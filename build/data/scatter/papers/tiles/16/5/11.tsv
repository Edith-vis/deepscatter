In this paper, we propose a fine-grained and attribute-based access control framework for our key project, CROWN grid. To avoid single point of failure and enhance scalability of the system, we employ a distributed delegation authorization mechanism. We successfully implement our proposed access control in CROWN grid, and evaluate this approach by comprehensive experiments.	access control;authorization;experiment;reliability engineering;scalability;single point of failure	Jinpeng Huai;Yu Zhang;Xianxian Li;Yunhao Liu	2005	2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)	10.1109/ICPP.2005.33	computer science;database;authorization;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-45.02134857706769	56.34860197949216	54972
293d6ba80ab5fabaab32afb291ce83497686617d	capturing policies for fine-grained access control on mobile devices		As of 2016, there are more mobile devices than humans on earth. Today, mobile devices are a critical part of our lives and often hold sensitive corporate and personal data. As a result, they are a lucrative target for attackers, and managing data privacy and security on mobile devices has become a vital issue. Existing access control mechanisms in most devices are restrictive and inadequate. They do not take into account the context of a device and its user when making decisions. In many cases, the access granted to a subject should change based on the context of a device. Such fine-grained, context-sensitive access control policies have to be personalized too. In this paper, we present a system i.e. Mithril that uses policies represented in Semantic Web technologies and captured using user feedback, to handle access control on mobile devices. We present an iterative feedback process to capture user specific policy. We also present a policy violation metric that allows us to decide when the capture process is complete.	access control;context-sensitive grammar;control system;end system;end-to-end principle;feature vector;generative model;information privacy;iterative method;mobile device;pattern recognition;personalization;personally identifiable information;play store;prototype;read-only memory;semantic web;semantic web rule language;semantic reasoner;sensor;simulation;superuser;usability testing;web ontology language	Prajit Kumar Das;Anupam Joshi;Timothy W.

eb3ad56478fc03365d237b2d2af1b408bdc0ab2b	a design of embedded integration prototyping system based on ar		Because of increasing usage of smart phones in recent years, the application field of convergence industry between IT technology using smart phone-based mobile communication networks and other industry branches is expanding. In addition, Ru0026D technologies in other fields are applied to smart phone applications effectively in order to develop products and support daily life more convenient. However, it is very hard to control these products and there is no efficient solution for this problem when many people are sent to specific area for big events, such as Biennale, Film Festival, EXPO, and so on. In order to solve this problem, this paper describes a network-based ticket reservation system and its organization using smart phone augmented reality and mobile communication networks. In particular, we propose a method of designing and developing prototyping system based on smart phone application design technologies, prior to developing real smart phone application.	embedded system	Sin-Kwan Kang;Jung Eun Kim;Hyun Young Lee;Dong Ha Lee;Jeong-Bae Lee	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27186-1_7	embedded system;phone;global positioning system;ticket;augmented reality;mobile telephony;convergence (routing);computer science	EDA	-38.703759444397264	53.510292026220846	55491

For better performance, it is important to keep resources and the information integrity from the unexpected use by unauthorized user. Therefore, there is a strong demand for the authentication and the access control of distributed-shared resources. Nowadays, three kinds of access control, discretionary access control (DAC) mandatory access control (MAC) and role-based access control (RBAC) have been proposed. In RBAC, there are role hierarchies in which a senior role can perform the permission of a junior role. However, it is sometimes necessary for a junior role to perform a senior role’s permission, which is not allowed basically by a junior role. In this paper, we will propose a role delegation method, consisting of a role delegation server, and a role delegation protocols. We divide the delegation into two by the triggered object: active delegation and passive delegation. Consequently, a junior role can gain a senior role’s permissions.	authentication;authorization;discretionary access control;distributed computing;file system permissions;job stream;mandatory access control;role-based access control;server (computing)	SangYeob Na;SuhHyun Cheon	2000		10.1145/344287.344300	discretionary access control;role-based access control;database;computer security;computer network	Security	-47.868029213120366	53.74508299877441	55498

It helps the application do the right thing at the right place. On the other hand, location is the most difficult context to acquire and process. Location information cannot be obtained using a single sensing system. It has to be abstracted to application-specific meanings before an application can understand it and utilize it. Since 802.11 networks are used widely, we use its RF signal strength to derive a client's location. To facilitate the indoor location determination system development, we build a location toolkit, which includes several utility programs. The toolkit not only performs some common functionalities used in various location determination approaches, but also provides a straightforward visual interface to researchers and users. This paper presents our approach to developing an indoor location determination system based on the toolkit, and some research results we have obtained	ubiquitous computing	Yu Wang;Adam Harder	2006	2006 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW'06)	10.1109/ICPPW.2006.19	signal strength;embedded system;real-time computing;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;graphical user interface;mobile computing;radio frequency;computer network	HCI	-39.224021983955176	49.50516351430176	55669

However, credible interaction issues between mobile users are still the hard problems in the past. In this paper, we focus on how to assign the crowdsourcing sensing tasks based on the credible interaction between users. First, a novel credible crowdsourcing assignment model is proposed based on social relationship cognition and community detection. Second, the service quality factor (SQF), link reliability factor (LRF), and region heat factor (RHF) are introduced to scientifically evaluate the user crowdsourcing preferences. Then, a crowdsourcing algorithm based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) theory is proposed. Finally, the simulation experiments prove the correctness, effectiveness, and robustness of our method.	algorithm;analytical hierarchy;cognition;correctness (computer science);crowd computing;crowdsourcing;experiment;internet of things;robustness (computer science);simulation;smart device;user (computing)	Jian An;Xiaolin Gui;Zhehao Wang;Jianwei Yang;Xin He	2015	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2015.2415035	crowdsourcing software development;computer science;sensor;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;crowdsourcing;computer network	Mobile	-38.33110282755568	58.15777650677365	55924

Services may run either locally on a mobile device or on a remote server application that is also part of the framework. Those that are executed locally are replaceable software libraries. Services may be used to log in to a portal, send messages between multiple devices or doing other kinds of calculation and communication. The benefit of this framework is that it may be used within different operating systems and that it is very easy to be used as an SDK. Therefore developing such kinds of applications has not longer be done from scratch and can be accomplished quite fast.	library (computing);login;mobile device;operating system;server (computing);software development kit	Florian Klompmaker;Christian Reimann	2008		10.1145/1501750.1501759	mobile search;simulation;computer science;multimedia;mobile computing;world wide web	HCI	-36.29199662604297	51.33039660165672	56043

A transaction illegally and suspiciously reads an object if the transaction reads the object which includes data in other objects which are not allowed to be read and the object which is suspicious, respectively. A transaction illegally and impossibly writes an object after illegally and suspiciously reading an object, respectively. The write-abortion (WA), read-write-abortion (RWA), and flexible RWA (FRWA) protocols to prevent illegal information flow are proposed in our previous papers. In the WA and RWA protocols, a transaction is aborted once issuing an illegal or impossible write and issuing an illegal read or impossible write, respectively. Reads are meaninglessly performed since the reads are later undone due to the abortion of the transaction in the WA protocol. Reads which can be performed after an illegal read are not performed, i.e. Lost since a transaction is aborted just once issuing an illegal read in the RWA protocol. In the FRWA protocol, a transaction is aborted with some probability once illegally reading an object in order to reduce the number of meaningless and lost reads. We newly introduce the sensitivity concept of an object in order to decide on the abortion probability. The more number of transactions are aborted after illegally reading an object, the more highly sensitive the object is. A transaction which illegally reads a more sensitive object is aborted with higher probability. In the evaluation, we show the execution time of each transaction in the FRWA protocol is shorter than WA and more number of reads can be performed than RWA.	database transaction;information flow;information system;read-write memory;run time (program lifecycle phase);undo	Shigenari Nakamura;Dilawaer Duolikun;Tomoya Enokido;Makoto Takizawa	2015	2015 Ninth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2015.41	computer science;database;world wide web;computer security	DB	-36.74579965149744	58.81916283644949	56144
eb521f3379b520010ef0261a464e8bcb955a7436	ezsetup: a novel tool for cybersecurity practices utilizing cloud resources		Recent years have witnessed fast growth of interests and efforts in developing systems and tools for cybersecurity practices, especially with the rapid advancement of cloud computing. However, those systems either suffer from issues in scalability, customization and setup complexity or are constrained by a specific cloud technology and limited customization support. In this paper, we present a novel Web based tool called EZSetup that can create and manage user-defined virtual environments for various types of cybersecurity practices on demand and at scale. Distinct from previous cloud-based systems, EZSetup does not rely on a particular type of cloud platform or technology. It is able to interact with multiple clouds and instantiate virtual environments in multiple clouds simultaneously. EZSetup allows for easy customization and significantly reduces the overhead in creating and using practice environments through carefully designed Web interfaces. The experimental results are quite positive in general and indicate that EZSetup can also be applicable to other computer science and engineering subjects.	cloud computing;computer science;computer security;cyber security standards;hands-on computing;overhead (computing);scalability;smoothing;usability;user interface;virtual reality;web application	Yanyan Li;Dung Le Nguyen;Mengjun Xie	2017		10.1145/3125659.3125699	web application;personalization;computer science and engineering;scalability;engineering;cloud computing;computer security	HCI	-41.269807790178696	56.84357309112634	56272

Recently participatory sensing have been spreading, but its sensing tasks are still very simple and easy for participants to deal with (e.g. Please input the number of people standing in a queue. etc.). To adapt to high-level tasks which require specific skills such as those in engineering, the medical profession or authority such as the organizer of the event, we need to optimize social resource allocation because the number of such professionals are limited. To achieve the complex sensing tasks efficiently, LiPS enables to divide a complex sensing task into small tasks and link each other by assigning proper sensors. LiPS can treat physical sensors and human as hybrid multi-level sensors, and task provider can arrange social resource allocation for the goal of each divided sensing task. In this paper, we describe the design and development of the LiPS system. We also implemented an in-lab experiment as the first prototype of hybrid sensing system and discussed the model of further system through users' feedback.	electronic organizer;high- and low-level;participatory sensing;prototype;sensor	Mina Sakamura;Takuro Yonezawa;Jin Nakazawa;Kazunori Takashio;Hideyuki Tokuda	2014		10.1145/2638728.2641286	embedded system;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science	HCI	-35.87445774662785	53.597875427659	57145

However, entities in mobile computing are known of having limited energy, physical, and logical resources. This imposes various challenges that greatly affect communication quality and performance of those mobile entities, especially when applying computationally-intensive security measures that are essential for protecting the communication sessions. Therefore, it becomes vital to seek suitable security techniques that balance between the communication performance and the resource context of those mobile entities. This paper investigates some possible options toward implementing an adaptive security measures that work with various mobile and next generation Internet entities. The paper basically studies the communication performance of mobile entities when security functions are running on them with and without operating adaptations. While the focus in this paper is about the Message Authentication Code group of security functions, the work can be generalized to include any resource-intensive security measures including both other cryptographic (such as encryption) and non-cryptographic measures (such as challenges).	communications security;cryptography;encryption;entity;fits;general-purpose modeling;information;mathematical optimization;message authentication code;mobile computing;next-generation network;overhead (computing)	Abdulmonem M.

9f3d8824f8fa2c5c44a0169ff32ebd69845fea94	integrated inventory management system for outdoors stocks based on small uav and beacon		Inventory tracking/auditing is a task which must be carried out continuously to ensure the efficiency of the supply chain and to meet with regulatory requirements. Even though automated methods such as bar code and RFID are being used in most firms, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially, when stocks are bulky, big-sized and stored in multi-tier at outdoors environment. As a remedy to the above situation, the aim of this paper is to find a solution for rapid inventory tracking and auditing using human-controlled UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) equipped with iBeacon-based ID reader. The system architecture which consists of inventory management server, UAV-based mobile data scanner and iBeacon-based signal transmitter was proposed in this paper. And, based on this architecture, a prototype system was developed.	management system;unmanned aerial vehicle	Kwan Hee Han;Sung Moon Bae;Whayong Lee	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-77712-2_50	architecture;mobile broadband;embedded system;supply chain;management system;ibeacon;arduino;systems architecture;inventory control;computer science	DB	-42.090007989037545	53.57827935438868	57697

We start from the vision that unlike the current IoT landscape where tech and consulting companies provide complete “solutions” for some vertical markets, in future we might witness an “uberization” of IoT, where every person or company will be able to offer or “consume” sensor data, actuator access and data analytics services to/from anybody else, leading to several marketplaces where these IoT services will be traded and exchanged. In this line, we assume that data and information about the places, things and persons will be the major asset in our future society, and that physical objects and cloud-based computing environments will be simply the resources that will allow greater interaction between the physical and digital world. In this paper, we present our initial analysis about the main principles and technologies enabling future trade of sensor data and actuation access, and how it might affect the economic organization of our society today.	cloud computing;emergent;heart rate variability;internet of things;quality of service;requirement;thickness (graph theory);uberisation	Luiz Guilherme Pitta;Markus Endler	2018	2018 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2018.8538447	computer security;cloud computing;distributed computing;computer science;data analysis;internet of things	Mobile	-44.60921642973283	49.91417333934517	58002

1f5742545b78a1174d675fca68f29a26f11c66f0	a context-aware adaptive security framework for mobile applications		Mobile devices currently offer many value-added applications and services such as messaging, navigation, social networking, finance, and entertainment. As these mobile applications have access to users' personal information and are capable of gathering and transmitting trust sensitive information, posing security and privacy risks. In this paper, we propose a context-aware adaptive security framework for eliciting users' context information and adapting this information with mobile applications' network access control mechanism. The framework enforces the execution of mobile applications inside security incubators to control the communication between mobile applications and mobile device resources. Applications' access requests are analyzed based on user's context information collected from the mobile device sensors and the application security configuration.		Yaser Mowafi;Dhiah el Diehn I.

A lot of challenges of both academic as well as of practical nature are related with their deployment. Among else, the distributed nature of a coalition demands special focus in respect to security management. In this paper we argue about the necessity for adjustable security mechanisms towards the security management of multi-domain environments; we describe an approach that allows determination of preferences when defining access control permissions over the shared objects. We handle such preferences by encoding access control constraints using fuzzy relations and we describe a prototype security architecture that implements the basic principles of our approach.	access control;autonomous robot	Petros Belsis;Stefanos Gritzalis;Christos Skourlas;Vassilis Tsoukalas	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-76929-3_25	computer security model;cloud computing security;security through obscurity;security information and event management;security convergence;engineering;knowledge management;security service;distributed computing;distributed system security architecture;network access control;computer security	HCI	-45.26613604450316	54.22917887570189	58967

They consist of wireless sensor networks that are ensembles of small, smart, and cheap sensing and computing devices that permeate the environment as well as high-bandwidth rich sensors such as satellite imaging systems, meteorological stations, air quality stations, and security cameras. Emergency response, homeland security, and many other applications have a very real need to interconnect such diverse networks and access information in real-time. While Internet protocols and Web standards provide well-developed mechanisms for accessing this information, linking such mechanisms with resource-constrained sensor networks is very challenging because of the volatility of the communication links. This paper presents a service-oriented programming model for sensor networks which permits discovery and access of Web services. Sensor network applications are realized as graphs of modular and autonomous services with well-defined interfaces that allow them to be described, published, discovered, and invoked over the network providing a convenient way for integrating services from heterogeneous sensor systems. Our approach provides dynamic discovery, composition, and binding of services based on an efficient localized constraint satisfaction algorithm that can be used for developing ambient-aware applications that adapt to changes in the environment. A tracking application that employs many inexpensive sensor nodes, as well as a Web service, is used to illustrate the approach. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of ambient-aware applications that interconnect wireless sensor networks and Web services.	algorithm;autonomous robot;closed-circuit television;computation;constraint satisfaction;dataflow;finite-state machine;gateway (telecommunications);hop-by-hop transport;internet protocol suite;middleware;programming model;real-time transcription;sensor web;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented modeling;service-oriented programming;source tracking;volatility;web service;web standards;world wide web	Isaac Amundson;Manish Kushwaha;Xenofon D.

The use of multiuser tools makes the existence of jointly-owned objects a necessity: a participant who joins a multiuser tool written by others knows that the user agent executed in his name will not allow unauthorized access to other objects if the multiuser tool is jointly owned by all participants. In this article, we discuss the requirements and issues behind jointly-owned objects. By generalizing these requirements, we have implemented a conditionally jointly-owned object. The conditions take the form of a quorum or a list of users who have the rights to access an object or to change its protection state. We sketch a design of conditionally jointly-owned objects, and apply the same concepts to subjects. Authority- and quorum-based objects are investigated as examples of conditionally jointly-owned objects. We show that conditionally jointly-owned objects can also be used to resolve conflicts that may arise among joint owners. We generalize Graham and Denning's protection model to incorporate these jointly-owned entities. Operating-system support for conditionally jointly-owned objects is specified at the system-call level. Examples are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of conditionally jointly-owned objects.	operating system	Steven Guan;Hussein M.

Edge computing has the potential to address the concerns of response time requirement, battery life constraint, bandwidth cost saving, as well as data safety and privacy. In this paper, we introduce the definition of edge computing, followed by several case studies, ranging from cloud offloading to smart home and city, as well as collaborative edge to materialize the concept of edge computing. Finally, we present several challenges and opportunities in the field of edge computing, and hope this paper will gain attention from the community and inspire more research in this direction.	abstraction (software engineering);bandwidth (signal processing);centrality;cloud computing;design rationale;edge computing;home automation;internet of things;mathematical optimization;mobile device;privacy;programming paradigm;response time (technology);rich internet application;smart environment	Weisong Shi;Jie Cao;Quan Zhang;Youhuizi Li;Lanyu Xu	2016	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2016.2579198	human–computer interaction;cloud computing;information privacy;computer science;utility computing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;computer network	HPC	-41.78600907697535	50.684456162386375	59562

The SuNDroPS system, briefly described in this paper, applies context-aware techniques to data gathering, shared services, and information distribution; the system is based on a context-aware approach that, applied to these tasks, leads to the reduction of the so-called information noise, delivering to the users only the portion of information that is useful in their current context.	big data;dynamic data;pervasive informatics;shared services;ubiquitous computing	Emanuele Panigati	2014	2014 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)	10.1109/HPCSim.2014.6903703	idef1x;data modeling;semantic computing;computer science;data mining;database;data stream mining;world wide web;data mapping	HPC	-40.74483480507147	48.36262124716502	59643

Realizing the promise of the wireless grid involves providing a set of middleware services that would allow devices to autonomously share their resources. However, existing wireless grid middleware provide only rudimentary support in this regard. This paper describes our initial experiences in realizing autonomic resource management capabilities for wireless grids. Specifically, we present protocols that support self-configuration mechanisms such as resource discovery and brokering. The proposed protocols leverage similar techniques in the wired grid domain while adding new functionality to handle the dynamic nature of wireless grids. We demonstrate the protocols by using them to build a grid of Bluetooth devices. We also used Bluetooth grid to compare the performance of our service discovery protocol with other similar protocols. Results indicate that our discovery protocol strikes a balance between the compared protocols in terms of resource discovery time and expressiveness of resource description. This allows the protocol to support sophisticated resource brokering and scheduling techniques without incurring prohibitive overheads. Furthermore, in contrast to the existing protocols our protocol supports service advertisements. This facilitates more efficient handling of dynamic situations such as devices leaving and joining the grid.	autonomic computing;bluetooth;middleware;programming paradigm;provisioning;scheduling (computing);seamless3d;serial experiments lain;service discovery	Mohamed El-Darieby;Diwakar Krishnamurthy	2007	2007 10th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management	10.1109/INM.2007.374710	communications protocol;semantic grid;computer science;resource management;operating system;middleware;distributed computing;service discovery;bluetooth;world wide web;grid computing;computer network	HPC	-33.85841247177151	47.959702205971126	59933

However, location privacy must be ensured before providing widely disseminated location services. Privacy rules may depend not only on the identity of the requester, but also on past events such as the places visited by the person being located, or previous location queries. Therefore, location systems must support the specification and enforcement of security policies (including history-based) allowing users to specify when, how and whom may know their location. We propose a middleware platform named Jano [Jano (or JANVS in latin) is the god of doors and gates in the roman mythology. He is usually depicted with two or four faces turning in opposite directions.] supporting both pull and push location requests while enforcing configurable security policies. Policies are specified using the Security Policy Language, SPL, facilitating the use of well-known security models. In particular, Jano supports history-based policies applied to person’s or object’s location. Jano implementation integrates several location technologies (e.g. GPS, RFID, etc.) and deals with the related heterogeneity aspects. It provides a web-based interface that facilitates policy specification, and its evaluation shows good performance, embodying a number of optimizations regarding bandwidth, process and storage savings.	bandwidth (signal processing);declarative programming;global positioning system;graphical user interface;location-based service;middleware;mobile device;privacy;radio-frequency identification;software deployment;usability;web application	José Simão;Carlos Ribeiro;Paulo José Azevedo Vianna Ferreira;Luís Veiga	2012	Journal of Internet Services and Applications	10.1007/s13174-012-0065-z	simulation;operating system;distributed computing;computer applications;computer security;computer network	Security	-39.50026374613335	54.02203412610608	60028

One such example is a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes that combine physical sensing capabilities such as temperature, light, or seismic sensors with networking and computation capabilities. Applications range from environmental control, warehouse inventory, and health care to military environments. Existing sensor networks assume that the sensors are preprogrammed and send data to a central frontend where the data is aggregated and stored for offline querying and analysis. This approach has two major drawbacks. First, the user cannot change the behavior of the system on the fly. Second, conservation of battery power is a major design factor, but a central system cannot make use of in-network programming, which trades costly communication for cheap local computation.In this paper, we introduce the Cougar approach to tasking sensor networks through declarative queries. Given a user query, a query optimizer generates an efficient query plan for in-network query processing, which can vastly reduce resource usage and thus extend the lifetime of a sensor network. In addition, since queries are asked in a declarative language, the user is shielded from the physical characteristics of the network. We give a short overview of sensor networks, propose a natural architecture for a data management system for sensor networks, and describe open research problems in this area.	central processing unit;computation;computer network programming;data hub;database;declarative programming;embedded system;mathematical optimization;on the fly;online and offline;open research;query optimization;query plan;sensor	Yong Yao;Johannes Gehrke	2002	SIGMOD Record	10.1145/601858.601861	sensor web;query optimization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;data mining;database;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network programming;mobile wireless sensor network;health care;visual sensor network	DB	-39.6243951960166	47.58631253740276	60279

It is generally agreed that without the proper countermeasures in place, use of agent-based applications will be severely impeded. However, not all applications require the same set of countermeasures, nor can they depend entirely on the agent system to provide them. Instead, countermeasures are applied commensurate with the anticipated threat profile and intended security objectives for the application. While countermeasures typically include any action, device, procedure, technique, or other measure that reduces the vulnerability of or threat to a system, our focus here is specifically on technical mechani sms, as opposed to procedural or non-technical measures. Such countermeasures can be integrated directly into an agent system, or incorporated into the design of an agent to supplement the capabilities of an underlying agent system. This paper gives an overview of the threats associated with software agent systems and their technical countermeasures, including the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques involved. Emphasis is on mobile software agents, since they typically face a more severe set of threats than do static agents and, therefore, demand more rigorous	agent-based model;application domain;countermeasure (computer);mobile agent;procedural programming;programming paradigm;protection mechanism;software agent;software deployment;threat (computer)	Wayne A.

This paper presents the results acquired from a prototype based on an embedded system platform and a mobile device using Wi-Fi communication. In general, the objective of the prototype is send data from an automotive gas analyzer to a mobile device by means of an embedded platform based on FPGA, essentially to notify to the vehicle owner about the behavior of the car in terms of pollutant emissions. The results of the masurements are processed and compared with the Mexican Official Standards to finally show them to the user by means of a mobile device. We use a back-end FPGA platform to process data banks from the gas analyzer, and a Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 compliant module to transmit the results to a front-end Android based smart phone which presents the results to the user. Due to the acquired data and results are handled as in Mexican Official automotive emission test, security and communication protocols are an essential part of this prototype.	hoc (programming language)	Amadeo José Argüelles-Cruz;Mario Matamoros de Luis;Paulina Elizabeth Moreno Aguilera;Cornelio Yáñez-Márquez	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-03176-7_38	computer network	Mobile	-38.84691131246564	57.28227876341275	60399

A key element of such applications is ubiquitous and precise sensing of the people you interact with. Existing techniques that rely on deployed infrastructure to determine proximity are limited in availability and accuracy. Virtual Compass is a peer-based relative positioning system that relies solely on the hardware and operating system support available on commodity mobile handhelds. It uses multiple radios to detect nearby mobile devices and places them in a two-dimensional plane. It uses adaptive scanning and out-of-band coordination to explore trade-offs between energy consumption and the latency in detecting movement. We have implemented Virtual Compass on mobile phones and laptops, and we evaluate it using a sample application that senses social interactions between Facebook friends.	algorithm;global positioning system;ibm notes;interaction;laptop;location (geography);microsoft windows;mobile app;mobile device;mobile phone;operating system;out-of-band agreement;sensor;smartphone;testbed;windows mobile	Nilanjan Banerjee;Sharad Agarwal;Paramvir Bahl;Ranveer Chandra;Alec Wolman;Mark D.

In this paper, we examine how new security requirements impact the design of online games by using online Bridge, a simple client-server game, as our case study. We argue that security is emerging as an inherent design issue for online games, after graphics and artificial intelligence, which have become important issues of the design of most games for decades. The most important new security concern in online game design is fairness enforcement, and most security mechanisms all contribute to a single objective, namely, making the play fair for each user.	artificial intelligence;client–server model;computer graphics;copy protection;display device;emergence;fairness measure;pc game;requirement;server (computing);simulation;type enforcement	Jeff Yan	2003		10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254333	computer security model;game design;cloud computing security;the internet;simulation;security through obscurity;security information and event management;covert channel;turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games;computer science;emergent gameplay;game mechanics;game developer;internet privacy;video game development;computer security;game programming;client–server model	ECom	-45.946961720892844	56.80786839231898	61376

Smartwatches are a particularly interesting platform for this purpose, as they offer salient advantages, such as their proximity to the human body. However, they also have limitations associated with their small form factor, such as processing power and battery life, which makes it difficult to simply transfer smartphone-based context sensing and prediction models to smartwatches. In this paper, we introduce an energy-efficient, generic, integrated framework for continuous context sensing and prediction on smartwatches. Our work extends previous approaches for context sensing and prediction on wrist-mounted wearables that perform predictive analytics outside the device. We offer a generic sensing module and a novel energy-efficient, on-device prediction module that is based on a semantic abstraction approach to convert sensor data into meaningful information objects, similar to human perception of a behavior. Through six evaluations, we analyze the energy efficiency of our framework modules, identify the optimal file structure for data access and demonstrate an increase in accuracy of prediction through our semantic abstraction method. The proposed framework is hardware independent and can serve as a reference model for implementing context sensing and prediction on small wearable devices beyond smartwatches, such as body-mounted cameras.	algorithm;android;cold start;conflict (psychology);data access;deploy;design of experiments;evaluation;experiment;framing (world wide web);generic drugs;input/output;manuscripts;martin kay;physical object;reasoning;reference model;research design;reza iravani;run time (program lifecycle phase);semantic data model;small form factor;smartphone;smartwatch;software deployment;wearable computer;wearable technology;benefit;sensor (device)	Reza Rawassizadeh;Martin Tomitsch;Manouchehr Nourizadeh;Elaheh Momeni;Aaron Peery;Liudmila Ulanova;Michael Pazzani	2015		10.3390/s150922616	embedded system;simulation;prediction;wearable computer;computer science;artificial intelligence;smartwatch;data mining;quantified self;efficient energy use;lifelog	HCI	-40.820074240462276	48.57661301968476	61632

Role-Based Access control is a way to solve this problem. However, existing implementations of role-based access control are not fine-grained, and it takes no account of category information of the resources. As every resource in the model was authorized in the same way, such a model cannot meet the security requirement of smart community systems. In this paper, we proposed an improved role-based access control model for categorized resources, in combination with special requirements of smart community systems. We designed a role-based access control model for categorized resources, which integrates the community category information in the definition of roles so as to limit the number of roles. The new model was fully implemented in a community management system with 14500 users from 14 communities. We compared our system to Spring Security, an existing security open source framework and demonstrated the advantages of our access control model.	authorization;big data;categorization;cloud computing;open-source software;requirement;role-based access control;spring security;unix	Siping Shi;Chengzhong Xu	2016	2016 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data (CCBD)	10.1109/CCBD.2016.044	access control;computer science;implementation;distributed computing;authorization;role-based access control;permission;computer security;community management;computer access control	Security	-47.83389649064456	53.88646623887737	62153

While more and more wireless devices are phased in, a user can barely familiarize herself with managing these devices. This is because wireless devices often operate in some form of binding relationships among themselves, which are typically set up at startup in a self-organizing fashion, leaving the user little room for intervention. As a remedy, we propose a software-hardware codesign and implementation that enable the user to adapt network operations to certain needs anytime without knowledge of low-level details. Binding manipulation is done straightaway with simple mouse clicking and dragging on icons in our graphical user interface. We demonstrate example applications in green power systems as well. A practical platform over which to inspire other applications, this study elegantly lends itself to generic wireless network environments.	anytime algorithm;drag and drop;graphical user interface;high- and low-level;home automation;ibm power systems;name binding;organizing (structure);self-organization	Chia-Wei Hsieh;Kuang-Hui Chi;Ji-Han Jiang;Chian C.

Although web services are capable of coupling heterogeneous information systems in a flexible and cost-efficient way, the processing efficiency and robustness against certain attacks do not fulfill industry-strength requirements. In this paper, a comprehensive stream-based WS-Security processing system is introduced, which enables a more efficient processing in service computing and increases the robustness against different types of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The introduced engine is capable of processing all standard-conforming applications of WS-Security in a streaming manner. It can handle, e.g., any order, number, and nesting degree of signature and encryption operations, closing the gap toward more efficient and dependable web services.	algorithm;attachments;business process execution language;closing (morphology);cost efficiency;course (navigation);denial-of-service attack;dependability;digital signature;document object model;encryption;information system;malware;mission critical;non-functional requirement;prototype;soap;server-side;services computing;stream processing;validator;ws-security;web service;xml	Nils Gruschka;Meiko Jensen;Luigi Lo Iacono;Norbert Luttenberger	2011	IEEE Transactions on Services Computing	10.1109/TSC.2010.61	web service;computer science;operating system;soap;database;internet privacy;law;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-46.76344671464399	57.636571961524545	62486

Replication is a highly desirable feature in these service s, since it provides the scalability and reliability required on large Data Grids and is the basis for federating catalogues from different organisations. Grid Catalogues are often used to store sensitive data and must h ave access control mechanisms to protect their data. Replication has to take this security policy into account, making sure that replicated information cannot be abused but allowing some flexibility like selective replication for the site s depending on the level of trust in them. In this paper we discuss the security requirements and implications o f several replication scenarios for Grid Catalogues based on experienced gained within the EGEE project. U sing the security infrastructure of the EGEE Grid as a basis, we then propose a security architecture for replica ted Grid Catalogues, which, among other features, supports partial and total replication of the securitymechanisms on the master. The implementation of this architecture in the AMGA Metadata Catalogue of the EGEE project is then described including the application to a complex scenario in a Biomedical application.	amga;access control;authentication;authorization;computer security;control system;egi;federated identity;information sensitivity;requirement;scalability;self-replicating machine;self-replication;the machine's child;worldwide lhc computing grid	Nuno Santos;Birger Koblitz	2008	Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience	10.1002/cpe.1299	computer security model;service provider;cloud computing security;security information and event management;computer science;security policy;access control;operating system;data mining;database;security service;distributed computing;distributed system security architecture;metadata;world wide web;distributed database;computer security;enterprise information security architecture;grid computing;replication	HPC	-47.019763188805406	55.359659155033874	62582

For elderly people, conceiving technologies for increasing their autonomy, so as to enable them to self-manage their life is of utmost importance. However, when it comes to smart home, once all appliances in a home are automated and connected through internet, it becomes essential to consider issues of security, especially security configuration. In the smart home, security has to be configured and managed by technology-unaware elderly people. One mechanism of auto security configuration in such environment can be achieved by observing the trustworthiness of smart devices. Trust-based security mechanisms allow access rights to evolve among previously unknown devices, thus minimizing security configuration. In this paper, we present a security configuration model which takes critical security decisions by determining the trustworthiness of an entity based on the sources of trust: Direct interaction and Recommendation trust.	auto-configuration;autonomy;home automation;smart device;trust (emotion);ubiquitous computing	Md.

d96524390f7d449853d607371e6ac0c84860a6e7	towards a framework for federated global identity management		This paper reports on research being conducted into the formulation of the architectural blueprint necessary to provide a Global identification service across global ICT infrastructures integrating that of the Web and the Grid and introducing the concept of what the EU IST Framework V initiative refers to as ’protected GC infrastructure’. Such a platform implies a secure vertical integration between heterogeneous grid platforms but more significantly creates the condition for horizontal integration i.e. interoperability of various global infrastructures (the Internet, the Web and the Grid) with common services i.e the creation of new secure and trustworthy global and interoperable services. The proposed research is both fundamental and highly innovative because the FeGIMa framework manages individual and organizational identification with their disparate security mechanisms. It does so for the variety and diversity of global ICT stake-holders through the formulation of a sufficiently abstract/highlevel architectural blueprint that frees them from having to be constrained to the same (i.e. one type fits all) technologies for authentication. For the disparate community of global computing stake-holders the freedom obtained through the proposed technically innovative FeGIMa framework results in the simplicity of ”Single Sign on and Single Service Authentication SSO & SSA” thereby directly contributing to realizing the vision of Information Society for All.	aaa (video game industry);authentication;authorization;blueprint;e-government;electronic business;fits;federated identity;global serializability;grid computing;group cohesiveness;high-level programming language;identity management;identity management system;internet;interoperability;knowledge society;list of toolkits;middleware;next-generation network;online locator service;provisioning;radius;response time (technology);risk management;server (computing);service locator pattern;single sign-on;traverse;user profile;warez;web service;world wide web	Mehrdad Naderi;Jawed I.

Fortunately, a mobile device encounters, possibly intermittently, many entities capable of lending it computational resources. At one extreme is the traditional cloud-computing context where a mobile device is connected to remote cloud resources maintained by a service provider with which it has an established relationship. In this paper we consider the other extreme, where a mobile device's contacts are only with other mobile devices, where both the computation initiator and the remote computational resources are mobile, and where intermittent connectivity among these entities is the norm. We present the design and implementation of a system, Serendipity, that enables a mobile computation initiator to use remote computational resources available in other mobile systems in its environment to speedup computing and conserve energy. We propose a simple but powerful job structure that is suitable for such a system. Serendipity relies on the collaboration among mobile devices for task allocation and task progress monitoring functions. We develop algorithms that are designed to disseminate tasks among mobile devices by accounting for the specific properties of the available connectivity. We also undertake an extensive evaluation of our system, including experience with a prototype, that demonstrates Serendipity's performance.	algorithm;cloud computing;computation;computational resource;entity;mobile device;prototype;scsi initiator and target;speedup	Cong Shi;Vasileios Lakafosis;Mostafa H.

As a result, developers have to write code to access sensor data using their own protocols under the error-prone wireless network, which makes the development time longer. To address this issue, we propose a mobile sensor device virtualization scheme that allows developers to access sensor data using local (cloud-side) sensor APIs instead of network APIs even if the services are run on cloud servers. Therefore, it is much easier to develop mobile services.	abstraction layer;cognitive dimensions of notations;http 404;mobile cloud computing;operating system;prototype;sensor;server (computing);system call	Jin-Hwan Jeong	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289220	sensor web;embedded system;real-time computing;mobile search;virtualization;cloud computing;mobile database;computer science;operating system;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer security;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	-39.32745153194746	48.49746085296605	63042

All these elements require special skills in their development. In order to write safe, secure IoT systems, developers must be trained and experienced in four different areas of software development: embedded, cloud, web and mobile. In addition, given the distributed nature of IoT systems, distributed programming skills play a critical role. In this paper we examine the challenges in IoT system development, and summarize our observations and experiences on the necessity and co-presence of different types of software development skills in the design of IoT systems.	cloud computing;continuous delivery;distributed computing;ecosystem;embedded software;embedded system;end-to-end principle;gateway (telecommunications);internet of things;machine learning;mobile app;software development;web development	Antero Taivalsaari;Tommi Mikkonen	2018	2018 Third International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing (FMEC)	10.1109/FMEC.2018.8364039	computer engineering;cloud computing;software development;logic gate;internet of things;edge computing;computer science	SE	-43.130900004406875	46.94319963669637	63264

ac9134752a0398e9f9399e0bcfb76fb21fa28430	emulating smart city sensors using soft sensing and machine intelligence: a case study in public transportation		This paper proposes a new framework for emulating the functionality of a sensor by using multiple available soft sensors and machine intelligence algorithms. As a case study, the localization of city buses in a smart city setting is investigated by using the accelerometer and microphones of the passengers and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) running in the cloud; in this application, the GPS functionality is emulated by using these two soft sensors. What makes such an emulation feasible is the statistical dependence of the location data (which would normally be obtained from a GPS) on the accelerometer and microphone data; while accelerometers capture data that relate to the typical stop/start patterns of the buses, microphone capture enter/exit patterns of the passengers through the sound levels inside the bus. We evaluate our proposed scheme through simulations and show that the proposed framework can operate with more than 90\% accuracy in estimating the location of public buses while preserving the actual location privacy of the smartphone users. This approach results in smartphone battery energy savings of 38-46\% (as compared to GPS-based approaches) due to the elimination of the power-hungry GPS devices.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;best, worst and average case;built-in self-test;categorization;cloud computing;data acquisition;data aggregation;emulator;global positioning system;microphone;mobile device;noise figure;sensor;simulation;smart city;smartphone;support vector machine	Cem Kaptan;Burak Kantarci;Tolga Soyata;Azzedine Boukerche	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422969	smart city;real-time computing;public transport;cloud computing;global positioning system;accelerometer;microphone;intelligent sensor;assisted gps;computer science;artificial intelligence	Mobile	-38.94593487056291	56.76850258868807	63473

Therefore, apps targeted for such platforms must be energy-efficient. However, due to the use of energy oblivious design practices often this is not the case. In this paper, we present a light-weight re-factoring technique that can assist in energy-aware app development. Our technique relies on a set of energy-efficiency guidelines that encodes the optimal usage of energy-intensive (hardware) resources in an app. Given a prototype for an app, our technique begins by generating a design-expression for it. A design-expression can be described as a regular-expression representing the ordering of energy-intensive resource usages and invocation of key functionalities (event-handlers) within the app. It also generates a set of defect-expressions, that are design-expressions representing the negation of energy-efficiency guidelines. A nonempty intersection between an app's design-expression and a defect-expression indicates violation of a guideline (and therefore, potential for re-factoring). To evaluate the efficacy of our re-factoring technique we analysed a suite of open-source Android apps using our technique. The resultant re-factoring when applied, reduced the energy-consumption of these apps between 3 % to 29 %. We also present a case study for one of our subject apps, that captures its design evolution over a period of two-years and more than 200 commits. Our framework found re-factoring opportunities in a number of these commits, that could have been implemented earlier on in the development stages had the developer used an energy-aware refactoring technique such as the one presented in this work.	android;code refactoring;integer factorization;mobile operating system;open-source software;prototype;regular expression;resultant;smartphone;software bug;tablet computer	Abhijeet Banerjee;Abhik Roychoudhury	2016	2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems (MOBILESoft)	10.1145/2897073.2897086	embedded system;simulation;engineering;mobile deep linking;world wide web	SE	-35.871829318658826	54.737146965779786	64284

However, heterogeneous sensing devices, networks and data hinder the integration of the applications. Multi-source data fusion technology is used to monitor different environmental parameters by a variety of different types of sensors and then to process the different environmental parameters by the mathematical algorithm to judge the occurrence of some phenomenon. A large number of calculations are needed in the algorithm and different algorithms are used for the particular issues. The technology of Web of Things is used to shield the difference of the underlying sensing devices, networks and data by Web technology in order to provide a good platform for information integration. Based on this, a light-weight rule-based practical method is adopted to integrate the fine-grained multi-source data sensed under WoT platform into the high-level information, which can support multiple application scenarios at the same time and sends the procured information to the decision center by the real-time Web technology.	algorithm;heterogeneous system architecture;high- and low-level;logic programming;multi-source;real-time web;sensor;source data;web of things	Li Yangqun	2013	2013 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/CyberC.2013.49	embedded system;communications protocol;web modeling;the internet;web of things;computer science;operating system;data mining;database;sensor fusion;rest;world wide web;computer security;internet of things	Robotics	-40.22537964066778	47.63869928690539	64350

In this paper, we purpose a design of the trust model that not only presents a trust computation mechanism but also lays the emphasis on the trust management.

Also, a personal pervasive server that is carried by each person coordinates the embedded servers that are near to the person. The framework is very attractive because it is easy to personalise the coordination according to each person's policy.

This in turn has led to the development of standardized platforms most notably windows mobile, java micro edition, Android and the IPhone OS which enable third party developers to build applications fairly easy. Thanks to the widespread acceptance of Web Services, it is fairly easy to access resources/services from a mobile/nomadic device. However, by relying on external resources and services, the QoS (quality of Service) is of the upmost importance. Especially if a mobile/nomadic device is engaged in the execution of a workflow, it is vital to keep service latencies at a minimum. This paper investigates the use of cooperation between consumers and providers as an effective means of improving the experience of service consumers.	android;java platform, micro edition;microsoft windows;mobile phone;operating system;personal digital assistant;quality of service;web service;windows mobile	Yuting Luo;Ralph Deters	2009	2009 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference (APSCC)		web service;embedded system;mobile search;mobile qos;computer science;operating system;database;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-37.73110463582685	52.06123388328684	64942

adf9f8ae5c0b8b92dafdb2be816e53cfec0e814e	a person-oriented ubiquitous and secure information communication environment supported by data-driven networking processor	network processor	This paper proposes a basic concept of person-oriented ubiquitous and secure information sharing environment. In the ubiquitous network environment, people, within a predefined restriction, can access and use information, network and computing resources wherever and whenever they are. Here, the owner of the resource and/or information is not necessarily same as the user. At the same time, the user specific information does exist which is owned by the user itself but often managed by other organization. So the secure and safe resource management is required. We propose two approaches for consolidating the ubiquitous and secure information sharing platform, one is right-token management platform and the other is use of objective-specific VPN. We also propose to use a data-driven networking processor as a hardware platform supporting above resource and data management platform layers, which has in nature the passiveness and high real-time multi-processing capability. We propose to use it as engines for continuous authentication and enciphering at the terminal side and communication protocol handlers, authentication and enciphering in the network. keywords: authentication, ubiquitous services, information sharing, VPN, data-driven processor	authentication;british informatics olympiad;cipher;communications protocol;data security;multiprocessing;programming paradigm;real-time clock;ubiquitous computing;virtual private network	Hiroshi Ishii;Yoshitsugu Kondo;Hiroaki Nishikawa	2005			communications protocol;resource management;distributed computing;information sharing;computer science;network processor;computer network;data management;active networking;broadcast communication network;authentication	Mobile	-44.03897452700291	59.121403507402064	65448

76ed96f23de887378b92ae6d1ed14b3edc22410e	safe-aas: decision virtualization for effecting safety-as-a-service		In this paper, we present solution for the development of a novel infrastructure, safety-as-a-service (Safe-aaS) for the road transportation industry. Safe-aaS provides safety related decisions to the registered end-users. The safety decisions are customized as per the end-user types and their requirements. Existing related research work on road safety focus on the development of the safety systems, which are able to assist the driver of the vehicle. However, none of the works serves as a common platform for providing customized decisions dynamically as per user requirements. As per our knowledge, Safe-aaS is one of the first attempts in its domain, where multiple end-users receive safety related decision dynamically. An end-user enjoys the pay-per-use service of Safe-aaS, without concerning about the back-end process. Safe-aaS is based on service oriented architecture, where different business entities such as vehicle owners, sensor owners, safety service provider, and end-users are involved. We introduce the term, decision virtualization, which enables multiple end-users to access the customized decisions remotely. We present possible cost analysis for the entities involved in the system. Analytical results show the cost and profit analysis of the different entities. We observe the profit gain by mobile sensor owner is 19.69% more as compared to static sensor owner. In the presence of 5, 10, and 15 end-users, payable rent varies between 15%–20%. Additionally, we present two case studies to depict a clear view of usage of Safe-aaS.	common platform;entity;fail-safe;malware;mathematical model;norton safe web;privacy;real life;requirement;service-oriented architecture;user requirements document	Chandana Roy;Arijit Roy;Sudip Misra;J.

This distributed computing paradigm is modern and powerful. Many network-based applications have been developed or designed under this model. The application areas include, for example, intelligent agent, network and system management, web-based mobile applets, electronic commerce and more recently, active networking. While offering a new attractive paradigm over the Internet, this mobile agent technology introduces significant new security threats. For example, a malicious agent with certain access rights might be able to destroy critical information on the nodes it visits.

In addition, wearable and on-body sensors will monitor the vital signals and well being of the responders. These connected devices or the so-called IoT surrounding public safety responders generate highly vulnerable data, where security breaches may have life threatening consequences. Authentication of responder devices is essential in order to control access to public safety networks. Most of the existing authentication schemes do not scale well with the large number of devices of IoT, and are not fast enough to work during time-critical public safety missions. On the other hand, for general IoT services, cloud-based solutions provide unlimited resources for storing and accessing IoT data. However, the cloud may have some implications for sensitive data that are collected for public safety. Therefore, authentication solutions are desired to integrate well into the cloud environment. In this article, we propose cloud-centric, multi-level authentication as a service approach that addresses scalability and time constraints, and demonstrate its effectiveness. We draw future research directions for secure public safety networks in the presence of IoT devices and the cloud.	authentication;cloud computing;cutscene;fail-safe;real-time computing;scalability;sensor;wearable computer;window of opportunity	Ismail Butun;Melike Erol-Kantarci;Burak Kantarci;Houbing Song	2016	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2016.7452265	cloud computing;computer science;sensor;operating system;authentication;internet privacy;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Security	-45.23709949925517	51.73785794348327	66164

At the same time, the status of XML as a standard for storing and exchanging data in Internet and XML documents is becoming a de facto standard for storing and exchanging information. So, access control of XML documents is a key in dynamic coalition environment. In this paper, we propose an approach that exploits the semantics associated with subject and information in XML documents to facilitate automatic access control policies while resource sharing occurs among coalition members. Our approach relies on identifying the necessary attributes required by users to gain access to specific XML documents information. Specifically, it consists of extracting user attribute sets that semantically match with the attributes of the information in XML documents. This relies on a closer examination of why a user is assigned a specific role.	access control;entity;exploit (computer security);xml	Tao Peng;Minghua Jiang;Ming Hu	2008	2008 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2008.310	xml catalog;xml validation;binary xml;xml encryption;xml namespace;simple api for xml;xml;computer science;information security;document structure description;xml framework;soap;data mining;xml database;xml schema;database;authorization;qname;xml signature;world wide web;xml schema editor;computer security;cxml;efficient xml interchange	DB	-47.74099729582304	52.599731976544064	66312

0d7fc649e8ce6de76c1673be60b620ed1d06ac79	a fog-computing architecture for preventive healthcare and assisted living in smart ambients		In the last years, the emergence of pervasive connected devices and the development of the cloud computing paradigms brought a revolution in health-care and industrial applications. Cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) exploit large scale service providers to vastly reduce costs and gather Big Data. However, cloud-based services still face various issues related to: high bandwidth requirements, unpredictable delays, and security and safety concerns. These issues are critical to health-care and Active and Assisted Living (AAL) where a correct and timely reaction can result in saving a life or drastically reducing a disability (e.g. after a stroke). In this scenario, we present a flexible multi-level architecture using the fog approach, a computing paradigm in which heterogeneous devices at the edge of the network collect data, compute a task with minimal latency, and produce physical actions meaningful for the user, leveraging upon context and location awareness. In this paper, we envision also an edge node built upon Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The hardware of a FPGA node can be reconfigured to produce maximum performance in tasks, to guarantee a minimal delay, or the capacity to scale on the number of devices connected, with a minimal power consumption. We present two case studies for assistive smart ambients and health applications designed on our Fog architecture.	atm adaptation layer;big data;cloud computing;computer architecture;emergence;field-programmable gate array;internet of things;location awareness;pervasive informatics;programming paradigm;requirement	Luca Cerina;Sara Notargiacomo;Matteo GrecoLuca Paccanit;Marco D.

Therefore, Mobile Ad-hoc Networks are valuable solutions to let them coordinate. While executing some activities, nodes can move in the area and, hence, disconnect from the others. In order operators to coordinate with each other, devices need to be continuously connected, although that is not guaranteed, due to the mobile nature of the network. In this paper we present a bayesian approach to predict device disconnections in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks, and validating experimental results that show the viability of the approach. This prediction feature is useful for an upper coordination layer, which can arrange appropriate actions to prevent disconnections from occurring or, at least, to mitigate the consequences.	hoc (programming language);pervasive informatics;publish–subscribe pattern	Massimiliano de Leoni;Massimo Mecella;Paolo Manfre;Junio Valerio Franchi;Daniele Graziano	2009	2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops	10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345353	mobile ad hoc network;bayesian probability;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;internet privacy;mobile computing;emergency management;computer network	Robotics	-41.89803196579063	52.198032133104135	66722

We present a new concept—verifiable transaction atomicity—for designing electronic payment protocols. We give formal specifications to the verifiable atomic commitment problem. Then we design a robust electronic currency system to meet the specifications and achieve the verifiable transaction atomicity.	algorithm;atomicity (database systems);database;digital currency;distributed computing;electronic funds transfer;formal verification;malware;non-repudiation;transaction processing	L.

c19f644df5027b2f6ea4615ea8757fee3d1dd2e7	modeap: moving desktop application to mobile cloud service	remote desktop protocol;mobile cloud;virtual network computing;smartphone	Thanks to the availability of various mobile applications, lots of users shift from desktop environments, e.g., PCs and laptops, to mobile devices, e.g., smartphones and tablets. However, there are still some desktop applications without counterparts on mobile devices, such as some integrated development environments (e.g., eclipse) and automatic industry control systems. In this paper, we propose Modeap, a platform-independent mobile cloud service that can push all desktop applications developed for various operating systems from cloud servers to mobile devices. Modeap follows a design principle of complete detachment and regeneration of desktop user interface, i.e., the essential graphical primitives of the original desktop applications will be intercepted and then translated into standard web-based graphical primitives such that the interactions between users and remote cloud applications become possible via mobile web browsers. In this way, all desktop applications built upon the same set of graphical primitives can be used on mobile devices in great flexibility without installing any new software. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype that provides Windows applications from cloud server to mobile web browsers. The results of extensive experiments show that the proposed framework can achieve our design goals with low latency and bandwidth consumption. H. Li, P. Li, and S.

This increase in social networking use has led to user anxiety related to privacy and the unauthorised exposure of personal information. Large-scale sharing in virtual spaces means that researchers, designers and developers now need to re-consider the issues and challenges of maintaining privacy when using social networking services. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current state-of-the-art privacy in social networks for both desktop and mobile uses and devices from various architectural vantage points. The survey will assist researchers and analysts in academia and industry to move towards mitigating many of the privacy issues in social networks.	social network	Mohammad Badiul Islam;Renato Iannella;Jason Watson;Shlomo Geva	2015	IJIPSI	10.1504/IJIPSI.2015.075438	privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Vision	-46.982642899788836	60.1010551165832	68123

Second, we present our architecture – “Personal Home Domains” (PHD) –, which adds some key features to the original AD: it allows offline content in addition to streaming; it harmonizes the distribution inside the domain with (new) the delivery from service provider to the domain; it allows for the distribution of free or age-protected content; it emphasizes the mobility of users more than the original concept; and it allows for non-compliant devices inside the domain devices as well."""	authentication;authorization;blocking (computing);digital distribution;digital recording;discontinuous galerkin method;encryption;iptv;in the beginning... was the command line;interactivity;interoperability;oma;online and offline;overhead (computing);parental controls;personalization;privacy;protection mechanism;prototype;requirement;streams;scalability;uncontrolled format string;user experience;web content;yet another	Marcos A.

Various system design schemes have been proposed for the purpose of enhancing the performance of traditional hospital-centered health care system. Equipped with wireless devices, the innovative system is capable to offer intelligent monitoring and control. In this paper, the authors present an improved web-based motion detection system for health care. The algorithm running on it can detect different motion patterns for individuals and perform well across different hardware platforms, such as Android phones and sensors. The authors use Contiki and its supported low-power wireless standards for 6LoWPAN-based Wireless Sensor Network WSN to address security issues and realize real-time bidirectional communication. The Web of Things WoT integrates data from resource-constrained sensors into web applications and allows the realization of this smart system. Further, a technical evaluation is given to evaluate this system.

P2P-based sharing systems have been actively researched to enable resource sharing between multiple heterogeneous healthcare enterprises. Unfortunately, P2P system introduces a whole new class of privacy and security threats and in order to enable resource sharing between multiple heterogeneous healthcare enterprises, a policy management framework is required. To solve these problems in a loose-coupling way, we propose a dynamic, distributed and heterogeneous policy management framework for sharing medical information among autonomous and disparate healthcare information systems.	authorization;autonomous robot;database;information system;loose coupling;privacy	Fahed Al-Neyadi;Jemal H.

In most privacy preserving mechanisms proposed to protect sensitive individual information, system performance is compromised at the same time. In this article, we consider the trade-off between individual privacy and system performance in CPSs. After introducing the CPS architecture and the basic definition of differential privacy, we formulate the performance optimization problem subject to a given differential privacy requirement. For a simplified system, we derive the closed-form optimal system performance under the desired privacy requirement. Simulation results are provided to verify the proposed mechanism, which balances the trade-off between system performance and privacy. We also identify future research topics on the privacy preserving problem in CPSs.	cyber-physical system;differential privacy;internet privacy;linear system;mathematical optimization;optimal control;optimization problem;simulation;spectral leakage;systems architecture	Heng Zhang;Yuanchao Shu;Peng Cheng;Jiming Chen	2016	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2016.7437026	privacy software;privacy by design;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-46.44593949224721	58.77452580518131	69542

The large latency and limited bandwidth on the Internet greatly affects the game’s scalability. The High Level Architecture (HLA) is the IEEE standard for distributed simulation with its Data Distribution Management (DDM) service group assuming the functionalities of interest management. With its support for reuse and interoperability and its DDM support for communication optimization, the HLA is promising at supporting multi-user gaming on the Internet. However, this usually requires particular prior security setup across administrative domains according to the specific Run Time Infrastructure (RTI) used. We have previously developed a Service Oriented HLA RTI (SOHR) which enables distributed simulations to be conducted across administrated domains on the Grid.

ad446df7903132982c400fd52371cee18513d977	introduction to the special section on social collaborative internet of things		The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought enormous opportunities because of its potential to deliver greater cost and time savings to a wide range of enterprise tasks [1,2] . Considering IoT’s potential, several manufacturers, software developers, and service providers, are putting huge efforts to benefit from the IoT vision [3] . There are a number of application scenarios where IoT can play an important role, including building and home automations [4] , smart cities [5] , and smart manufacturing. A wide range of applications, such as access control, energy optimization, light and temperature control, connected appliances, and predictive maintenance, are included in building and home automations. The IoT-based applications of smart cities include residential E-meters, pipeline leak detection, smart street lights, traffic control, surveillance cameras, and centralized system control. The potential applications in the area of smart manufacturing include real time inventory, flow optimization, asset tracking, predictive maintenance, employee safety, and firmware updates. The USA National Intelligence Council predicted that “by 2025 Internet nodes may reside in everyday things – food packages, furniture, paper documents, and more”. IoT can play a noteworthy role in improving the quality of our lives by employing IoT technologies in various fields such as industrial automation, healthcare, and transportation. In parallel, social networking services have emerged to facilitate in building the online social relations among people with common interests, backgrounds, real-life connections, or activities. Recently researchers have coined a term of Social Collaborative Internet of Things (SCIoT) to leverage the social networking services for enabling the interaction and sharing information among the smart objects of IoT to achieve a common goal. SCIoT can be augmented by integrating the IoT with Edge computing [6,7] or Cloud computing [8] . SCIoT refers to the augmented use of social networks for collaboration between machines in IoT. A smart sprinkler system integrated with SCIoT can be an example of such environment where smart sprinkler can listen to a local weather tower equipped with sensors and also part of social network made of other devices. Smart sprinkler can collect the information from SCIoT to make the turn off decision considering the rain forecast. W. Khan et al. in ‘When Social Objects Collaborate: Concepts, Processing Elements, Attacks and Challenges’ define the Social Collaborative Internet of Things (SCIoT) as follows: “A Social Collaborative Internet of Things is a new paradigm that has strong ties with Social Internet of Things and is defined as a platform of IoT where smart objects work together socially through recursive interactions of knowledge by establishing social relationships with their surrounding smart objects aiming to achieve common/shared goals in order to benefit humans. ” For this Special Section, we invited researchers from academia and industry to discuss challenging ideas, novel research contributions and demonstration results, on SCIoT. After a rigorous review process, the four papers described below have been selected to be published. J. F. Colom et al. proposed collaborative processing framework in the paper entitled ‘Collaborative building of behavioral models based on Internet of Things’ for distribution of applications among the IoT objects. The framework comprises of load computing model, a scheduling mechanism, and a handover procedure for distributing tasks among the IoT devices. In each cycle of the task distribution, each node compute load, then share the computed load with the neighbouring devices and receive their computed load. Once the IoT devices have found their own and available devices computed load, the task scheduling is performed. After scheduling the tasks along with states are offloaded to the available IoT devices. W. Khan et al. presented a survey entitled ‘When Social Objects Collaborate: Concepts, Processing Elements, Attacks and Challenges’ on trust management schemes proposed for existing Social Internet of Things (SIoTs). The schemes are compared by highlighting their similarities and differences. Further, the key features and limitations of these trust management schemes are also presented. The authors provide the definition of Social Collaborative Internet of Things (SCIoT). A SCIoT hierarchical model is also presented to highlight the significance of the process.

The key hypothesis of this dissertation is that resource management on smartphones can be improved by adapting to usage patterns of users. We extensively studied users in the wild to characterize smartphone usage. We discovered significant diversity in smartphone usage. Along all aspects that we studied, users differ by one or more orders of magnitude. This finding suggests that resource management policies and algorithms on smartphones can become more effective if they learn and adapt to user behavior.We developed the prototype of a system that adaptively manages battery, one of the most strained resources on smarthpones, and evaluated its performance. PowerLeash is a system that gives users control over their smartphonesu0027 battery lifetime when running background applications. With PowerLeash a user who is running power consuming background applications on her smartphone can decide how long her battery should last. PowerLeash continuously monitors the phoneu0027s battery level, the useru0027s interactions with the phone, and progress of background applications. It builds a personalized model to estimate battery consumption based on usage and background applications progress. Using the on-line model and other information, PowerLeash dynamically adjusts the power consumption of background applications to meet the useru0027s desired battery lifetime. We have designed PowerLeash to be easy to deploy, easy to use, and easy to incorporate in background applications. PowerLeash can run on any Android smartphone as a user level application, and relies only on information that is available to user-level processes. We present the design of PowerLeash and a detailed performance evaluation based on user studies. We use the lessons from deploying PowerLeash on volunteers smartphones to inform future iterations.	smartphone	Mohamamd Hossein Falaki	2012			simulation;engineering;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-36.19601452522851	56.32969961677712	69867

Unfortunately, classic middleware platforms do not appear able to cope with such a level of heterogeneity and new communication mechanisms are thus required. This paper presents Plugin-Orb, an adaptive middleware for mobile and embedded devices with poor resources. Plugin-Orb aims to obtain a communication mechanism which would make a client application able to inter-operate with server objects running over different middleware technologies using an unified communication interface, thus having the programmer able to develop applications without taking into account underlying middleware technologies.	client (computing);embedded system;middleware;mobile device;plug-in (computing);programmer;server (computing);ubiquitous computing	Antonio d'Acierno;Giuseppe De Pietro;Antonio Coronato;Giuliano Gugliara	2005			ubiquitous computing;context-aware pervasive systems;middleware (distributed applications);software;mobile device;unified communications;programmer;middleware;distributed computing;computer science	HPC	-38.74019194573371	46.48293201093774	70225

More and more sophisticated applications are being developed and a very promising market is quickly being established where mobile users may access multimedia data while roaming from a cell to another, anytime and everywhere. Such scenario requires a strong infrastructure in order to adequately manage all the different issues related with high level service provisioning. QoS represents one of the most crucial issues as it involves many different aspects and directly impacts the user satisfaction. In order to achieve this target, we propose an architecture which allows mobile devices to access advanced services available in the wired part of the network. This architecture, based on mobile agents technology, assumes the presence of a VOD Virtual Server. The strategy adopted is to hide all the basic mechanisms inside a middleware layer that provides the necessary interfaces to allow a simple interaction between the user on the one side and the network and the distributed services on the other. The overall architecture, that is currently being implemented and tested, has been used as an experimental environment to provide mobile users with a new service to access MPEG-4 flows.	anytime algorithm;high-level programming language;middleware;mobile agent;mobile device;mobile phone;provisioning;quality of service;reference architecture;serial experiments lain;server (computing);versant object database	Dario Bruneo;Massimo Villari;Angelo Zaia;Antonio Puliafito	2003		10.1109/ISCC.2003.1214184	radio access network;mobile search;quality of service;computer science;operating system;middleware;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-35.541762993153704	48.86072094783473	70275

The combination of a standardised interface and the security features provided by TLS have made web technology very attractive. The TLS technology however has some limit at ions, especially in its lack of access control functionality. This paper focusses on alternatives to provide improved security services to web based applications. The SESAME se­ curity architecture is shown to provide all of the TLS security services, with the addition of other services such as the access control service. Al­ so because SESAME uses the connection based GSS-API which is the same paradigm used by TLS, it is shown to be a suitable replacement. Unfortunately because web servers and web browsers do not provide hooks for replacing the TLS security technology, SESAME is not easi­ ly used. Two alternatives are therefore considered that overcome this limitation: a new proposal before the IETF of extending TLS to carry attribute certificates and a hybrid solution buHt by the authors.	intranet;sesame	Paul Ashley;Mark Vandenwauver;Joris Claessens	1999		10.1007/978-0-387-35568-9_21	web service;web application security;web development;web application;web modeling;computer science;access control;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;standardization;enterprise information security architecture;computer network	Crypto	-45.937003073983135	56.964852525393674	70293

9a3e2f082b3632ce7fc3474fc8b2fcdfaa8633a9	energy harvesting in m2m and wsn space		Energy harvesting or power harvesting or energy scavenging is a process where energy is derived from external sources (e.g. solar power, thermal energy, wind energy, salinity gradients, kinetic energy etc.), captured, and stored for small, wireless autonomous devices, like those used in wearable electronics and wireless sensor networks. This paper is focused to applications of Energy Harvesting in Wireless Sensor Networks. This is going to help the ever growing M2M (Machine to Machine) field where there is an exponential growth of intelligent devices and automatic control of these is of paramount importance. [1] Energy Harvesting: A Survey: Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN) is used for various purposes. One of the biggest disadvantages of WSN is that these are mostly used in remote places and in unattended fashion. These at present are powered by small batteries and due to continuous usage batteries drain within some time. Replacing these batteries is mostly difficult if not impossible. Scientists have been looking for some solution to this issue and WSN with capacity of working on harvested energy from various resources evolved out of this requirement. Coarasa et al. [2] has proven that mobile energy sources, which are called actors, could be moved along a pre-decided pattern, which can radiate appropriate level of electro-magnetic energy which will be sufficient to charge the WSNs. The work has calculated all aspects of energy transfer between the actor and the sensor. This result has also been verified by extensive simulation. Schmidt [3], in his article in Wireless Communications, has provided a cohesive set of details about Energy Harvesting Details and its relevance to Machine to Machine Communications (M2M). It has been predicted that Internet connected devices will increase from an approximate 300 Million (by 2017) to 50 Billion (by 2020) in number. The issue of controlling such a huge number of intelligent devices is a daunting task. And in most places, it is assumed that M2M communication will be automatic to make it a viable proposition. We observe that development and enhancement of cloud services will help in enhancing the M2M operations. To empower this huge number of devices, power support provided by standard battery will become increasingly difficult. Moreover, many times, the WSN devices are strewn across remote fields where the result from these active devices is useful, but once they die, accessing and battery replacement is almost impossible. Energy harvesting will provide continuous power to the new generation of battery-less WSNs. These will provide continuous service from these WSNs and it will also need no maintenance. For critical applications, it is possible to use a technique called COUNCIL based clusters of WSNs [4]. Here the technique used is as follows. Simply put, as a Single Cluster is apt to fail more, a group of Clusters, called COUNCIL, is used to replace a single cluster. Service of the single cluster head is replaced by an Average of multiple cluster heads which uses a threshold secret sharing method. This provides better security. Again, all elements (WSN) are powered by energy transfer through harvesting. Energy may be harvested by either solar energy or by miniaturized electrodynamic energy converter. A thermoelectric converter can produce energy from heat. We may add a capacitor to store energy when ambient energy is not available. Sub-GHz signal is tapped for harvesting energy from RF sources and it is also to be noted that this provides a higher range of 300 m outside and 30 m inside a building. For Building Automation, energy harvesting WSNs are heavily used, thus eliminating costly battery replacement. Here, controlling of light, metering, energy management etc. are the main targeted area for automation. In this application, all control elements get information about various parameters from various battery-less sensors and these are passed on to the central Building Automation System. Self-powered radiator valves are automatically controlled by energy which is generated from the temperature difference between surrounding air (in ambient temperature) and hot water which in turn controls the connectivity with a controller and also for controlling the valve. These systems thus have no cable connection, no batteries and needs zero maintenance. HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning) control is a flexible automation system where a Thermostat, VAV (Variable Air Volume) or Fan Coil Controller are the recipient of information related to occupancy, temperature, humidity, window position or CO2 from the corresponding battery-less sensors and this in turn controls the valve actuators for radiators or dampers for the VAV systems. This controller is also connected to a Building Automation System thus providing a centralized control of the building parameters over Internet. Alarm systems e.g. water detector or fire detector will have more stringent requirement for its continuous flawless working. Battery-less sensors are of great help here as these systems are inherently more reliable as they do not have any battery (which will fail) or wiring system. Energy harvesting sensors play a big role here. All system parameters could be passed through some communication protocol (in encrypted format) to a remote Cloud environment. All related management systems could gather system parameters through this cloud-based system and could pass on control information through this system, as well. When cloud-based systems are used for sensitive control systems, it is necessary to take care of the cloud security issues [5], [6]. Future Aspects of Energy Harvesting: Advanced Ultra-Low power Wireless Communication has progressed to a great level and this in turn has helped in advanced M2M applications. Smart Home, Smart Metering and Smart Grid are few areas where M2M is already playing a big role through application of Energy Harvesting. Other areas like logistics for Industry and Transportation are having advanced research on the anvil, where M2M using energy harvesting is active. Some unusual applications: Though not directly connected with WSN and M2M technology, research is ongoing for bio-medical devices (pace-maker, middle-ear implant etc.) where the device may harvest energy through the body movement itself [7]. These are in deep research domain. One example: A person with Pace-Maker with an Energy Harvesting Technology and no battery will last for many years. In case, this person gets a heart attack, his movement will stop, so no power to his pacemaker. So a hybrid technology will need to be evolved where such pace-makers will also have a battery backup. In case of accidental stoppage of movement, this battery will start providing power to the pace-maker. Normally, this battery will keep getting charged for many years.

Yet, due to the lack of common accepted standards, cloud service providers use different technologies and offer their clients services that are operated by a variety of proprietary APIs. The lack of standardization results in numerous heterogeneities (e.g., heterogeneous service descriptions, message level naming conflicts, data representation conflicts etc.) making the interoperation, collaboration and portability of services a very complex task. In this work we focus on the problems of interoperability and portability in Cloud Computing, we address their differences and we discuss some of the latest research work in this area. Finally we evaluate and point out relationships between the identified solutions.	apache cocoon;application programming interface;cloud computing;cross-correlation;data (computing);database;emoticon;interoperability;interoperation;microsoft azure;microsoft windows;ncsa mosaic;owl-s;ontology (information science);open cloud computing interface;oracle c++ call interface;sparql;semantic web rule language;software portability	Kostas Stravoskoufos;Alexandros Preventis;Stelios Sotiriadis;Euripides G.

A similar problem exists in the area of Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) where the verifier's trust in the issuer of a public key certificate is a well-known prerequisite for the acceptance of the certificate. This work presents a method for the assignment, the storage, the propagation and the verification of trust in a distributed system which is based on a PKI trust management approach. A participant's trust causes the issuing of a digital certificate binding a privilege for the proper fulfillment of a certain task to the trusted entity. These certificates are stored in a distributed manner in the system and, therefore, are available to any other participant for its trust decisions. We describe the processes for the certification and the verification of these trust privileges. Additionally, a formal model of the trust verification process is presented. An example illustrates the application of the method and the model.	certificate authority;distributed computing;entity;formal language;public key certificate;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;software propagation;trust management (information system);ws-trust	Thomas Wölfl;Kai Fischbach	2007	27th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW'07)	10.1109/ICDCSW.2007.11	web of trust;chain of trust;certificate policy;data structure;trust anchor;computer science;public key certificate;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;root certificate;world wide web;computer security;certification practice statement;computational trust;computer network	SE	-44.92024833672205	56.677032256481425	71015

To solve this problem, we propose a user-centered control system to provide personalized and automated channel selection services. This system has a client-server architecture. The mobile client is a remote control device for interacting with TV and any information modified ubiquitously through the mobile device is sent to the service server for further processing. A wireless environment is developed to access the proposed approach, in which a user can interact with the multimedia broadcasting system with his personal hand-held device. The experimental results show that the system can efficiently learn a user's interests and perform sensible channel selection.

At home, users interact with many devices and get access to many multimedia oriented documents (hosted on local drives, on cloud storage, online streaming, etc.) in various situations with multiple (and sometimes at the same time) devices. The diversity and heterogeneity of users profiles and service sources can be a barrier to discover the available services sources that can come from anywhere from the home or the city. The objective of this paper is to suggest a meta-level architecture for increasing the high level of context concepts abstracting for heterogeneous profiles and service sources via a top-level ontology. We particularly focus on context-aware mHealth applications and propose an ontologies-based architecture, OntoSmart (a top-ONTOlogy SMART), which provides adapted services that help users to broadcast of multimedia documents and their use with interactive services in order to help in maintaining old people at home and achieving their preferences. In order to validate our proposal, we have used Semantic Web, Cloud and Middlewares by specifying and matching OWL profiles and experiment their usage on several platforms.	cloud storage;computer mouse;context-aware network;high-level programming language;mhealth;multimodal interaction;ontology (information science);personal computer;smart;semantic web;set-top box;smartphone;streaming media;tablet computer;upper ontology	Adel Alti;Sébastien Laborie;Philippe Roose	2015	2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2015.7347984	computer science;operating system;database;health;multimedia;world wide web	Mobile	-38.94099448545113	49.55553517169894	71746

The key implementation issues for the proposed home monitoring system are (1) the easy configuration of a vacuum robot to connect to Wi-Fi networks, (2) the session management between a vacuum robot and a home monitoring server, and (3) the support of the Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal between a vacuum robot and a user terminal. In order to solve these issues, we use and extend the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the UDP hole punching. For easy configuration of a vacuum robot, we also propose the GENERATE method which is an extension to the SIP that allows for the generation of a SIP URI. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed system, we have implemented the prototype and conducted the performance test using the authoritative call generator.	ip camera;robot	KwangHee Choi;Ki-Sik Kong;Joon-Min Gil	2013		10.1007/978-94-007-6738-6_62	embedded system;computer vision;simulation	Robotics	-36.22968427073848	53.04700359240324	71780

Equipped with all these sensors and internet connectivity, modern mobile phones are enabling continuous sensing and increasingly many emergent mobile applications are using sensed context on the phone to understand users' needs and improve usability. However, limited battery power is a big hindrance to the deployment of continuous sensing on mobile devices and without any intelligent sensor management, the battery lasts only few hours. In this research, we emphasize on location-awareness and address the challenges in developing ubiquitous positioning solutions, cross-device indoor localization, position and trajectory tracking and inferring high-level contexts using machine-learning techniques on sensor data in an energy-efficient way.	bluetooth;emergence;global positioning system;gyroscope;high- and low-level;internet access;location awareness;machine learning;mobile app;mobile device;mobile phone;near field communication;sensor;software deployment;usability	Sourav Bhattacharya	2011		10.1145/2030112.2030196	embedded system;real-time computing;mobile search;simulation;particle filter;computer science;operating system;efficient energy use;mobile computing	Mobile	-41.332352323231504	50.27191234954648	72052

Therefore, the paper proposes a semantic enhanced attribute-based access manager as a gatekeeper for cloud-based services so that authoritative service access can be achieved. The paper use universal resource identifier for attribute representation. The core of the approach is an access manager, which does not only providing a globally accessible attributes but also managing the entire service access decision process. Furthermore, we propose a rule-based representation scheme to represent service access policies, using a logic-based reasoning mechanism. In order to analyze the feasibility of the proposed approach, we select a cloud-based collaboration scenario and present the prototype implementation of it.	access control;cloud computing;common open policy service;embedded system;gatekeeper;information sensitivity;java;knowledge base;logic programming;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;prototype;sparql;spin;scalability;security token;semantic web;semantic reasoner;uniform resource identifier;validator;xacml	Zahid Iqbal;Josef Noll	2012	2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2012.280	computer science;knowledge management;data mining;semantic web stack;database	DB	-47.64820459443792	53.3506231705151	72235
ddabfda93ba39531b8512271cc94706733cdbcfc	challenges in haptic communications over the tactile internet		The Tactile Internet presently constitutes a vision of an Internet over which, in addition to current communications modalities, a sense of touch can be transported. In that case, people would no longer need to be physically near the systems they operate, but could control them remotely. The main problem that needs to be solved to realize the Tactile Internet is summarized by the “1 ms challenge.” If the response time of a system is below 1 ms, the end-user will not be able to tell the difference between controlling a system locally or from another location. This paper offers a summary of the requirements for haptic communications, followed by an overview of challenges in realizing the Tactile Internet. In addition, possible solutions to these challenges are proposed and discussed. For example, the development of the fifth generation mobile communication networks will provide a good foundation upon which a Tactile Internet could be built. This paper also describes the design of a modular testbed needed for testing of a wide variety of haptic system applications.		Dani&#x00EB;l Van Den Berg;Rebecca Glans;Dorian De Koning;Fernando A.

The infrared network is designed for in-building use, where each room becomes a communication cell. In contrast to the approach used by other PDAs, most PARCTAB applications run on remote hosts and therefore depend on reliable communication through the IR network. The infrastructure provides reliability as well as uninterrupted service when a PARCTAB moves from cell to cell. The PARCTAB and a supporting infrastructure [I, 41 has been operational since March 1993 at the Computer Science Lab at Xerox PARC. The system currently comprises thirty cells and twenty-five PARCTABS and will expand in the near future. There are three types of software components in the PARCTAB system: gateways, agents, and applications. Gateways implement a datagram service for sending and receiving packets using IR signals. Each tab is represented by an agent. An agent tracks the location of its tab and provides location independent reliable remote procedure calls. The protocols enforce security, preventing, for example, an unauthorized application from taking control of a tab. Applications are built using a library of widgets designed to accommodate the PARCTAB'S low IR-communication bandwidth and small display area.

46289f0ae8618c399507b6d459cecded7b176035	internet of vehicles and autonomous connected car - privacy and security issues		"""In the Intelligent Vehicle Grid, the car is becoming a formidable sensor platform, absorbing information from the environment, from other cars (and from the driver) and feeding it to other cars and infrastructure to assist in safe navigation, pollution control and traffic management. The Vehicle Grid essentially becomes an Internet of Things (IOT), which we call Internet of Vehicles (IOV), capable to make its own decisions about driving customers to their destinations. Like other important IOT examples (e.g., smart buildings), the Internet of Vehicles will not merely upload data to the Internet using V2I. It will also use V2V communications between peers to complement on board sensor inputs and provide safe and efficient navigation. In this paper, we first describe several vehicular applications that leverage V2V and V2I. Communications with infrastructure and with other vehicles, however, can create privacy and security violations. In the second part of the paper we address these issues and more specifically focus on the need to guarantee location privacy to mobile users. We argue on the importance of creating public, open """"smart city"""" data repositories for the research community and propose privacy preserving techniques for the anonymous uploading of urban sensor data from vehicles."""	connected car;giove;internet of things;privacy;smart tv;smart city;upload;vehicle-to-vehicle	Joshua Joy;Mario Gerla	2017	2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038391	smart city;grid;building automation;leverage (finance);computer network;computer science;privacy software;the internet;internet of things;computer security;upload	Mobile	-43.32890908810043	52.101967754651675	72634

A/sup 3/ fault tolerance includes three objectives, namely, access security, agent persistence, and avoidance of long queuing time. The last two objectives are achieved by agent mobility. The prototype for this framework was verified over the Internet, a typical sizeable network, with selected sites that include part of our university's intranet and other local Internet sites, as well as the stable Java-based Aglets mobile-agent platform. Results from the verification exercise with this prototype indicate unanimously that the A/sup 3/ framework is indeed a fault-tolerant solution for distributed computing with multiple mobile agents over sizeable networks. Access security is achieved by formation of communes, namely, villages and public intranets. These communes protect themselves by denying accesses by non-members to the shared communal resources. The smallest commune is a village, and different villages are interconnected automatically by mediators or connectors into a larger commune known as the public intranet, which has a different connotation from the conventional one that is formed for institutional privacy and integrity. Agent mobility for achieving agent persistence and avoidance of long queuing time depends on the instantaneous values of the migration indices, which are computed from the specific sets of run-time parameters.	distributed computing;mobile agent	Allan K.

There are many ways to access the resources of a Grid, each with unique security requirements and implications for both the resource user and the resource provider. A comprehensive set of Grid usage scenarios is presented and analyzed with regard to security requirements such as authentication, authorization, integrity, and confidentiality. The main value of these scenarios and the associated security discussions is to provide a library of situations against which an application designer can match, thereby facilitating security-aware application use and development from the initial stages of the application design and invocation. A broader goal of these scenarios is to increase the awareness of security issues in Grid Computing.	authentication;authorization;computation;computer;confidentiality;data integrity;distributed computing;experimental system;grid computing;jackson;legion (software);requirement;schedule (project management);software deployment	Marty Humphrey;Mary R.

0b2de714121bfe46bbc6254e1857b4a7e0109ce2	a reference model for internet of things middleware		Internet of Things (IoT) is a term used to describe an environment where billions of objects, constrained in terms of resources (“things”), are connected to the Internet, and interacting autonomously. With so many objects connected in IoT solutions, the environment in which they are placed becomes smarter. A software, called middleware, plays a key role since it is responsible for most of the intelligence in IoT, integrating data from devices, allowing them to communicate, and make decisions based on collected data. Then, considering requirements of IoT platforms, a reference architecture model for IoT middleware is analyzed, detailing the best operation approaches of each proposed module, as well as proposes basic security features for this type of software. This paper elaborates on a systematic review of the related literature, exploring the differences between the current Internet and IoT-based systems, presenting a deep discussion of the challenges and future perspectives on IoT middleware. Finally, it highlights the difficulties for achieving and enforcing a universal standard. Thus, it is concluded that middleware plays a crucial role in IoT solutions and the proposed architectural approach can be used as a reference model for IoT middleware.	interaction;internet of things;middleware;multi-objective optimization;reference architecture;reference model;requirement;systematic review;usability	Mauro A.

A semantic privacy-preserving model provides authorized view-based query answering over a widespread multiple servers for data sharing and integration. The combined semantics-enabled privacy protection policies are used to empower the data integration and access control services at the virtual platform (VP). The ontology mapping and merging algorithm with a local-as-view (LAV) source description that creates a global ontology schema at the VP by integrating multiple local ontology schemas for data sharing. The perfect rules integration of datalog rules enforces the data query and protection services. Semantics-enable policies are combined together at the VP, but the access control criteria specified in each server are still satisfied. Therefore the soundness and completeness of data sharing and protection criteria are ensured to support the validity of policy combination. This guarantees the trustworthiness of data sharing and protection services in multiple servers.	access control;algorithm;authorization;datalog;ontology-based data integration;privacy;semantic integration;server (computing);trust (emotion);virtual machine	Yuh-Jong Hu;Jiun-Jan Yang	2011		10.1145/1988688.1988700	computer science;data mining;database;ontology-based data integration;world wide web	DB	-47.65669685978564	53.343261866919065	73571

A common tactic for enabling interoperability is the use of open standards, so there is currently a large amount of active work in standards development for the Cloud. This paper explores the role of standards in cloud-computing interoperability. It covers standard-related efforts, discusses several cloud interoperability use cases, and provides some recommendations for moving forward with cloud-computing adoption regardless of the maturity of standards for the cloud.

System entities may be classified into two main categories that are, in principle, in conflict. These are the service resource requestors (SRRs) wishing to use services and/or exploit resources offered by the other system entities and the service resource providers (SRPs) that offer the services/resources requested. Seeking for the maximization of their welfare, entities may misbehave, thus leading to a significant deterioration of system's performance. The scope of this paper is to present a computational model for trust establishment based on a reputation mechanism, which incorporates direct SRRs' experiences and information disseminated from witness SRRs on the basis of their past experiences with SRPs. The designed mechanism discriminates between unfair feedback ratings intentionally and unintentionally provided, takes into consideration potential changes to providers' behavior, and weighs more recent events in the evaluation of the overall reputation ratings. The proposed model has been extensively evaluated through simulation experiments.

add6502517ac7440f0cf025e1975e443b59fbee0	evidence based trust estimation model for cloud computing services		With growing acceptance of cloud environment, demand for cloud services based applications is rapidly increasing. Cloud environment is inherently distributed and highly dynamic. Usually, many cloud services having similar functionalities but varying performances are offered. This makes difficult for user to identify the appropriate cloud service. Consequently, trust assessment is becoming essential to locate and to continue using the suitable cloud service. Quality of Service (QoS) attributes are significant for trust assessment in cloud environment. These attributes are dynamically changing and are not considered by the traditional trust assessment approaches. Hence, these approaches are inadequate to withstand in cloud environment. This paper proposes an evidence based trust estimation model (EBTEM) for trust assessment of cloud services. EBTEM uses various attributes of cloud service as evidence factors. It performs adaptive trust computation, which is sensitive to changes in the service behavior. EBTEM also presents a method for dynamic trust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other models in respect of accuracy and efficiency.	algorithm;cloud computing;computation;mean squared error;performance;quality of service;requirement;web of trust	Shilpa Deshpande;Rajesh Ingle	2018	I.

We illustrate an integration of differential privacy with privacy policy languages and policy-enforcement frameworks like the PRECIOSA PeRA architecture. Next, we identify differential privacy mechanisms to be integrated within the policy-enforcement framework and provide guidelines for the calibration of parameters to ensure specific privacy guarantees, while still supporting the level of accuracy required for ITS applications. We also discuss the challenges that the support of user-level differential privacy presents and outline a potential solution. As a result, we show that differential privacy could be put to practical use in ITS to enable strong protection of users' personal data.	differential privacy;family computer disk system;personally identifiable information;privacy policy;user space	Frank Kargl;Arik Friedman;Roksana Boreli	2013		10.1145/2462096.2462114	embedded system;privacy software;intelligent transportation system;privacy by design;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;differential privacy;computer network	DB	-46.16478865774928	59.635393959319366	74894

To support the integrative use of data held by mobile hosts in this environment, we proposed the AMDS (Active Mobile Database System) as the kernel system for data management. The behavior definition language of this system, ECA (event-condition-action) rules, has a high description capability that enables users to define complicated behavior. However, the execution of the ECA rules may fall into a chain of unexpected behaviors. In general, a directed graph, called a trigger graph, is used for detecting chains. Since the trigger graph highly depends on network topology, it is difficult to employ the trigger graph in a mobile computing environment. In this paper, we propose a method that reconstructs the trigger graph dynamically to adapt to changes in network topology. Using this mechanism, mobile applications with ECA rules can be used more safely.	mobile computing	Tsutomu Terada;Masahiko Tsukamoto;Shojiro Nishio	2003		10.1109/DEXA.2003.1232141	wait-for graph;directed graph;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;database;distributed computing;mobile computing;world wide web	DB	-38.91539173102889	49.40973757558025	75031

876e96d8a3d57527c400b8ec7af59ba5a806acb4	a distributed framework for health information exchange using smartphone technologies	mphr;health information exchange hie;mobile computing;nfc;bioinformatics	Nationwide health information exchange (NHIE) continues to be a persistent concern for government agencies, despite the many efforts and the conceived benefits of sharing patient data among healthcare providers. Difficulties in ensuring global connectivity, interoperability, and concerns on security have always hampered the government from successfully deploying NHIE. By looking at NHIE from a fresh perspective and bearing in mind the pervasiveness and power of modern mobile platforms, this paper proposes a new approach to NHIE that builds on the notion of consumer-mediated HIE, albeit without the focus on central health record banks. With the growing acceptance of smartphones as reliable, indispensable, and most personal devices, we suggest to leverage the concept of mobile personal health records (PHRs installed on smartphones) to the next level. We envision mPHRs that take the form of distributed storage units for health information, under the full control and direct possession of patients, who can have ready access to their personal data whenever needed. However, for the actual exchange of data with health information systems managed by healthcare providers, the latter have to be interoperable with patient-carried mPHRs. Computer industry has long ago solved a similar problem of interoperability between peripheral devices and operating systems. We borrow from that solution the idea of providing special interfaces between mPHRs and provider systems. This interface enables the two entities to communicate with no change to either end. The design and operation of the proposed approach is explained. Additional pointers on potential implementations are provided, and issues that pertain to any solution to implement NHIE are discussed.	bank (environment);clinic;clustered file system;converter device component;crew resource management, healthcare;delegate action;device translator device component;entity name part qualifier - adopted;global network;government agencies;handheld game console;health information exchange;health information systems;hospitals, public;hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy;information system;interface device component;interoperability;mobile device;operating system;patients;peripheral;personal health records;personally identifiable information;pointer <dog>;repository;smartphone;specification;tablet dosage form;tablet computer;benefit	Mohamed Abdulnabi;Ahmed Al-Haiqi;Miss Laiha Mat Kiah;A.

Open Handset Alliance (OHA) hosting members like Google, Motorola, HTC etc released an open source platform Android for mobile devices. Android is also used in netbook and embedded platform. Android runs on top of linux kernel with a custom JVM set on top of it. Android uses new power management framework to save power in mobile devices. Android developers are allowed to build only JAVA applications. Google tries to make Android as energy efficient as possible to save battery power in mobile devices. In this work, we present benefits of using Android in low power embedded devices. We compared Android JAVA performance with popular Sun embedded JVM running on top of Angstrom linux. Our work shows that Android provides better VM designs but consumes more energy due to lack of dynamic compiler in Dalvik JVM. The implication is that, Android can become more energy efficient by implementing an optimized dynamic compiler in Dalvik JVM.

Through the use of Mobile Social Networks (MSN), users may access, publish and share content generated by them at anytime and anywhere, enhancing their social interactions. MSN applications are characterized by the integration of context information to the social network content, enriching the existing applications and providing new services. On the other hand, the extensive use of context information leads to new privacy and security challenges, which is the scope of this chapter, which aims to describe the main concepts, research challenges and solutions for this area.	social network	Ariel Soares Teles;Francisco José da Silva e Silva;Romulo de Carvalho Batista	2013		10.1007/978-3-7091-0894-9_9	personally identifiable information;public relations;cloud computing security;privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;internet privacy;computer security	ML	-41.79437082477113	50.96858543800815	75880

This approach has not yet caught on since a global user-service interaction is still an open issue. This paper states our position with regard to the next generation front-end technology for the Internet of the Future. This approach will enable the massive deployment of services over the Internet in a user-centric fashion. This paper advocates the full development of front-end technologies to bring services closer to users, empowering them anytime and anywhere. It also outlines all the main gaps and technological challenges that have to be addressed.

This bidirectional information flow facilitates improved grid monitoring, control automation, energy efficiency, and sustainability. Several smart grid networking architectures have been proposed recently. However, the majority of these are restricted to subdomains such as home area networks or substation networks, or are not scalable. There is a need for an overarching and inclusive communication architecture which accounts for all smart grid communication scenarios. In this paper, we propose iCenS, a holistic smart grid networking architecture. We identify various communication scenarios, elaborate on the suitability of iCenS, and discuss how it can be used to solve smart grid networking challenges. We also present simulation results demonstrating the scalability of our design and its effectiveness in serving various types of smart grid traffic.	entity;grid network;holism;network architecture;scalability;simulation;traction substation	Reza Tourani;Satyajayant Misra;Travis Mick;Sukumar M.

In existing servers, server embedded programs cannot be used safely in large-scale environments like a shared hosting service. These problems occur because server processes run under the privilege of an identical user. For example, server embedded interpreters are commonly used to improve performance in processing dynamic content, like Weblogs and wikis. However, other customers that share the same server can steal, delete, and tamper with data files of Weblogs and wikis. To solve these problems, we designed a new Web server system, Hi-sap. In the system, Web objects that are stored in a server are divided into partitions. Server processes run under the privilege of different users in every partition. We implemented Hi-sap on a Linux OS and tested the effectiveness of the system.

The presented system exploits Wi-Fi service set identifiers (SSIDs) for the discovery of phones and to convey short emergency messages. It can operate in two setups: either the victims' phones send out a distress signal or the responder's device is beaconing a rescue signal. By means of attaching the responder device to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) the scalability of both setups were compared with each other. Both setups were explored at two different altitudes.

The scientific community has proposed different solution for such issue, e.g., the MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) protocol introduced the topic concept as “the key that identifies the information channel to which payload data is published”. This study extends the topic approach by proposing the Web of Topics (WoX), a conceptual model for the IoT. A WoX Topic is identified by two coordinates: (i) a discrete semantic feature of interest (e.g. temperature, humidity), and (ii) a URI-based location. An IoT entity defines its role within a Topic by specifying its technological and collaborative dimensions. By this approach, it is easier to define an IoT entity as a set of couples Topic-Role. In order to prove the effectiveness of the WoX approach, we developed the WoX APIs on top of an EPCglobal implementation. Then, 10 developers were asked to build a WoX-based application supporting a physics lab scenario at school. They also filled out an ex-ante and an ex-post questionnaire. A set of qualitative and quantitative metrics allowed measuring the model's outcome.	internet of things;mqtt;model-driven architecture;payload (computing);quantitative structure–activity relationship;sensor;uniform resource identifier;world wide web	Luca Mainetti;Luigi Manco;Luigi Patrono;Ilaria Sergi;Roberto Vergallo	2015	2015 IEEE 2nd World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)	10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389025	embedded system;data modeling;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;information architecture;software metric;computer network	DB	-41.16794111377859	47.45038473228824	76852

Specially in mobile communication domain, a vital factor that can affect the performance of any mobile application is the resource constraint nature of mobile devices with limited processing and storage capacity. On the other hand integration of heterogeneous networks and systems bring influential research challenges. In this paper, we present a concept of REST based Mobile Web Services (MobWS) provisioning and its comparison with a similar SOAP architecture in terms of HTTP payload. The requirements of REST architecture are discussed and URL structures are defined for the interaction with synchronous and asynchronous RESTful MobWS. A resource oriented approach for optimizing HTTP payload is presented and related message structures are discussed. It is shown that the REST based MobWS provisioning when compared to SOAP, offers promising results by significantly reducing the payload.	application programming interface;hypertext transfer protocol;interaction;middleware;mobile app;mobile device;performance evaluation;provisioning;representational state transfer;requirement;soap;web service	Fahad Aijaz;Syed Zahid Ali;Muzzamil Aziz Chaudhary;Bernhard Walke	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5378949	web service;payload;mobile search;mobile web;heterogeneous network;mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;service-oriented architecture;soap;mobile device;distributed computing;information technology;world wide web;computer network	Visualization	-37.464264285063834	51.677569255032154	77071

The novelty of the application is that it requires little to no active involvement by users and unlike existing applications, it correlates the individual’s well-being to their environment as opposed to their physical activity alone. Consequently, when health and environment data are acquired, our application enables users to better identify behavior changes towards enhancing their health by enhancing their environments. Furthermore, Sense2Health is an open platform for integrating existing domain-specific sensing applications (environmental and health monitoring) focused on decreasing required specialized development efforts. We present in this paper the design of Sense2Health in addition to a proof-of-concept implementation for a noise-monitoring use case. Afterwards, we assess its performance while integrating it with a dedicated open source noise sensing application.	backup;cloud computing;open platform;open-source software;quantified self;scalability;seamless3d;server (computing);weatherstar	Sara Hachem;Georgios Mathioudakis;Animesh Pathak;Valérie Issarny;Rajiv Bhatia	2015		10.5220/0005332100360044		HCI	-41.606734909758536	48.92669852806429	77162
8fb23488b929a67f2a53bf4d7d422a12cd42f169	authentication with user driven web application for accessing remote resources		With the emerging of data-driven analysis and data science, the needs of high-performance computing resources and cyberinfrastructure (CI) have been widely spread across almost all domain fields in academia. While CI providers have continued success with the infrastructure-as-a-service model (IaaS), there are increasing demands to offer more service models for diverse users and use cases. We have proposed a web application framework, which empowers users running their own analytic workflows as a web service that is accessible by other users authenticated with existing credentials. Through this framework, ad-hoc analysis routines can be described and wrapped in a workflow model that is shareable and re-useable. While the framework offers a new way for any user with valid credential to access and utilize remote resources, there are cases where more flexible authentication methods can further lower the access barrier of HPC resources. In this paper, we detail credential management of this framework and report our preliminary works on enabling temporary access to the remote resources including using dynamic generated credentials and social logins.	application framework;authentication;cloud computing;credential;cyberinfrastructure;data science;hoc (programming language);supercomputer;usability;web application;web framework;web service	Yige Wang;Ruizhu Huang;Weijia Xu	2018		10.1145/3219104.3229290	web application;world wide web;cyberinfrastructure;web service;workflow;credential;web application framework;use case;computer science;authentication	HCI	-41.46480904550808	56.59973265320065	77470

We provide taxonomy with six different architectural patterns; standalone, full offloading, partial offloading, SaaS-based, CaaS-based, and offloaded CaaS-based. Different architectural patterns yield different levels of qualities, especially for performance and lower energy consumption for mobile applications.	architectural pattern;cloud computing;mobile app;mobile phone;software architecture;software as a service	Jennifer Kim	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA)	10.1109/SOCA.2010.5707181	embedded system;real-time computing;architectural pattern;computer science;operating system;mobile device;mobile computing	SE	-37.1816726155284	53.063715931543875	77783

5cba0f92f5d5c1d0374bd3c11b85865f52ae5c61	enabling gesture-based interactions with objects		Increasing numbers of everyday objects in libraries, stores and warehouses are instrumented with passive RFID tags, resulting in a ripe opportunity for gesture-based interactions with people. By a simple act of picking up and gesturing with an RFID-tagged object, users can send their opinions and sentiments about that object to the cloud. Prior work in RFID-based gesture tracking relies on multiple bulky and expensive antennas and readers to function, which incurs unacceptable infrastructure costs for large-scale ubiquitous deployment (over an entire warehouse or mall, for example) thus hindering practical adoption. In this paper, we propose Pantomime, the first RFID-based gesture recognition system that uses just a single antenna per geographical area of coverage. Our key insight is to replace the conventional multiple antenna single tag tracking framework with an equivalent multiple tag single antenna system. Through a novel tag coordination protocol and a lightweight tracking algorithm, Pantomime enables accurate gesture tracking that works for objects tagged with just two RFID tags. We implement a real-time prototype of Pantomime with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID readers and antennas. Extensive evaluations and real-world case studies in a classroom and a retail store demonstrate that Pantomime achieves comparable gesture tracking accuracy (87%) to state-of-the-art multi-antenna schemes (88%) at a minimal deployment cost.	algorithm;cloud computing;experiment;geographic coordinate system;gesture recognition;interaction;library (computing);multi-user;prototype;radio-frequency identification;real-time locating system;software deployment;tracking system	Longfei Shangguan;Zimu Zhou;Kyle Jamieson	2017		10.1145/3081333.3081364	real-time computing;gesture recognition;software deployment;computer science;gesture;cloud computing	Mobile	-42.085461486329514	53.21855005051358	78628

Specially, a user would like to find out and interact with some strangers with similar interest in vicinity through profile matching. However, in matching process, individuals always have to reveal their personal and private profiles to strangers, which conflicts with users' growing privacy concerns. To achieve privacy preserving profile matching i.e., friend discovery, many schemes are proposed based on homomorphic and commutative encryption, which bring tremendous computation and communication overheads, and are not practical for the resource limited mobile devices in MSNP. In this paper we adapt Confusion Matrix Transformation CMT method to design a Lightweighted fIne-grained Privacy-Preserving Profile matching mechanism, LIP3, which can not only efficiently realize privacy-preserving profile matching, but obtain the strict measurement of cosine similarity between individuals, while other existing CMT-based schemes can only roughly estimate the matching value.	social network	Yufeng Wang;Xiaohong Chen;Qun Jin;Jianhua Ma	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-27161-3_15	computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	ECom	-40.451636214883166	60.23598330401832	78701
bf82f995d3f5e4aa29e39a4f1699ce7dd874f4ea	an nf v-powered emergency system for smart enhanced living environments		The emergence of ubiquitous computing paradigms, and smart Ambient Intelligence environments, will play a crucial role, towards creating better living environments for activity-challenged individuals, such as disabled, or elderly people that require constant care. In addition, cloud computing has been an empowering force for that endeavour. In this paper, we propose a virtualized Cloud-based Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system that enables caretakers and first responders to constantly monitor a patient's indoor/outdoor position and be notified in case of emergency. Positioning is made possible through an embedded device (carried by the patient) that performs proximity estimation (Wi-Fi) and cell identification(Cellular). The geolocation data are sent to a VNF (Virtual Network Function) for further processing and assessment. In case the patient drifts away from his/her premises, the VNF retrieves the closest-to-the-patient third party agents (caretakers, hospital, police, volunteers, first responders, etc.) through the Location-to-Service-translation (LoST) protocol [1] and alerts them via a SIP-based (Session Initiation Protocol) VOIP (Voice over IP) communication channel.	atm adaptation layer;ambient intelligence;channel (communications);cloud computing;embedded system;emergence;endeavour (supercomputer);geolocation;global positioning system;ubiquitous computing	Yannis Nikoloudakis;Evangelos K.

This enhancement is carried out by the addition of specific behaviours, mostly dependent on context values. The tool assists the user in the construction of applications by easily selecting the components that fit his needs. A series of forms allows selecting sensors, context values of interest and digital counterparts to define an augmentation layer. The latter is composed of augmentation units, called augmenters, which are configurable through widgets that can be placed over the presentation layer of any Web application.

It defines the notion of a security-enhanced agent and outlines security management components in agent platform bases and considers secure migration of agents from one base to another. The security enhanced agent carries a passport that contains its security credentials and some related security code. Then we describe how authentication, integrity and confidentiality, and access control are achieved using the agent's passport and the security infrastructure in the agent bases. We then discuss the application of the security model in roaming mobile agents and consider the types of access control policies that can be specified using the security enhanced agents and the policy base in the agent platforms. Finally we describe the security infrastructure that implements the proposed security services and outline the development of a secure agent based application using the proposed architecture.	access control;agent-based model;authentication;computer security;confidentiality;credential;mobile agent;security management	Vijay Varadharajan;David Foster	2003	World Wide Web	10.1023/A:1022360516731	software security assurance;computer security model;cloud computing security;countermeasure;security management;security information and event management;security association;covert channel;asset;computer science;access control;logical security;mobile agent;security service;application security;distributed system security architecture;internet privacy;network access control;network security policy;computer security;enterprise information security architecture;computer network	Security	-46.518520658471026	54.783838887641636	79103

Modern devices (which are usually equipped with sensors), have the ability to observe and monitor their environments. Consequently, there are unique opportunities and benefits to be reaped, by creating virtual counterparts, which allow access to their functionality through well-known protocols and standards (such as REST and HTTP). In this way, a corresponding digital world of vast resources is actually generated. Such opportunities can be of immense importance for business-centric scenarios where data provided and exchanged can complement and add to existing business models, thus playing an important part in the future planning of businesses.  In this paper we firstly attempt to highlight the current research approaches specifically from the view of business centric scenarios. We discuss current research directions as well as existing problems and challenges based on the WoT paradigm and its implementations. We also highlight the methods, techniques and architectures involved, especially from the perspective of Web Services interactions. We attempt to stress the importance and possible benefits of implementing WoT methods, in a number of different enterprise's operations. We focus on a domain specific application, implementing the notions of the Web of Things on medium sized enterprises, such as a network of retail stores. Finally, we study the information provided by applying the WoT approach and we analyze the influence that this information has for the future planning of business procedures.	embedded system;hypertext transfer protocol;interaction;internet of things;programming paradigm;sensor;smartphone;web of things;web service;web standards;world wide web	Nikos Vesyropoulos;Christos K.

034362cd1d5dff8595f197615b42b31b50d4a7c8	ultraviolet radiation measurement via smart devices		Ultraviolet (UV) radiation has a great impact on human health. Nowadays, the public basically gets information about UV radiation through weather forecasts, which can only provide rough and average prediction for a certain large area. Since CMOS sensors in smartphone cameras are very sensitive to UV radiation, smartphones have potential to be the ideal equipment to measure it. At the same time, result optimization can be achieved in real time by taking advantage of fog computing because fog servers are able to aggregate UV radiation data and compute the results at local areas. This paper exhaustively discussed a novel procedure that could measure UV radiation through smartphone cameras, and also briefly covered how to leverage fog computing to improve UV measurement accuracy. To implement the procedure, an Android app called UV meter was developed. Experiments were conducted by utilizing the app to validate and evaluate the correctness and accuracy of the procedure on both smartphones and smart watches. Results showed that the proposed procedure could achieve an average of 95% accuracy of a typical professional digital UV meter, and could be easily implemented on smart devices.	aggregate data;cmos;computation;correctness (computer science);experiment;fog computing;futures studies;mathematical optimization;radiation hardening;real-time clock;sensor;smart device;smartphone;smartwatch	Bo Mei;Ruinian Li;Wei Cheng;Jiguo Yu;Xiuzhen Cheng	2017	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2017.2717845	android (operating system);embedded system;computer network;computer science;simulation;accuracy and precision;smartwatch;radiation;intelligent sensor;ultraviolet;server;edge computing	Mobile	-38.71160224099031	56.815465278252226	79989

What most people perceive of its structure often lacks acknowledgement of the smallest parts of it, albeit as of recently the most used ones, namely smartphones and smartwatches. Being recognized as a prominent member of the wearable/ubiquitous computing family, smartwatches have been gaining in popularity proving themselves valuable in various contexts, ranging from providing fitness applications and general health monitoring, to always-on assistive technology for people with special needs. This paper focuses on an alternative approach to using smartwatches, considering them monitoring tools for system and network administrators able to provide fast and readily available information on various network equipment and services. For this purpose a proof-of-concept application suite was built, used to provide the status of important services on a remote Linux-based server, as well as the status of the server system itself. We show how smartwatches can offer different, and some unique, previously considered impractical ways to convey information.

With the existence of application distribution channels such as the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, researchers can distribute applications and collect large scale data in ways that previously were not possible. Motivated by the lack of a universal, multi-platform sensing library, in this work we present the design and implementation of SensingKit, an open-source continuous sensing system that supports both iOS and Android mobile devices. One of the unique features of SensingKit is the support of the latest beacon technologies based on Bluetooth Smart (BLE), such as iBeacon and Eddystone. We evaluate and compare the power consumption of each supported sensor individually, using an iPhone 5S device running on iOS 9. We believe that this platform will be beneficial to all researchers and developers who plan to use mobile sensing technology in large-scale experiments.	android;app store;bluetooth;eddystone (google);experiment;gyroscope;ibeacon;mhealth;microphone;mobile device;open-source software;play store;sensor;smart tv;smartphone;ios	Kleomenis Katevas;Hamed Haddadi;Laurissa N.

f674fb4f110a4ae95eef10bc0e574aac2023107b	computer security		An important, emerging trend in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) are low-power networks (LPNs), referring to networks that target devices with very limited access to energy sources. While there are several approaches that allow to comply to these novel power restrictions, none of them provide a sufficient level of security, in particular with respect to data protection. In this paper, we propose a data protection scheme that ensures endto-end security from low-power devices to backend applications. It meets the technical constraints imposed by LPNs, while preserving data confidentiality and integrity. Our solution has been deployed on the water distribution network of the City of Antibes in France. The evaluation of the overhead introduced by the proposed data protection scheme shows promising results with respect to power (battery) consumption.	computer security;confidentiality;information privacy;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;overhead (computing);power semiconductor device	Costas Lambrinoudakis;Christos Kalloniatis;John Mylopoulos;Annie I.

a07e7893147cc9f7c0166476516cd7a41e6cfda2	energy efficient sensing for managing context and privacy on smartphones		Mobile devices can better manage user privacy if they continuously model a user’s context, but doing so can result in high energy consumption. The energy costs can be reduced by reasoning about what context information is known, what additional information is needed, how accurate it must be and how to efficiently acquire it. We model the sensors and their data properties, accuracy levels and energy costs in an RDF knowledge base supported by an OWL ontology. We describe a method to manage privacy on smartphones in an energy efficient manner by selecting the best choice sensor for maintaining the user’s context information. Sensor selection is done by COntext MANager miDDleware (COMANDD), which maintains a context model and answers queries about it. Context requests are served by capability matching, accuracy level matching and selection of lowest energy cost sensor for reporting context data. A context change detection function is used to decide when the context should be updated.	knowledge base;middleware;mobile operating system;privacy;resource description framework;sensor;smartphone;web ontology language	Prajit Kumar Das;Anupam Joshi;Timothy W.

A transaction is a unit of work issued by an agent. A transaction is assigned with a purpose which is a subfamily of roles granted to the agent. Even if transactions issue methods according to the purposes, illegal information flow might occur. We define legal, independent, illegal, and possibly illegal information flow relations among purposes. We discussed the purpose-based marking protocol to prevent illegal information flow.

67b9a53650c62c5fa8a54eef123264433eed56fe	cloud robotics in smart manufacturing environments: challenges and countermeasures		In Smart Manufacturing Environments (SME), the use of cloud robotics is based on the integration of cloud computing and industrial robots, which provides a new technological approach to task execution and resource sharing compared to traditional industrial robots. However, research on cloud robotics in SME still faces some challenges. First, highly flexible load scheduling mechanisms are immature. Second, traditional optimization mechanisms for the network service quality do not meet the requirements of smart manufacturing due to time variability and service quality dynamics. And, finally, existing learning algorithms used without cloud-assisted resources cause great resource wasting. Accordingly, this paper explores main technologies related to cloud robotics in SME. The research contents include self-adaptive adjustment mechanisms for the service quality of a cloud robot network, computing load allocation mechanisms for cloud robotics, and group learning based on a cloud platform. The results presented in this paper are helpful to understand the internal mechanisms of perception and interaction, intelligent scheduling and control of cloud robot systems oriented to smart manufacturing, and the design of a cloud architecture oriented to group learning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the others, RESERVOIR, VISION Cloud and CloudWave are three interesting examples of how infrastructures and data can be managed in an effective way and how applications can adapt to the infrastructure, and the infrastructure to the services requested, in order to improve the overall quality of the service provided. From our experience in these three successful projects, we show in this paper how they try to address the challenges described above, providing an important boost to making the future internet vision concrete.

We are looking into possibilities to create long-term persistency of both the deposited data and the services operating on this data. Challenges, both technical and non-technical, that need to be solved are the need to replicate more than just the data, proper identification of the digital objects in a distributed environment by making use of persistent identifiers and the set-up of a proper authentication and authorization domain including the management of the authorization information on the digital objects. We acknowledge the investment that most language resource centers have made in their current infrastructure. Therefore one of the most important requirements is the loose coupling with existing infrastructures without the need to make many changes. This shift from a single language resource center into a federated environment of many language resource centers is discussed in the context of a real world center: The Language Archive supported by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.	archive;authentication;authorization;loose coupling;persistent identifier;requirement;self-replication	Willem Elbers;Daan Broeder;Dieter Van Uytvanck	2012			natural language processing;speech recognition	PL	-47.18736761158141	52.028506930398564	80746

Data sources that can be used to automatically determine the current location of data processing could help cloud users to ful fill their duty and to strengthen the confidence in a privacy friendly processing of their personal data. For that, data location metrics need to be defined, appropriate data sources need to be determined and the measured data need to be combined reasonable.

Currently, each Web application stores its own user data. This not only burdens the applications with storing, managing, and securing user data but also deprives users from controlling their own data. With recent proposals of secure client-side cross-domain communication mechanisms, we can provide an independent file system service to Web applications. This service returns the control over user data back to the users, where users can share or restrict access to their files as they wish, and relieves web application servers from the contractual or regulatory obligation of safeguarding user data.	application server;client-side;posix;web 2.0;web application;world wide web	Francis Hsu;Hao Chen	2009		10.1145/1655008.1655011	web service;web application security;static web page;web development;web application;data web;web design;computer science;stub file;web api;ws-policy;ssh file transfer protocol;web navigation;web log analysis software;web page;database;open;internet privacy;data file;web 2.0;world wide web;web server;application server;mashup	OS	-47.337799024090586	58.86715325226145	80894

Several intelligent services are available due to the universal acceptance and implementation of the comprehensive GSM standard. However these services lack context which is the need of the modern times. With the development of computer-based location tracking systems and sensor systems a large amount of contextual information is easily available. This paper proposes the incorporation of context- aware services in the GSM networks. The architecture discussed in the paper explains gathering contextual information and facilitates the discovery, selection and execution of these services on a GSM-enabled mobile device.	context-aware network;desktop computer;entity;location awareness;most bus;middleware;mobile device;tracking system	Saira Parvez Khan;Shoab Ahmed Khan;Sana Ismaeel;Zaheer Ahmed;Muhammad Akbar	2007	2007 International Conference on Mobile Data Management	10.1109/MDM.2007.65	service provider;gsm;intelligent network;unstructured supplementary service data;computer science;telecommunications service;operating system;mobile device;customised applications for mobile networks enhanced logic;services computing;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network;service data point	Mobile	-39.218566935033856	50.07424713485565	80905

In order to reduce the complexity and cost of the application development, we propose a device-independent formalization of the pass-by rendezvous of mobile entities in this paper. Specifically, we first define a pass-by rendezvous as a phenomenon, where two mobile entities are closed enough at a certain time. We then derive four properties from the definition to be satisfied within any pass-by systems. The properties allow indirect pass-by rendezvous between mobile entities with different devices. Finally, we apply the proposed method to two different practical systems (Bluetooth Low Energy and GPS). In the case study, we see how the pass-by rendezvous can be implemented in each system, and see how the indirect rendezvous across the two systems can be inferred using the proposed properties.	bluetooth;entity;global positioning system	Arisa Hayashi;Sachio Saiki;Seiki Tokunaga;Shinsuke Matsumoto;Masahide Nakamura	2015	2015 10th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies (APSITT)	10.1109/APSITT.2015.7217096	embedded system;mobile search;simulation;engineering;mobile computing;computer security	Mobile	-39.50121018765338	50.268062617361366	81017

These user devices foster a needs for tasks migration from one device to another device at runtime, making it easier for the user to continue his task on another device. For such a need, an architecture is proposed to design and develop applications that migrate from one device to another and resume its operation. A simple application was constructed based on the proposed framework. Experiments were carried out to demonstrate its applicability, and to support experimenting with, for example timestamping different parts of the migration process.	automatic control;experiment;hewlett-packard 200lx;internet;laptop;mobile device;mobile phone;osgi;personal computer;personal digital assistant;portable document format;run time (program lifecycle phase);tablet computer;ubiquitous computing	Aamir Saeed;Rasmus L.

Giving the client direct access to the storage servers requires verification that the client requests conform with the system protection policy. Today, the only available solutions enforce access control at the granularity of entire storage servers. This is an outcome of the way storage servers abstract storage: an array of fixed size blocks. The alternative approach of providing access control at the granularity of blocks is infeasible there are too many active blocks in the server. Object stores (r.g., the NASD system [7]) provide means to address these issues. An object store control unit presents an abstractio n of a dynamic collection of objects, each can be seen as a different array of blocks, thus providing the basis for providi ng protection at an object level. In this paper we present a security model for the object store which leverages on existing security infrastruc ture. We give a simple generic mechanism capable of enforcing an arbitrary access control policy at object granularity. This mechanism is specifically designed to achieve low overhead by minimizing the cost of validating an operation along the critical data path, and lends itself for optimizations such as caching. The key idea of the model is to separate the mechanisms for transport security from the one used for access control and to maximize the use standard security protocols when possible. We utilize a standar d industry protocol for authentication, integrity and priva cy on the communication channel (IPSec for IP networks) and define a proprietary protocol for authorization on top of the secure communication layer.	access control list;authentication;authorization;channel (communications);control unit;cylinder-head-sector;file server;ipsec;information privacy;network-attached secure disks;overhead (computing);proprietary protocol;random access;secure communication;server (computing);storage area network;system 7	Alain Azagury;Ran Canetti;Michael Factor;Shai Halevi;Ealan A.

6ea93130679b0c9828dc274fbe6dde7987009ec5	guest editorial circuit and system design automation for internet of things		Internet-of-Things (IoT) is the technical backbone of smart cities which are envisioned to cope up with rapid urbanization of human population with limited resources. IoT provides three key features of smart cities such as intelligence, interconnection, and instrumentation. IoT is essentially a system-of-systems which can be considered as a configurable dynamic global network of networks. The main components of IoT include the following: 1) The Things; 2) Internet; 3) LAN; and 4) The Cloud. IoT is built by various diverse components including electronics, sensors, actuators, controllers, networks, firmware, and software. However, the existing electronics, controllers, and processors do not meet IoT requirements, such as multiple sensors, communication protocols, and security requirements. The existing computer-aided design (CAD) or electronic design automation tools are not enough to meet diverse challenges such as time-to-market, complexity, and cost of IoT. The required electronic circuits and systems need to be developed by handling and solving specific requirements. Real-time and ultralow power plays a major role since mobile devices in the IoT have to provide a long availability with a relative small energy budget. At the same time, reliability, availability, real-time constraints, and performance requirements pose significant challenges, and therefore, lead to a high interest in research. In this special issue, different approaches to design novel devices, circuits, and systems for solving the challenges with IoT are targeted. Various novel design automation components including modeling, design flows, simulation methods, and optimizations for designing of modern IoT are targeted, from system level down to device level. The current special issue was envisioned with the above technical considerations. After a rigorous review process, a set of articles were selected for this special issue. These papers are briefly discussed in the rest of the editorial.	automation;internet of things	Saraju P.

Developers use local databases to provide mobile users with a responsive and secure service for data storage and access. However, using local databases comes with a cost. Studies have shown that they are one of the most energy consuming components on mobile devices and misuseof their APIs can lead to performance and security problems. In this paper, we report the results of a large scale empirical study on 1,000 top ranked apps from the Google Play app store. Our results present a detailed look into the practices, costs, and potential problems associated with local database usage in deployed apps. We distill our findings into actionable guidance for developers and motivate future areas of research related to techniques to support mobile app developers.	android;app store;best practice;code refactoring;computer data storage;data structure;database;mobile app;mobile device;parameter (computer programming);play store;sql;software engineering;structured query language interface	Yingjun Lyu;Jiaping Gui;Mian Wan;William G.

A few hundred milliseconds difference in the response time are enough for visitors to choose one page instead of its competitors. This paper describes the increasing demand for faster loading webpages and the need of methods for optimization of the web code in order to increase their speed. It describes the process of loading webpages in browser and lists several methods for front-end performance optimization. The understanding of the loading process allows the correct identification of the parts that can be affected and improved. It also helps for understanding the effect of these methods and the cases when they can be applied. Although the total effect of the optimization depends on the specific webpage the appliance of these rules does not only reduce the page loading speed but it also affects the total bandwidth and load of the web server.	internet;mathematical optimization;performance tuning;response time (technology);server (computing);software appliance;web page;web server	Ilian Iliev;Georgi Petrov Dimitrov	2014	2014 37th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859613	web service;embedded system;static web page;computer science;web api;front and back ends;web page;database;world wide web	DB	-34.11162941681453	55.11313827842694	81416

Nowadays users not only represent the final utilizers of the technology, but they actively contribute to its evolution by assuming different roles: they act as humans, by sharing contents and experiences through social networks, and as virtual sensors, by moving freely in the environment with their sensing devices. Smart cities represent an important reference scenario for the active participation of users through mobile technologies. It involves multiple application domains and defines different levels of user engagement. Participatory sensing, opportunistic sensing, and mobile social networks (MSNs) currently represent some of the most promising people-centric paradigms. In addition, their integration can further improve the user involvement through new services and applications. In this article we present SmartCitizen app, an MSN application designed in the framework of a smart city project to stimulate the active participation of citizens in generating and sharing useful contents related to the quality of life in their city. The app has been developed on top of a context- and social-aware middleware platform (CAMEO) able to integrate the main features of people-centric computing paradigms, lightening the app developer's effort. Existing middleware platforms generally focus on a single people-centric paradigm, exporting a limited set of features to mobile applications. CAMEO overcomes these limitations and, through Smart- Citizen, we highlight the advantages of implementing this type of mobile application in a smart city scenario. Experimental results shown in this article can also represent the technical guidelines for the development of heterogeneous people-centric mobile applications embracing different application domains.	application domain;middleware;mobile app;mobile social network;participatory sensing;pervasive informatics;programming paradigm;sensor;smart city;the quality of life	Franca Delmastro;Valerio Arnaboldi;Marco Conti	2016	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2016.7509389	mobile search;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;operating system;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network	HCI	-41.221573621903126	50.62767522247982	82613

Since the declaration of this vision in the late 90s, a significant number of DE data-sets have been created by the industry, governments, non-governmental organisations and individuals. An overwhelming majority of the successful applications that use DE data-sets has its end-user applications running on the desktop. While these applications are great tools, they remain inaccessible to the community as a whole. In this paper, we present a framework for the development of cyber-applications.

As the field is at an early stage of development, there is still a lot of uncertainty about which of available wireless technologies will lead to the most successful solutions. Cellular networks, near field communication, infrared and Bluetooth are analysed in terms of their suitability for mobile payments. This paper tries to find out which of these technologies can lead to systems that the user will be most likely to accept. Acceptance factors discovered in the author's previous research are used in this analysis: perceived ease of use, usefulness, mobility, trust and cost. The study reveals which of the technologies are likely to best fulfil each of the acceptance criteria.	bluetooth;chi;mobile device;mobile payment;near field communication;usability	Agnieszka Zmijewska	2005	International Conference on Mobile Business (ICMB'05)	10.1109/ICMB.2005.38	mobile broadband;radio access network;mobile identification number;mobile search;3g;mobile web;imt advanced;public land mobile network;wireless application protocol;engineering;mobile technology;mobile radio telephone;location-based service;mobile business development;internet privacy;mobile station;mobile computing;computer security;computer network;mobile payment	Mobile	-38.52832541269782	55.65088620370949	84242

Over the years, we have seen a variety of OSes emerging in the sensornet community to facilitate developing WSN applications. Aside from the basic system implementations, there is also a large body of work devoted to improving OS capabilities in different dimensions. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing work in sensornet OS design. We first examine the challenges in the OS design space. We then introduce the major components of a sensornet OS. Next, we provide an overview of existing work, present a taxonomy of state-of-the-art OSes, and discuss various approaches to address the design challenges. Finally we discuss evaluations of a sensornet OS and present some recommendations from the perspectives of OS developers and OS users. We have also identified several open problems that need further investigation to make the OS provide stronger support for WSNs.	distributed computing;graph coloring;habitat;operating system;scalability;sensor;taxonomy (general)	Wei Dong;Chun Chen;Xue Liu;Jiajun Bu	2010	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/SURV.2010.032610.00045	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;computer security;taxonomy;computer network	Mobile	-38.512694572171036	46.81667475635782	84280

Exposing or sharing personal information to these communities has risks as well as benefits and there is always a challenge between the risks versus the benefits of using these technologies. Life-logs are pervasive tools or systems which sense and capture contextual information from the user’s environment in a continuous manner. A life-log produces a dataset which consists of a continuous streams of sensor data. Sharing this information has a wide range of advantages for both user and society. On the other side, in terms of individual privacy, life-log information is very sensitive. In this paper, first we list risks and benefits of sharing life-log information. Although social medias enable users to define share limitation for their information, but because of the life-log data structure, current sharing models are not capable of handling life-log information while maintaining user privacy. Therefore, based on the identified risks we propose a data model for sharing life-log information. This data model has been designed for life-logs and it tries to reduce the associated risks. Furthermore, ethics for providing and using life-log tools will be discussed. These ethics focus on reducing risks as much as possible while sharing life-log information.	capability maturity model;data model;data structure;online community;operational system;personally identifiable information;pervasive informatics;privacy;social media;social network	Reza Rawassizadeh	2012	Behaviour & IT	10.1080/0144929X.2010.510208	personally identifiable information;social media;data structure;information privacy;data model;computer science;knowledge management;group information management;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;lifelog;social computing	HCI	-43.09828276837343	60.155395862959416	84393

One popular example are pervasive mobile multiplayer games, where interactions with other users or physical objects in the real world are part of the gameplay. This induces a notion of locality, as a user's actions affect other nearby users. However, this locality in the interaction is not reflected in the underlying communication system. Events triggered by users are sent via the cellular connection to a remote data center, where they are processed and then distributed to other players, again via the cellular link. In this work, we demonstrate an event dissemination system that utilizes the available local communication interfaces of today's smartphones to distribute events in groups of nearby players. The system executes transitions between different communication interfaces (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct) and the utilized dissemination protocol depending on the size and density of the group of players, thereby exploiting the characteristics of the chosen interface. Attendees can experience the resulting benefits in terms of latency and update frequency by playing our mobile pervasive multiplayer game TowerWorld at the venue.	bluetooth;data center;interaction;locality of reference;pervasive informatics;sensor;smartphone;venue (sound system)	Björn Richerzhagen;Marc Schiller;Max Lehn;Denis Lapiner;Ralf Steinmetz	2015	2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2015.7158179	games;communications protocol;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;bluetooth;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-39.070995447557564	51.322112897392486	84547

Role assignment in TCAC is based on the trustworthiness and context information of users. The TCAC model is flexible, scalable, and well suitable for the dynamic and distributed systems. Then we provide a trust evaluation mechanism based on the local and global reputation to compute the trust value of a user in distributed system, which can avoid malicious nodes behave correctly in order to get the highest possible trust value. Finally an implementation framework of the access control system based on TCAC is described.	computer access control;control system;distributed computing;malware;requirement;role-based access control;scalability;security assertion markup language;trust (emotion);xacml;xml	Fujun Feng;Chuang Lin;Dongsheng Peng;Junshan Li	2008	2008 10th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications	10.1109/HPCC.2008.37	computer science;information security;authorization;internet privacy;open system;world wide web;computer security	DB	-45.635943897250996	55.91014461369798	84617

The primary motivation for the work comes from the authors’ research into the development of grid-enabled healthcare systems (or health grids). Indeed, we would argue that if the e-Health dream is to become reality, then there is a clear need for web services that enable remote access to medical data to be secured in an appropriate fashion. We compare our approach of wrapping web services with alternative approaches based on generic SOAP proxies. As an illustrative example we describe how the OGSA-DAI grid services have been secured via XACML-based access control policies. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Current models for IoT are focused heavily on developing vertical solutions limited by hardware and software platforms and support. With the estimated explosion of IoT in the coming years as predicted by Cisco, IBM and Gartner, there is a need to rethink how IoT can deliver value to the end-user. A paradigm shift is required in the underlying fundamentals of current IoT developments to enable a wider notion of """"thing"""" discovery as well as discovery of relevant data and context on the IoT. Discovery will allow users to build IoT apps, services and applications using """"smart things"""" without the need for a priori knowledge of things.

This paper first analyzed several trust models used in large and distributed environment and then introduced a novel cloud trust model to solve security issues in cross-clouds environment in which cloud customer can choose different providers’ services and resources in heterogeneous domains can cooperate. The model is domain-based. It divides one cloud provider’s resource nodes into the same domain and sets trust agent. It distinguishes two different roles cloud customer and cloud server and designs different strategies for them. In our model, trust recommendation is treated as one type of cloud services just like computation or storage. The model achieves both identity authentication and behavior authentication. The results of emulation experiments show that the proposed model can efficiently and safely construct trust relationship in cross-clouds environment.	authentication;cloud computing;computation;emulator;entity;experiment;interoperability;prototype;server (computing);simulation;testbed;virtual private server	Wenjuan Li;Lingdi Ping	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10665-1_7	cloud computing security;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;role;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computational trust;distributed computing environment	Web+IR	-46.79170261563829	55.49522172248129	85688

However accessing complex applications is time consuming on devices with limited capabilities. Moreover, the communication between these applications is a frequent and valueless action which is currently managed by the end-user himself, by getting data from an application and putting it into another. In this paper we propose a web based framework for application integration. This framework first hides the heterogeneity of accessing devices from the service providers and then facilitates the usage of enterprise applications, by enabling simple communication (e.g. by drag&drop) between independent and heterogeneous services. We rely within this framework on the widget concept, where a widget gives access to a single functionality of an enterprise application. This enables to reuse the widget user interfaces in various contexts.	drag and drop;enterprise software;pervasive informatics;user interface	Nassim Laga;Emmanuel Bertin;Noël Crespi	2009		10.1145/1568199.1568232	service provider;embedded system;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;user interface;world wide web	OS	-37.531534464887685	48.86500451165019	86157
6cc1c508e22d9b4cc8d96aa8a632cd5d7ebcb5f4	xsacd - cross-domain resource sharing & access control for smart environments	service oriented architectures;web services;ubiquitous computing;authorization;access control	Abstract Computing devices permeate working and living environments, affecting all aspects of modern everyday lives; a trend which is expected to intensify in the coming years. In the residential setting, the enhanced features and services provided by said computing devices constitute what is typically referred to as a “smart home”. However, the direct interaction smart devices often have with the physical world, along with the processing, storage and communication of data pertaining to users’ lives, i.e. private sensitive in nature, bring security concerns into the limelight. The resource-constraints of the platforms being integrated into a smart home environment, and their heterogeneity in hardware, network and overlaying technologies, only exacerbate the above issues. This paper presents XSACd, a cross-domain resource sharing u0026 access control framework for smart environments, combining the well-studied fine-grained access control provided by the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) with the benefits of Service Oriented Architectures, through the use of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS). Based on standardized technologies, it enables seamless interactions and fine-grained policy-based management of heterogeneous smart devices, including support for communication between distributed networks, via the associated MQ Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT)–based proxies. The framework is implemented in full, and its performance is evaluated on a test bed featuring relatively resource-constrained smart platforms and embedded devices, verifying the feasibility of the proposed approach.	access control;smart environment	Konstantinos Fysarakis;Othonas Soultatos;Charalampos Manifavas;Ioannis Papaefstathiou;Ioannis G.

These bene ts are enhanced if the groups are organized in a hierarchy (partial order) by the subgroup relation , where g h signi es that every member of group g is thereby also a member of group h. It is often useful to distinguish the case when g is an immediate subgroup of h, that is when g h and there is no group k such that g k h. The class of partial orders called ntrees was recently de ned by using rooted trees and inverted rooted trees as basic partial orders and combining these recursively by re nement [12]. It has been shown that ntrees arise naturally in many practical situations and they have a simple representation. Any ntree hierarchy can be expressed as the intersection of two linear orderings. So it is possible to assign a pair of integers l[x] and r[x] to each group x such that g h if and only if l[g] l[h] and r[g] r[h]. In this paper we show how to extend this representation of ntrees by assigning four additional integers to each group so that it is also easily determined whether or not g is an immediate subgroup of h.	access control;recursion	Ravi S.

dcaa085a219c2860dfb133c84f6336b7ed81e481	on-the-fly computing meets iot markets — towards a reference architecture		The Internet of Things (IoT) connects the things of our everyday life and supports usin our common activities. Several markets for IoT services have been created. These markets enable IoT users to search and compose services in order to support an IoT activity. However, existing IoT markets like IFTTT (If This Then That) are not convenient for users with respect to service discovery and composition. The objective of On-the-fly (OTF) computing is to configure and provide software markets that fulfill individual users' wishes by the automatic on-the-fly composition of single services. The architecture framework of On-the-fly computing markets helps architects to systematically develop these systems in different domains. In this paper, we use our OTF architectural framework to examine the requirements of a reference architecture for IoT markets. Furthermore, we perform a comparison between the architecture of IFTTT as an existing IoT market with this reference architecture. The results show how existing IoT markets can be improved. In return, the practical knowledge of IFTTT is taken to the reference architecture. This knowledge helps to overcome the limitations of today's IoT markets or creating new markets in the future.	enterprise architecture framework;ifttt;internet of things;qualitative comparative analysis;reference architecture;requirement;semantic matching;service discovery	Bahar Jazayeri;Simon Schwichtenberg	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture Workshops (ICSAW)	10.1109/ICSAW.2017.59	on the fly;service discovery;computer security;software;reference architecture;architecture;architecture framework;distributed computing;internet of things;engineering	Mobile	-42.81454713710955	46.57846622196284	86477

As the utilization of cloud resources extends beyond a single provider, for reasons including fault-tolerance and performance, the issue of effectively managing such resources comes to the fore. Different providers expose different interfaces to their compute resources utilizing varied architectures and implementation technologies. This heterogeneity poses a significant system management problem, and can limit the extent to which the benefits of cross-cloud resource utilization can be realized. We address this problem through the definition of an architecture to facilitate the management of compute resources from different cloud providers in an homogenous manner. This preserves the flexibility and adaptability promised by the cloud computing paradigm, whilst enabling the benefits of cross-cloud resource utilization to be realized. The practical efficacy of the architecture is demonstrated through an implementation utilizing compute resources managed through different interfaces on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. Additionally, we provide empirical results highlighting the performance differential of these different interfaces, and discuss the impact of this performance differential on efficiency and profitability. © 2009 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.

ad3555d02b6067d973c9daf84951e7fe042c79bb	an architecture for a mobility recommender system in smart cities	iot;mobility;multimodal routing;smart cities;recommendation systems	To date, there is a wide availability of academic and commercial ICT proposals to improve urban mobility. Nevertheless, in the literature, there is still a lack of suitable solutions for door-to-door routing supporting users from their origins to destinations and including the suggestion on where to park. On the other hand, in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenario, a lot of novel information sources could be exploited to compute more efficient mobility solutions to be proposed to the user. As an example, parking availability data could be easily collected and exploited to provide multimodal routes (i.e. routes with at least two different means of transportation) that include suggestions on where to park and how to reach the final destination. In this paper, we describe a distributed IoT architecture towards the definition of a Mobility Recommender System. In particular, we focus on a car-based multimodality, where the user always starts a trip with his/her private vehicle, but he/she can also leave the car in Park-and-Ride infrastructures and reach the destination with public transportation. This type of routing on a wider search area will result to be more costly, and thus, it will particularly benefit from a parallel computational architectural solution.	recommender system;smart city	Sergio Di Martino;Silvia Rossi	2016		10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.066	simulation;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;internet of things	ML	-43.23295004640211	51.57871435334426	86840

However, with the growth of heterogeneous devices IoT introduce a pressure of massive amount of heterogeneous data, which makes it very important to explore the methods and tools to strengthen the IoT to intelligently deal with the incremental massive amounts of data. Towards that, this paper presents an IoT edge-based method to enable intelligent IoT entity connectivity for smart data provision, called smart data mobility. The presented method enables the IoT to perceive and learn from the environments, based on which to let the IoT entities interact with each other in a self-evolvable way for data sharing, in responding to the dynamically changing environments. The presented intelligence enablers for IoT can support smart services and digitalized functionalities from different domains and in different purposes, via strengthening the entities' connectivity with self-evolvable interaction relations to support the efficient and smart data exchanging.	artificial neural network;autonomy;data-intensive computing;distributed computing;entity;internet of things;interoperability;knowledge base;recursion;sdb (debugger);smart environment;trust management (information system);usb hub;web service	Bin Xiao	2017		10.1145/3109761.3109789	computer network;computer science;artificial neural network;big data;data sharing;internet of things;smart environment	AI	-42.88298349869387	47.87589392199938	87229

80e1f9ef3785214ae0c96e5309255ac5a2d3237e	let's get physical: adding physical dimensions to cyber systems.		Technology advances are creating major shifts in the industrial landscape. Traditional sectors such as transportation, medical and avionics, are witnessing fundamental changes in the supply chain and in the content where the interactions between the physical world and the computing world are becoming increasingly tight. Cyber Physical Systems, Systems of Systems, Internet of Things, Industrie 4.0, Swarm Systems and The Fog are all sectors that attract massive attention from the research communities and massive investment from industry. These concepts are tightly intertwined and describe a movement towards a fully interconnected planet where billions of devices interact via a complex mesh of wireless and wired communication infrastructures. The most compelling vision for the future of technology and industry is one where a swarm of devices is connected with the cloud to provide platforms for myriad of new applications. In this new world, new companies will arise and established ones will have to change radically their business model. The increasing sophistication and heterogeneity of these systems requires radical changes in the way sense-and-control platforms are designed to regulate them. In this presentation, I highlight some of the design challenges due to the complexity, heterogeneity and power consumption of CPS. Indeed, low power consumption is an essential requirement for the swarm of devices especially in the domain of wearable devices for healthcare. Coupled with low cost and reliability, power consumption has to be taken into consideration for any CPS deployment.		Alberto L.

For the very first time, supply chain participants thus need to face the automatic exchange of event data with business partners. Data protection of sensitive business secrets is therefore the major aspect that needs to be clarified before companies will start to adopt EPCglobal networks. This book contributes to this proposition as follows: it defines the design of transparent real-time security extensions for EPCglobal networks based on in-memory technology. For that, it defines authentication protocols for devices with low computational resources, such as passive RFID tags, and evaluates their applicability. Furthermore, it outlines all steps for implementing history-based access control for EPCglobal software components, which enables a continuous control of access based on the real-time analysis of the complete query history and a fine-grained filtering of event data. The applicability of these innovative data protection mechanisms is underlined by their exemplary integration in the FOSSTRAK architecture.	real-time transcription	Matthieu-P.

It provides features such as identity provisioning, identity federation, profile management, user-oriented group management, and branded web interfaces that are important to many e-Science applications. Globus Nexus implements best practices approaches for each of these features for example using delegated security protocols such as OAuth, provides sophisticated workflows for actions such as email validation, and implements complex user-defined policies regarding permissible actions. We present here Globus Nexus' capabilities, motivate design choices, and present results that characterize the scalability, reliability, and availability of its implementation and deployment.	best practice;e-science;email;identity provider;interaction;oauth;outsourcing;platform as a service;provisioning;requirement;scalability;software deployment;usb hub;user interface;web application	Kyle Chard;Mattias Lidman;Josh Bryan;Tom Howe;Brendan McCollam;Rachana Ananthakrishnan;Steven Tuecke;Ian T.

Smart heterogeneous sensor networks are well suited data sources for such environments, because they allow for dynamic adaptation to newly added sensor types and novel tasks. Realistic verification of protocols and algorithms for smart networks poses special constraints on testbeds, necessitating support for heterogeneous platforms and mobility in the network. These distinct requirements limit the usability of many known testbeds of purely homogeneous nature. In this paper, we determine a minimum set of premises for smart heterogeneous sensor network testbeds and evaluate existing architectures with respect to these requirements. We then present our tubicle node platform, an integrated sensor network node providing inherent support for heterogeneity and fulfilling the determined set of requirements in their entirety. A set of twenty tubicles forms the basis for our TWiNS.KOM testbed. Specifically designed for heterogeneity, the architecture allows rapid validation of smart sensor network algorithms and quick experimental setup.	algorithm;ambient intelligence;heterogeneous computing;requirement;smart transducer;testbed;usability	Andreas Reinhardt;Matthias Kropff;Matthias Hollick;Ralf Steinmetz	2008	2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2008.4664271	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-39.48175256922404	46.949199099860074	88600

It comprises an application server, at least one administrator module and many individual user modules. It involves a user-specific setup file of encoded security, task and document parameters generated by an administrator to authorize a user to perform a set of predefined tasks on a selected group of electronic contract documents. It also consists of a configure file generator for the user to select and configure authorized tasks from a set of predefined task modules of execution instructions. Then, its execution engine carries these instructions automatically in a secure environment based on the user's configuration file. Thus, this automation system substantially improves the efficiency, and at the same time eliminates the potential for human error and security breaches in the performance of electronic contract management and task process.	application server;authorization;contract management;human error;process architecture;secure environment;server (computing);system administrator	Thomas Kwok;Thao Nguyen	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on e-Technology, e-Commerce and e-Service	10.1109/EEE.2005.17	database;business;world wide web;computer security	DB	-48.057950679463644	59.456988436454736	89128

Information spaces provide a way to organize information, resources, and services around important privacy-relevant contextual factors. In this article, we describe a theoretical model for privacy control in context-aware systems based on a core abstraction of information spaces. We have previously focused on deriving socially based privacy objectives in pervasive computing environments. Building on Ravi Sandhu's four-layer OM-AM (objectives, models, architectures, and mechanisms) idea, we aim to use information spaces to construct a model for privacy control that supports our socially based privacy objectives.

Generally, Proximity awareness can be enabled with two methodologies: Over-The-Top (OTT), in which the centralized server determines the proximity based on users' location updates and interests, and intermediate the interactions between proximal users, Device-to-Device (D2D), which allows two devices in radio range to discovery and communicate directly. This paper designs and implements a novel hybrid interactive chatting system, HYChat, which integrates the merits of both methodologies: simultaneously support direct interaction through WiFi Direct when individuals are within each other's radio range, when detecting two devices are out of range of WiFi Direct (e.g., due to individual's movement), it will switch to online OTT mode automatically to continue the interactive chat. Specifically, two key challenges in HYChat are preliminarily solved in this paper: profile matching prior to establishing connection among devices (i.e., layer 2 profile matching), and the smooth switching between D2D and OTT modes. The prototype of HYChat on Android phones illustrates its effectiveness. In brief, the hybrid system HYChat could greatly facilitate individuals' social interaction in physical proximity.	android;centralized computing;hybrid system;interaction;mobile social network;prototype;sensor;server (computing)	Jinhang Zuo;Yufeng Wang;Qun Jin;Jianhua Ma	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart City/SocialCom/SustainCom (SmartCity)	10.1109/SmartCity.2015.115	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;world wide web	Mobile	-37.818282980282795	57.53421731060179	89710

Recent advances and trends, such as sensor systems, IoT, cloud computing, and data analytics, are making possible to pervasively, efficiently, and effectively collect data. However such pervasive data collection and the lack of security for IoT devices increase data privacy concerns.

MadApp allows web applications to be developed in two pieces. First, a static piece that contains unchanging content can be downloaded from a traditional web server. This static piece may specify “holes” that designate places in which dynamically collected content can be integrated into the web application as this content is opportunistically collected from the pervasive computing environment. MadApp supports both the development of these web applications by making is easy to specify this missing content and how it is dynamically integrated and the deployment of the web applications by providing middleware support for collecting and integrating content on the fly. This demonstration showcases how MadApp can be used to support such opportunistic web applications through a webpage integrated with the demonstration event itself. Users will be able to download a web page that contains a static map and a listing of the demonstrations. As users move through the demonstration space, they can generate content, e.g., photos of demonstrations, which their app will then share opportunistically with others in the exhibition space.	download;middleware;on the fly;server (computing);software deployment;ubiquitous computing;web application;web page;web server	Venkat Srinivasan;Christine Julien	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PERCOM WORKSHOPS)	10.1109/PerComW.2014.6815186	web service;ajax;web application security;embedded system;middleware;web development;web modeling;real-time computing;data web;web mapping;web-based simulation;web design;human–computer interaction;web accessibility initiative;web standards;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;web api;operating system;web navigation;web page;distributed computing;web 2.0;world wide web;ubiquitous computing;web server;mashup;computer network	Mobile	-37.537238141989945	47.54141529823754	89758
7a351aad06c7c2b3d1f799e993ed52eee0a1414b	privacy-respecting smart video surveillance based on usage control enforcement		The number of video surveillance deployments in publicly accessible spaces is continuously increasing. At the same time, the call for technical assistance of human operators in terms of so-called smart video surveillance system has been growing ever louder and is addressed by research and development. With such systems, video analysis algorithms for activity recognition, tracking, and biometric identification of persons become reality. While aiming to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of video surveillance, these developments coincidentally increase the diversity and intensity of intrusions into observed individuals privacy and the potential for misuse. Legal scholars agree that applicable data protection laws cannot sufficiently cover the technological evolution of smart video surveillance and demand further regulations. In this sense they expect that a lawful operation of smart video surveillance will require effective mechanisms for protecting privacy and preventing misuse. This research introduces a conceptual framework for lawful and privacyrespecting smart video surveillance, which enforces privacy-related constraints based on the current threat situation and the type of incident that has been detected. It thus constitutes the first approach towards situation-dependent smart video surveillance as opposed to adjusting the privacy level of disclosed data exclusively to the authorization levels of observers. This framework also increases the selectivity of smart video surveillance in terms of restricting data processing to individuals associated to an incident under investigation and in terms of data disclosure by means of enforcing privacy privileges for authenticated individuals or groups. Constraints are enforced by means of usage control technology, which is instantiated for video surveillance systems for the first time. Based on the proposed generic smart video surveillance architecture extended with usage control enforcement capabilities, smart video	activity recognition;algorithm;authentication;authorization;biometrics;closed-circuit television;information privacy;selectivity (electronic);video content analysis	Pascal Birnstill	2016			embedded system;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-45.32088962452373	59.63829851433762	90065

Social networking services on the Internet can use smartphones applications as data providers. The data gathered from sensors and data harvested from social networking services can be used by different applications for providing context-aware services. However, the excellence of the data oriented services depends on the Data quality (DQ). DQ is critical for decision making mechanisms. We present the problem related to DQ when dealing with social and sensor data. Also, we present and explore a framework whose objective is to evaluate and control DQ aspects when dealing with social and sensor data.	context-aware network;data quality;internet of things;programming paradigm;sensor;smartphone	Gabriel Rodrigues Caldas de Aquino;Claudio Miceli de Farias;Luci Pirmez	2018				HCI	-42.15475440239056	49.73600786521227	90387

When developing authorization concepts for virtual knowledge spaces, different boundary conditions have to be considered. Basically, we identify the specific requirements for the creation of coherent and intuitive rules to reduce the administrative complexity to a minimum and prevent mistakes. Furthermore we turn attention to flexibility of the authorization infrastructure as well as performance issues.

More recently, the cyber physical system (CPS) has emerged as a promising direction to enrich the interactions between physical and virtual worlds. In this article, we first review some research activities inWSN, including networking issues and coverage and deployment issues. Then,we review some CPS platforms and systems that have been developed recently, including health care, navigation, rescue, intelligent transportation, social networking, and gaming applications. Through these reviews, we hope to demonstrate how CPS applications exploit the physical information collected by WSNs to bridge real and cyber spaces and identify important research challenges related to CPS designs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

48a1146ef0f1be37b574288c307585e2ad65069d	security and privacy for innovative automotive applications: a survey		Abstract Software applications play an important role in vehicle innovation, aiming at improved safety, efficiency, and comfort, and creating the new areas of cooperative intelligent transport systems and autonomous vehicles. To accommodate modern applications, vehicles have become increasingly computerized and connected. Despite the benefits that the adoption of these applications bring to the automotive sector and consumers, automotive applications along with the enabling technological innovation open great challenges to security and privacy. Addressing these challenges is a prerequisite for the acceptance and deployment of innovative applications at a large scale. This survey investigates the main security and privacy challenges for the design of automotive applications and platforms. Based on the main security and privacy requirements and threats identified, we review existing protection mechanisms proposed within the automotive domain. We then identify the main gaps in existing research and draw a roadmap for future research.	privacy	Van Huynh Le;Jerry den Hartog;Nicola Zannone	2018	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2018.09.010	computer network;software deployment;computer science;systems engineering;software;intelligent transportation system;automotive industry	Crypto	-46.66890135633753	50.089086364565915	90953

However, due to the limitation of resources, efficient management of the large volume of WSNs data is an important issue to deal with. In recent years, Sensor Cloud (SC) infrastructure is introduced as an integration of cloud computing into WSNs to innovate a number of other new services. SC infrastructure is becoming popular that can provide an open, flexible, and reconfigurable platform for several monitoring and controlling applications. In this paper, we design and implement a smart surveillance system on top of sensor cloud infrastructure. For the real time alerts of the system, we define the architecture of a cloud gateway and propose a semantic filtering mechanism to extract the meaningful data from sensor data in WSNs. Through implementation of the smart surveillance system, we show the functionality and feasibility of our system.	cloud computing;reconfigurable computing;smart tv	Jaeseok Shim;Yujin Lim;Jaesung Park	2013		10.1145/2513228.2513320	embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;computer security	Mobile	-42.46855742412584	47.96288897469548	91014

To protect citizens’ privacy and to be compliant with legal requirements, surveillance video cannot generally be accessed in public places. However, a large amount of video data is often still required to provide timely services in these places. This work proposes a novel approach to support a developer to improve the service access to surveillance video. Firstly, a mobile web middleware architecture for the development of context-awareness applications, using NFC (Near Field Communication) and a new framework for NFC utilization by analyzing and constructing a service model, are proposed. Based on them, the efficient support for acquiring, interpreting and accessing contexts is provided, and more advanced applications with context-awareness and adaptability to their changing contexts are allowed. Moreover, a privacy-aware approach for video communication in our middleware is proposed. Symmetric key encryption and public-key encryption techniques are used to ensure privacy information security. A real-time scrambling approach to conceal video information is presented. Finally, we present the design and the implementation of the context-aware middleware and validate the expressiveness of application logics through prototype development.	authentication;closed-circuit television;context awareness;domain-specific language;encryption;information security;interoperability;middleware;mobile device;near field communication;privacy;prototype;public-key cryptography;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;service layer;symbian;symmetric-key algorithm;type-length-value	Jie Shen;Ying-Jue Cai;Lei Luo	2014	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-014-2036-9	computer science;operating system;middleware;internet privacy;near field communication;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-44.277148355938166	59.03885262744512	91057

By converting our cities into smart ones, we enable future generations to live in a friendly and sustainable environment. Within smart cities, the wide deployment of sensors allows the interaction of citizens with city infrastructures. While smart cities are aiming towards more efficient resource management via smart grids, smart vehicles etc, another approach can also be made. The wide deployment of sensors in smart cities can be used to provide citizens with better medical services. In this work, we illustrate how this can be achieved by allowing patients to interact with city sensors. Patients with respiration problems use their smart phones to find the route to their destination with the minimal effect on their health.	sensor;smart city;smartphone;software deployment	Constantinos Patsakis;Riccardo Venanzi;Paolo Bellavista;Agusti Solanas;Mélanie Bouroche	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)	10.1109/MeMeA.2014.6860145	simulation;engineering;advertising;computer security;internet of things	Mobile	-41.93744412203802	51.7560114991001	91132

However, the autonomous, heterogeneous, and decentralized nature of participating peers introduces the following challenge for resource sharing: how to make peers profitable in the untrusted P2P environment? To address the problem, we present a self-policing and distributed approach by combining two models: PET, a personalized trust model, and M-CUBE, a multiple-currency based economic model, to lay a foundation for resource sharing in untrusted P2P computing environments. PET is a flexible trust model that can adapt to different requirements, and provides the solid support for the currency management in M-CUBE. M-CUBE provides a novel self-policing and quality-aware framework for the sharing of multiple resources, including both homogeneous and heterogeneous resources. We evaluate the efficacy and performance of this approach in the context of a real application, a peer-to-peer Web server sharing. Our results show that our approach is flexible enough to adapt to different situations and effective to make the system profitable, especially for systems with large scale.	autonomous robot;dependability;distributed computing;high-level programming language;model m keyboard;next-generation network;norm (social);peer-to-peer;personalization;polyethylene terephthalate;programming paradigm;quality of service;requirement;server (computing);trust (emotion);web server	Zhengqiang Liang;Weisong Shi	2005	MONET	10.1007/s11036-005-4453-5	cooperative;shared resource;computer science;knowledge management;economic model;peer-to-peer;distributed computing;computer security;profitability index;computer network	HPC	-35.268728723945145	57.25550792367694	91796

Because network criteria are still undergoing development, the LAN will be evaluated under the TCSEC [2] criteria for multi-level secure computer systems. The remainder of the paper briefly describes the LAN itself, the policy model and its Gypsy representation,and FTLS. This is followed by a discussion of related issues such as covert channel analysis. The conclusions will cover both the applicability of the TCSEC criteria to network products such as this and the use of such products as building blocks for distributed semre systems.	computer security model;covert channel;distributed computing;experiment;formal methods;ian cullimore;multilevel security;prototype;software release life cycle;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;verdix	John McHugh;Andrew P.

As increased penetration leverages mobile application business opportunities, it is crucial to identify methodologies to fit mobile-specific demands. Regularity is one of the important measures to enclose  easy-come, easy-go mobile users. It is known that a user with multiple visits in one day with a long interval has a larger revisiting possibility in the following month than the others. The author proposes a 4+1 bit method to incorporate this empirical law in order to cope with the two major mobile restrictions: distributed server environments and large data stream. The proposed method can be performed in a one-path manner with 32-bit word boundary-aware memory compaction. The experimental result shows the method is promising to identify revisiting users under mobile-specific constraints.

054636306ddd650ce8164a144cb6e87e9c1163ff	bluewave: enabling opportunistic context sharing via bluetooth device names	ubiquitous computing;mobile interaction	"""Context-aware applications oftentimes require devices to share a user's context in order to provide them with relevant information and services. However, current context-sharing techniques require significant amounts of setup before they can be used, making them cumbersome when devices need to share information once or spontaneously. To address this problem, we present Bluewave, a Bluetooth-based technique that allows devices to opportunistically share context when they are nearby. With Bluewave, devices upload context to a trusted server, and extend their Bluetooth name with a URL and a set of temporary credentials. Other devices can obtain this information via Bluetooth discovery, and use it to request and receive context without having to pair. Bluewave provides a simple but effective way for users to share context through their mobile devices, supporting applications where the environment needs to collect information about the user. Our system's design has been guided by user feedback, and integrates privacy controls to let users manage how their context is being shared. In this paper, we describe Bluewave's architecture, and show how it can be used to create a wide range of """"just in time"""" services. We argue that Bluewave's low battery consumption, combined with its speed and compatibility with existing devices, significantly reduces the cost of sharing context, and provides a practical way to create, deploy, and prototype a new generation of context-aware applications."""	bluetooth;credential;just-in-time compilation;mobile device;privacy;prototype;server (computing);upload	Adrian A. de Freitas;Michael Nebeling;Akshaye Shreenithi Kirupa Karthikeyan Ranithangam;Junrui Yang;Anind K.

Especially rule based access control systems provide the capabilities to define and enforce expressive, fine grained access rights or restrictions respectively. In the first part of the presentation GeoXACML, a standardised spatial access control language, will be presented and it will be demonstrated that GeoXACML based access control systems can meet the access control specific requirements in OGC Web Service based SDIs. Having powerful, complex access control policies in place introduces a new challenge. It is essential that the policy defining the semantics of an access control system can be easily and securely administrated. In the second part of the presentation it will be highlighted how to administrate complex GeoXACML policies. A very general and powerful administrative model, the Layered Administration Model (LAM), will be introduced. The LAM intends to support an easy, distributed and hierarchical administration of complex spatial access control policies as found in SDIs.	access control;control system;geoxacml;requirement;web service	Jan M.

This raises several issues to solve in this field, most notably the ones regarding interoperability between various devices. To ease Machine-to-Machine communication, new data models must be created to explicitly describe devices and their capabilities in a standardized way.

The problem is compounded further by the availability of a wide range of end user devices such as desktops, notebooks, tablets and smartphones. To provide a consistent and uniform Quality of Experience to the end user, we propose a contextaware service adaptation framework in this paper. The basic idea is to monitor the user and network context and leverage this information for adapting services to match the device and network characteristics.

Connections are usually made through wireless networks. However, wireless networks cannot guarantee connectivity and their bandwidth can be highly constrained. This paper presents a robust event-based data distribution mechanism for mobile augmented reality and virtual environments. It is based on replicated databases, pluggable networking protocols, and communication channels. The mechanism is demonstrated in the Battlefield Augmented Reality System (BARS) situation awareness system, composed of several mobile augmented reality systems, immersive and desktop-based virtual reality systems, a 2D mapbased multimodal system, handheld PCs, and other sources of information such as external data servers.	algorithm;augmented reality;communications protocol;database;desktop computer;handheld game console;information system;multimodal interaction;requirement;virtual reality	Dennis G.

9f11f1b7a1cfc250e2885cae7c58a2b268d79069	a novel sustainable interchain network framework for blockchain		The traditional online data exchanges are processed through the third-parties’ support. However, such mode is facing the problem on personal privacy disclosure and relate issues. Blockchain has been proposed as a promising diagram as the new approach for data organization and management, especially for the online data exchanges. It can provide reliable and credible service for business and related requirements as the decentralization technology. The blockchain network itself is always the focus of the whole system for it’s the foundation of all the services. When more than one blockchains is proposed to provide different services for different using environments, it is becoming a challenge on how to exchange the data between the different blockchains. In this paper, we provide the design of unitary, which a novel sustainable interchain network framework for blockchain. Unitary Interchain Network is a network consists of infinite parallel global blockchain networks. It is a distributed P2P network of decentralized networks.

Along with their rising acceptance comes the need for well suited security components. In this respect, access control and privacy emerged to crucial factors. Targeting the demands of a SOA, many promising authorization models have been developed, most notably the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model. In this paper we take up concepts from the OASIS XACML and WS-XACML specifications and introduce a dynamic ABAC system that incorporates privacy preferences of the service requestor in the access control process. Separating the Policy Decision Point from the service provider’s premises, our infrastructure enables the deployment of alternative PDPs the service requestor can choose from.

However, since users continuously request queries to LBS server by using their exact locations, their privacy information is always in danger. Because the existing techniques provide user's privacy protection operating on centralized system, an anonymizer suffers from performance degradation and security problem. Therefore, a mechanism based on distributed system for users' privacy protection is required for the safe and comfortable use of LBSs by mobile users. For this, we, in this paper, propose a grid-based cloaking scheme for continuous query processing in Distributed systems. The proposed scheme stores information and performs operations in distributed manner to create a cloaking area. In addition, the proposed scheme uses aggregate nodes to prevent query issuers' bottleneck. Through performance analysis, we show that our cloaking scheme outperforms the existing centralized cloaking schemes in terms of service time.	aggregate data;bottleneck (engineering);centralized computing;dbpedia;database;distributed computing;elegant degradation;location-based service;profiling (computer programming);server (computing);terms of service	Hyeong-Il Kim;Young-Sung Shin;Jae-Woo Chang	2011	2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2011.87	computer science;operating system;location-based service;database;distributed computing;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network	DB	-38.65723579530424	60.09600058315032	94224

In the same period the upcoming combination of Service-oriented Architectures and Web Service technology demonstrated a way to realize open standardized, flexible, service component based, loosely coupled and interoperable cross domain enterprise software solutions. But those solutions have been too resource-intensive and complex to be applicable for limited devices like wireless sensor nodes or small-sized embedded systems. Thus, more and more research investigations have been launched to bring the aspect of cross domain interoperability to the field of embedded battery powered devices. The proposed laboratory assistance solution in this paper demonstrates the benefits of Web Service enabled WSNs for process monitoring and disaster management by extending an existing system in the Life Science Automation domain.

We have developed a web-based infrastructure called Sensor.Network for storing, sharing, searching, visualizing and analyzing data from heterogeneous devices and facilitating easy interaction amongst devices and with end users through an open, REST-based API. Such a data-exchange can enhance our understanding of the world around us and offer valuable insights for tackling a wide range of issues-from global ones like sustainable resource management to local ones like improving rush-hour traffic flow. The design and implementation of a service like this raises several questions: What are the right data abstractions? How should one balance ease of sharing with privacy concerns? What are effective mechanisms for searching, visualizing and analyzing data? How can one facilitate data-centric collaboration and the composition of loosely-coupled “mashups” between sensors and actuators (e.g. a humidity sensor from one vendor controlling a sprinkler system from another). This paper describes the design choices we made in addressing many of these questions and the rationale behind them.

With the explosion of big data and advent of cloud computing, data analytics has not only become prevalent but also a critical business need. Internet applications today consume vast amounts of data collected from heterogeneous big data repositories and provide meaningful insights from it. These include applications for business forecasting, investment and finance, healthcare and well-being, science and hi-tech, to name a few. Security and operational intelligence is one of the critical areas where big data analytics is expected to play a crucial role. Security analytics in a big data environment presents a unique set of challenges, not properly addressed by the existing security incident and event monitoring (or SIEM) systems that typically work with a limited set of traditional data sources (firewall, IDS, etc.) in an enterprise network. A big data environment presents both a great opportunity and a challenge due to the explosion and heterogeneity of the potential data sources that extend the boundary of analytics to social networks, real time streams and other forms of highly contextual data that is characterized by high volume and speed. In addition to meeting infrastructure challenges, there remain additional unaddressed issues, including but not limited to development of self-evolving threat ontologies, integrated network and application layer analytics, and detection of """"low and slow"""" attacks. At the same time, security analytics requires a high degree of data assurance, where assurance implies that the data be trustworthy as well as managed in a privacy preserving manner. Our panelists represent individuals from industry, academia, and government who are at the forefront of big data security analytics. They will provide insights into these unique challenges, survey the emerging trends, and lay out a vision for future."""	big data;cloud computing;data security;event monitoring;firewall (computing);microsoft forefront;ontology (information science);security information and event management;social network;threat model	Rafae Bhatti;Ryan LaSalle;Rob Bird;Tim Grance;Elisa Bertino	2012		10.1145/2295136.2295148	limit set;analytics;big data;cloud computing;computer science;information security;data mining;data security;business intelligence;internet privacy;software analytics;privacy;world wide web;computer security;social network;data collection	DB	-44.75221517431526	51.14086110673309	94464

To support mobile data access, existing multidatabases must address the obstacles in mobile computing such as low bandwidth, intermittent network connections, and resource constraints of mobile devices. The execution autonomy of mobile agents alleviates these problems and provides opportunity for conserving energy. We proposed and implemented a novel multidatabase information retrieval system, MAMDAS, which represents an application of Mobile Agents within the Mobile Data Access System framework. In this paper, we propose several MAMDAS optimization techniques to improve its performance and study the effect of mobile agents on energy saving through extensive simulation. Our experimental results show that by deploying appropriate power management policies, the mobile device energy saving can achieve as high as 51%. The high performance, energy efficiency, scalability, and robustness of MAMDAS allow us to envision its application in a variety of fields such as military operations, emergency teams, and mobile e-business.	data access;electronic business;information retrieval;mathematical optimization;mobile agent;mobile computing;mobile device;power management;scalability;simulation	Yu Jiao;Ali R.

This is a new form of the device cooperative content which we previously proposed (Kidawara, Y. et al., PACRIM, 2003). The original idea for this content was based on temporal synchronization. The new type of content is semantically synchronized and based on the concept of device cooperative browsing. This concept is an interactive method of browsing for content related to the content currently being viewed by a user. The operating mechanism is based on multiple devices connected via a peer-to-peer network. The mechanism operates cooperatively in order to find each user's particular interests and maintain information about them. Multiple devices sharing common information might thus have common topics of interest on various user devices. When new devices are connected in this environment, they detect the required information through filtering, and obtain it from other devices in the local ubiquitous network. In addition to describing this concept, we also discuss WebBoard, which is a successful implementation of our novel approach.	content-control software;peer-to-peer;ubiquitous computing;web content	Yutaka Kidawara;Koji Zettsu	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) (IEEE Cat.

We present scenarios where the current approaches are deficient in addressing the needs for ubiquitous sensing in services and applications on the Future Internet, involving the massive sharing of information from sensors via heterogeneous networks. We propose an information-centric architecture for real-time ubiquitous sensing which capitalizes on the proposed locator/identifier split, thus extending the Network of Information (NetInf) approach. From this we identify the challenges for which we present work-in-progress within the framework of the EU-funded MediaSense project. Firstly, we integrate sensors as addressable objects, exposed by means of sensor gateways and relocatable abstract interfaces. Sensor information is thus made available to applications solely based on identity. Secondly, sensor information is made available in a distributed data model towards searching and browsing. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the architecture in proof-of-concept applications for intelligent commuting, environmental monitoring and seamless media transfer, utilizing two different sensor platforms.	data model;future internet;identifier;image sensor;online locator service;real-time clock;seamless3d	Theo Kanter;Victor Kardeby;Stefan Forsström;Jamie Walters	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-21444-8_25	systems engineering;engineering;software engineering;computer engineering	Mobile	-40.92446156163266	47.81282152493488	94795

However this integration poses new challenges in the design and simulation of the involved embedded systems since it requires the cooperation of simulation tools that model hardware, software, and network aspects and their interactions. We present the modeling and simulation of a network scenario, core of a telecom provider's future portfolio, in which an ARM-based mobile handset is used as the gateway between a wireless sensor network (WSN) and remote users through a wide area network (WAN). Initially, the gateway and the WSN are modeled at system level with SystemC while the wide area network is modeled with NS-2. Then, HW/SW partitioning is performed on the gateway and an instruction set simulator of the ARM processor is used for the cycle-accurate execution of the RTOS and the application software	arm architecture;co-simulation;computer architecture simulator;embedded system;instruction set simulator;interaction;internet protocol suite;mobile phone;operating system;real-time clock;real-time computing;shattered world;simulation;systemc;telecommunications network	Franco Fummi;Davide Quaglia;Fabio Ricciato;Maura Turolla	2006	Proceedings of the Design Automation & Test in Europe Conference		embedded system;real-time computing;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;wireless network;modeling and simulation;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;residential gateway;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	EDA	-38.68040549132124	46.4546221078181	94887

At the same time there exists an ever-growing demand for ubiquitous healthcare systems to improve human health and well-being. In most of IoT-based patient monitoring systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, there exists a bridging point (i.e., gateway) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways enables massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a case study of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UTGATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system energy efficiency, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.	bridging (networking);cloud computing;data mining;dataflow;embedded system;firewall (computing);gate;internet of things;interoperability;real-time clock;scalability;sensor;server (computing);signal processing;software deployment;thread-local storage;tunneling protocol;websocket	Amir-Mohammad Rahmani;Nanda Kumar Thanigaivelan;Tuan Nguyen Gia;Jose Granados;Behailu Negash;Pasi Liljeberg;Hannu Tenhunen	2015	2015 12th Annual IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2015.7158084	communications protocol;logic gate;computer science;data integration;operating system;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;server;computer network	Mobile	-42.72000750347697	48.14026290976895	94903

This paper presents architecture to handle various kinds of emergency situations more efficiently and effectively, by allowing the user (victim or witness) easy and quick way to alert the concerned department (s) with just a single button press. The service automatically sends the location of incident and contacts the appropriate emergency dealing department automatically through already stored contact numbers. The emergency related information is then synchronized automatically to the mobile cloud, allowing further analysis and improvement in safety of people and creates further services for the concerned authorities and users.

Apache Ranger and Apache Sentry are two predominant frameworks used to provide authorization capabilities in Hadoop ecosystem. In this paper we present a formal multi-layer access control model (called HeAC) for Hadoop ecosystem, as an academic-style abstraction of Ranger, Sentry and native Apache Hadoop access-control capabilities. We further extend HeAC base model to provide a cohesive object-tagged role-based access control (OT-RBAC) model, consistent with generally accepted academic concepts of RBAC. Besides inheriting advantages of RBAC, OT-RBAC offers a novel method for combining RBAC with attributes (beyond NIST proposed strategies). Additionally, a proposed implementation approach for OT-RBAC in Apache Ranger, is presented. We further outline attribute-based extensions to OT-RBAC.	apache hadoop;authorization;ecosystem;fault tolerance;layer (electronics);role-based access control;scalability;sentry gun;ranger	Maanak Gupta;Farhan Patwa;Ravi S.

648b6afaec86cea755ff5cd3b3a709074d151379	blinkcomm: initialization of iot devices using visible light communication		Many applications from the Internet ofThings (IoT) domain used in healthcare, smart homes, and cities involve a large number of interconnected wireless devices. To ensure privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of the information, devices should be initialized prior to any communication. In this paper, we present a secure initialization method for constrained IoT devices such as wireless sensors devices and/or actuators. The solution uses visible light communication (VLC) for the initial configuration of the IoT devices. The VLC system consists of a modulated light source such as a smartphone screen and a very simple photodetector. We analyze known coding and modulation techniques used for the VLC and propose BlinkComm, a differential coding technique that achieves threefold increase in transmission speed compared to existing solutions. We showed through experiments with 32 participants that the proposed solution achieves fast completion times and low error rates as well as high user satisfaction levels.

Current trust management models addre ss these trust aspects individually when in fact they are dependent on eac h other. In this paper we identify and analyze the trust relationships in a c ontext-aware service platform and propose an integrated trust management model th at supports quantification of trust for different trust aspects. Our model add resses a set of trust aspects that is relevant for our target context-aware service pl atform and is extensible with other trust aspects. We propose to calculate a resu lting trust value for contextaware services, which considers the dependencies be tween the different trust aspects, and aims to support the users in the selec tion of the more trustworthy services. In this calculation we target two types o f user goals: one with high priority in privacy enforcement (privacy concerned) and one with high priority in the service adaptation (service concerned).

ce7f52dc91540b69598aa6c479297f1c246ec913	intelligent systems and smart homes	smart home;intelligent system	The concept of ambient intelligence propagates a vision of smart homes where people are supported and assisted in their daily activities by information technology that is very different from the computer as we know today. In recent years, significant advances have been achieved in the enabling technologies for smart homes, such as the increasingly mature networked appliances, pervasive sensor technologies and various kinds of wired and wireless communication protocols. These advances play a major role in the facilitation of smart homes. Though, there is not a general agreement on the definition of Home intelligence, many consider Home intelligent to generally be the combination of home network service, home automation service, and internet service to devices, services, as well as offices (in and/or outside home). Recently, home intelligent has been extended to include context aware and situation aware automation by using ubiquitous technologies. For example, in smart home environments, users are progressively offered more personalized services, ranging from home automation, security, monitoring, entertainment, to healthcare. In particular, many research efforts have been targeted to design and development of smart homes for ageing and disabled people. It is widely acknowledged that an important step in ubiquitous computing is context-awareness. Services in pervasive and mobile environments need to be contextaware so that they can adapt themselves to rapidly changing situations. Even though many intelligent systems have been built in recent years, there is a still a lack of a general model to guide the system design. The lack of a general model has resulted the construction of systems that suffer from many interoperability issues. In this context, we envision the creation of smart environments that integrate information, communication and sensing technologies into everyday objects. This special issue is a collection of novel ideas and state-ofthe-art research results on integrating intelligent systems and smart homes. We hope that this special issue will serve as a landmark source for education, information, and reference to students, professionals, and researchers interested in updating their knowledge about intelligent systems and smart homes. Submissions to this special issue come from the open Call for Papers as well as from the selected papers presented at the 2007 International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Smart Homes (WISH-07) organized at Niagara Falls, Canada, from August 28th to September 1st, 2007. In the paper “Service Integration with UPnP Agent for a Ubiquitous Home Environment”, Wally Chen et al. proposed an approach for UPnP devices connecting to outer networks via UPnP aware gateway. They also developed several service oriented applications in a smart campus based on the proposed framework.

036fa399728c1c1064b056929fc77cba41ca3268	catchme if you can: enable sustainable communications using internet of movable things	big data	"""The customary perspective of Internet of Things (IoT) endeavors to unite all the physical objects or """"things"""" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity to allow more direct integrations between the physical world and cyber-based systems. While these networked devices and associated communications can increase the energy demands exponentially and end up harming the environment seriously. Currently most researchers and practitioners have dedicated their efforts on improving the resource efficiency of IoT systems itself, while missing that there is a great potential to fully utilize the advanced capabilities of storage and communications in IoT devices, especially their movability which can carry the data to the destinations too. In this paper, we are paving a novel communications paradigm, named as Context-aware tethering communications hangout using Mobile encounter (CatchMe). A time-space matrix has been proposed to capture human mobility preferences, as well as a similarity analytical framework has been developed for mobile encountering analysis and predication, which are pillar stones of CatchMe paradigm. It aims to fully utilize the devices' mobility to create their encounter opportunities for short-range device to device (D2D) communications. Based on the real mobility traces, two case studies for mobility analysis have been conducted and the results confirm that there are reasonable opportunities existing for mobile encountering among most users, thus CatchMe is feasible. The extra numerical study demonstrates that CatchMe has great promises to significantly reduce the energy consumption, comparing with the infrastructure-based transmission approach which has been taken for granted in daily use. The current stage of proof-of-concept on CatchMe paradigm does not yet lend itself to sweeping prescription. Nevertheless, we believe this research direction is thoughtprovoking and opening a new conversation for researchers to rethink and redesign more sustainable communications and networking by fully exploring the moveable IoTs."""	embedded system;internet of things;numerical analysis;programming paradigm;sensor;tracing (software)	Ambreen Memon;William Liu;Adnan Al-Anbuky	2016	2016 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 14th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 2nd Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)	10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2016.163	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Mobile	-42.927269325829904	50.307184749771366	95394

For many years, lots of research efforts have been made in building low-cost, yet effective sensor networks for various application domains such as structural health monitoring of bridges, disaster recovery, automated ventilation of buildings. Integration of sensors into smartphones and the advent of wearable devices open a new opportunity for mobile applications to leverage in-situ user contexts such as his/her location, activity, social relationship, health status. In recent studies of mobile and pervasive computing, a number of useful mobile context-aware applications have been proposed, but their actual deployment is slow due to complexity of context processing and heavy resource and battery usage. To address such challenges, we have been building MobiCon for many years, upon which diverse context-aware applications are developed and deployed without concerns about complexity of context processing and resource optimization.	context awareness;disaster recovery;mathematical optimization;mobile app;sensor;smartphone;software deployment;ubiquitous computing;wearable technology	Youngki Lee;Younghyun Ju;Chulhong Min;Jihyun Yu;Junehwa Song	2012	2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)	10.1109/SECON.2012.6275765	embedded system;communications protocol;energy;wireless sensor network;mobile telephony;global positioning system;wearable computer;computer science;sensor;operating system;mobile technology;internet privacy;platform;mobile computing;computer security;resource	Mobile	-41.371061285905206	50.075349079635004	95653

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is a highly flexible and scalable access control scheme which can deal with diverse security requirements in Grid environment. However, in ABAC the user attributes delivered by the Identity Providers for authorization decisions may cause some privacy violation. We developed an attribute release control scheme that can improve the privacy protection capability of the current security systems in Grids. The Shibboleth Identity Provider, GridShib, and Globus Toolkit are used for our implementation.	access control;authorization;identity provider;privacy;requirement;scalability;shibboleth	Sang M.

This paper focuses on analysing and specifying agent security services for an Agentcities e-Banking service. In this version of the service we have defined a set of requirements for core, general and Multi-Multi Agent Systems (MMAS) scenarios to support confidentiality, integrity, and authentication interactions. We have applied an Abstract Security Model for mapping relationships between Assets, Safeguards, and Threats. Profiles define the mapping between these entities in order to meet the system requirements and policies represent collaboration rules to achieve the goal of meeting the requirements. Consequently, the Security Model implementation in this scenario has demonstrated that agent based commerce services are plausible in MMAS environments.	agent-based model;authentication;confidentiality;entity;interaction;multi-agent system;online banking;requirement;system requirements	Juan Jim Tan;Leonid Titkov;Stefan Poslad	2002		10.1007/3-540-36609-1_12	computer security model;knowledge management;environmental resource management;security service;business;computer security	Security	-46.90030219684789	54.49933331792035	96638

In this paper, we identify the different ways in which fuzzy logic can be profitably adopted in performing these tasks, providing flexibility in capturing users' needs and dealing with complex architectures and conflicting or hardly-satisfiable requirements. We specifically put forward the idea of using fuzzy logic at the user-side, to enable the specification of users' needs in crisp or fuzzy ways and their homogenous processing.	cloud management;fuzzy logic;requirement	Sara Foresti;Vincenzo Piuri;Gerson A.

This requires, on the one hand, an infrastructure for simulating the physical environment and, on the other hand, an infrastructure for emulating the Ambient Assisted Living devices. Both can be interconnected through data streams that allow emulated devices to behave as if they were connected to the real world, since they get similar sensor input. This paper introduces advances on a simulation framework for ambient intelligence so that it becomes capable of producing such data streams.	emulator	Jorge J.

WBANs can observe physiological conditions of patient under supervision, and can provide us real-time feedback. Through WBAN a patient is constantly monitored, and in case of some critical situation an immediate action should be required. In today's world most of the healthcare organizations need to modernize their IT infrastructure so that they can be able to provide safer, faster and more efficient healthcare delivery.

We envision “Pervasive Apps”, user-centric activity-aware pervasive computing applications. They use available sensors for activity recognition. They are downloadable from application repositories, much like current Apps for mobile phones. A key challenge is to provide Pervasive Apps in open-ended environments where resource availability cannot be predicted. We therefore introduce Titan, a service-oriented framework supporting design, development, deployment, and execution of activity-aware Pervasive Apps. With Titan, mobile devices inquire surrounding nodes about available services. Internet-based application repositories compose applications based on available services as a service graph. The mobile device maps the service graph to Titan Nodes. The execution of the service graph is distributed and can be remapped at run time upon changing resource availability. The framework is geared to streaming data processing and machine learning, which is key for activity recognition. We demonstrate Titan in a pervasive gaming application involving smart dice and a sensorized wristband. We comparatively present the implementation cost and performance and discuss how novel machine learning methodologies may enhance the flexibility of the mapping of service graphs to opportunistically available nodes.	activity recognition;algorithm;ambient intelligence;computation;displacement mapping;download;gnu;graph (discrete mathematics);machine learning;mobile device;mobile phone;nonlinear gameplay;pervasive informatics;programming model;refresh rate;rich internet application;run time (program lifecycle phase);sensor;sensor node;service-orientation;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented programming;service-oriented software engineering;smart environment;software deployment;streaming media;titan;ubiquitous computing	Daniel Roggen;Clemens Lombriser;Mirco Rossi;Gerhard Tröster	2011	EURASIP J.

HSB is constructed to facilitate data access for third parties. Meanwhile, we build the health data center to recommend services in a personalized manner based on middleware platform. Further, external services and platform owned services are orchestrated and integrated to a health services library, which supports an end-to-end process and supplies application services for the senior. The goal of the platform is to provide overall management and sufficient services in all aspects of healthcare of the senior.

e7bf52d9a16a707d495e2b9338bf399cdbcc104b	a trust model for an open, decentralized reputation system		The use of reputation systems has been proposed for various applications, e. g., to estimate the trustworthiness of sellers and buyers in electronic transactions. Reputation systems collect opinions of users about properties of certain services, subjects and other users and evaluate these opinions. It is important that the results of reputation systems are consistent with intuitive expectations of its users, which highly depends on the properties of the underlying trust model. The trust model defines the representation of the trust values as well as the computation of trust values for derived trust relations. We propose a new sophisticated computational model of trust which seamlessly integrates authentication verification into the trust evaluation process and which is suitable especially for open, decentralized reputation systems. It consists of definitions of trust and authentication relations, inference rules and three downward compatible trust calculi. It is therefore possible to represent and evaluate trust values with different levels of detail. The model reflects all relevant aspects and properties of trust and authentication relations and therefore avoids any counterintuitive effects.	algorithm;authentication;backward compatibility;computation;computational model;electronic funds transfer;level of detail;microsoft outlook for mac;reputation system;requirement;trust (emotion);ws-trust	Andreas Gutscher	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-73655-6_19	public relations;trust anchor;business;computational trust	Web+IR	-43.577285804141205	57.45962081312713	98151

They are gaining more and more momentum and are expected to play a key role in Next Generation Networks. For these reasons, their management is becoming critical. Fault management is one of the most challenging areas of network and service management. It includes fault detection, isolation and repair. This paper proposes a Web service-based architecture for detecting faults in Web services. The architecture is rooted in passive testing. Passive testing consists of observing and analyzing messages the component under test exchanges with its environment. The passive testers of our architecture are designed as Web services. The components of the architecture are presented and the potential interfacing technologies are evaluated. This evaluation has led us to the selection of mobile agents.	next-generation network;web service	Abdelghani Benharref;Roch H.

The Web Observatory provides an active decentralised ecosystem for datasets and applications based on a number Web Observatory sites, each of which can run in a different administrative domain. On a Web Observatory site users can publish and securely access datasets across domains via a harmonised API and reverse proxies for access control. However, that API provides a different interface to that of the databases on which datasets are stored and, consequently, existing applications that consume data from specific databases require major modification to be added to the Web Observatory ecosystem. In this paper we propose a lightweight architecture called Porter Proxy to address this concern. Porter Proxy exposes the same interfaces as databases as requested by the users while enforcing access control. Characteristics of the proposed Porter Proxy architecture are evaluated based on adversarial scenario-handling in Web Observatory eco-system.	access control;administrative domain;application programming interface;database;ecosystem;proxy server;reverse proxy;world wide web	Xin Wang;Aastha Madaan;Eugene Siow;Thanassis Tiropanis	2017		10.1145/3041021.3051694	proxy;web application security;data web;computer science;information security;access control;database;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-43.656720253295994	55.22415960298848	99058

The involving of mobile devices into these services has become a technology trend. Existing solutions to these services restrict these devices to be located in the same local network. In this paper, we design and implement an integrated architecture that supports the outdoor remote control to home devices and the sharing of digital media among indoor and outdoor devices. By following the digital home related standards, we show our system design with the details of hardware and software components.	home automation;remote control;universal plug and play	Ti-Hsin Yu;Shou-Chih Lo	2013		10.1007/978-94-007-6738-6_41	embedded system;internet privacy;computer security	HCI	-38.9908907943291	53.024504849223405	99079

This is generally called a """"trust framework."""" The framework provides trust to its participants, in which economical operations are enabled. A modern framework of services are enpowered by IoT, where the environments often change in time. Here, we have to re-evaluate the policies when we observe changes in the environments. In this paper, we propose a formal model of adaptive policy evaluation framework that reflects the trust for the evaluation policy and the collection of environmental data by IoT devices. PDP runs under a given trust circle, receives assertions including policies of peers, and make a decision. Furthermore, we formalize the adaptive evalua- tion scheme of policies that reflects the dynamics of a trust circle which is affected by the environment of PDP. Monitor plays an essential role in controlling the trust circle by sensing the dynamic change of environments, which gives growth or shrink of a trust circle."""	formal language	Hiroyuki Sato;Shigeaki Tanimoto;Toru Kobayashi;Atsushi Kanai	2018	2018 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)	10.1109/SOSE.2018.00024	process management;accountability;environmental data;computer science;transparency (graphic);decision-making;distributed computing;server;information and communications technology;internet of things	Security	-46.17437911411829	52.32900745597662	99167

In the world of Omni-Channel-Banking, customers demand a flexible and easy usage for carrying out their banking activities. Establishing such an Omni-Channel-Banking experience is a challenging task that requires support for the development of heterogeneous user interfaces (UIs) allowing flexible access to different channels (e.g. PC, Smartphone, ATM) and a seamless hand-over between these channels to allow task-continuity for the customer. Therefore, we present a model-based solution architecture for the development of multi-device UIs. Our solution architecture minimizes recurrent UI development efforts for different channels and enables data synchronization between them. To show the feasibility of our approach, we present an industrial case study, where we implement a cross-channel banking web-application that enables a modern customer experience.	user interface;web application	Enes Yigitbas;Thomas Kern;Patrick Urban;Stefan Sauer	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46963-8_10	web development;web modeling	HCI	-37.56360863656021	49.04854399309612	99747

This unprecedented digital wave paves the way for a major technological breakthrough called to deeply change our daily lives. Nevertheless, in order to make this announced revolution come true, some strong issues remain to be addressed. The most dominant one relates to our ability to leverage the whole IoT service space and more specifically to our ability to compose IoT services from multiple connected devices by cleverly selecting them with the required software functions whatever our technical skills. In such a challenging context, this paper presents a model-based approach particularly allowing an autonomous recommendation of available IoT services to end-users. To support this vision, a rich and flexible abstraction framework relying on Attributed Typed Graphs has been used. The latter formalism enables to represent how known IoT services are composed from different perspectives. Capitalizing on this modeling tool and first focusing on the way IoT services interact with the physical environment, lightweight service signatures are computed by using an innovative physical-interfaced-based algorithm. Finally, we discuss how leveraging the computed signatures can allow for autonomously recommending viable IoT services according to available connected devices.	algorithm;antivirus software;autonomous robot;home automation;internet of things;semantics (computer science)	Michel Le Pallec;Mohamed Omar Mazouz;Ludovic Noirie	2016		10.1145/2991561.2991567	embedded system;simulation;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;biological classification;computer science;operating system;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;computer network	HCI	-44.56084607588557	49.645129795825575	99773

Creating VOs is very important task in Grid computing. VOs are dynamically created for some goals and then disappear after the goals are achieved. Conventional authorization architectures for the Grid have been proposed in a single VO environment. However, in reality we often need to handle the situation of several dynamically created VOs. Hence, enough fine-grained authorization methods for all the Grid entities such as resource providers, VO manger, and users do not exist under the dynamic VO environment. In this paper, we propose a TAS architecture to support a fine-grained authorization service in a dynamic VO environment. In contrast to the conventional architecture, TAS architecture uses a ticket that is unforgeable and exchangeable among VO entities for resource control.	authorization;entity;thermal-assisted switching	Byungjoon B J Kim;Sung Je Hong;Jong Kim	2004		10.1145/1111348.1111352	computer science;operating system;database;grid;world wide web;computer security;grid computing	HPC	-46.83842604060078	52.85227960396047	99895

afe45aadab12a5929be91ec4f4d6a05df360e5cd	design of framework supporting ipmi and dcmi based on open bmc		This study aims at developing and applying a framework that supports IPMI(Intelligent Platform Management Interface) and DCMI(Data Center Manageability Interface) based on open BMC(Board Support Controller). The proposed framework includes IPMI 2.0-based control firmware and DCMI technology that enables server board management in the data center. The existing BMC has been provided in the form of a private binary by a third-party vendor, and needs to be consulted with vendors when changes such as addition / deletion are required. In addition, the functionality provided by BMC has been determined by vendor-specific characteristics. In this paper, the proposed open BMC provides BMC IDE environment as well as code release. Therefore, user (developer) can configure BMC function more easily, and it is designed to implement and delete additional function if necessary. The designed BMC IDE environment not only supports BMC Application development, but also helps board system providers to design and evaluate IPMI library and DCMI library.	data center;firmware;integrated development environment;intelligent platform management interface;server (computing)	Jae-Hoon An;Younghwan Kim;Chang Won Park	2017		10.1145/3129676.3129706	firmware;embedded system;control theory;vendor;operating system;data center;intelligent platform management interface;computer science	Mobile	-35.66649406500996	52.25317234016284	100271

These will typically be resource-constrained (such as sensor motes), will use different operating systems, and will be connected through different types of network interfaces. Additionally, they may be mobile and/or form ad-hoc networks with their peers, and will need to be adaptive to changing conditions based on context-awareness. Our focus in this paper is on the provision of a middleware framework for such system environments. Our approach is based on a small and efficient ‘middleware kernel’ which supports highly modularised and customisable component-based middleware services that can be tailored for specific embedded environments, and are runtime reconfigurable to support adaptivity. These services are primarily communications-related but also address a range of other concerns including service discovery and logical mobility. In the paper we provide an overview of our approach, focusing in detail on both the middleware kernel and the services. We also discuss an application scenario in which we are currently applying and evaluating our middleware approach.	code mobility;component-based software engineering;computer science;contiki;data synchronization;distributed computing;embedded system;java;middleware;mobile computing;network operating system;p.i.p.s.;peer-to-peer;personal digital assistant;reconfigurability;routing;software architecture;software deployment	Paolo Costa;Geoff Coulson;Cecilia Mascolo;Luca Mottola;Gian Pietro Picco;Stefanos Zachariadis	2007	IJWIN	10.1007/s10776-007-0057-2	embedded system;middleware;real-time computing;computer science;message oriented middleware;operating system;middleware;distributed computing;mobile computing	Embedded	-38.70604110872586	46.4108668683784	100770

Such systems can effectively only be realized with a merging of various device classes and the integration of mobile actors and wireless communication technologies to provide the necessary flexibility. This article introduces a system design that combines portable hand-held devices as well as autonomous sensors through XMPP with the flexibility of cloud services to support post-disaster management. This combination provides the communication between the different involved parties (e.g., rescue teams, relief forces, NGOs) and enables a global view on sensed data through the use of cloud-based storage and analysis services. Along with a discussion about requirements and a description of appropriate solutions and initial evaluations, we present new insights on the practical appliance of XMPP and potential enhancements for XMPP-based real life collaboration applications in hybrid (ad hoc and infrastructure) network scenarios. We also show that resource constrained devices can run the XMPP protocol to extend smartphones with sensors or to connect different device classes in a seamless way. R. Klauck · M.

Reputation-based trust management in Pilarcos utilizes shared experience information on the actors’ past behaviour in estimating the risks of a collaboration; these experiences are shared between members of the service ecosystem through a reputation system. As the reputation system becomes an essential peer-control mechanism for the open service ecosystem, it must be augmented with sanctions for misbehaviour and appropriate incentives for correct behaviour. A fair sanctioning system cannot be built on traditional subjective reports, as rebuttal of undeserved reports requires shared, objective measures. To make the shared experience information objective and verifiable, we associate it with whether the relevant collaboration contract was followed, backed up with evidence in the form of nonrepudiable receipts. In this way, we are able to protect automated reputation-based trust decisions from being skewed by misinformation.	autonomous robot;backup;centralized computing;decision problem;ecosystem;experience;ftc fair information practice;formal verification;malware;objectivity/db;reputation system;trust management (information system);trusted operating system;trusted third party	Sini Ruohomaa;Puneet Kaur;Lea Kutvonen	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-29852-3_10	public relations;political science;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-43.114233800061086	57.50904620003593	101053

However, because of the inherent non-controllability of agents across different management domains, this approach has been confronted with the challenge of so-called “trust” crisis that the success and benefit of cooperation cannot be ensured. This crisis has worried the research of autonomic computing and multi-agent systems for a long time. In order to conquer the crisis, this paper proposes a model for Trusted and Autonomic Service Cooperation, called TASC, which can eliminate the dilemma that the requirements of “Autonomy” and “Trust” conflict with each other. This model depends on three technologies to make service cooperation both trusted and autonomic: virtual society assistant management for providing cooperation assistance and maintaining cooperation order, contract templates for quickly creating e-contracts between agents, and norm-conforming policy-driven self-management for making agents conform rationally to the relevant regulations. It is the close coupling of those technologies that supports effectively both the resolution of “trust” crisis and the realization of autonomic service cooperation.	autonomic computing	Linqiao Jin;Jie-Qing Ai	2009		10.1109/ICETC.2009.24	service;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;society;law;computer security;government	Crypto	-44.605900580079854	55.71676971078389	101220

As the strictly personal devices they are, they gradually enable the replacement of well established activities as for instance payments, two factor authentication or personal assistants. In addition, Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets extend the capabilities of the latter even further. Devices such as body worn fitness trackers allow users to keep track of daily activities by periodically synchronizing data with the smartphone and ultimately with the vendor’s computational centers in the cloud. These fitness trackers are equipped with an array of sensors to measure the movements of the device, to derive information as step counts or make assessments about sleep quality. We capture the raw sensor data from wrist-worn activity trackers to model a biometric behavior profile of the carrier. We establish and present techniques to determine rather the original person, who trained the model, is currently wearing the bracelet or another individual. Our contribution is based on CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition so that computational complexity facilitates: the execution on light computational devices on low precision settings, or the migration to stronger CPUs or to the cloud, for high to very high granularity. This precision parameter allows the security layer to be adaptable, in order to be compliant with the requirements set by the use cases. We show that our approach identifies users with high confidence.

We believe that new applications can leverage these models to achieve new features that are not available for legacy applications. In our project we aim to build elastic applications which augment resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile phones, with elastic computing resources from clouds. An elastic application consists of one or more weblets, each of which can be launched on a device or cloud, and can be migrated between them according to dynamic changes of the computing environment or user preferences on the device. This paper overviews the general concept of this new application model, analyzes its unique security requirements, and presents our design considerations to build secure elastic applications. As first steps we propose a solution for authentication and secure session management between weblets running device side and those on the cloud. We then propose secure migration and how to authorize cloud weblets to access sensitive user data such as via external web services. We believe some principles in our solution can be applied in other cloud computing scenarios such as application integration between private and public clouds in an enterprise environment.	application framework;authentication;cloud computing;elasticity (cloud computing);elasticity (data store);mobile device;mobile phone;platform as a service;requirement;secure communication;session (computer science);session key;software as a service;user (computing);utility computing;web service;weblet	Xinwen Zhang;Joshua Schiffman;Simon Gibbs;Anugeetha Kunjithapatham;Sangoh Jeong	2009		10.1145/1655008.1655026	web service;cloud computing security;cloud computing;computer science;information security;operating system;cloud testing;mobile device;utility computing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-43.494134114964844	58.65920617506679	101310

Thus, the IoT is a prototypical example of Big Data. The contribution of this paper is to define a software architecture supporting the collection of sensor-based data in the context of the IoT. The architecture goes from the physical dimension of sensors to the storage of data in a cloud-based system.

bef2a9825488e5aee5cd069e0ad0157af619bf57	preserving privacy in location-based mobile social applications	building block;large scale;location privacy	Location-based social applications (LBSAs) rely on the location coordinates of the users to provide services. Today, smartphones using these applications act as simple clients and send out user locations to untrusted third-party servers. These servers have the application logic to provide the service, and in the process collect large amounts of user location information over time. This design, however, is shown to be susceptible to large-scale user privacy compromises even if several location cloaking techniques are employed. In this position paper, we argue that the LBSAs should adapt an approach where the untrusted third-party servers are treated simply as encrypted data stores, and the application functionality be moved to the client devices. The location coordinates are encrypted, when shared, and can be decrypted only by the users that the data is intended for. This approach significantly improves user location privacy. We argue that this approach not only improves privacy, but it is also flexible enough to support a wide variety of location-based applications used today. In this paper, we identify the key building blocks necessary to construct the applications in this approach, give examples of using the building blocks by constructing several applications, and outline the privacy properties provided by this approach. We believe our approach provides a practical alternative design for LBSAs that is deployable today.	business logic;data store;encryption;location-based service;privacy;smartphone	Krishna P. N.

Simulations provide useful tools for engineer to plan traffic systems and government to make decisions. The microscopic traffic simulation approach defines the behavior of each interactive object in the traffic network, such as a vehicle and a traffic light through an individual model so that we can observe the detail traffic information of a scenario. Since microscopic model requires large computational power and data storage power, new simulation system architecture is needed. In the paper, the background of this research work is introduced.

In typical designs, however, application of each thing is restricted to a dedicated use case in a single network of connected devices, resulting in a closed loop of information flow. We argue that, given the envisioned diversity, capabilities, and sheer number of smart things, this obstructs the possibility of creating diverse and exciting applications that benefit of the generated information in public, global usage scenarios. In this paper, we thus aim to initiate the discussion of creating a true Internet of Things, i.e., interconnected IoT networks, based on provision and requests of generated information in a public infrastructure. We highlight the challenges in designing this infrastructure for feasible integration in the current Internet and IoT designs, comprehensive provision and retrieval of information, and versatile derivation of higher information contexts from single information sources. Assessing advantages and shortcomings of existing approaches, we propose a suitable approach and discuss both a centralized and distributed implementation of the proposed infrastructure.	centralized computing;cloud computing;indirection;internet of things;microsoft outlook for mac;pervasive informatics;programming paradigm;requirement;smartphone	Hanno Wirtz;Klaus Wehrle	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communications and Networking (SECON)	10.1109/SAHCN.2013.6644955	information infrastructure;web of things;human–computer interaction;computer science;semantic web;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Mobile	-43.07601778583424	46.91457590475453	102173

e696e00f70c690b8362c12296fc833f4db3c1033	report on policy 2006: workshop on policies for distributed systems and networks	distributed system	A policy-based system accepts as input a policy that specifies the behavior of the system in response to an event. Examples of policies include the following: (i) If a server’s average response time is below a specific threshold, then decrease the maximum number of concurrent users allowed; (ii) If there are two unsuccessful logins with the same user identifier within a three minute interval, then e-mail the system administrator. In a non policy-based system these policies would be hardcoded. Thus a change in a policy (e.g., instead of two unsuccessful logins causing an email to be sent to the system administrator have it be three unsuccessful logins) requires recoding and recompiling. In a policy-based system a change in policy results in a change of inputs to the policy-based system. This does not require recompiling, and allows for a more reusable and adaptive system. Policies have been studied in the context of areas that includes network management, quality of service and access control within an enterprise. Successes have spurred further research in exploring the use of policies in different application domains. However, commercial policy-based systems at this time are limited to VPN management and firewall management. There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in order for policybased systems to become more widely deployed. Addressing these issues is complicated by the increased complexity of computing systems as these systems become larger, and more dynamic and unstable as the use of mobile devices increases.

This exposes the need to design next-generation navigation services that accommodate these newly emerging aspects. In this paper, we present a prototype system, namely, EPUI (an Experimental Platform of Urban Informatics), which provides a testbed for exploring and evaluating venues and route recommendation solutions that balance between different objectives (i.e., demands) including the newly discovered ones. In addition, EPUI incorporates a modularized design, enabling researchers to upload their own algorithms and compare them to well-known algorithms using different performance metrics. Its user interface makes it easily usable by both end-user and experienced researchers.	algorithm;next-generation network;prototype;testbed;upload;urban informatics;user interface	Xiaoyu Ge;Panos K.

6c7584d750e261e49d6dd35911df08ca572750fd	a new sharing paradigm for the personal cloud		Pushed by recent legislation and smart disclosure initiatives, personal cloud solutions emerge and hold the promise of giving the control back to the individual on her data. However, this shift leaves the privacy and security issues in user’s hands, a role that few people can properly endorse. Considering the inadequacy of existing sharing models, we advocate the definition of a new sharing paradigm dedicated to the personal cloud context. This sharing paradigm, called SWYSWYK (Share What You See with Who You Know), allows to derive intuitive sharing rules from the personal cloud content, to self-administer the subjects and the sensitive permissions, and to visualize the net effects of the sharing policy on the user’s personal cloud. We then propose a reference architecture providing the users tangible guarantees about the enforcement of the SWYSWYK policies. An instance of this architecture has been implemented on top of an existing personal cloud platform to demonstrate the practicality of the approach.	cloud computing;performance evaluation;personal cloud;personally identifiable information;privacy;programming paradigm;reference architecture;smart tv;wysiwyg	Paul Tran-Van;Nicolas Anciaux;Philippe Pucheral	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-64483-7_12	computer science;computer security;internet privacy;the internet;enforcement;reference architecture;architecture;legislation;personal cloud	Security	-45.69085993837097	59.2553826966379	103605

However, we argue that these existing services do not sufficiently bring real-world contexts into app testing, which reduces the visibility into how an unreleased app would perform in the wild. In fact, this is a challenging problem that current emulator-based or device-based testing services cannot properly or scalably address. This paper envisions a split-execution model for building automated and contextual testing services for mobile apps. This model allows the service to evolve over time, by adopting new algorithms and recruiting new physical devices. Finally, preliminary results from a prototype demonstrate the potential and feasibility of our proposed architecture.	algorithm;cloud computing;emulator;fault coverage;mobile app;prototype;test automation	Li Lyna Zhang;Chieh-Jan Mike Liang;Wei Zhang;Enhong Chen	2017		10.1145/3032970.3032972	simulation;computer science;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-37.786250524149786	52.39903829570064	103779

Starting by an overview of the existing work in this field, and ending up with the proposal of a new distributed and cooperative architecture for intrusion detection. In order to overcome the weaknesses and flaws of the existing MANET intrusion detection systems (IDSs), this architecture integrates an agent-based detection process. So, the main principle of the proposed architecture is based on: (a) the distribution which is achieved through the implementation of a local intrusion detection system on each network node, and (b) the cooperation that is guaranteed by mobile and stationary agents' collaboration. In that way we were able to have an IDS with so many interesting features such as: flexibility, distribution and cooperation, autonomy, lightweight, reactivity and fault tolerance which are extremely desired for any MANET intrusion detection system.	agent-based model;emoticon;fault tolerance;hoc (programming language);intrusion detection system;manet database;microsoft academic search;multi-agent system;scheme;stationary process	Leila Mechtri;Fatiha Djemili Tolba;Salim Ghanemi	2012	2012 Ninth International Conference on Information Technology - New Generations	10.1109/ITNG.2012.18	vehicular ad hoc network;intrusion detection system;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;multi-agent system;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security;collaborative software;computer network	Mobile	-44.437641625999376	55.56390976756605	104130
2b0eeab7ee904ab94bbf902d7b419f91f5cb6a03	introduction to wireless sensor networks	article	With the popularity of laptops, cell phones, PDAs, GPS devices, RFID, and intelligent electronics in the post-PC era, computing devices have become cheaper, more mobile, more distributed, and more pervasive in daily life. It is now possible to construct, from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, a wallet size embedded system with the equivalent capability of a 90’s PC. Such embedded systems can be supported with scaled down Windows or Linux operating systems. From this perspective, the emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is essentially the latest trend of Moore’s Law toward the miniaturization and ubiquity of computing devices. Typically, a wireless sensor node (or simply sensor node) consists of sensing, computing, communication, actuation, and power components. These components are integrated on a single or multiple boards, and packaged in a few cubic inches. With state-of-the-art, low-power circuit and networking technologies, a sensor node powered by 2 AA batteries can last for up to three years with a 1% low duty cycle working mode. A WSN usually consists of tens to thousands of such nodes that communicate through wireless channels for information sharing and cooperative processing. WSNs can be deployed on a global scale for environmental monitoring and habitat study, over a battle field for military surveillance and reconnaissance, in emergent environments for search and rescue, in factories for condition based maintenance, in buildings for infrastructure health monitoring, in homes to realize smart homes, or even in bodies for patient monitoring [60; 76; 124; 142]. After the initial deployment (typically ad hoc), sensor nodes are responsible for self-organizing an appropriate network infrastructure, often	cubic function;duty cycle;embedded system;emergence;global positioning system;habitat;hoc (programming language);laptop;linux;low-power broadcasting;microsoft windows;mobile phone;moore's law;operating system;organizing (structure);personal computer;personal digital assistant;pervasive informatics;post-pc era;self-organization;sensor node;software deployment	Supriyo Chatterjea;Paul J.

19efdbe68afa72bde9135e509d41cd836b055fbe	distributed policy based management for wireless sensor networks to support the internet of things environment		Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm of the Internet. It was a natural result of technology advancement in wireless devices such as sensors, RFID devices, PDAs and smart phones. The technology advancement makes it possible to build devices, which are smaller, more powerful, very well connected, and embedded with sensing ability. The connectivity combined with sensing ability of these devices created the new wave of modern Internet that is The Internet of Things. Naturally, all new technologies have to struggle with many new challenges. IoT is no different; it has been associated with new challenges such as security, trust, standardization, and governance of these tiny devices, which collectively are forming a WSN. WSNs are particularly special due to limited hardware resources. Such as memory, processing and battery power that make it capable of handling only limited software. Therefore, governing these tiny devices is a challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new solution based on implementing an overlay network on top of the WSN. The main advantages of the proposed solution are dynamism, robustness, and fully distributed policy management system.	internet of things	Nidal Qwasmi;Ramiro Liscano	2014			operating system;database;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-43.32302704064311	48.79295426372585	104540
983bac78450d0a991b1ed54c93f79aaaf3ea3408	a scalable integrated sdn and openstack management system	information technology;decision support systems;handheld computers;conferences	Due to the need to agilely cope with more complex and virtualized applications, integrating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) switches and OpenStack software platform into the data center has becomes an important enabling technology. However, the SDN controller and OpenStack have their own management interface, such as Horizon, which may not be able to meet the user's requirement on managing both platforms in one data center. For example, although the deployment of switches of a data center usually follows a layering hierarchy, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of management system of the SDN controller, such as Ryu, shows the topology of switches in a random and messy manner. Furthermore, tightly integration of SDN and OpenStack is required for agile and real-time management. Thus, in this paper, we design and implement a management system which tightly integrates SDN and OpenStack. In the proposed management system, the topology displays SDN switches, Open vSwitches (OVS), as well as virtual machines in hierarchy of multi-rooted trees. In order to display millions of virtual machines and thousands of switches, the GUI of the proposed management system provides a scalable view for users to zoom in or zoom out the topology. The proposed management system adopts modular design and provides web-based user interface and RESTful API for interoperability. The prototype of the proposed management system is shown to demonstrate the usability and scalability of the proposed system.	agile software development;application programming interface;data center;graphical user interface;interoperability;management interface;management system;modular design;network switch;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;representational state transfer;scalability;software deployment;software-defined networking;usability;virtual machine;web application	Sing-Chi Chen;Ren-Hung Hwang	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)	10.1109/CIT.2016.27	computer science;operating system;database;law;information technology;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Networks	-33.96279849980154	52.74861417369514	104674

ACIS is a decentralized bilateral-hierarchy architecture that forms a community of individual end-users (community members) having the same interests and demands in somewhere, at specified time. It allows the community members to mutually cooperate and share information without loading up any single node excessively. In this paper, an autonomous decentralized community communication technique is proposed to assure a flexible, scalable and a multilateral communication among the community members. The main ideas behind this communication technique are: content-code communication (community service-based) for flexibility and multilateral benefits communication for scalable and productive cooperation among members. All members communicate productively for the satisfaction of all the community members. The scalability of the system's response time regardless of the number of the community members has been shown by simulation.

2543747bed1974b3b6c70eaa4a2b5741983e2ed1	socioplatform: a platform for social context-aware applications	swinburne	With an explosive growth in the popularity of social media and increasing prevelance and features of advanced mobile devices, interest has grown significantly in applications that are aware of users’ social context and are able to assist them in their daily activities. A key requirement of developing social context-aware applications is the platform support to reduce the complexity of engineering such applications. In this chapter, we present such a platform, namely SocioPlatform, to aid the development of social context-aware applications by acquiring, reasoning, storing and provisioning different types of social context information, and managing their runtime interactions and adaptation. The platform hides the complexity of managing social context, and thus assists the development of social context-aware applications. We demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the platform by developing two different types of such applications.	application programming interface;google calendar;high- and low-level;interaction;knowledge base;mobile device;provisioning;social media;social network	Muhammad Ashad Kabir;Alan W.

In this paper, we present a new system called ThermoCoach that improves thermostat usability by giving personalized and actionable recommendations for thermostat use. The system senses human occupancy patterns in a home and emails the household suggested setpoint schedules that can be modified or activated with the click of a button. We performed a randomized controlled trial by deploying over 600 devices in 40 homes from 12 weeks to compare ThermoCoach with a manually programmable thermostat and the Nest learning thermostat. Results indicate that ThermoCoach saves 4.7% more energy than a manually programmable thermostat and 12.4% more energy than the Nest learning thermostat while significantly improving comfort over both approaches.	advanced process control;chi;computer cooling;conference on embedded networked sensor systems;email;field-programmable gate array;lu decomposition;norm (social);personalization;programmable logic device;randomized algorithm;recommender system;samuel newman;scott meyers;setpoint (control system);smart thermostat;ubiquitous computing;usability;yang	Devika Pisharoty;Rayoung Yang;Mark W.

Web Services, which provide a serviceoriented distributed architecture for the interconnection of systems through TCP/IP networks, have been widely adopted for the integration of business applications, but this sort of integration is still not provided by embedded applications. The present work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using Web Services for the integration of embedded applications running on heterogeneous architectures. This is achieved through the provision of a support for the development and deployment of web services on embedded platforms. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by developing an application deployed on an embedded platform - the SHIP board - which is then integrated with a distributed enterprise application.	computation;distributed computing;embedded system;enterprise software;interconnection;internet protocol suite;middleware;quality of service;requirement;software deployment;system integration;web service	Guilherme Bertoni Machado;Frank Siqueira;Robinson Mittmann;Carlos Augusto Vieira e Vieira	2006	International Conference on Networking, International Conference on Systems and International Conference on Mobile Communications and Learning Technologies (ICNICONSMCL'06)	10.1109/ICNICONSMCL.2006.89	web service;web application security;embedded system;middleware;web modeling;computer science;service-oriented architecture;distributed computing;services computing;law;computer network	Robotics	-35.75839723201665	48.08549741994671	104965
986a506bba7b05239fe53b036bd5944965d561ad	witness-based location proofs for mobile devices		Location-aware mobile applications are gaining popularity. This growth has caused the emergence of services that are offered to the users only when they are at specific locations. To implement valuable services, like a product sale, it is necessary to verify the presence of the useru0027s device in a way which can be reliably trusted by the providers. This paper presents a system to support the creation of proofs that the useru0027s device is at a claimed location. The system relies on different techniques for location estimation and on witness devices to testify to the presence of the useru0027s device. A prototype was implemented and evaluated in regard to response times, accuracy of location estimates, and feasibility of proof exchanges. The results show that the solution is both practical and useful.		Joao Ferreira;Miguel L.

In this paper we present a security framework for mobile business applications that is capable of performing context-aware access control on message level. There are several components in the framework that together (1) ensure that security requirements defined in policies are enforced in the framework, (2) provide context information and apply plausibility checks to increase the confidence that context information represents the actual situation or state (context) of an entity, and (3) perform the access-control decisions based on a combination of classic access control schemes and context information.

Our mobile personal cloud can host multiple different services which are intelligent, distributed, dynamic and operate in real time. In this paper we describe one service that we designed and deployed on our mobile personal cloud called Mobile Wellbeing Companion Cloud (MWCC). Using low-cost, off-the-shelf hardware components and open-source software, our MWCC combines several sensor network technologies to allow users to monitor and interact with their personal data and environment in real time without privacy leakage. MWCC augments heterogeneous sensors data with state of the art machine learning algorithms for signal filtering, fast classification and analysis and provides interactive data visualisation for transparent user interaction. We show that our MWCC is easy to use and highly accurate while managing to keep resource costs low.	algorithm;cloud computing;data visualization;machine learning;open-source software;peer-to-peer;personal cloud;personally identifiable information;sensor;spectral leakage	Milena Radenkovic;Vu San Ha Huynh	2016	2016 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577166	embedded system;simulation;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;personal information manager;computer network	Mobile	-41.37223734984449	49.753491088150604	106094

An emerging architecture solution in the wireless Internet is based on mobile proxies (implemented as mobile agent-based middleware components) over the fixed network that follow the movements and act on behalf of the limited wireless clients. It is crucial that mobile proxies have full visibility of their context, i.e., the set of available and relevant resources, depending on access control rules, client location, user preferences, privacy requirements, terminal characteristics, and current state of hosting environments. The paper presents the design and implementation of a context-centric security middleware, called UbiCOSM, for MA-based service provisioning in pervasive computing. UbiCOSM dynamically determines the contexts of mobile proxies, and effectively rules the access to them, by taking into account different types of metadata (user profiles and authorization policies), expressed at a high level of abstraction and cleanly separated from the service logic. The paper also shows the functioning of UbiCOSM in the design and the development of a mobile context-centric airport business assistant.	access control;agent-based model;authorization;business logic;context awareness;high-level programming language;locality of reference;middleware;mobile agent;overhead (computing);personal digital assistant;prototype;provisioning;real-time computing;real-time locating system;requirement;separation of concerns;shadow copy;ubiquitous computing;user (computing);user profile	Antonio Corradi;Rebecca Montanari;Daniela Tibaldi;Alessandra Toninelli	2005	The 2005 Symposium on Applications and the Internet	10.1109/SAINT.2005.2	the internet;computer science;access control;middleware;mobile agent;authorization;internet privacy;metadata;world wide web;computer security;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Mobile	-43.86144203104184	54.55497504369731	107013
35ac34bd1c32b9291c9fe68b05324cbc60ec9208	towards privacy-aware smart buildings: capturing, communicating, and enforcing privacy policies and preferences		The Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the way we interact with our environment in domains as diverse as health, transportation, office buildings and our homes. In smart building environments, information captured about the building and its inhabitants will aid in development of services that improve productivity, comfort, social interactions, safety, energy savings and more. However, by collecting and sharing information about building's inhabitants and their activities, these services also open the door to privacy risks. In this paper, we introduce a framework where IoT Assistants capture and manage the privacy preferences of their users and communicate them to privacy-aware smart buildings, which enforce them when collecting user data or sharing it with building services. We outline elements necessary to support such interactions and also discuss important privacy policy attributes that need to be captured. This includes looking at attributes necessary to describe -- (1) the data collection and sharing practices associated with deployed sensors and services in smart buildings as well as (2) the privacy preferences to help users manage their privacy in such environments.	interaction;internet of things;privacy policy;sensor	Primal Pappachan;Martin Degeling;Roberto Yus;Anupam Das;Sruti Bhagavatula;William Melicher;Pardis Emami Naeini;Shikun Zhang;Lujo Bauer;Alfred Kobsa;Sharad Mehrotra;Norman M.

MCS paves the way to explore new monitoring applications in different fields such as social networks, lifestyle, healthcare, green applications, and intelligent transportation systems. Hence, MCS applications make use of sensing and wireless communication capabilities provided by billions of smart mobile devices, e.g., Android and iOS-based mobile devices. The aim of this paper is to identify and explore the new paradigm of MCS that is using smartphone for capturing and sharing the sensed data between many nodes. We discuss the main components of the infrastructure required to support the proposed framework. The existing and potential applications leveraging MCS are laid out. Furthermore, this paper discusses the current challenges facing the collection methodologies of the participants’ data in task management. The recent issues in the MCS findings are reviewed as well as the opportunities and challenges in sensing methods are analyzed.

ea4192368a6a73f5aa1d45032c7dbf3a6a72055b	exegesis: extreme edge resource harvesting for a virtualized fog environment		Currently there is an active debate about how the existing cloud paradigm can cope with the volume, variety, and velocity of the data generated by end devices (e.g., Internet of Things sensors). It is expected that there will be over 50 billion of these devices by 2020, which will create more than two Exabytes worth of data each day. Additionally, the vast number of edge devices create a huge ocean of digital resources close to the data source, which, however, remain so far unexploited to their full extent. EXEGESIS proposes to harness these unutilized resources via a three-layer architecture that encompasses the mist, fog, and cloud. The mist network is located at the very bottom, where interconnected objects (Internet of Things devices, small servers, etc.) create neighborhoods of objects. This arrangement is enhanced by a virtual fog layer, which allows for dynamic, ad hoc interconnections among the various neighborhoods. At the top layer resides the cloud with its abundant resources that can also be included in one or more virtual fog neighborhoods. Thus, this article complements and leverages existing cloud architectures, enabling them to interact with this new edge-centric ecosystem of devices/resources, and benefit from the fact that critical data are available where they can add the most value.	cloud computing;computer architecture;distance fog;ecosystem;exabyte;fog computing;hoc (programming language);internet of things;programming paradigm;sensor;three-layer architecture;velocity (software development)	Evangelos K.

Fog Computing for on-site data analysis and Blockchain as a decentralized framework are used to establish security and trust. AR enables new interactive scenarios with devices in the industrial environment and provides user interfaces for devices that had previously lacked one. The combination of these technologies in an industrial environment opens up new possibilities and opportunities. We present the IIoT Bazaar, a decentralized marketplace for industrial edge applications that relies on Blockchain to create transparency for all stakeholders involved and to enable the traceability of app installations on edge devices. With Fog Computing, resource-limited edge devices can be integrated into the IIoT Bazaar ecosystem. Fog Nodes enable the provisioning of applications on edge devices and their integration into a decentralized Blockchain network. AR serves as an interface between the users and the machines, allowing people to interact intuitively with the edge devices. With a case study, we demonstrate the design and prototypical implementation of the IIoT Bazaar and its applications which bring software developers and users together using a combination of Fog Computing, AR, and Blockchain.

The precision granted by ADS-B will allow for the network to support the huge growth in air traffic in the coming decades and assist both air traffic controllers and pilots in improving safety in flight. However, the ADS-B protocol has serious security vulnerabilities. Coupled with the importance of ADS-B in the air transportation system, these security issues make ADS-B an appealing target for attack by adversaries. This paper dismisses the need for encryption and focuses security strategies on location verification. Multilateration is combined with data fusion and location tracking for effective and undemanding short-term and long-term location verification.

fe2f9b4dcac14a611264716ab181b48b874ca64a	poster: using clusters of parked cars as virtual vehicular network infrastructure		In future smart cities, cars will be equipped with multiple communication technologies. The Car4ICT architecture aims to exploit such cars for providing services to users. Cars take the role of service hubs and support users in discovering services and utilizing them. So far, Car4ICT has been investigated in urban and rural scenarios, but parked cars have not been considered part of it. As such parked cars are ubiquitous in cities, they help improve the architecture even further by reducing the need to rely on Store-Carry-Forward (SCF) and adding more services. In this paper, we outline our integration of parked cars into the Car4ICT architecture. By combining them into clusters, we are able to add additional network nodes, thus improving the stability of the network topology. Furthermore, members of these clusters are then connected to the Car4ICT network and are able to provide/consume extra services. While there exist solutions for clustering, there are several research questions when integrating such virtual vehicular network infrastructure. We describe our approach and discuss some of the interesting research questions and the problems that have to be solved.	autonomous car;cluster analysis;existential quantification;network topology;smart city	Florian Hagenauer;Christoph Sommer;Takamasa Higuchi;Onur Altintas;Falko Dressler	2016	2016 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2016.7835943	simulation;computer security	HPC	-43.35497464960298	51.60167872647846	107972

In particular, it focuses on addressing the problem of connecting buyers and sellers. An algorithm that uses multiple criteria to match buyers and sellers based on prespecified user profiles was devised and implemented. The process of matching and connecting buyers and sellers are divided in four stages: selection, evaluation, filteringand assignment . Ideas of the approach of connection are realized in a testbed on securities trading consisting of a society of information agents (abroker agent , a recommendation agentand a record agent ) and trading agents (buyerand seller agents) that communicates via a blackboard database. In addition, an information brokering protocolwas devised and implemented to structure the interactions and information exchange among agents in the testbed. A series of experiments that were carried out showed favorable results in executing the protocol.	agent-based model;algorithm;e-commerce;experiment;information exchange;interaction;testbed;user profile	Kwang Mong Sim;Raymond Chan	2000	IEEE Trans.

This paper paves the way to the development of trustworthy pervasive video surveillance systems, by emphasizing the need to properly combine different aspects that current systems do not manage. In particular, in this paper we propose the combination of the following issues into a common framework: proper people identification mainly based on computer vision techniques, content protection not only by using convenient cryptographic techniques, but also law enforcement and user cooperation in order to get feedback with regard to the whole video surveillance system. Furthermore, an analysis focused on the current computer vision techniques used for people identification is presented. Finally, a score to measure the trust offered by video surveillance systems is proposed.	algorithm;closed-circuit television;computer vision;copy protection;cryptography;information system;pervasive informatics;privacy;web application	Antoni Martínez-Ballesté;Hatem A.

The majority of government organizations depends on advanced systems consisting of inter‐ connected computing machines, used to provide public services. This connec‐ tivity and online services have many advantages for users, but also, they become vulnerable in case of a cyber-attack. One of the most targeted systems is the one used in the aviation sector, which is also vulnerable in front of physical threats. Since Sept 11th, 2001, an improvement of terrorist tactics was observed, reason why the security of this sector represents a critical consideration. This paper presents a summary of the ongoing research activities taken to improve the security level of airports and proposes a scalable solution for the integration of several security tools, services and fields.	cloud computing;computer;e-services;malware;scalability;threat (computer)	George Suciu;Andrei Scheianu;Alexandru Vulpe;Ioana Petre;Victor Suciu	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-77700-9_16		Security	-47.03725279805935	50.87454041766384	108314

be4e0f77ad95f91e18827ceee64ec55c6b14da78	on neighbors, groups and application invariants in mobile wireless sensor networks	inf 01 informatica	The miniaturization and energy-efficient operation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) provides unprecedented opportunities for monitoring mobile entities. The motivation for this thesis is drawn from real-world applications including monitoring wildlife, assisted living, and logistics. Nevertheless, mobility unveils a series of problems that do not arise in fixed scenarios. Through applications, we distill three of those, as follows.#R##N##R##N#Neighbor discovery, or knowing the identity of surrounding nodes, is the precondition for any communication between nodes. As compared to other existing solutions, we provide a framework that approaches the problem from the perspectives of latency (the time required to detect an amount of contacts), lifetime (the time nodes are expected to last) and probability (the fraction of contacts guaranteed to be detected within a given latency). By formalizing neighbor discovery as an optimization problem, we obtain a significant improvement w.r.t. the state-of-art. We offer a solver providing the optimal configuration and an implementation for popular WSN devices. #R##N##R##N#Group membership, or knowing the identity of the transitively connected nodes, can be either the direct answer to a requirement (e.g., caring for people that are not self-sufficient), or a building-block for higher-level abstractions. Earlier works on the same problem target either less constrained devices such as PDAs or laptops or, when targeting WSN devices, provide only post-deployment information on the group. Instead, we provide three protocols that cover the solution space. All our protocols empower each node with a#R##N#run-time global view of the group composition. #R##N##R##N#Finally, we focus on the behavior of the processes monitored by WSNs. We present a system that validates whether global invariants describing the safe behavior of a monitored system are satisfied. Although similar problems have been tackled before, the invariants we target are more complex and our system evaluates them in the network, at run-time. We focus on invariants that are expressed as first-order logic formulas over the state of multiple nodes. The requirement for monitoring invariants arises in both fixed and mobile#R##N#environments; we design and implement an efficient solution for each. Noteworthy is that the solution targeting mobility bestows each node with an eventually consistent view on the satisfaction of the monitored invariants; in this context, the group membership algorithms play the role of global failure detectors.

However there is a lack of data services that can be efficiently performed in mobile computing environments. The main reason is that many well-known techniques have to be adapted to the new environment. Particularly, the processing of location-dependent queries is still a subject of research. In this paper we introduce an approach to deal with location-dependent queries posed in mobile environments. A decentralized solution is proposed using mobile agents, which also help in the optimization of the communication effort.	approximation algorithm;database;extrapolation;mathematical optimization;mobile agent;mobile computing;mobile device;petri net;query language;sql;scalability	Sergio Ilarri;Eduardo Mena;Arantza Illarramendi	2001		10.1109/DEXA.2001.953121	mobile search;mobile web;mobile database;computer science;software agent;operating system;mobile technology;mobile agent;mobile device;database;distributed computing;mobile station;mobile computing;world wide web	DB	-34.44887963719585	48.91457234038128	109066
ab88aa0e6506ee3a7db045631d40a289746bf01e	seat: secure energy-efficient automated public transport ticketing system		In smartcard-based travel payment systems, passengers have to place the smartcard near the journey registration devices once each for check-in and check-out to authenticate their travel. This is an annoying process when if the journey involves multiple stops. In this paper, we describe a working system of secure energy-efficient automatic ticketing (SEAT) for public transport, which transforms traditional check-in/check-out system into Be-in/Be-out system. In SEAT, a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) enabled smartphone communicates with registration devices to track the journey for pricing without any human intervention. SEAT is vigilant toward the energy consumption of the BLE device under various conditions, and security and privacy threats to the overall ecosystem. We develop models for energy consumption and latency for BLE devices under the influence of mutual interference based on experiments with 32 BLE devices. We utilize these models to develop an energy-efficient protocol for SEAT that is secure and privacy preserving. Our experiments show that a BLE module consumes only 18.3 J daily under the proposed system model, which is less than 0.1% of the total capacity of a typical smartphone battery.	authentication;bluetooth;communications protocol;ecosystem;experiment;interference (communication);issue tracking system;requirement;scalability;smart card;smartphone;system requirements	Chayan Sarkar;Jan Jaap Treurniet;Sujay Narayana;R.

Jini architecture provides an infrastructure for defining, advertising, and finding services in a network, while .NET lets developers build Internet-based, distributed applications using .NET remoting. These two environments are very similar in many aspects and both are capable of facilitating implementation of distributed programs. However, they are not compatible. Clients in Jini can not request remote services from .NET systems and clients in .NET can not find Jini services. Furthermore, none of these environments provides load-balancing mechanisms. To solve these two problems, this paper integrates Jini and .NET and proposes a smart proxy architecture. Consequently, Jini and .NET services can now make themselves visible to both Jini and .NET clients, and any Jini or .NET client can transparently switch to a less-loaded Jini or .NET service through a smart proxy once the current service is too busy. Specifically, this paper solves two important issues for Jini and .NET: interoperability and dynamic load-balancing. Experimental results show that this technique can dynamically distribute Jini and .NET clients quite evenly over Jini and .NET services when proper load-balancing strategies are implemented onto smart proxies	.net framework;.net remoting;distributed computing environment;interoperability;load balancing (computing);lookup table;regular expression;jini	Ying Chen Lin;Sy-Yuan Li;Yuan-Shin Hwang	2006	2006 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW'06)	10.1109/ICPPW.2006.34	interoperability;the internet;resource allocation;computer science;load balancing;resource management;distributed computing;open system;world wide web;distributed computing environment;computer network	HPC	-33.83996624880334	48.4032207839534	109188

Although designed to support inter-operation, research and practice suggest that existing client-side and server-side frameworks, many times, cannot fully inter-operate. The problem is that, as web services are increasingly being deployed to support business-critical environments, interoperability issues may prevent or impact business transactions, potentially resulting in huge financial and reputation losses. In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of the interoperability of 1024 publicly available web services, against a set of diverse and well-known client-side web service frameworks. We have detected at least one severe interoperability issue in over 53% of the services tested and quite different inter-operation capabilities regarding the client-side frameworks. Results clearly show that, although providers frequently claim interoperability capabilities, urgent improvements are required.	client-side;field research;operations research;soap;server (computing);server-side;ws-i basic profile;web services interoperability;web framework;web service	Ivano Alessandro Elia;Nuno Laranjeiro;Marco Vieira	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing	10.1109/SCC.2014.19	web service;web application security;semantic interoperability;interoperability;middleware;web development;web modeling;business process execution language;web standards;web api;ws-policy;service-oriented architecture;ws-addressing;database;business;internet privacy;ws-i basic profile;web 2.0;cross-domain interoperability;world wide web;universal description discovery and integration;application server	Visualization	-42.891605186032706	54.91420953070394	109500

This paper presents the real-world deployment of a system that exploits public transit bus passengers’ Bluetooth-capable devices to capture and reconstruct micro- and macro-passenger behavior. We present supporting evidence that approximately 12 % of passengers already carry Bluetooth-enabled devices and that the data collected on these passengers captures with almost 80 % accuracy the daily fluctuation of actual passengers flows. The paper makes three contributions in terms of understanding passenger behavior: We verify that the length of passenger trips is exponentially bounded, the frequency of passenger trips follows a power law distribution, and the microstructure of the network of passenger movements is polycentric.	bluetooth;mobile phone;quantum fluctuation;software deployment	Vassilis Kostakos;Tiago Camacho;Claudio Mantero	2013	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-013-0652-4	sustainable transport;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;public transport;bluetooth;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing	HCI	-41.54698376566237	52.67713349808279	109538

Accordingly, this paper explores the notion of cross-source integration of cloud-based, context-aware information in ubiquitous computing through a developed prototypical solution. Moreover, the described solution incorporates remote and automatic configuration of Android smartphones and advances the research area of context-aware information by harvesting information from several sources to build a rich foundation on which algorithms for context-aware computation can be based.

Multi-Agent Systems have proven to be a valuable tool in the areas of cyber security, distributed networks and legacy systems because of their scalable and flexible architecture. In this paper, we present a novel implementation of a Multi-Agent System for use within, or to support, Internet of Things networks through the distributed processing of security events to offload the computational cost of processing data from Internet of Things devices. In particular, domain experts can add new agents to existing systems which can automatically work with preexisting agents without manual reconfiguration. The scalability of this deployment model makes it suitable for a broad range of environments including dynamic and large-area networks.	algorithmic efficiency;computer security;distributed computing;internet of things;legacy system;multi-agent system;network traffic control;personal digital assistant;real-time clock;scalability;software deployment;subject-matter expert	Phillip Kendrick;Abir Hussain;Natalia Criado;Martin Randles	2017		10.1145/3018896.3065844	computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security	Security	-44.344445259270884	52.44315291239484	109882

They are no longer restricted to a single device that is used by a single user. Future web applications are distributed across the borders of heterogeneous devices as a set of interconnected components using a message brokering system. With this approach new challenges arise, e. g., the inclusion of dynamically available devices during the application's load time or the discovery and integration of their capabilities (sensors, communication interfaces or installed apps etc.) at run time. In this paper, we present our ongoing work towards a distributed client-server runtime environment (CSR) that should support the dynamic distribution and user-centered adaptation of composite multi-device web applications -- denoted as distributed mashups.	client–server model;loader (computing);mashup (web application hybrid);mobile device;programming paradigm;run time (program lifecycle phase);runtime system;sensor;server (computing);user-centered design;web application	Oliver Mroß;Klaus Meißner	2014		10.1145/2677356.2677658	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;world wide web	Web+IR	-37.52665715032012	48.26828916190197	109981
b56681b12900336b202a6ed45719d71d5d844a25	sqlite optimization with phase change memory for mobile applications		Given its pervasive use in smart mobile platforms, there is a compelling need to optimize the performance of sluggish SQLite databases. Popular mobile applications such as messenger, email and social network services rely on SQLite for their data management need. Those mobile applications tend to execute relatively short transactions in the autocommit mode for transactional consistency in databases. This often has adverse effect on the flash memory storage in mobile devices because the small random updates cause high write amplification and high write latency. In order to address this problem, we propose a new optimization strategy, called per-page logging (PPL), for mobile data management, and have implemented the key functions in SQLite/PPL. The hardware component of SQLite/PPL includes phase change memory (PCM) with a byte-addressable, persistent memory abstraction. By capturing an update in a physiological log record and adding it to the PCM log sector, SQLite/PPL can replace a multitude of successive page writes made to the same logical page with much smaller log writes done to PCM much more efficiently. We have observed that SQLite/PPL would potentially improve the performance of mobile applications by an order of magnitude while supporting transactional atomicity and durability.	atomicity (database systems);byte addressing;database;durability (database systems);email;flash memory;mathematical optimization;mobile app;mobile device;persistent memory;pervasive informatics;phase-change memory;sqlite;social network;transactional memory	Gi-Hwan Oh;Sangchul Kim;Sang-Won Lee;Bongki Moon	2015	PVLDB	10.14778/2824032.2824044	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;database	DB	-36.106383988477624	56.441507661301614	110075

This service has been developed as a desktop application that can be executed in Android devices. The set of algorithms that determine the crossing order are fed with information about surrounding vehicles: actual and further GPS position, speed and an identification number. The interchange of this information relays in a IEEE 802.11p communications architecture, that is, in a VANET network created ad-hoc among the vehicles are close to the intersection. The reliability of the application depends on the probability that the vehicles would be able to share this information, so before testing I-CROSS, the communication link must be checked in different scenarios. In this paper the results of these tests are shown and a description of the I-CROSS is also included.	algorithm;android;artificial intelligence;desktop computer;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);identifier;relay;vehicle-to-vehicle	Unai Hernández-Jayo;Idoia De-la-Iglesia;Inigo Lacoume;Aboobeker Sidhik Koyamparambil Mammu	2013	2013 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference	10.1109/VNC.2013.6737614	vehicular ad hoc network;embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-39.996187870794444	54.986904992347	110211

Unfortunately, users enjoy these conveniences at the cost of revealing their personal data. Furthermore, an important factor called social strength, which impacts the discovering result a lot, is always ignored. To address these problems, we propose S-match, which aims to achieve secure friend discovery in social strength-aware PMSNs. Specifically, S-match exploits a two-dimensional similarity vector with considering both priority-aware similarity coefficient and social strength-aware similarity coefficient. We construct a similarity evaluation model based on entropy method to measure profile similarity, as well as a novel priority-aware similarity coefficient by improving Jaccard similarity function. Finally, the combination of the homomorphic property and the priority-aware similarity coefficient guarantee the avoidance on the insider attacks. The security and performance are thoroughly analyzed and evaluated via detailed simulations.	bluetooth;coefficient;correctness (computer science);cryptosystem;embedded system;interaction;jaccard index;personally identifiable information;scsi initiator and target;similarity measure;simulation;smartphone	Ben Niu;Yuanyuan He;Fenghua Li;Hui Li	2015	MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357567	computer science;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security	DB	-38.72303325975823	58.87401829865525	110308

The task of designing and ensuring the correctness of applications in these environments is similarly becoming more complex. The unified goal of much of the research in distributed wireless systems is to provide higher-level abstractions of complex low-level concepts to application programmers, easing the design and implementation of applications. A new and growing class of applications for wireless sensor networks require similar complexity encapsulation. However, sensor networks have some unique characteristics, including dynamic availability of data sources and application quality of service requirements, that are not common to other types of applications. These unique features, combined with the inherent distribution of sensors, and limited energy and bandwidth resources, dictate the need for network functionality and the individual sensors to be controlled to best serve the application requirements. In this article, we describe different types of sensor network applications and discuss existing techniques for managing these types of networks. We also overview a variety of related middleware and argue that no existing approach provides all the management tools required by sensor network applications. To meet this need, we have developed a new middleware called MiLAN. MiLAN allows applications to specify a policy for managing the network and sensors, but the actual implementation of this policy is effected within MiLAN. We describe MiLAN and show its effectiveness through the design of a sensor-based personal health monitor.	correctness (computer science);encapsulation (networking);high- and low-level;middleware;non-functional requirement;programmer;sensor	Wendi B.

The pillars of the future wireless society will be the trustworthiness of the wireless positioning device and ecofriendliness of the transmission-reception process. These are triggered by the user needs, preferences and targeted applications, and by the type of the environment where navigation takes place. A link is still missing between these user needs/environment awareness (or application layer) and the physical layer where the wireless device is actually designed. The missing link can be created by cognitive approaches, borrowed on one hand from cognitive human behavior, and on the other hand from cognitive computing. Building a cognition stage between the application and physical layers will create a myriad of new possibilities for flexible location-based services and positioning-based applications, and possibly a new paradigm in wireless location research. MULTI-POS training network is bridging the gap between the lower technology layer and upper application layer involved in wireless mobile location. In addition, MULTI-POS will offer comprehensive training to young fellows in the broad field of wireless location, will create novel technologies and business models for the future location-enabled wireless devices, will promote the exchange of fellows in mixed academic-industrial R&D trajectories and in multiple European cultures, and will initiate an educational and research framework that unifies the currently fragmented research activities on technological and applications aspects of wireless navigation. There is strong involvement of industrial partners in the network to accomplish this.	bridging (networking);cognition;cognitive computing;list of code lyoko episodes;location-based service;programming paradigm;trust (emotion)	Jari Nurmi;Francescantonio Della Rosa;Elena Simona Lohan	2014	International Conference on Localization and GNSS 2014 (ICL-GNSS 2014)	10.1109/ICL-GNSS.2014.6934174	simulation;wireless wan;wireless site survey;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;wireless network;hybrid positioning system	Mobile	-43.849304393754295	49.804448009321554	110379

Candidate compositions are vulnerable to such instability. We propose a novel approach to improve performance stability by leveraging on the principles of design diversity in service composition(s). The approach uses portfolio theory to construct a diversified composition of candidate services that share lowest possible correlation for their performances. We use an exemplar to illustrate the applicability of the approach. Controlled experiments are used to test the approach effectiveness in improving the performance stability of CSC. While the scalability of our approach is evaluated, we report on its sensitivity and effectiveness under multiple correlation settings.	cloud computing;computation;experiment;instability;mathematical optimization;modern portfolio theory;open-source software;performance;prototype;scalability;universal conductance fluctuations	Faisal Alrebeish;Rami Bahsoon	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services	10.1109/ICWS.2015.11	web service;von neumann stability analysis;simulation;cloud computing;computer science;information security;modern portfolio theory;operating system;law;correlation	SE	-48.15744932130839	56.62517111476236	110416

In the beginning of the 1990s a vehicle control system was built up by ‘simple’ computer nodes exchanging ‘simple’ and relatively non-critical data. Today we have moved into distributed vehicle control systems with functions spanning several nodes from different vendors. These systems are running on communication architectures consisting of different types of communication busses providing different functionality, from advanced control to entertainment. The challenge is cost efficient development of these systems, with respect to business, functionality, architecture, standards and quality for the automotive industry. In this article we present three different architectures – used in passenger cars, trucks, and construction equipment. Based on these case studies with different business and functionality demands, we will provide an analysis identifying commonalities, differences, and discussing how the different demands are reflected in the network architectures.	advanced process control;autonomous car;bus (computing);control system;cost efficiency;file spanning;network architecture	Jakob Axelsson;Joakim Fröberg;Hans A.

2814796d27070806a2211ed203ab9b74573f27a8	a secure service provisioning framework for cyber physical cloud computing systems		Cyber physical systems (CPS) are mission critical systems engineered by combination of cyber and physical systems respectively. These systems are tightly coupled, resource constrained systems and have dynamic real time applications. Due to the limitation of resources, and in order to improve the efficiency of the CPS systems, they are combined with cloud computing architecture, and are called as Cyber Physical Cloud Computing Systems (CPCCS). These CPCCS have critical care applications where security of the systems is a major concern. Therefore, we propose a Secure Service provisioning architecture for Cyber Physical Cloud Computing Systems (CPCCS), which includes the combination of technologies such as CPS, Cloud Computing and Wireless Sensor Networks.

An ICT-infrastructure handles data and information and encompasses devices and networks, protocols and procedures including Internet, Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. The current challenges of ICT-infrastructures are delivering services and applications that are requested by users, such as residents, public organisations and institutions. These services and applications must be combined to enhance and enrich the environment and provide personalised services. This requires radical changes in technology, such as dynamic ICT-infrastructures, which should dynamically provide requested services to be able to build smart societies. This paper is about pursuing smart and connected cities and communities by creating smart volatile ICT-infrastructures for smart cities and communities, called Ipsum. The infrastructure is of multidisciplinary art and includes different kinds of hardware, software, artificial intelligence techniques depending on the available parts and the services to be delivered. The goal is to provide a powerful and smart, and cost-saving volatile ICT-infrastructure with person-centred, ubiquitous and malleable parts, i.e., devices, sensors and services. Volatile means in real-time constitute a volatile network of devices and deploying it into cities and communities. Ipsum will be smart everywhere by collaborating with several different hardware and software systems and cooperating to perform complex tasks. By including ubiquitous and malleable parts in the infrastructure, Ipsum can facilitate an informed and engaged populace.

Typical solutions entail specialized infrastructure support for authentication, encryption and access control. Mobile applications executing over ad hoc wireless networks present designers with a rather distinct set of security requirements. A totally open setting and limited resources call for lightweight and highly decentralized security solutions. In this paper we propose an approach that relies on extending an existing coordination middleware for mobility (Lime). The need to continue to offer a very simple model of coordination that assures rapid software development led to limiting extensions solely to password protected tuple spaces and per tuple access control. Password distribution and security are relegated to the application realm. Host level security is ensured by the middleware design and relies on standard support provided by the Java system. Secure interactions among agents across hosts are accomplished by careful exploitation of the interceptor pattern and the use of standard encryption. The paper explains the design strategy used to add security support in Lime and its implications for the development of mobile applications over ad hoc networks.	access control;authentication;dashboard;distributed computing;encryption;hoc (programming language);interaction;interceptor pattern;java;middleware;mobile app;password;requirement;software development;spaces;tuple space;lime	Radu Handorean;Gruia-Catalin Roman	2003	Electr.

8f333ffa25b6ad19f6525346ff9996e8242f13ca	enhancing the trustworthiness of service on-demand systems via smart vote filtering		Service on-demand (SoD) systems allow their users to regulate the sharing of common resources via a voting process. A common application example is the collaborative scheduling of multimedia transmissions in e-radio or video streaming services. Therefore, high user commitment and participation is critical to the success of a SoD system. Securing a SoD system against common attacks, such as vote flooding, can impose client anonymity retraction, online registering and access control mechanisms. Nonetheless, such processes can degrade the users’ quality of experience, discouraging user participation. The present study proposes a defense mechanism against vote flooding attacks that can operate under complete vote anonymity and without any user access restrictions. The novel scheme is implemented as a vote filtering scheme, executed prior to each service scheduling decision. The proposed scheme has linear complexity and is shown via simulations to considerably mitigate or completely negate the effects of several attacks types.	access control;add-ons for firefox;calendaring software;control system;scheduling (computing);simulation;smart tv;streaming media;trust (emotion);usability	Christos V.

Moreover, we have investigated technologies that can be used to implement a content management system in a distributed environment. Based on these, this paper introduces the Visual REST content management system that provides a uniform way to manage the content stored in all of the devices with the same user-friendly and efficient principles.

Driven by the trend of different mobility and service ubiquity, the service convergence comes into sight as a promising solution facing the NGS context. Moreover, reengineering is needed for the delivery of the converged services. Existing solutions as IN, SOA and WS have not been able to completely cover all the converged service delivery needs. This paper proposes to redesign the service by modelling its structure and converged interfaces. We proposed a loose coupling between service elements (service composition) as well as a more flexible deployment of services (service aggregation) in order to meet converged service delivery.	authentication;autonomy;code refactoring;communications satellite;generic programming;itil;loose coupling;network convergence;next-generation network;programming paradigm;service composability principle;service-oriented architecture;software deployment;state diagram	Noëmie Simoni;Chunyang Yin;Philippe Coude	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing	10.1109/SCC.2010.61	service level requirement;service product management;differentiated service;service delivery framework;business;data as a service;world wide web;converged infrastructure;computer security;computer network	HPC	-36.79742277890835	49.33709381580417	111893

(security of converging future architectures for personalized services : architectural and protocol aspects)		The emergence and evolution of Next Generation Networks (NGN) have raised several challenges mainly in terms of heterogeneity, mobility and security. In fact, the user is able, in such environment, to have access to many networks, via multiple devices, with a vast choice of services offered by different providers. Furthermore, end-users claim to be constantly connected anywhere, anytime and anyhow. Besides, they want to have a secure access to their services through a dynamic, seamless and continuous session according to their preferences and the desired QoS. In this context, security represents an important concern. In fact, this user-centric session should obviously be secured. However, many challenges arise. In such environment, system boundaries, which were well delimited, become increasingly open. Indeed, there are multiple services which are unknown in advance and multiple communications between services and with users. Besides, heterogeneity of involved resources (terminals, networks and services) in the user session increases the complexity of security tasks. In addition, the different types of mobility (user, terminal, network and service mobility) affect the user-centric session that should be unique, secure and seamless and ensure continuity of services. This open, heterogeneous and mobile environment presents significant risks in terms of security and becomes increasingly vulnerable. Therefore, a new security solution, which responds to user-centric requirements in NGN environment, should be provided. For this purpose, we propose a novel security architecture which ensures a dynamic and seamless security service composition (Securityware). This architecture is organized in four visibility levels (equipment, network, service and user) and each resource (terminal, network and service) is considered as a service component. Thus, we aim through our proposal based on security as a service approach to ensure a secure service ac-cess and to guard security continuity within a seam-less session.To control and evaluate security in our architecture, an audit service based on QoS is proposed. In the protocol level, we propose SIP+ protocol which represents an extended version from Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that permits to establish a personalized and mobile service session. It is based on QoS (Quality of Service) negotiation to maintain the required end-to-end QoS. To achieve security requirements, we should also secure the proposed SIP+ protocol against the potential attacks and vulnerabilities in order to provide a secure service session while respecting our user-centric needs. Therefore, we introduce a Token Security which furthers end-to-end session continuity and manages security continuity during mobility and user context change. This Token permits to have a unique user authentication in a cross-organizational environment.	anytime algorithm;authentication;bibliothèque de l'école des chartes;computer security;computer terminal;delimiter;emergence;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;futures and promises;linear algebra;next-generation network;personalization;quality of service;requirement;scott continuity;seamless3d;security as a service;security service (telecommunication);service composability principle;unique user	Ali Hammami	2013				Security	-44.46021511734022	54.56449684867979	112394

Its purpose is to ensure the storage of web application's data in the device of the user rather than in the server side. With HTM5, the storage is no more achieved by proprietary solution as it is ensured by standardized APIs. However, with this new functionality that improves the user's quality of experience, it is crucial to reassure the end user about his data protection when they are stored locally and when they are externalized. In this work, our contribution deals with the assurance and security of data stored by HTML5 APIs. These measures are integrated into the browser to be performed automatically. In fact, data will be stored safely in a secure local space devoted to each user. As a proof of concept, we implemented our approach on the chromium browser, and we studied its performances.	chromium (web browser);computer data storage;html5;information privacy;performance;server-side;web application	Mayssa Jemel;Ahmed Serhrouchni	2014	2014 10th International Conference on Information Assurance and Security	10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064619	computer science;database;internet privacy;information repository;world wide web	DB	-42.81400510301991	59.333166764950114	112400

Recent work on scaling infrastructure for conventional web services using distributed approaches can be applied to the mobile space, but limitations inherent to mobile devices (computational power, battery life) and their communication infrastructure (availability and quality of network connectivity) challenge system designers to carefully design and optimize their software architectures. Additionally, notions of mobility and position in space, unique to mobile systems, provide interesting directions for the segmentation and scalability of mobile information systems. In this paper we describe the implementation of a mobile recommender system for leisure activities, codenamed Magitti, which was built for commercial deployment under stringent scalability requirements. We present concrete solutions addressing these scalability challenges, with the goal of informing the design of future mobile multi-user systems.	image scaling;information system;mobile device;multi-user;recommender system;requirement;scalability;sensor;software deployment;web service	Michael Roberts;Nicolas Ducheneaut;James Begole;Kurt Partridge;Bob Price;Victoria Bellotti;Alan Walendowski;Paul Rasmussen	2008	2008 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks	10.1109/WOWMOM.2008.4594884	web service;real-time computing;mobile search;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;mobile business development;mobile computing;world wide web;recommender system;computer network	Mobile	-39.74239193650568	49.89100471341754	112484

In this paradigm, everyday and physical objects are being equipped with capabilities to detect and communicate information they receive from their environment, turning them into smart objects. However, such entities are usually deployed on environments with changing and dynamic conditions, which can be used by them to modify their operation or behavior. Under the foundations of EU FP7 SocIoTal project, this work provides an overview about how contextual information can be taken into account by smart objects when making security decisions, by considering such information as a first-class component, in order to realize the so-called context-aware security on IoT scenarios.	context awareness;entity;future internet;interaction;internet of things;programming paradigm;requirement;sim lock;smart objects;ubiquitous computing	José Luis Hernández Ramos;Jorge Bernal Bernabé;Antonio F.

This is generating an increasing demand for homogeneous mechanisms to access, publish and share real-world information. This paper discusses, first, an architectural solution based on Next Generation Networks: a pilot Telco Ubiquitous Sensor Network (USN) Platform that embeds several OGC® Sensor Web services. This platform has already been deployed in large scale projects. Second, the USN-Platform is extended to explore a first approach to Semantic Sensor Web principles and technologies, so that smart devices can access Sensor Web data, allowing them also to share richer (semantically interpreted) information. An experimental scenario is presented: a smart car that consumes and produces real-world information which is integrated into the Semantic Sensor Web through a Telco USN-Platform. Performance tests revealed that observation publishing times with our experimental system were well within limits compatible with the adequate operation of smart safety assistance systems in vehicles. On the other hand, response times for complex queries on large repositories may be inappropriate for rapid reaction needs.	anatomic node;annotation;apache cassandra;big data;chimeric antigen receptor;computation (action);distributed computing;drug vehicle;emergency medical service;experiment;experimental system;future internet;genetic heterogeneity;incubators (device);interpretation process;mathematical optimization;mongodb;neural network simulation;next-generation network;ontology (information science);physical object;population;programming languages;rdfa;registration;repository;slc25a11 gene;scalability;semantic sensor web;semantic web;sensor observation service;smart device;smart system;social security number;specification;subscriber identity module;web service;xlink;benefit	David Díaz Pardo de Vera;Álvaro Sigüenza Izquierdo;Jesús Bernat Vercher;Luis A.

7e51b9c58fba47a2c0056c217221cf803f28b860	privacy aware recommender service using multi-agent middleware- an iptv network scenario		IPTV service providers are starting to realize the significant value of recommender services in attracting and satisfying customers as they offer added values e.g. by delivering suitable personalized contents according to customers personal interests in a seamless way, increase content sales and gain competitive advantage over other competitors. However the current implementations of recommender services are mostly centralized combined with collecting data from multiple users that cover personal preferences about different contents they watched or purchased. These profiles are stored at third-party providers that might be operating under different legal jurisdictions related to data privacy laws rather than the ones applied where the service is consumed. From privacy perspective, so far they are all based on either a trusted third party model or on some generalization model. In this work, we address the issue of maintaining users’ privacy when using third-party recommender services and introduce a framework for Private Recommender Service (PRS) based on Enhanced Middleware for Collaborative Privacy (EMCP) running at user side. In our framework, PRS uses platform for privacy preferences (P3P) policies for specifying their data usage practices. While EMCP allows the users to use P3P policies exchange language (APPEL) for specifying their privacy preferences for the data extracted from their profiles. Moreover, EMCP executes a two-stage concealment process on the extracted data which utilize trust mechanism to augment the recommendation’s accuracy and privacy. In such case, the users have a complete control over the privacy level of their profiles and they can submit their preferences in an obfuscated form without revealing any information about their data, the further computation of recommendation proceeds over the obfuscated data using secure multi-party computation protocol. We also provide an IPTV network scenario and experimentation results. Our results and analysis shows that our two-stage concealment process not only protect the users’ privacy, but also can maintain the recommendation accuracy.	adobe flash player;aggregate data;approximation error;centralized computing;collaborative filtering;encryption;experiment;game theory;iptv;information privacy;mathematical optimization;middleware;multi-user;network topology;network traffic control;obfuscation (software);p3p;personalization;privacy law;privacy policy;procedural reasoning system;recommender system;seamless3d;secure multi-party computation;software propagation;third-party software component;tree network;trusted third party	Ahmed M.

A problem to be solved by grid systems is to ensure consistent access control. This problem is complicated because the hosts in a grid computing environment usually span multiple autonomous administrative domains. This paper presents a grid access control model, based on asynchronous automata theory and the classic Bell-LaPadula model. This model is useful to formally study the confidentiality and integrity problems in a grid computing environment. A theorem is proved, which gives the necessary and sufficient conditions to a grid to maintain confidentiality. These conditions are the formalized descriptions of local (node) relations or relationship between grid subjects and node subjects.	access control;authentication;automata theory;autonomous robot;bell–lapadula model;confidentiality;grid systems corporation;grid computing;node (computer science)	Zhiwei Xu;Guanying Bu	2003	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/BF02948926	grid file;semantic grid;computer science;access control;theoretical computer science;data grid;automata theory;distributed computing;grid;computer security;grid computing	HPC	-46.71056329469201	53.337330777291996	114066

Computing architecture and nature of access changed drastically the format of service-delivery model. Technologies like mobile and cloud make computing power globally/universally available. Mobile offers computing on move and cloud provides ilities (Availability, Scalability, and Reliability) of computing resources on service-based economic model. The integration of both the technologies offers IT infrastructure/services on move, anywhere, any time (always on), anyhow (in disruptive environment) and to anybody (for all types of users) or simply we termed as mobile cloud access 24X7X365. The scalable provision of services and more effective use of resources is reason to be emerged as a potential technology (i.e. Mobile Cloud Computing) for mobile services. It overcomes obstacles related to the performance in mobile environment, guaranteed for the availability of resources, assures security, provide intelligent services, transforming the internet computing infrastructure, and broad network access to mobile users. This technology brings innovation in terms of resources and changed the functional architecture of resources-limited device to resources-rich environment. Intensive mobile users need to process high performance computing applications when they are on move, which is most desirable for their professional assignments; they need the service technology always-on. Our research contribution in this paper is to investigate the mobile cloud technology infrastructure, various service frame-works, service models that exist, benefits of mobile cloud, threats and challenges, future approach, and to find services offering by the technology for all types of mobile cloud users.	access network;anytime algorithm;high availability;internet;middleware;mobile cloud computing;non-functional requirement;scalability;supercomputer	Khalid Mohiuddin;Asharul Islam;Aftab Alam;Awais Ali	2012		10.1145/2381716.2381820	cloud computing security;radio access network;mobile search;simulation;mobile web;cloud computing;engineering;mobile technology;utility computing;mobile business development;services computing;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;provisioning;mobile payment	HPC	-41.21101535507049	55.25026485496734	114205

819c21059eed6ef6317c4229ae47841dbdb1bd1c	smart device prototype for automated emergency calls - using sip and tts to reach legacy emergency services		The Internet-of-Things (IoT) promises to transform our society into smart environments, incorporating smart objects that cooperate to fulfil specific goals. Amongst its many applications, emergencies can also benefit from IoT principles and use of automation for a better emergency response and reducing the number of fatalities. Smart devices can be used to detect emergency events (e.g., fire, presence of hazardous gases). In this paper, we present a prototype applying the IoT paradigm to the concept of automated calls. The prototype is capable to measure environmental parameters such as smoke, temperature and gas to determine the occurrence of a serious incident (e.g., fire in room) and automatically initiate an emergency call. To make our approach interoperable with most platforms and operational practices (including emergency services that mostly rely on voice calls), the system generates an audio call using preformatted messages and a text-to-speech engine. Our approach brings the benefits of automated calls without requiring significant investments to existing infrastructures (including those used by emergency services).	interoperability;netware file system;next-generation network;programming paradigm;prototype;response time (technology);smart device;smart environment;smart objects;speech synthesis	Mihai Buf;Marco Manso;Barbara Guerra	2018		10.5220/0006631401150121	smart device;computer network;computer science	HCI	-45.3190191909095	46.97904915486557	114475

However, this advanced degree of connectivity also increases the network security management complexity. Most of this complexity results form the need of controlling the connectivity of each network with respect to the others and the Internet. Also, it is necessary to take into account changes on users, shared resources and services, not only in the local network, but also in the interconnected networks. Because of these changes, network administrators are systematically confronted with firewall and other network elements reconfiguration. This paper proposes the use of a LDAP global directory service to simplify the task of managing the security in large-scale networks. By taking advantage of the distributed features of directory services, the paper defines a strategy for managing a group of interconnected networks as a single entity, without removing the administration autonomy of each independent network.	lightweight directory access protocol;security management	Edgard Jamhour	2001		10.1109/SCCC.2001.972642	directory service;network management station;network security;business;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-45.40641372545094	54.98776001376649	114886
d862975b5713394833512e0575398d98e0b61247	classification of hidden users’ profiles in wireless communications		The Internet can be seen as a mix of several services and applications running on top of common protocols. The emergence of several web-applications changed the users’ interaction paradigm by placing them in a more active role allowing them to share photos, videos and much more. The analysis of the profile of each user, both in wired and wireless networks, becomes very interesting for tasks such as network resources optimization, service personalization and security. In this paper, we propose a promiscuous wireless passive monitoring classification approach that can accurately create users’ profiles in terms of the used web-applications and does not require authentication with the wireless Access Point. By extracting appropriate layer 2 traffic metrics, performing a Wavelet Decomposition and analyzing the obtained scalograms, it is possible to analyze the traffic’s time and frequency components. An appropriate communication profile can then be defined in order to describe this frequency spectrum which is characteristic to each web-based application. Consequently, it is possible to identify the applications that are being used by the different connected clients and build user-profiles. Wireless traffic generated by several connected clients running some of the most significant web-based applications was captured and analyzed and the obtained results show that it is possible to obtain an accurate application traffic mapping and an accurate user profiling.	authentication;computer security;emergence;internet;mathematical optimization;personalization;programming paradigm;spectral density;wavelet;web application;wireless access point	Eduardo Rocha;Paulo Salvador;António Nogueira	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-30422-4_1	speech recognition;multimedia	Metrics	-38.20977789278057	50.87521121135459	114984

However such design features have begun to be developed currently following a pre-Web Services approach in two aspects: in the first place making a clear separation of authentication from authorization issues, and in the second place not designing them over the OGSI/WSRF defined mechanisms and specifications. In this paper we are proposing a new Security Framework that unifies identified common points of both features, Authentication and Authorization, into a mechanism called validation policy which is expected to improve service performance and security. Our framework seeks to implement these aspects over the Grid Service’s Operations and Service Data concepts to fully exploit its functionalities. The paper also presents the integration of an enhanced OCSP Service Provider into the Globus Toolkit 3.9.4 as a first proof of concept.	authentication;authorization;online certificate status protocol;open grid services architecture;open grid services infrastructure;requirement;state (computer science);web service	Jesus Luna;Manuel Medina;Oscar Manso	2005		10.1007/11533733_3	service level requirement;computer science;service delivery framework;operating system;service design;authentication;database;world wide web;computer security	HPC	-34.89397564924953	59.715324688329666	115042

The key challenges for such monitoring services are characterized by the combination of spatial and non-spatial attributes being monitored and the wide spectrum of update rates. A typical example of such services is """"alert me when the gas price at a gas station within 5 miles of my current location drops to 4 per gallon"""". Such a service needs to monitor the gas price changes in conjunction with the highly dynamic nature of location information. Scalability of such location sensitive and content rich information monitoring services in the presence of different update rates and monitoring thresholds poses a big technical challenge. In this paper, we present SLIM, a scalable location sensitive information monitoring service framework with two unique features. First, we make intelligent use of the correlation between spatial and non-spatial attributes involved in the information monitoring service requests to devise a highly scalable distributed spatial trigger evaluation engine. Second, we introduce single and multi-dimensional safe value containment techniques to efficiently perform selective distributed processing of spatial triggers to reduce the amount of unnecessary trigger evaluations. Through extensive experiments, we show that SLIM offers high scalability for location-sensitive, content-rich information monitoring services in terms of the number of information sources being monitored, number of users and monitoring requests."""	distributed computing;experiment;information sensitivity;scalability	Bhuvan Bamba;Kun-Lung Wu;Bugra Gedik;Ling Liu	2013	2013 IEEE 20th International Conference on Web Services	10.1109/ICWS.2013.17	computer science;operating system;group method of data handling;data mining;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security	DB	-38.56109111974981	59.976264038535255	115095

Identity federation facilitates user interaction with Web services that control access, but it is more difficult for a service provider to evaluate the assurance of a user's identity if the creation and propagation of user authentication assertions involve different authentication authorities and mediators. On the basis of this formal representation, an aggregated trust value is calculated for evaluating the trustworthiness of a user's identity from the user's authentication assertions propagated through multiple entities.	authentication;federated identity;identity management system;trust metric	Hidehito Gomi	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-22444-7_8	computer science;multi-factor authentication;authentication;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;identity management	DB	-46.972692841860564	54.99787367220395	115385

However, most of the current mobile storage systems can only provide simple storage service with certain degree of security guarantee, and ignore the distinctive characteristics and requirements of mobile users. In this paper, we present a lightweight mobile storage platform, which is constructed by cloud storage technology and several innovative mechanisms are incorporated for providing better file query experience, enhanced data security, and optimised energy-efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the prototype implementation, and the results indicate that it is effective to obtain better tradeoffs between QoS performance and energy consumption.	cloud computing;mobile computing	Xiao Peng;Runtong Chen;Xilong Qu	2017	IJICT	10.1504/IJICT.2017.10004806	computer network;quality of service;information repository;computer science;cloud computing;cloud storage;data security;mobile computing;cloud computing security;converged storage	DB	-41.86829059625154	59.44163126310268	115418
17917901f724f87ccecc3637023b11cc1a414211	procmotive: bringing programmability and connectivity into isolated vehicles		In recent years, numerous vehicular technologies, e.g., cruise control and steering assistant, have been proposed and deployed to improve the driving experience, passenger safety, and vehicle performance. Despite the existence of several novel vehicular applications in the literature, there still exists a significant gap between resources needed for a variety of vehicular (in particular, data-dominant, latency-sensitive, and computationally-heavy) applications and the capabilities of already-in-market vehicles. To address this gap, different smartphone-/Cloud-based approaches have been proposed that utilize the external computational/storage resources to enable new applications. However, their acceptance and application domain are still very limited due to programmability, wireless connectivity, and performance limitations, along with several security/privacy concerns.  In this paper, we present a novel reference architecture that can potentially enable rapid development of various vehicular applications while addressing shortcomings of smartphone-/Cloud-based approaches. The architecture is formed around a core component, called SmartCore, a privacy/security-friendly programmable dongle that brings general-purpose computational and storage resources to the vehicle and hosts in-vehicle applications. Based on the proposed architecture, we develop an application development framework for vehicles, that we call ProCMotive. ProCMotive enables developers to build customized vehicular applications along the Cloud-to-edge continuum, i.e., different functions of an application can be distributed across SmartCore, the user's personal devices, and the Cloud.  In order to highlight potential benefits that the framework provides, we design and develop two different vehicular applications based on ProCMotive, namely, Amber Response and Insurance Monitor. We evaluate these applications using real-world data and compare them with state-of-the-art technologies.		Arsalan Mosenia;Jad F.

Many users want to separate work and personal use of smartphones for security and privacy consideration, but it is very inconvenient to carry multiple smartphones. Multi-boot and virtualization are two existing techniques used to solve this problem. In this paper, we present a prototype on which multiple Android instances can time-share one ARM platform by using suspend and resume mechanism. We describe the design and implementation of our prototype and evaluate its performance. The performance result shows that our implementation imposes negligible time overhead, and the switching speed is much faster than the multi-boot approach. We also avoid a huge number of modified code lines, considerable memory occupation and significant performance penalty of the virtualization solution.	android (robot)	Zhijiao Zhang;Y.

Despite its huge potential value, one can foresee considerable drawbacks and undesirable potential uses of it in terms of privacy. In specific, the pervasive computing paradigm raises the level of the challenge to protect privacy of end-users, mainly due to the fact that devices operating in such an environment will be embedded in the fabric of the everyday life and will exhibit enhanced tracking and profiling capabilities. What is needed, inter alia, is appropriate mechanisms that are able to evolve with the needs of the users and interact with them in order to meet their privacy requirements. In this paper we suggest the foundations of a new Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET), with respect to the basic characteristics and implications introduced by pervasive environments.	embedded system;entity;holism;identity management;pervasive informatics;polyethylene terephthalate;privacy;privacy-enhanced electronic mail;profiling (computer programming);programming paradigm;requirement;ubiquitous computing	Stelios Dritsas;John Tsaparas;Dimitris Gritzalis	2006		10.1007/11824633_11	context-aware pervasive systems;simulation;confidentiality;telecommunications;computer science;tracking;mobile computing;computer security	DB	-45.54151526258282	58.916844855043145	115933

Among all the required features for a typical team collaboration application, shared storage for referred documents or produced artifacts by the team is a must-have one. However, existing shared storage solutions for team collaboration applications are far from satisfaction. Some of them rely on self-built storage infrastructure, which could be a big burden, especially for those small or medium vendors. With the prevalence of personal cloud storage services, such as Dropbox and Google Drive, more team collaboration applications allow users to share files from their personal cloud-storage spaces through external shared links, which can partly solve the problem. However, this method is not convenient for team collaboration, neither safe enough. This paper presents an approach to leverage third-part personal cloud-storage services to provide shared storage for team collaboration applications. Compared to existing approaches, our approach provides sophisticated mechanisms to make sure it's more convenient and safer. It brings benefits in three folds: for users, it improves the utilization of personal cloud storage space, for vendors of personal cloud storage service, it helps attract users to use their services, for vendors of team collaboration applications, it reduces the burden of developing self-built storage infrastructure. The approach has been tested in kAct, a task-based team collaboration application provided by Kingdee, and the results are promising.	cloud computing;cloud storage;document;dropbox;features new to windows 8;google drive;personal cloud;world wide web	Ke Ning;Zhangbing Zhou;Liang-Jie Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing	10.1109/SCC.2014.86	simulation;converged storage;cloud computing;engineering;internet privacy;world wide web	SE	-41.70157664630392	57.030350878912756	115950

23f40a3407fa6f175244716616f43c5602519c4b	towards a middleware for context-aware health monitoring		The surge of commodity devices, sensors and apps allows for the continuous monitoring of patient’s health status with relatively lowcost technology. Nonetheless, current solutions focus on presenting data and target at individual health metrics and not intelligent recommendations. In order to advance the state-of-the-art, there is a demand for models that correlate mobile sensor data, health parameters, and situational and/or social environment. We seek to improve current models by combining environmental monitoring, personal data collecting, and predictive analytics. For that, we introduce a middleware called Device Nimbus that provides the structures to integrate data from sensors in existing mobile computing technology. Moreover, it includes the algorithms for context inference and recommendation support. This development leads to innovative solutions in continuous health monitoring, based on recommendations contextualised in the situation and social environment. In this paper we propose a model, position it against state-of-the-art, and outline a proof-of-concept implementation.	algorithm;business ecosystem;context awareness;data retrieval;design rationale;end-to-end principle;extensibility;intelligent agent;middleware;mobile computing;personalization;personally identifiable information;preprocessor;requirement;sensor;web standards	Eduardo Araujo Oliveira;Fernando Luiz Koch;Michael Kirley;Carlos Victor G. dos Passos Barros	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24804-2_2	environmental monitoring;predictive analytics;computer science;social environment;intelligent agent;data mining;middleware;mobile computing;continuous monitoring;inference	HCI	-41.943075571218614	49.38909371346011	116374

Naturally, IoT applications and intelligent sensing systems supported by sensing devices, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), are closely coupled. Modern intelligent sensing systems generate huge volumes of sensing data, well beyond the processing capabilities of common techniques and tools. As a result, collecting, managing, and processing IoT big sensing data within an acceptable time duration is a new challenge for both research and industrial applications. The massive size, extreme complexity, and high speed of big sensing data bring new technical requirements including data collection, data storage, data organization, data analysis, and data publishing in real time when deploying real-world IoT applications. To better facilitate these IoT applications, the convergent research of WSNs, big data, the IoT, and cloud computing is a natural scientific development trend. In this article, we concentrate on big-sensing-data curation and preparation issues with cloud computing under the theme of the IoT. There are three especially critical issues that need to be addressed: scalable big-sensing-data cleaning, scalable big-sensing-data compression, and cloud-based data curation response for IoT device optimization. Viewed from the IoT side, all IoT sensing devices are integrated together in an adaptive solution and upload their data onto the cloud. The automatic responses from both the cloud and intelligent sensors will change the status or behavior of sensing devices and, therefore, the status of the IoT itself.	big data;cloud computing;computer data storage;data acquisition;data compression;data curation;digital curation;internet of things;mathematical optimization;plasma cleaning;requirement;scalability;sensor;upload	Chi Yang;Deepak Puthal;Saraju P.

The design has adhered to open grid standards and specifications, and is based upon a modular layered approach so that any existing or emerging authorisation mechanisms or solutions can easily be plugged into or unplugged from the architecture. In addition, the architecture can inter-work with and be easily integrated with other grid security building blocks.	authorization;bridging (networking);defense in depth (computing);grid computing;pervasive informatics;ubiquitous computing	Jay Chin;Ning Zhang;Aleksandra Nenadic;Li Yao;J.

2a3df099df7c9a2af8539ea810182681e4764fd9	an intercepting api-based access control approach for mobile applications		Mobile device users employ mobile applications to realize tasks once limited to desktop devices, e.g., web browsing, media (audio, video), managing health and fitness data, etc. While almost all of these applications require a degree of authentication and authorization, some involve highly sensitive data (PII and PHI) that must be strictly controlled as it is exchanged back and forth between the mobile application and its server side repository/database. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a candidate to protect highly sensitive data of such applications. There has been recent research related to authorization in mobile computing that has focused on extending RBAC to provide a finer-grained access control. However, most of these approaches attempt to apply RBAC at the application-level of the mobile device and/or require modifications to the mobile OS. In contrast, the research presented in this paper focuses on applying RBAC to the business layer of a mobile application, specifically to the API(s) that a mobile application utilizes to manage data. To support this, we propose an API-Based approach to RBAC for permission definition and enforcement that intercepts API service calls to alter information delivered/stored to the app. The proposed intercepting APIbased approach is demonstrated via an existing mHealth application.	application programming interface;authentication;authorization;business logic;ct2;dos;desktop computer;fast healthcare interoperability resources;information exchange;mhealth;mobile app;mobile computing;mobile device;mobile operating system;personally identifiable information;reference implementation;representational state transfer;role-based access control;server (computing);server-side;visual intercept	Yaira K.

Such collaborations normally require flexible and interoperable services while running on mobile devices and being integrated with various other services. Therefore, middleware and toolkits for developing mobile services which can be accessed by using standard interfaces and protocols are in demand. Due to the lack of tools, the support of the development of Web services and collaboration tools on mobile devices is still limited. This paper presents the Vimoware toolkit which allows both developers and users to develop Web services for mobile devices, to conduct ad-hoc team collaborations by executing pre-defined or on-situ flows of tasks, and to test collaboration scenarios.	application checkpointing;collaborative software;denial-of-service attack;hoc (programming language);interoperability;list of toolkits;middleware;mobile device;representational state transfer;web service	Hong Linh Truong;Lukasz Juszczyk;Shariq Bashir;Atif Manzoor;Schahram Dustdar	2008	2008 34th Euromicro Conference Software Engineering and Advanced Applications	10.1109/SEAA.2008.42	web service;mobile search;mobile web;computer science;knowledge management;operating system;mobile device;mobile business development;services computing;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web	SE	-36.15801788409097	47.944686310054514	117788

IoT is an upcoming research field and is being regarded as the revolution in the world of communication because of its extensible applications in numerous fields. Due to open and self-assimilation nature of these networks they are highly prone to attacks. Because of this reason security is of primary concern here. The security attack can be of various types, the idea here is to prevent IoT networks from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The objective of Denial of Service (DoS) is to make the server resources unavailable to the intended user, and when several such DoS attacks are present in a network then the attack is known as a DDoS attack. Our strategy is to prevent DDoS attack in IoT networks by using Learning Automata (LA) concepts. In this paper, we present a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) which is used as a system model for IoT here. SOA provides a platform to the developers using which they can develop various applications for IoT without any concern regarding the nature of the objects, thereby acting as a middleware. The DDoS prevention strategy has been targeted for the SOA based architecture for IoT. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is effective in preventing DDoS attacks in IoT.	automaton;computation;data assimilation;denial-of-service attack;interconnection;internet of things;learning automata;middleware;protocol stack;server (computing);service-oriented architecture;simulation	Sudip Misra;P.

The sensors available on these devices provide valuable data about user contexts, which when combined with sensor data from other mobile devices can reveal interesting environmental contexts, which can then be used for applications like real-time traffic monitoring, noise mapping, crowdmapping, etc. Developing applications for inferring environmental context requires participation from multiple users satisfying certain requirements (e.g., location of users etc.); hence, building such applications requires developers to carefully identify potential collaborators satisfying these conditions. This makes the development of such applications cumbersome and time-consuming. In this work, we present Sahyog1 - a publish-subscribe framework that allows developers to specify these requirements and identify users that can actively participate in such applications. Sahyog helps application developers request data from a large number of users without worrying about reaching out to users, communicating data requests and responses, and storing information. We discuss the design and implementation of our system with the underlying research challenges, and evaluate it using several parameters.	computation;middleware;mobile device;multi-user;performance evaluation;privacy;publish–subscribe pattern;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time web;requirement;sensor;smartphone;website monitoring	Garvita Bajaj;Pushpendra Singh	2015	2015 7th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)	10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266518	embedded system;real-time computing;mobile search;mobile telephony;computer science;sensor;operating system;middleware;mobile computing;world wide web;server;computer network;collaboration	Mobile	-40.3444423024377	49.60993436860057	118007

Currently most cloud service providers (CSPs) isolate user activities and data within a single tenant boundary with no or minimum cross-tenant interaction. It is anticipated that this situation will evolve soon to foster cross-tenant collaboration supported by Authorization as a Service (AaaS). At present there is no widely accepted model for cross-tenant authorization. Recently, Calero et al [12] informally presented a multi-tenancy authorization system (MTAS) which extends the well-known role-based access control (RBAC) model by building trust relations among collaborating tenants. In this paper we formalize this MTAS model and propose extensions for finer-grained cross-tenant trust. We also develop an administration model for MTAS (AMTAS). We demonstrate the utility and practical feasibility of MTAS by means of an example policy specification in XACML. We anticipate researchers will develop additional multi-tenant authorization models before eventual consolidation and unification.		Bo Tang;Ravi S.

Also, stress can propagate from one individual to other working in a close proximity or toward a common goal, e.g., in a military operation or workforce. Real-time assessment of the stress of individuals alone is, however, not sufficient, as understanding its source and direction in which it propagates in a group of people is equally-if not more-important. A continuous near real-timein situ personal stress monitoring system to quantify level of stress of individuals and its direction of propagation in a team is envisioned. However, stress monitoring of an individual via his/her mobile device may not always be possible for extended periods of time due to limited battery capacity of these devices. To overcome this challenge a novel distributed mobile computing framework is proposed to organize the resources in the vicinity and form a mobile device cloud that enables offloading of computation tasks in stress detection algorithm from resource constrained devices (low residual battery, limited CPU cycles) to resource rich devices. Our framework also supports computing parallelization and workflows, defining how the data and tasks divided/assigned among the entities of the framework are designed. The direction of propagation and magnitude of influence of stress in a group of individuals are studied by applying real-time, in situ analysis of Granger Causality. Tangible benefits (in terms of energy expenditure and execution time) of the proposed framework in comparison to a centralized framework are presented via thorough simulations and real experiments.	algorithm;cpu (central processing unit of computer system);causality;central processing unit;centralized computing;computation (action);distributed computing;energy metabolism;entity;experiment;mobile computing;mobile device;parallel computing;personnameuse - assigned;real-time clock;real-time transcription;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;software propagation;benefit	Parul Pandey;Eun Kyung Lee;Dario Pompili	2016	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2015.2477342	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;feature extraction;computer science;sensor;machine learning;stress	Mobile	-41.413755689479366	50.19936120832324	118318

Mobile opportunistic sensing is one type of these applications which has been adopted in multiple citizen science projects including air pollution monitoring. However, the opportunistic nature of sensing along with campaigns being mobile and sensors being subjected to noise and missing values leads to asynchronous and unclean data. Analyzing this type of data requires cumbersome and time-consuming preprocessing. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to treat such type of data by seeing data as functions rather than vectors.

In such settings, session mobility allows users to split sessions across several devices, to dynamically include or remove devices from sessions and to handover sessions from one device to another. While there are some good SIP-based solutions for session mobility in ubiquitous audio/video scenarios, there is yet no working approach for collaborative apps with event-like communication patterns. We describe and evaluate a solution for session mobility based on XMPP offering discovery of personal devices, discovery and authorization of public devices, and adhoc discovery of smart objects. All this can be done with little or no modification of existing XMPP technology, thus creating a standard-based toolset for session mobility. This eases development of collaborative apps and finally allows users to seamlessly continue their task in pervasive settings.	authorization;hoc (programming language);internet of things;interoperability;mobile device;pervasive informatics;publish–subscribe pattern;server (computing);smart objects;smartphone;state (computer science);stationary process;streaming media;tablet computer;ubiquitous computing	István Koren;Daniel Schuster;Thomas Springer	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops)	10.1109/PerComW.2013.6529476	computer science;operating system;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;collaborative software;computer network	Mobile	-37.59776349298474	50.573198578985405	119159

An implication of this habit is that certain live information, such as that for navigation, for dating and for handling emergencies, should be tailored to the useru0027s current location. While this is technically feasible with the current technology, it raises concerns on the useru0027s location privacy. To address the delicate tradeoff between useru0027s location privacy and appropriateness of the information for that location, this paper discusses three information delivery protocols. One is the widely adopted Androidu0027s protocol, the other two are the authorsu0027 novel ones, termed AL protocol and LBPP protocol respectively. The former conceals the useru0027s location within a geographical area, the latter employs secure two-party computation. Privacy of all protocols is analysed, motivating the choice to implement the LBPP protocol.

47d2a285b11b877d7a7a64e1094f8436e7861cbe	a dynamic-trust-based recruitment framework for mobile crowd sensing		Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) arises as an appealing paradigm, which utilizes participants to contribute sensing data generated from sensors embedded in smart devices in the internet of things (IoT) for the people-centric service delivery and crowd intelligence extraction. Due to the inherent selfishness of human and network's openness, the quality of the data submitted by the participants is not always satisfying. To cope with this problem, a dynamic-trust-based recruitment framework (DTRF) for MCS system is proposed to recruit suitable participants who are trustworthy and always submit high-quality sensing data on time. In this model, we first give the definition of trust, and evaluate the overall trust degree of the participant from multi-dimensional trust evaluation factors: direct trust, feedback trust and incentive function. Then we develop an adaptive weight allocation approach based on information entropy theory, and the algorithm realization is given. Extensive simulations verifies that DTRF can achieve good performance in terms of trustworthy participants selection and task completion rate, compared with trust without feedback model.	adaptive filter;algorithm;embedded system;entropy (information theory);experiment;itil;internet of things;openness;programming paradigm;sensor;simulation;smart device	Yali Gao;Xiaoyong Li;Jirui Li;Yunquan Gao	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997420	service delivery framework;trustworthiness;computer network;computer science;mobile telephony;incentive;mobile computing;internet of things	Mobile	-42.14967485742457	57.440866095372726	119866

These devices require two key resources to function: power and data. The mobile nature of such devices combined with the economic limitations of size and cost makes it impractical to keep them continually connected to fixed sources of either resource. Mobile devices cope with disconnection from fixed sources of power and data by “caching”. For power, devices typically use rechargeable batteries; batteries act as a cache of power from the fixed power grid. Likewise, data from the “information grid” (i.e., the Internet) is cached in device-local storage (memory, flash memory, or disk, etc.) for use by the applications running on that device.	cpu cache;cache (computing);course (navigation);flash memory;mobile operating system;rechargeable battery;thread-local storage;user profile	Mitch Cherniack;Michael J.

The entities may even reside in domains where different technologies are used. This article presents a case study on the design and implementation of a novel lookup service for the dynamic discovery of entities across technologies and domains. This novel service allows end users to dynamically discover entities that meet specific constraints (e.g., interests or abilities, availability at a specific time or location, and/or affiliation(s)). It is a powerful enabler that may be used as a pillar for a wide range of other end-user services. The proposed architecture relies on presence service and RESTful Web services. The related security aspects are studied.

As a continuum of devices and objects are interconnected with each other in order to share data and information. It is really important to evaluate the trustworthiness of these devices/objects, whether they are trustworthy or malicious. In this work, we propose a novel Trust and Reputation (TR) based model to outsource malicious users in a Fog-based IoT (FIoT).

However, this rapid relocation to the cloud has fueled security and privacy concerns as users’ data leave owner’s protection sphere and enter the cloud. Significant efforts have been devoted by academia and research community to study and build secure frameworks in cloud environment, but there exists a research gap for comprehensive study of security frameworks in mobile cloud computing environment. Therefore, we aim to conduct a comprehensive survey to analyze various cryptographic, biometric and multifactor lightweight solutions for data security in mobile cloud. This survey highlights the current security issues in mobile cloud environment and infrastructure, investigates various data security frameworks and provides a taxonomy of the state-of-the-art data security frameworks and deep insight into open research issues for ensuring security and privacy of data in mobile cloud computing platform.	authentication;biometric device;biometrics;cryptography;data access;data security;microelectronics and computer technology corporation;mobile app;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;open research;privacy;programming paradigm;qualitative comparative analysis;relocation (computing);taxonomy (general)	Tarunpreet Bhatia;A.

To facilitate the vote verification process, a number of verification techniques (either physical or digital) have been developed to provide an evidence to voters and other participating entities for the assurance of the integrity of election result. However, we observed that these techniques have a number of limitations among which, the fact that the existing techniques do not fully comply with verification requirements (e.g., public verifiability). They implement limited prevention mechanisms from known attacks and they are not based on interoperable components and processes (typically, vendor lock-in). In order to address these issues, we propose a new method for vote verification based on open standards which allows interested parties or organizations to participate in vote verification process so as to enhance transparency and capture vote threats and challenges during and after elections.	business process;communications protocol;computer security;digital data;entity;formal verification;interoperability;open-source software;procedural programming;prototype;requirement;side effect (computer science);usability;vendor lock-in	Ali Fawzi Najm Al-Shammari;Adolfo Villafiorita;Komminist Weldemariam	2012	2012 Seventh International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	10.1109/ARES.2012.42	political science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security;functional verification	SE	-47.10683962277229	58.086375241129545	121203

With the development of mobile devices and the rapid prevalence of smartphones that boosted mobile Internet access, location-based crowdsourcing is quickly becoming ubiquitous, enabling location-based queries assigned to and performed by humans. In sharp contrast of existing location-based crowd-sourcing approaches that focus on simple queries, in this paper, we describe a crowdsourcing process model that supports queries including several crowd activities, and can be applied in a variety of location-based crowdsourcing scenarios. We also propose different strategies for managing this crowdsourcing process. Finally, we describe the architecture of our system, and present an experimental study conducted on pseudo-real dataset that evaluates the process outcomes depending on these execution strategies.	computation;computer vision;crowdsourcing;experiment;fifo (computing and electronics);internet access;living lab;location-based service;mobile device;process modeling;smart city;smartphone	Karim Benouaret;Raman Valliyur-Ramalingam;François Charoy	2013	9th IEEE International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing		the internet;crowdsourcing software development;computer science;operating system;data mining;database;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web	DB	-38.90370114753606	51.517935548367596	122483

The existing science gateway infrastructure has been extended on several levels and layers to especially support the computing- and data-intensive research domains of quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, and docking. On the security level, the MoSGrid project has implemented a granular security concept, which applies Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions for trust delegations. Support of the highly scalable grid middleware UNICORE has been added to the middleware layer as has the support of the object-based file system XtreemFS for distributed data management. Furthermore, developers are supported by the PortletAPI, which eases the creation of domain-specific portlets.

Most of them are based on different approaches and technologies; therefore, relying on only one for using in all cases is not recommendable. The diversity in smart-devices (i.e. smartphones and tablets) and in their hardware features; such as screen-resolution, processing power, etc.; as well as the availability of different mobile operating systems makes the process of mobile application development much complicated. In this work, we analyze few of these cross-platform development frameworks through developing three mobile apps on each of them as well as on the native Android and iOS environments. Moreover, we also performed a user evaluation study on these developed mobile apps to judge how users perceive the same mobile app developed in different frameworks and environments, from the native to the cross-platform environment. Results indicate that these frameworks are good alternative to the native platform implementations but a careful investigation is required before deciding to check whether the target framework supports the needed features in a stable	android;mobile app;mobile operating system;smartphone;ios	Shah Rukh Humayoun;Stefan Ehrhart;Achim Ebert	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39232-0_41	embedded system;mobile search;mobile web;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;mobile deep linking;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;android	Mobile	-37.63769635379402	52.281340605590295	122672

A promising approach is represented by automated trust negotiation, which establishes trust between strangers through the exchange of digital credentials and the use of access control policies. An automated trust negotiation strategy needs to be adopted to establish trust between two parties based on their disclosure policies. Previously proposed negotiation strategies may fail when in fact success is possible, disclose irrelevant credentials, or have high communication or computational complexity. In this paper, we model the policies participating trust negotiation as Negotiation Petri Net and propose a trust negotiation Strategy based on Negotiation Petri Net (SNPN) by combining the characteristics of Negotiation Petri Net architecture with the behaviors of auto trust negotiation. We prove that SNPN is efficient with O(n) communication complexity and O(nm) computational complexity including Negotiation Petri Net building process and the negotiation process in the worst case, where n is the number of credentials and m is the size of the credential disclosure policies. Meanwhile SNPN is complete and makes sure that no irrelevant credentials will be disclosed during negotiations.	access control;best, worst and average case;communication complexity;computational complexity theory;credential;distributed computing;grid computing;peer-to-peer;petri net;real-time clock;relevance;requirement;ws-trust;web of trust	Yan He;Miaoliang Zhu	2007		10.1145/1366804.1366900	computer security model;computer science;knowledge management;communication complexity;distributed computing;computational complexity theory;computer security;petri net;grid computing	AI	-43.43095956284438	57.22612610163879	122722

Second, we use the history information to define permissions for the operations of our model including the transfer of document parts. Third, since the text content of an element can be composed of parts of text from different sources, we consider units smaller than the XML element as a protection unit. Therefore, we keep track of these parts and allow to define access to them individually.	access control;authorization;computer data storage;xml	Patrick Röder;Omid Tafreschi;Claudia Eckert	2007		10.1145/1229285.1229336	well-formed document;xml catalog;xml validation;binary xml;xml encryption;xml;xml schema;computer science;access control;document type definition;document structure description;xml framework;role-based access control;data mining;xml database;xml schema;database;xml signature;world wide web;xml schema editor;computer security;cxml;efficient xml interchange	DB	-37.40827680531256	60.18493896866901	122826

Getting the new version of an application involves the download of a significant amount of data, which is not practical through low-bandwidth/high-cost links. As a consequence, mobile device users often fail to update their applications.  This paper introduces a collaborative and epidemic updating scheme to improve software updates distribution. In our approach, updates are distributed by the surrounding devices, eliminating the need for costly resources. Moreover, the packaging of these updates, which consists in delivering binary patches of the difference with a previous version, dramatically reduces the amount of data to download.  Preliminary experimental results based on real contact traces show that our approach offers an efficient selection and recovery of patches, ensuring a fast update for each participating device.	download;middleware;mobile device;patch (computing);software propagation;tracing (software);typhoon;vulnerability (computing);windows mobile	Tegawendé F.

However, the native CAN protocol exhibits a set of availability, reliability and timeliness limitations. Given the large practical base of off-the-shelf microcontrollers integrating standard CAN interfaces and the emergence of CAN protocol open cores, a fundamental question is whether (and how) those components can be used for highly dependable applications of CAN? This paper identifies a fundamental set of shortcomings of the native CAN protocol and discusses how existing CAN controllers can be combined with additional hardware/software components to secure the provisioning of strict dependability and timeliness guarantees. Furthermore, the paper discusses the main issues in the design and implementation of CANELy, a CAN-based infrastructure able of extremely reliable hard real-time communication, and shows how CANELy components can be integrated in the onboard data communication and processing infrastructure currently being designed for future space vehicle avionics.	avionics;can bus;component-based software engineering;dependability;embedded system;emergence;microcontroller;provisioning;real-time clock;real-time computing	José Rufino;Paulo Veríssimo;Ricardo Pinto;Carlos Almeida;Guilherme Arroz	2011			real-time computing;dependability;distributed computing;computer security	Embedded	-37.13074651870662	46.75502655567467	122905

Unfortunately, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet the requirements of critical applications that require low latency or enhanced privacy levels. The deployment of private cloud services on top of pervasive grids represent an interesting alternative to traditional cloud infrastructures, allowing the use of near-environment resources for IoT data analysis tasks. In this work we discuss the challenges associated with the deployment of IoT services over pervasive environments, and present a study case deployed over CloudFIT, a computing middleware for pervasive systems. Hence, we evaluate the behavior of a data-intensive application under volatility and heterogeneity constraints, bringing to light to the use of low-end devices that are usually located at the proximity to IoT sensors/actuators.	pervasive informatics;platform as a service	Luiz Angelo Steffenel;Manuele Kirsch-Pinheiro	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-47063-4_36	computer network;latency (engineering);software deployment;computer science;cloud computing;middleware;internet of things;computer data storage	HCI	-42.80132984114343	49.16832383381015	123127
11e9203c3bd8ae1e73cab78f2aa9b58dfd28d06e	cyberpsychology meets the internet of things		Internet of Things (IoT) refers to an emerging infrastructure that allows creating networks of physical objects, enabled by micro-electrical systems, wireless communication, and Internet technologies. In this vision, objects are no longer ‘‘inert’’ entities in the environment, but can communicate with each other to provide services that improve our lives. Existing examples of IoT systems include fire extinguishers that send signals when they are empty, or distributed environmental sensors that monitor air quality. In the last few years, IoT has taken an important step forward, growing from a futuristic vision to a concrete business opportunity that is attracting significant investments by key ICT players and public institutions. As highlighted by a recent European Commission study, the market value of the IoT in the EU alone is expected to exceed one trillion euros in 2020. The term ‘‘Internet of Things’’ was introduced in the late 1990s by Kevin Ashton at MIT, to refer to a scenario in which everyday objects are able to communicate between themselves and be managed by computers. According to this vision, objects become digitally augmented and connected entities, which can collect different types of data from the physical context and transmit them over wireless networks.

One advantage of using MA paradigm instead of conventional message passing paradigm is that it can reduce communication traffic among the computing devices in the system. Also, the MA paradigm supports asynchronous interaction of computing devices, enabling more efficient system services. In order to adopt the MA paradigm into the ubiquitous computing technologies, it is necessary to develop a lightweight middleware platform, called MAP(Mobile Agent Platform), that supports agent migration and install it in various devices such as PDAs, hand-held devices, and digital appliances. In this paper, we propose our lightweight MAP, named KAgentPlatform, that is developed based on J2ME for ubiquitous environments.

Such applications emerge out of the interaction of these devices with each other and with more powerful server-class computers on the Internet. Programming such applications is challenging due to the massively distributed nature of these networks combined with the challenges of embedded programming. In addition, resource constraints, device heterogeneity, and the integration with the Internet further complicate this situation. In this paper, we present a programming-in-the-large approach for resource-constraint devices such as wireless sensor nodes. Our approach is to model such applications using the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), which is successfully and widely used in the Internet to model complete applications and business processes. However, BPEL and its associated technologies are too resourcedemanding to be directly applied in resource-constraint environments. We therefore use the BPEL model as input to a code generation process that generates custom-tailored, lean code for different target platforms. The resulting code is fully standard-compliant and allows a seamless integration of IoT devices in enterprise IT environments. We present an exhaustive evaluation on real hardware showing the first-rate performance of the approach.

Events happening in the real-world need to be detected in real-time based on sensor data and other data sources. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a technology to detect complex (or composite) events in data streams and has been successfully applied in high volume and high velocity applications like stock market analysis. However, these application domains faced only the challenge of high performance, while the Internet of Things and Mobile Big Data introduce a new set of challenges caused by mobility. This chapter aims to explain these challenges and to give an overview on how they are solved respectively how far state-of-the-art research has advanced to be useful to solve Mobile Big Data problems. At the infrastructure level the main challenge is to trade performance against resource consumption and energy efficiency and operator placement is the most dominant mechanism to address these problems. At the application and consumer level, mobile queries pose a new set of challenges for CEP related to continuously changing positions of consumers and data sources, and the need to adapt the query processing to these changes. Finally, proper methods and tools for systematical testing and reproducible performance evaluation for mobile distributed CEP are needed but not yet available.

More and more data are being shared among different type of users residing in different places, performing different kinds of tasks for different kinds of services. However, these technological advances pose a serious risk on individuals 'privacy rights. In this paper, we consider a problem of monopolistic information management technologies. Most service providers have an access to any information. Even though the information is really a personal data, service providers can access to it merely with the user's first subscription. In order to limit the disclosure and avoid the misuse of personal data, this paper discusses an architectural proposal for a policy negotiation system. This proposed architecture mediates among the three actors: the users, the service providers and the law. The central unit of the proposed architecture is a policy negotiation engine. A negotiation engine undertakes the enforcement of user's privacy preference, by matching the service provider's disclosure policy and user's privacy policy. Several additional components assigned with supporting functional tasks complement the architecture, while the formal definition of personal data type and services type. This architecture provides more powerful right to each user. Finally, this paper discusses the formalization how users can express their privacy preferences and how regulations can be expressed in this system.	adobe flash player;information exchange;information explosion;information management;personally identifiable information;privacy policy	Injoo Jang;Wenbo Shi;Hyeong Seon Yoo	2008	2008 Fourth International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management	10.1109/NCM.2008.244	service provider;support function;privacy policy;information exchange;information privacy;data type;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;access control;data mining;database;internet privacy;information management;privacy;computer security;computer network	DB	-44.07754327327831	59.875601360099814	124308

However, a majority of the proposals assume that points of interests (POI) are ranked only by distance, and demand extensive architectural changes. As a result, a significant gap remains between academic proposals and the industry standard of implementing location based services. Recent advances in mobile device capabilities, more specifically in their computational power and energy efficiency, have opened the possibility of engaging the client hardware more actively in the execution of a privacy algorithm, thereby relaxing strong dependencies on trusted third parties or the service provider. With this motivation, we propose a novel privacy algorithm that determines the most prominent result set through operations restricted to the client device, thereby limiting the communication of precise location information to the service provider. The service provider only acts as a data source, and is required to perform operations that are within existing industry norms. By measuring the privacy offered by the algorithm under a formal threat model, we demonstrate its robustness and practicability, and supplement our conclusions with empirical evidence.	algorithm;location-based service;mobile device;privacy;result set;technical standard;the industry standard;threat model	Wisam Eltarjaman;Rinku Dewri;Ramakrishna Thurimella	2017	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2016.2625256	robustness (computer science);mobile search;service provider;computer network;information privacy;privacy software;quality of service;distributed computing;location-based service;computer science;server	Security	-40.82248780940078	60.0111717364158	124367

However the management context functionality (FCAPS management functions) is still an initial state of research and development. In this paper we discuss requirements and security services for TINA management context, in particularly for TINA accounting management architecture. We propose and implement a model of security management middleware architecture, based on secure objects, cryptography and ticket distributed. To provide security services, secure objects, which have security functionality like authentication and access control, have been defined in security domain. Secure objects in our model are CORBA objects. Security domain, also called SBS , provides security serGces and has SMIB that contains security policies, cryptographic algorithms and other relevant information.

The MSV is intended as a general representation of media navigation and a basis for synchronization of multi-device media presentations. The MSV is motivated by the idea that media navigation can be decoupled from media content and visual presentation, and shared across a network. Implementation of the MSV concept for the Web allows us to construct navigable, synchronized, multi-device, multimedia presentations, spanning computers across the Internet. In particular, media presentations may be hosted by regular Web browsers on a range of devices, including smart phones, pads, laptops and smart TVs. Our proof of concept implementation bases its synchronization accuracy on primitive, centralized, ad-hoc, application-level clock synchronization. Still, inter-client synchronization error of about 33 ms is demonstrated between three screens in London (UK), synchronized via a server in Tromsø (Norway).	centralized computing;clock synchronization;computer;file spanning;hoc (programming language);internet;laptop;quantum state;server (computing);smart tv;world wide web	Ingar Mæhlum Arntzen;Njål T.

Second, we introduced the challenges ahead to the design and development of the future engineering systems with new security capabilities. Third, we presented the security requirements in Hadoop distributed file systems. Since trust-based packet transfer in sensor networks is one of the important security issue infrastructure security, we presented a trust-based approach using Sporas formula and presented the simulations to trust of a successive node before transferring the packets.

The basic, abstract challenge is to maintain an up to date UM. Today's technology provides solutions to this abstract challenge -- the UM may be stored in the cloud or on the user's mobile device (or even both). However, the devil is in the details -- how can the environment or service provider access the UM and get the needed information from the model? How can the UM (or the user-modeling component) respond to continuous requests for personal data required by services in ubiquitous computing? This paper presents the idea and work in progress of """"Mobile Info-Beads User Model"""" -- an extension of the """"Info-Beads User Modeling approach"""" to the mobile world, where user-modeling components are exchanged and composed for providing the current service with the personal data needed for personalization.

In contrast, most devices in the phone's environment - e.g., household appliances or environmental sensors - are much less flexible because their functionality is hardcoded at the design time. In order to realize the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), where all devices communicate with each other to realize joint tasks, it is necessary that these devices are able to extend and adapt their functionalities on-the-fly based on their surrounding. To realize smart functionalities for IoT devices, we propose """"hybrid Apps"""", the concept of Smartphone """"Apps"""" applied to small embedded systems. In contrast with current packaged """"smart home"""" solutions, where all appliances have to be changed to their smart counterparts at the same time, hybrid Apps permit an incremental and hence feasible deployment of the IoT vision. In this paper we discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with this approach. We argue code interpretation as a candidate reprogramming method for IoT devices and analyzed its feasibility with real-world measurements of key parameters such as computational and energy overhead.

This is a famous quote that we use everyday implicitly or explicitly. Trust often is an inherent characteristic of our daily life, but in the digital community and between devices how can we represent trust? Since our mobile and digital devices became our confidants, we cannot share the information embedded in these devices with other devices without establishing trust. Hence, in this research a proximity based trust model based on Homophily principle is proposed. Earlier social studies have shown that people tend to have similarities with others in close proximity. In such clustered communities of interest people tend to communicate, socialize and potentially trust each other. In this paper, a novel proximity based trust model is built taking into consideration different aspects like cooperation or unselfishness, honesty, similarity and Activity.	embedded system;socialization	Mai H.

Turing and K. Gödel. Its scope and focus have changed continuously over the past seven decades. The first computers ran numerical software for defense applications. In the 70’s, the advent of mainframe computers broadened the scope to include commercial applications. In parallel, large-scale circuit integration allowed exponential increases in computing power (Moore’s law). In the 80’s, the convergence between information technologies and telecommunications opened the way for the Internet, the Web and the Information Society. In the 90’s, another very important, but less visible, revolution started with the dissemination of embedded systems technologies. More than 95% of the chips produced today are for embedded applications. These are electronic components integrating software and hardware jointly and specifically designed to provide given functionalities, which are often critical. They are hidden in devices, appliances and equipment of any kind: mobile phones, cameras, home appliances, cars, aircraft, trains, medical devices etc. In 2008, the average person used about 230 embedded chips every day: 80 chips in home appliances, 40 chips at work, 70 chips in cars, 40 chips in portable devices. In the near future, another anticipated, important landmark will be the advent of the Internet of Things as the result of the convergence between embedded technologies and the Internet. The idea is to use internet technologies to integrate services provided by hundreds of billions of embedded systems. This will require an upgrade of the internet infrastructure to make it more secure, safer and reactive. Current features for exchanging multimedia documents will be extended to encompass real-time monitoring and control. Systems are becoming ubiquitous: the state of almost everything can be sensed, measured and monitored; people and objects can communicate and interact in entirely new ways; intelligent systems allow enhanced predictability of events and optimal use of resources. It is hard to imagine what Computer Science will be in two decades. More than any other discipline, it is driven by applications and exponential progress in technology. The broadening of its perimeter is accompanied by a shift in focus from algorithms and programs to systems.	algorithm;computer science;electronic component;embedded system;gödel;integrated circuit;internet of things;internet protocol suite;list of numerical analysis software;mainframe computer;mobile phone;moore's law;perimeter;personal digital assistant;real-time locating system;time complexity;turing;world wide web	Joseph Sifakis	2011	Central European Journal of Computer Science	10.2478/s13537-011-0008-y	computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;vision science	EDA	-40.004983226463665	52.04275835357116	125884

These environments serve as a common platform for heterogeneous users (e.g., corporate, individuals etc.) by hosting customized user applications and systems, providing ubiquitous access to the shared resources and requiring less administrative efforts; as a result, they enable users and companies to increase their productivity. Unfortunately, sharing of resources in open environments has significantly increased the privacy threats to the users. Indeed, shared electronic data may be exploited by third parties, such as Data Brokers, which may aggregate, infer and redistribute (sensitive) personal features, thus potentially impairing the privacy of the individuals. A way to palliate this problem consists on controlling the access of users over the potentially sensitive resources. Specifically, access control management regulates the access to the shared resources according to the credentials of the users, the type of resource and the privacy preferences of the resource/data owners. The efficient management of access control is crucial in large and dynamic environments. Moreover, in order to propose a feasible and scalable solution, we need to get rid of manual management of rules/constraints (in which most available solutions rely) that constitutes a serious burden for the users and the administrators. Finally, access control management should be intuitive for the end users, who usually lack technical expertise, and they may find access control mechanism more difficult to understand and rigid to apply due to its complex configuration settings.	access control;social network	Malik Imran Daud	2016	CoRR		geography;database;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-44.19902035115612	58.220465186000446	126309
b38b0a2e3470da17c1591e91856e7fc5e9f2ca90	composable distributed mobile applications and services in opportunistic networks		Advances in computational devices, wireless networking, cyber-physical integration and novel user interfaces are creating a world where we are continuously surrounded by a wealth of computational resources and new ways of interacting with them. However, we currently lack means of composing applications and services that can take full advantage of this environment. In this paper we present a system design that allows application developers to treat the future environment as a generic execution environment, which will automatically distribute and execute the components of their applications. This has the potential to unlock a wealth of currently unused resources and enable new classes of more immersive and useful applications and service that execute directly in the surrounding environment.	computation;computational resource;function composition (computer science);interaction;prototype;sim lock;systems design;testbed;user interface	Chrysa Papadaki;Teemu Kärkkäinen;Jörg Ott	2018	"""2018 IEEE 19th International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WoWMoM.2018.8449786	wireless network;market research;systems design;immersion (virtual reality);cloud computing;wireless;distributed computing;computer science;user interface	Arch	-41.08106343819955	46.399188190649056	126453

An intrusion tolerant mechanism against the attack is formalized for grid services based on the mechanism design analysis of game theory in this paper. The problems that the attackers could use the authentic IP addresses of the zombies to hide the source of attacks and to increase the computational ability and the likelihood to filter out legitimate traffic are effectively settled under the mechanism.

During the development of the DHCompliant protocol, the problem of locating mobile devices in an indoor environment has been investigated. The communication of the device with the location service has been carried out to study the time delay that web services offer in front of the sockets. The importance of obtaining data from real-time location systems portends that a basic tool for interoperability, such as web services, can be ineffective in this scenario because of the delays added in the invocation of services.

This Internet of Things is physically closed to the user but suffers from weak run-time execution environments. Cloud Environments provide powerful data storage and computing power but can not be easily accessed and integrate the final-user contextawareness. We consider smartphones are set to become the universal interface between these two worlds. In this position paper, we propose a middleware approach where smartphones provide service gateways to bridge the gap between IoT services and Cloud services. Since smartphones are mobile gateways, they should be able to (re)configure themself according to their place, things discovered around, and their own resources such battery. Several issues are discussed: collaborative event-based context management, adaptive and opportunistic service deployment and invocation, multi-criteria (userand performance-oriented) optimization decision algorithm.	anytime algorithm;autonomic computing;bridging (networking);cloud computing;computer data storage;embedded system;internet of things;mathematical optimization;middleware;platform as a service;run time (program lifecycle phase);sensor;smartphone;software deployment	Roya Golchay;Frédéric Le Mouël;Stéphane Frénot;Julien Ponge	2011	CoRR		embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;middleware;computer data storage;world wide web;internet of things	Mobile	-40.10072282984999	48.49646155610367	126994

They attract many users seeking popularity, entertainment and network building, along with ease of use. Most current SNSs are based on centralized designs, which are less likely to improve privacy since there is a single and central authority with exclusive administration control over user information. Many proposals have been introduced that work towards decentralizing the infrastructure support in order to enhance privacy in SNSs. However, designing decentralized social network systems (DSNS) driven by privacy is a hard task because privacy is impacted by most design choices. This paper proposes a multi-criteria analysis grid designed to evaluate several properties of SNSs related to privacy trade-offs. Based on the analysis grid result, this paper also presents the application of lattice-based tools to classify and visualize social network systems in privacy-related hierarchies.	best practice;centralized computing;component-based software engineering;crystal structure;expressive power (computer science);gene ontology term enrichment;graphical user interface;privacy by design;privacy policy;social network;usability;web service	Regina Marin;Guillaume Piolle;Christophe Bidan	2013	2013 International Conference on Social Computing	10.1109/SocialCom.2013.79	web service;privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;evaluation;lattice;data mining;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;data visualization;grid computing	DB	-42.977602158181625	58.59836672797728	127411

Companies, like Philips Medical Systems, may have a competitive advantage, because they have a large installed base which may provide valuable information already, and because they can change their products to provide additional information. To optimally benefit from this advantage, we created a platform that enables quick development of e-services. The platform enables uniform access to data, combines static with live data, and supports transparent composition of existing, into new services. We discuss the requirements, design, and implementation of the platform, and we show its use in a case study that addresses asset management and utilization services for mobile medical equipment.	e-services;quality of service;requirement	Merijn de Jonge;Wim van der Linden;Rik Willems	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74974-5_33	web service;service bureau;computer science;service delivery framework;location-based service;service design;database;services computing;law;world wide web	Mobile	-40.79170913142274	53.50442859078543	127582

b091cc108be2769ffb5ea8961d19070da20c1da3	smart urban planning using big data analytics to contend with the interoperability in internet of things		Abstract The recent growth and expansion in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) is providing a great business prospective in the direction of the new era of smart urban. The insight of the smart urban is extensively preferred, as it improves the excellence of life of citizens, connecting several regulations, that is, smart transportation, smart parking, smart environment, smart healthcare, and so forth. Continuous intensification of the multifaceted urban set-up is extensively challenged by real-time processing of data and smart decision capabilities. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a smart city architecture which is based on Big Data analytics. The proposed scheme is comprised of three modules: (1) data acquisition and aggregation module collects varied and diverse data interrelated to city services, (2) data computation and processing module performs normalization, filtration, processing and data analysis, and (3) application and decision module formulates decisions and initiates events. The proposed architecture is a generic solution for the smart urban planning and variety of datasets is analyzed to validate this architecture. In addition, we tested reliable datasets on Hadoop server to verify the threshold limit value (TLV) and the investigation demonstrates that the proposed scheme offer valuable imminent into the community development systems to get better the existing smart urban architecture. Moreover, the efficiency of proposed architecture in terms of throughput is also shown.	apache hadoop;authentication;big data;computation;foremost;http public key pinning;internet of things;interoperability;mapreduce;online and offline;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);server (computing);smart city;throughput	Muhammad Babar;Fahim Arif	2017	Future Generation Comp.

In the current mobile software environment, the device fragmentation causes substantial degree of inaccuracy in matching applications with devices as the traditional platform-centric method handles only the features of platform vendors without considering the unique feature set of a certain device, such as device-manufacturer's features, resulting in a low accuracy in matching applications and devices. This paper proposes a new matching method that is device-centric, which achieves high accuracy in application-device matching by grouping features of existing devices and then using it as criteria of application-device matching. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we conduct a case study with 22 devices and 10 applications in the Google Android mobile software ecosystem. The result of case study shows our proposed method shows a higher accuracy.	android;fragmentation (computing);software ecosystem;wurfl	Heuijin Lee;Sungwon Kang;Myungchul Kim	2014	2014 21st Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference	10.1109/APSEC.2014.36	embedded system;mobile search;global positioning system;feature extraction;computer science;operating system;fragmentation;internet privacy;mobile station;mobile computing;world wide web;android	SE	-37.31672442827564	52.9205181967439	127875

In industrial settings there can be hundreds or thousands of objects to monitor, and systems that are distributed into different networks are seldom compatible. This paper proposes a condition monitoring system based on standardized services operating as parts of a service framework. The solution builds on dynamic service composition as well as standard information models for measurement related data, and supports functionality from sensors to cloud applications. The approach has been applied to industrial processing in mining and it can be claimed to improve interoperability as well as reduce engineering effort when composing functionality supporting maintenance operations.	algorithm;cloud computing;ecosystem;gateway (telecommunications);information model;interoperability;sensor;service composability principle	David Hästbacka;Erkki Jantunen;Mika Karaila;Laurentiu Barna	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793470	reliability engineering;engineering;operations management;computer security;predictive maintenance	SE	-45.3303926165346	47.05782861887272	127876

To meet this need, many locationsensing systems have been developed, but none of the systems for the indoor environment have been widely adopted. In this paper we propose Proximity Mining, a new approach to build location information by mining sensor data. The Proximity Mining does not use geometric views for location modeling, but automatically discovers symbolic views by mining time series data from sensors which are placed in surroundings. We deal with trend curves representing time series sensor data, and use their topological characteristics to classify locations where the sensors are placed.	artifact (software development);experiment;minoru 3d webcam;need to know;radio-frequency identification;sensor;time series;ubiquitous computing	Toshihiro Takada;Satoshi Kurihara;Toshio Hirotsu;Toshiharu Sugawara	2003		10.1109/MCSA.2003.1240774	real-time computing;computer science;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-40.34356397351868	49.70823000265022	128438

In this sense, electronic surveillance can be an efficient tool for helping to guarantee the safety of victims. Ambient Intelligence (AmI), based on ubiquitous computing, represents a promising approach to make technology adapt to people in order to solve the challenge of developing strategies that allow the early detection and prevention of problems in safety environments and, more specifically, the protection of people under risk situations, including cases of mistreatment or loss. This paper describes Guardian, an integral solution designed for improving the protection of mistreated and at-risk people by means of the integration of GPS, GPRS and ZigBee technologies. The basic architecture of the system, the proposed wireless devices, as well as the communication protocol used between the system and the devices are described.

These services enable users to perform a broad range of activities at any time and anywhere. While a lot of research and development effort has been focusing on extending the scope of activities that can be carried out on mobile devices, little attempt has been made to provide process-oriented services. In this paper, we propose a model for specifying and querying personal processes. This model is equipped with a set of operations that allow mobile users to express queries on their personal processes. Answers of these queries will help mobile users in planning their activities while they are on the move. We have designed and implemented a prototyped personal workflow system on Palm Pilot PDA based on the proposed model.

In order to overcome the shortcomings of blindness and randomicity in traditional service selection algorithm, we propose a novel ANN-based (Artificial Neural Network) service selection algorithm (called the ANNSS algorithm). We adopt a novel method that according to the earlier information of the cooperation between the devices and the context information, an ANN-based evaluation standard for the service quality of service provider is given out so that user can acquire an effective guidance and choose the most appropriate service. At the same time, we improved the traditional BP algorithm based on three-term method (called the TTMBP) consisting of a learning rate (LR), a momentum factor (MF) and a proportional factor (PF) in order to satisfy the requirements of time issue in real-time system. The convergence speed and stability were enhanced by adding the proportional factor. The self-adjusting architecture method is adopted so that a moderate scale of neural network can be obtained. We have implemented the ANNSS algorithm in an actual ubiquitous web services system and fulfilled various simulations. The results of simulation show that the proposed service selection scheme is not only scalable but also efficient, and that the novel BP algorithm based on three-term has high convergence speed and good convergence stability. The novel service selection scheme superior to the traditional service selection scheme without ANNSS. The novel algorithm can exactly choose a most appropriate service in ubiquitous web services environment. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Intelligent wearables, although becoming increasingly prevalent and pervasive, are vulnerable to various cyber-attacks due to their intrinsic characteristics, which consequently brings up unprecedented security challenges in terms of privacy leakage, financial loss, and even malicious invasion of other connected IoT components and applications. Therefore, it is of great necessity to keep intelligent wearables reliable and trustworthy before being able to secure the core parts of IoT. Toward this end, we provide in this article a survey of available attack methodologies on intelligent wearables as well as the corresponding countermeasures, from the perspectives of data integrity, authenticity, and privacy.	data integrity;ecosystem;internet of things;pervasive informatics;spectral leakage;trustworthy computing;wearable computer	Jiajia Liu;Wen Sun	2016	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2016.1600553CM	computer science;internet security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;internet of things	Security	-44.98684553737491	50.757145251375746	129704
da818700cf6d83e1f9f5b37ba1001f4d3da69678	drm cloud architecture and service scenario for content protection		The smart devices and cloud computing technology have been introduced into a new content service such as N-Screen service. The DRM(digital rights management) techniques have been rapidly developed in accordance with the new service environment after the awareness on the importance of DRM technology. In spite of the technical advancement of DRM, it is being taken as an unwelcome thing by the content consumers until now. In the Cloud era, the rapid introduction of service is possible and also the importance of content protection is going to increase more and more. As a result, the DRM technology should be changed to match the nature of the Cloud as well. In this paper, a model of DRM-as-a-Service for content protection within the Cloud, which is referred to as DRM Cloud, and an architecture of DRM Cloud are proposed. Also we describe the content download service by using the DRM Cloud and discuss about the establishment of the trusted DRM Cloud and its advantages.	cloud computing;copy protection;digital rights management;download;requirement;smart device	Hyejoo Lee;Changho Seo;Sang-Uk Shin	2013	J.

These applications require a reconfigurable sensor architecture that can span multiple scenarios, devices and use cases that allow storage, networking and computational resources to be efficiently used on the edge of the network. There are a number of platforms and gateway architectures that have been proposed to manage these components and enable application deployment. These approaches lack horizontal integration between multiple providers as well as higher order functionalities like load balancing and clustering. This is partly due to the strongly coupled nature of the deployed applications, a lack of abstraction of device communication layers as well as a lock-in for communication protocols. This limitation is a major obstacle for the development of a protocol agnostic application environment that allows for single application to be migrated and to work with multiple peripheral devices with varying protocols from different local gateways. This research looks at existing platforms and their shortcomings as well as proposes a messaging based modular gateway platform that enables clustering of gateways and the abstraction of peripheral communication protocol details. These novelties allow applications to send and receive messages regardless of their deployment location and destination device protocol, creating a more uniform development environment. Furthermore, it results in a more streamlined application development and testing while providing more efficient use of the gateway’s resources. Our evaluation of a prototype for the system shows the need for the migration of resources and the QoS advantages of such a system. The examined use case scenarios show that clustering proves to be an advantage in certain use cases as well as presenting the deployment of a larger testing and control environment through the platform.

Two major issues that need to be addressed in this regard are: specification of access control requirements and trust management. Specification of access control requirements for dynamic collaboration is challenging mainly because of the limited or lack of knowledge about remote users' identities and affiliations. The access control policies and constraints defining users' authorization over remote resources and services need to be specified in terms of the attributes and properties of the users. Moreover, the criteria for validating the attributes of the users should also be specified as part of access control requirements. Trust management, in the context of dynamic collaboration, involves validation of user's attributes for secure interaction and prevention of unauthorized disclosure of policies and attributes. The paper discusses these issues in detail and presents a framework for access control and trust management in a distributed collaborative environment.	access control;authorization;requirement;trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Basit Shafiq;Elisa Bertino;Arif Ghafoor	2005		10.1145/1102486.1102503	service provider;computer access control;computer science;knowledge management;access control;world wide web;computer security;distributed computing environment;collaboration	Security	-47.866660253909	53.859585819521044	130143

Besides SOAP and UDDI, which make the foundation of SOA, WSDL also plays an important role in this architecture. So far, in most of the security solutions that have been offered for SOA, providing security of SOAP messages has been the main objective. But in this article, the security view has been changed to WSDL files. So a new framework has been proposed which aims to protect Web services against WSDL attacks. Additionally to the best of our knowledge at the time of the writing of this article no other practical solution has been suggested in order to secure Web services WSDL files in SOA environment. Also, in order to provide security requirements, a new extension of WSDL file in the suggested framework has been offered.	programming paradigm;requirement;soa security;soap;service-oriented architecture;web services description language;web service	Narges Shahgholi;Mehran Mohsenzadeh;Mir Ali Seyyedi;Saleh Hafez Qorani	2011	2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Social Computing	10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.132	web service;web application security;java api for xml-based rpc;computer science;ws-policy;service-oriented architecture;database;internet privacy;ws-i basic profile;law;world wide web;devices profile for web services	DB	-46.47974068957915	55.2675040332923	130910

Yet, the verbosity of the XML-based protocol and its accompanying standards poses performance challenges which need to be addressed and solved to obtain the efficiency and scalability required by large information systems.This paper proposes a novel approach to overcome these performance issues in scenarios where multiple service invocations occur between a requester and a service. A protocol is introduced which allows negotiating common and distinctive parts of the SOAP message. Thereby, a session is established between these two peers in which only distinctive parts of the SOAP message are subsequently transfered over the wire. This results in a significant efficiency improvement regarding transmission as well as processing costs.	apache axis2;business process;information system;key (cryptography);microsoft outlook for mac;open research;parsing;soap;scalability;secure socket tunneling protocol;software system;surface web;system integration;web service;world wide web;xml	Nils Gruschka;Luigi Lo Iacono	2009	2009 Seventh IEEE European Conference on Web Services	10.1109/ECOWS.2009.10	web service;computer science;soap;database;internet privacy;programming language;law;world wide web;information system	HPC	-45.81179696623553	54.28693953768649	131012

In spite of the differences in resource availability, threat models, vulnerabilities, information formats, and communication protocols, there is a great advantage to (and great demand for) enabling information exchange between the tactical edge and enterprise environments. Creating a specialized mobile version of each desired service that incorporates an appropriate level of security protection and quality of service (QoS) for the tactical users is one possibility. Such an approach is not cost effective, however, as the market for a given tactical application is small compared to the commercial user base for mobile applications and services. Furthermore, the need for information or services from the enterprise by tactical users can be too ad hoc and time critical, e.g., during disaster response, to support developing a specialized version. Finally, service specialization for mobile web access covers only one of multiple information dissemination and access patterns that arise in tactical operations. This paper presents the design and a prototype implementation of a gateway solution that provides secure tactical-enterprise information exchange and handles the differences in resource availability, QoS requirements, communication formats, and protocols.	enterprise integration;enterprise software;experiment;hoc (programming language);information exchange;internet access;mission critical;mobile app;mobile device;multicast;partial template specialization;performance tuning;prototype;quality of service;requirement;software deployment;threat model	Partha P.

Although there is an abundance of open source tools serving the administrative needs of WSN deployments, there is a lack of tools or platforms for high level integrated WSN management. This is because of a variety of factors, including the lack of open source management tools, the immaturity of tools that offer manageability for WSNs, the limited high level management capabilities of sensor devices and architectures, and the lack of standardization. The current work is, to our knowledge, the first effort to conceptualize, formalize and design a remote, integrated management platform for the support of WSN research laboratories. The platform is based on the integration and extension of two innovative platforms: jWebDust, a WSN operation and management platform, and OpenRSM, an open source integrated remote systems and network management platform. The proposed system architecture can support several levels of integration (infrastructure management, functionality integration, firmware management), corresponding to different use-cases and application settings.	firmware;high-level programming language;open-source software;overhead (computing);systems architecture	Michael N.

Possible sources of that data include intelligent devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.) containing various sensors, Web pages, and social networking sites. Collected data are subject to analysis (using data mining or pattern recognition approaches, for instance) and after processing new content might be inferred. This is a value-added service that can itself be used as a data source. In this paper, we use our University Campus as an example for establishing a data management architecture that integrates into a more general, extensible publish/subscribe based model of crowdsourced applications.	crowdsourcing;data mining;fits;geolocation;pattern recognition;publish–subscribe pattern;sensor;smart city;smartphone;tablet computer;web page	Attila Adamkó;Lajos Kollár	2014		10.5220/0004964802260232	data science;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-41.99884675086993	49.69094397404716	131286

Several policy analysis types, (e.g., policy similarity, policy conflict and change-impact) have been proposed to help administrators maintain consistent and conflict-free policy repositories. However, there has not been much focus on the presentation and the ensuing interpretation of the results of such analyses, which greatly undermines the usability factor. In this paper, we present a novel multi-level grid-based technique for visualizing results of policy analysis. We implemented this technique, and we present a sample policy similarity analysis scenario that highlights the advantages of the proposed result visualization method.	access control;column (database);control system;multi-level governance;software deployment;usability;vii	Prathima Rao;Gabriel Ghinita;Elisa Bertino;Jorge Lobo	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks	10.1109/POLICY.2009.29	computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	Security	-46.68292882076556	56.87676250693681	131395
3b2421ee95201519ff4ee7bf6231c1d5dd2ecea2	distributed electronic rights in javascript	distributed objects;smart contracts;object capabilities;security	Contracts enable mutually suspicious parties to cooperate safely through the exchange of rights. Smart contracts are programs whose behavior enforces the terms of the contract. This paper shows how such contracts can be specified elegantly and executed safely, given an appropriate distributed, secure, persistent, and ubiquitous computational fabric. JavaScript provides the ubiquity but must be significantly extended to deal with the other aspects. The first part of this paper is a progress report on our efforts to turn JavaScript into this fabric. To demonstrate the suitability of this design, we describe an escrow exchange contract implemented in 42 lines of JavaScript code.	accessible surface area;caja project;distributed computing;earthstation 5;interaction;javascript;kelly criterion;organizing (structure);persistent data structure;programming language;scalability;smart contract;software deployment;stanley (vehicle);tom;tyler oakley	Mark S.

7fafbbb4a63df7388cfebc2013e1e57e21f6c16d	open source solutions for building iaas clouds		Cloud Computing is not only a pool of resources and services offered through the internet, but also a technology solution that allows optimization of resources use, costs minimization and energy consumption reduction. Enterprises moving towards cloud technologies have to choose between public cloud services, such as: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Cloud and Google Cloud services, or private self built clouds. While the firsts are offered with affordable fees, the others provide more privacy and control. In this context, many open source softwares approach the buiding of private, public or hybrid clouds depending on the users need and on the available capabilities. To choose among the different open source solutions, an analysis is necessary in order to select the most suitable according with the enterprise’s goals and requirements. In this paper, we present a depth study and comparison of five open source frameworks that are gaining more attention recently and growing fast: CloudStack, OpenStack, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula and Nimbus. We present their architectures and discuss different properties, features, useful information and our own insights on these frameworks.	amazon web services;cloud computing;documentation;google cloud messaging;internet;mathematical optimization;open-source software;privacy;requirement;software technical review;web service	Amine Barkat;Alysson Diniz dos Santos;Sonia Ikken	2015	Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience		simulation;engineering;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-41.302059034275715	57.749692081661635	131548

We design and implement ARO, the mobile Application Resource Optimizer, the first tool that efficiently and accurately exposes the cross-layer interaction among various layers including radio resource channel state, transport layer, application layer, and the user interaction layer to enable the discovery of inefficient resource usage for smartphone applications. To realize this, ARO provides three key novel analyses: (i) accurate inference of lower-layer radio resource control states, (ii) quantification of the resource impact of application traffic patterns, and (iii) detection of energy and radio resource bottlenecks by jointly analyzing cross-layer information. We have implemented ARO and demonstrated its benefit on several essential categories of popular Android applications to detect radio resource and energy inefficiencies, such as unacceptably high (46%) energy overhead of periodic audience measurements and inefficient content prefetching behavior.	android;cpu cache;mobile app;overhead (computing);profiling (computer programming);smartphone	Feng Qian;Zhaoguang Wang;Alexandre Gerber;Zhuoqing Morley Mao;Subhabrata Sen;Oliver Spatscheck	2011		10.1145/1999995.2000026	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;operating system;finite-state machine;world wide web;transport layer;umts frequency bands	Mobile	-35.67017622402797	55.8364885111351	131744

According to technology analysts, IDC, 55.7 million Internet appliances will ship in 2002, with wireless applications representing nearly a third of that number. In addition, the Boston, USA-based, Yankee Group estimates there will be more than 1 billion Web-enabled mobile devices by 2003, generating as much as 63% of transactions on the Web. As the corporate workforce becomes ever more mobile, and increasing numbers of portable devices [capable of supporting Internet Protocol (IP) and enterprise applications] are deployed, there is a growing need for the two environments to converge. In such a mobile (nomadic) environment, where clients are connecting to ever growing networks in an adhoc fashion, the security requirements of such practices become ever more important.	converge;data center;enterprise software;internet appliance;internet protocol suite;mobile device;requirement;software deployment;virtual private network;world wide web	Samantha Donovan;Peter Drabwell;Rae Harbird	2001	Inf.

In typical business-critical services environments the occurrence of interoperability issues can have disastrous consequences, including direct financial costs, reputation, and client fidelity losses. Despite this, experience suggests that interoperability is still quite difficult to achieve, since the heterogeneity of frameworks for providing web services is quite large. In addition, current tools have limited testing capabilities and, in many cases do not specialize in this problem. In this paper we present ITWS, an extensible Interoperability Testing tool for Web Services that is able to assess the interoperability of a web service, supported by any given framework. We have used ITWS to test the interoperability of a set of home-implemented TPC-App web services and a set of thousands of web services created in .NET C# against 11 client-side web service frameworks, including frameworks for mainstream programming languages. Numerous issues have been disclosed, showing the benefits of using ITWS and the importance of testing services for interoperability.	client-side;client–server model;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;programming language;server (computing);ws-i basic profile;web services interoperability;web service;world wide web	Ivano Alessandro Elia;Nuno Laranjeiro;Marco Vieira	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services	10.1109/ICWS.2014.65	web service;web application security;semantic interoperability;interoperability;web development;web modeling;language interoperability;web design;web standards;computer science;ws-policy;data mining;ws-addressing;database;software testing;web intelligence;ws-i basic profile;web 2.0;law;cross-domain interoperability;world wide web;universal description discovery and integration	DB	-42.83290301219418	54.87667656221313	132274

2ff2d7d6e4d2d76fa1c852ba94cdb2f340aadc91	social internet of vehicles: complexity, adaptivity, issues and beyond		Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is a specialized form of adaptive networks, where any change in one node can affect other nodes in the network. Millions of devices, including vehicles, buildings, healthcare, industries, and several other types of devices, share and exchange sensitive data among each other. Interconnection of these devices changes the paradigms of the world around us and puts a great effect on the overall society. The number of nodes, types of devices, layout of the overall network, and sensitivity of the data adds more and more complexity in the domain of SIoT. In this paper, our contribution is twofold, first, we provide a brief and comprehensive overview of the social aspects of the IoT by selecting the most recent papers to investigate the complexity, adaptivity, and other social aspects of the IoT and their implications. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the benefits of IoT to the society, social acceptance of IoTs, and social connectivity of different age groups. Second, we forecast the future trends and predict the world in the year 2020. We provide a detailed analysis by using several different data tables to present the future trends of different aspects of SIoT. With this survey, we aim to provide an easy and concise view of different challenges in implementing SIoT and how it will affect the future smart cities and overall impact on the society.

The goal of efficient energy management is to match the performance of the WNIC to the network activity shaped by a running application. In the case of interactive applications on mobile systems, network I/O is largely driven by user interactions. Current solutions either require application modifications or lack a sufficient context of execution that is crucial in making accurate and timely predictions. This paper proposes a range of user-interaction-aware mechanisms that utilize a novel approach of monitoring a user's interaction with applications through the capture and classification of mouse events. This approach yields considerable improvements in energy savings and delay reductions of the WNIC, while significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and computational overhead of predictions when compared to existing state-of-the-art solutions.	computation;high- and low-level;input/output;interaction;mobile device;network interface controller;overhead (computing);programmer	Igor Crk;Mingsong Bi;Chris Gniady	2008		10.1145/1375457.1375499	embedded system;design;real-time computing;simulation;prediction;performance;computer science;resource management;operating system;wireless network;measurement;statistics;computer network;energy management	Metrics	-35.758138689970366	55.683840946189996	132808
fc55c580a36d749e3352b9835fd6d987f26c9268	a survey of sensor network applications and architectural components		Wireless sensor networks have always been designed for monitoring physical environments and reporting the obtained data to a central collection point, called base station (or sink), to analyze them. This type of network consists of tiny, batterypowered devices, called sensor nodes, which are able to store and process data, and communicate results to the external world. It is well known that wireless sensor networks can be used for a wide variety of applications dealing with monitoring control, and surveillance. In this paper, we propose a classification of applications of wireless sensor networks based on their application domains. Precisely, we focus on five application domains, namely healthcare, agriculture, environmental, industry, and military. For each application domain, we give an overview of a variety of applications of wireless sensor networks. Moreover, we describe the main hardware and software components that are essential for the design and development of this type of network.		Habib M. Ammari;Nicholas Gomes;Matthew Jacques;Bruce R.

What can be observed depends on the activity, the person observing (e.g. a carer) and policy. In assisted living smart house environments, a single privacy policy, applied throughout, would be either too invasive for an occupant, or too restrictive for an observer, due to the conflicting goals of surveillance and private environments. Hence, we propose a dynamic method for altering the level of privacy in the environment based on the context, the situation within the environment, encompassing factors relevant to ensuring the occupant's safety and privacy. The context is mapped to an appropriate level of privacy, which is implemented by controlling access to data sources (e.g. video) using data hiding techniques. The aim of this work is to decrease the invasiveness of the technology, while retaining the purpose of the system.	data access;internet privacy;modality (human–computer interaction);privacy policy;smart house	Simon Moncrieff;Svetha Venkatesh;Geoff A.

To understand these impacts we need to identify the different levels of connectivity between real and virtual worlds and therefore the relationship of a product with its digital counterpart. As a point of departure we define the terms medium and agent to get a theoretical view on the associations in the real and virtual world.

RPS is not only capable of locating the nearest printers but also allows mobile users to print without having to install any printer drivers. Most of the time users can print even without having to download the file to the mobile device.

However, researchers have found that these two entities are closely correlated with each other after integration of sensor/actuators in the cyber systems. Cyber systems became responsive to the physical world by enabling real time control emanating from conventional embedded systems, thus emerging a new research paradigm named Cyber Physical System (CPS). In this article, we investigate major challenges in the integration of cyber world with physical world and its applications. In addition, we propose an architecture which contains several modules supporting the CPS. We found that every module in our proposed architecture has its own significance and can be applied to various applications.	embedded system;entity;programming paradigm;quality of service;real-time computing;scalability;von neumann architecture	Syed Hassan Ahmed;Gwanghyeon Kim;Dongkyun Kim	2013	2013 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2013.6686528	embedded system;simulation;engineering;cyber-physical system;computer security	EDA	-46.06777355928995	48.094019207337595	133456

One of the fundamental challenging issues is privacy measurement. Without a practical and effective way to quantify, measure and evaluate privacy, it is hard for social networking sites and users to make and adjust privacy settings to protect privacy. In this paper, we introduce a practical and effective approach for privacy measurement in social networks. We use Privacy Index (PIDX) to measure a user's privacy exposure in a social network. PIDX is a numerical value between 0 and 100. High PIDX value indicates high privacy risk in social networks. A privacy index function PIDX(i, j) is proposed to evaluate actor Aj's privacy exposure to actor Aj. Using this model, it is convenient to evaluate any users' privacy exposure to their friends, friends of friends, and public. We further develop a social network privacy simulation tool, OSNPIDX, to verify the effectiveness of our approach.	numerical analysis;privacy;simulation;social network	Yong Wang;Raj Kumar Nepali;Jason Nikolai	2014	2014 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785440	privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-39.795640818505895	59.06893234653907	133476
f7c3c3d357b3b72595449329e9be0ce133ad7617	mobile privacy-preserving crowdsourced data collection in the smart city		Smart cities rely on dynamic and real-time data to enable smart urban applications such as intelligent transp ort and epidemics detection. However, the streaming of big data fro m IoT devices, especially from mobile platforms like pedestr ians and cars, raises significant privacy concerns. Future autonomous vehicles will generate, collect and cons ume significant volumes of data to be utilized in delivering safeand efficient transportation solutions. The sensed data will, i nherently, contain personally identifiable and attributable informat ion both external (other vehicles, environmental) and internal (driver, passengers, devices). The autonomous vehicles are connected to the infrastructur e cloud (e.g., Amazon), the edge cloud, and also the mobile clo ud (vehicle to vehicle). Clearly these different entities mus t cooperate and interoperate in a timely fashion when routing and transferring the highly dynamic data. In order to maximise the availability and utility of the sensed data, stakeholders must have confidence that the data they transmit, receive, aggregate a nd reason on is appropriately secured and protected throughou t. There are many different metaphors for providing end-to-end security for data exchanges, but they commonly require a management and control sidechannel. This work proposes a scalable smart city privacy-preserving architecture named AUTHORIZED ANALYTICS that enables each node (e.g. vehicle) to divulge (contextually) local privat ised data. AUTHORIZED ANALYTICS is shown to scale gracefully to IoT scope deployments.	aggregate data;autonomous robot;big data;crowdsourcing;dynamic data;end-to-end principle;entity;interoperability;mobile device;norm (social);open road tolling;privacy;real-time data;routing;scalability;smart city	Joshua Joy;Ciaran McGoldrick;Mario Gerla	2015	CoRR		simulation;internet privacy;computer security	Mobile	-42.37160204201878	51.53126746108646	133579

Consequently, this has rendered many of the existing conventional security countermeasures less effective for mobile agents. In this paper, we propose a new philosophy of trust enhanced security, which advocates a paradigm shift for mobile agent security solutions: from security-centric to trust-centric with the aim of providing improved security and performance of mobile agents. We first examine the problem of uncertainty in behavior induced by the security assumption violations by mobile agents; we then propose a trust enhanced security approach and argue for the need for a paradigm shift to trust-centric solutions. Next we identify a list of general design requirements for the trust-centric solutions and outline the new architectural design which supports the new trust enhanced security philosophy in practice.

Mobility also enables distributed systems to evolve; for instance, the deployment of a new service over a network can be programmed as part of the service itself. Of course, moving programs introduces new challenges. One of these is related to program structure: How much of a computation should be moved? Where are the boundaries between mobile and immobile entities drawn? A second challenge is to provide security guarantees: How can the actions of mobile agent be controlled? And what kinds of security properties can we realistically expect to enforce? We answer these questions within the framework of the JavaSeal mobile agent system kernel. JavaSeal provides several abstractions for constructing agent systems in Java. Our basic building block is the seal which is a nested encapsulated computation fragment with sharply delineated boundaries. Strands are sequential threads of computation bound to a seal. Capsules transfer passive seals and objects over communication channels; Traffic over channels is regulated by portals. We argue that these abstractions are sufficient to program secure mobile agent systems. An electronic commerce application built over our kernel is used as a demonstrator.	authentication;computation;covert channel;distributed computing;e-commerce;entity;high- and low-level;interrupt;java classloader;java development kit (jdk);kernel (operating system);locality of reference;lock (computer science);machine-dependent software;mobile agent;portals;programming paradigm;seal (cipher);software deployment;structured programming;thread (computing);type system	Ciarán Bryce;Jan Vitek	2001	Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems	10.1023/A:1012715226170	e-commerce;real-time computing;mobile search;computer science;artificial intelligence;information security;mobile agent;distributed computing;programming paradigm;mobile computing;computer security;channel	Security	-45.71856907381998	53.38952979964846	134052

For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of “self-driving” cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of “connected vehicles” (United States) or “cooperative ITS” (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities. We analyze the threats on autonomous automated vehicles and cooperative automated vehicles. This analysis shows the need for considerably more redundancy than many have been expecting. We also raise awareness to generate discussion about these threats at this early stage in the development of vehicle automation systems.	authentication;autonomous car;autonomous robot;computer security;countermeasure (computer);error analysis for the global positioning system;fault tolerance;modality (human–computer interaction);parallels desktop for mac;patch (computing);redundancy (engineering);reference architecture;satellite navigation;selective availability anti-spoofing module;software deployment;vehicle-to-vehicle;vulnerability (computing)	Jonathan Petit;Steven E.

37ff4166f38e430622c67b2414ff5f821f21b10f	a fog-based distributed look-up service for intelligent transportation systems		Future intelligent transportation systems and applications are expected to greatly benefit from the integration with a cloud computing infrastructure for service reliability and efficiency. More recently, fog computing has been proposed as a new computing paradigm to support low-latency and location-aware services by moving the execution of application logic on devices at the edge of the network in proximity of the physical systems, e.g. in the roadside infrastructure or directly in the connected vehicles. Such distributed runtime environment can support low-latency communication with sensors and actuators thus allowing functions such as monitoring and remote control, e.g. for remote telemetry of public transport vehicles or remote control under emergency situations, respectively. These applications will require support for some basic functionalities from the runtime. Among them, discovery of sensors and actuators will be a significant challenge considering the large variety of sensors and actuators and their mobility. In this paper, a discovery service specifically tailored for fog computing platforms with mobile nodes is proposed. Instead of adopting a centralized approach, we propose an approach based on a distributed hash table to be implemented by fog nodes, exploiting their storage and computation capabilities. The proposed approach supports by design multiple attributes and range queries. A prototype of the proposed service has been implemented and evaluated experimentally.	as-interface;big data;business logic;centralized computing;cloud computing;computation;distributed hash table;experiment;fog computing;load balancing (computing);location awareness;lookup table;marco dorigo;programming paradigm;prototype;range query (data structures);remote control;runtime system;sensor	Giacomo Tanganelli;Carlo Vallati;Enzo Mingozzi	2017	2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974357	computer network;cloud computing;range query (data structures);utility computing;distributed computing;computation;distributed hash table;intelligent transportation system;computer science;real-time computing;telemetry;edge computing	Mobile	-41.480124615529796	48.52516360560667	134362

Therefore, users of entry-level mobile phones as well as users who cannot afford a data plan are excluded from the current dynamics of mobile applications consumption. A possible approach to include those users is the usage of SMS as the communication channel. Although SMS is widely supported by carriers and extremely popular among users, it is not trivial to replace the data connection capabilities with SMS. This work addresses this issue with an integrated solution composed by a client platform and a server-side system.This solution enables GUI-based mobile applications to be transferred over a short number of concatenated SMSs. It also presents components for the creation, deployment and distribution of mobile applications. In order to attest the relevance of such solution, an experiment was conducted and its results indicate a substantial level of acceptance by target group.	app store;channel (communications);cloud computing;concatenation;digital distribution;ecosystem;electronic billing;experiment;fits;feature phone;generic eclipse modeling system;graphical user interface;internet access;mobile app;mobile phone;relevance;rubygems;server-side;smartphone;software deployment;web service	Mauro Teófilo;Daniel Risi;Vicente Ferreira de Lucena Junior;Thomaz Philippe Cavalcante Silva;Luiz Carlos A.

Lately the concept of Federated Mission Networking following Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is being developed by NATO. In terms of secure information exchange for SOA-based services it proposes to use Web Authentication standard based on WS-Federation.

Trust is an important aspect which enhances reliability of federated identity management. Existing service provider-initiated or identity-provider initiated identity sharing models for SSO does not analyse the reliability of the trust based inter-relationships. In this paper we describe a model to analyse the reliability of existing trust based inter-relationships of federated identity management models in InterCloud using graph coloring. The analyses shows that reliability of federated identity management with SSO can be enhanced with strong trustworthy inter-relationships and in addition the reliability depends on the InterCloud deployment architecture.	authentication;entity;federated identity;graph coloring;identity management;identity provider;intercloud;operability;reliability engineering;single sign-on;software deployment	Uthpala Subodhani Premarathne	2017	2017 14th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983131	federated identity;software deployment;intercloud;computer network;cloud computing;distributed computing;architecture;computer science;identity management;graph coloring;authentication	DB	-47.32916973949591	55.319919533689514	134924
144fd073451805e30c5c8d6b58cb6c4a08eaca2a	stateless multiparty trust negotiation protocol for distributed systems		One of the most challenging problems in managing open distributed systems is specifying and enforcing security policies that regulate communications between peers and access to sensitive credentials. Existing academic research in Trust Management (TM) mainly focuses on establishing trust between two entities using the Automatic Trust Negotiation (ATN). However, real-word authorization processes, such as Service Level Agreement Negotiation (SLA), often involves more than two parties. Decomposition is insufficient to reduce an automated Multiparty Authorization into individual Automated Trust Negotiations, as individual negotiations may depend on one another; therefore, negotiation needs to be concurrent for the negotiation process to succeed. This paper proposes a distributed protocol that performs the trust establishment without a centralized moderator. Along with this protocol, a negotiation resolution algorithm known as Stateless Eager Multiparty Trust Negotiation strategy (SEMTN) is proposed in order to orchestrate the multiparty trust negotiation process. This paper shows that SEMTN is stateless, safe, and complete.	algorithm;authorization;best, worst and average case;centralized computing;communication complexity;computation;credential;distributed computing;entity;google moderator;relevance;service-level agreement;stateless protocol;trust management (managerial science)	Maha Ali Allouzi;Javed I.

43c51e93e15c8d8de3bf1ae2aa93ac50c20f9431	jsrex: an efficient javascript-based middleware for multi-platform mobile peer-to-peer networks		Code offloading on mobile platforms has received much attention as a way of relieving heavy workload by utilizing power of the other devices or cloud servers. The offloading mechanisms rely on multiple platforms to be enabled on variety of mobile devices. To support platform heterogeneity, the execution code should be implemented in JavaScript and executed on the designate devices by correspondingly compatible JavaScript engine. In this paper, we present a novel distribution mechanism with a built-in JavaScript execution package, annotation processor and an engine to enable code offloading among the devices and servers in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. This approach includes a set of constraints for code implementation so developers can easily integrate to their project. Our evaluation, based on a testbed with Android and Windows Phone devices, demonstrates the efficiency of offloading JavaScript-based packages on multiple devices, as well as compares the performance between JavaScript and native versions.	android;canonical account;javascript engine;microsoft windows;middleware;mobile device;peer-to-peer;testbed;windows phone	Minh Le;Stephen W.

Using location-tracking systems, this framework can navigate mobile agents to stationary or mobile computers near the locations of the entities and places to which the agents are attached, even when the locations change. The framework provides a way for mobile agents to follow their users as they move about and to adhere to places as virtual Post-its.

Decentralised security architectures allow the stakeholders in these distributed computations, the providers of both compute resources and the applications executing on them, to have a say in how a computation progresses. One of the most important issues in creating authorisation policies is how the components of these distributed applications are named. Providing a consistent and flexible naming architecture allows more fine-grained and usable security policies to be created and enforced.This paper introduces the naming architecture for the WebCom system. This architecture supports the addressing of all required information, with as much precision as is needed to create sophisticated authorisation policies.	authorization;computation;distributed computing;grid computing;web service	Thomas B.

In this situation, a user's context plays a key role. Unfortunately, the ubiquitous environment introduces some problems. The first is ease of access to what users truly want. The second important problem is handling private information. In utilizing a ubiquitous environment, all of a user's context is held online, and applications may share them to propose advanced services. Therefore, a user's context is automatically transmitted or attached as metadata. The context, however, includes the user's private information. Therefore, we need a system that separates information into private and public elements and treats them differently. In view of this, we consider how to attach metadata and how to extract and protect transmitted private information, in the specific case of blog entries. We propose a method of protecting private information that expands the existing item definition format in the CaTaC platform.

As the hardware industry continues making much smaller, compact and cheap hardware, the vision of having plenty of very small powerful digital networking nodes in, for e.g., the living room or bedroom, is not so far. Designing software that can make optimal use of all these computational nodes when needed is still challenging; since software will not only consume information from these nodes but parts of the software can be hosted on these different nodes. In this paper we propose the BubbleCodes Framework which is a generic application partitioning and retraction framework for next generation context-aware applications that will have the capabilities to partition and retract themselves on multiple computational nodes in a pervasive environment.

Our proposed model can save the time, minimize the effort for system operators when deploying development environment using Vagrant and guarantee the uniform working environment for users. Through our solution, all of administration task will be carried out on a centralized location so that the deployment process of virtual machines and environment will be executed automatically. In addition, in order to improve security for our system, we not only integrate the authentication and authorization mechanism but also implement the secured channel among nodes for encrypting traffic in our system to mitigate the internal and external attacks.	authentication;authorization;centralized computing;encryption;software deployment;sysop;virtual machine	Nam Pham Nguyen Xuan;Sungmin Lim;Souhwan Jung	2017		10.1145/3022227.3022263	embedded system;simulation;devops;database;development environment;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.26124517557734	58.88625831022439	137289

Application engineers have to deal with a new set of problems caused by mobility, such as low bandwidth, context changes or loss of connectivity. During disconnection, users will typically update local replicas of shared data independently from each other. The resulting inconsistent replicas need to be reconciled upon re-connection. To support building mobile applications that use both replication and reconciliation over ad-hoc networks, we have designed XMIDDLE, a mobile computing middleware. In this paper we describe XMIDDLE and show how it uses reflection capabilities to allow application engineers to influence replication and reconciliation techniques. XMIDDLE enables the transparent sharing of XML documents across heterogeneous mobile hosts, allowing on-line and off-line access to data. We describe XMIDDLE using a collaborative e-shopping case study on mobile clients.	computer;concurrent data structure;distributed computing;hoc (programming language);laptop;middleware;mobile app;mobile computing;mobile phone;online and offline;online shopping;personal digital assistant;xml	Stefanos Zachariadis;Licia Capra;Cecilia Mascolo;Wolfgang Emmerich	2002		10.1145/581339.581463	communications protocol;data structure;computer science;operating system;software engineering;database;distributed computing;programming language;mobile computing;world wide web	Mobile	-35.120065471389125	47.62702466690222	137838

However, the development of web applications adds a few more issues when accessing, managing, combining and orchestrating cloud resources in the application's logic. This paper proposes an extensible platform architecture for portable cloud service integration. It was designed to satisfy requirements and usage patterns of web applications. Moreover, it implements access control policies and mechanisms for sharing and delegation of resources. The article also explains how the platform can be implemented over existent interoperability frameworks, concretely the mOSAIC platform.

Active properties can modify the document’s content as seen by a user. Thus, the caching mechanisms must take into account that a document’s content not only depends on when the document was last modified, but also on the set of personal and universal properties attached to the document and the information on which these properties depend. Interestingly, active properties can be used to help caches manage their contents by notifying them of events that affect cache consistency, by providing caches with document-specific verifiers to further check on a document’s consistency, and by returning information that can aid in decisions of which documents to cache.	cache (computing);cache coherence;www	Eyal de Lara;Karin Petersen;Douglas B.

28e04254c0399a177048a3ef439538e0438228c1	towards middleware support for mobile and cellular networks: core problems and illustrated approaches		Mobile computing poses different requirements on middleware than more traditional desktop systems interconnected by fixed networks. Not only the characteristics of mobile network technologies as for example lower bandwidth and unreliability demand for customized support. Moreover, the devices employed in mobile settings usually are less powerful than their desktop counterparts. Slow processors, a fairly limited amount of memory, and smaller displays are typical properties of mobile equipment, again requiring special treatment. Furthermore, user mobility results in additional requirements on appropriate middleware support. As opposed to the quite static environments dominating the world of desktop computing, dynamic aspects gain more importance. Suitable strategies and techniques for exploring the environment e.g. in order to discover services available locally are only one example. Managing resources in a fault-tolerant manner, reducing the impact ill-behaved clients have on system stability define yet another exemplary prerequisite. Most state of the art middleware has been designed for use in the realm of static, resource rich environments and hence is not immediately applicable in mobile settings as set forth above. The work described throughout this thesis aims at investigating the suitability of different middleware technologies with regard to application design, development, and deployment in the context of mobile networks. Mostly based upon prototypes, shortcomings of those technologies are identified and possible solutions are proposed and evaluated where appropriate. Besides tailoring middleware to specific communication and device characteristics, the cellular structure of current mobile networks may and shall be exploited in favor of more scalable and robust systems. Hence, an additional topic considered within this thesis is to point out and investigate suitable approaches permitting to benefit from such cellular infrastructures. In particular, a system architecture for the development of applications in the context of mobile networks will be proposed. An evaluation of this architecture employing mobile agents as flexible, network-side representatives for mobile terminals is performed, again based upon a prototype application. In summary, this thesis aims at providing several complementary approaches regarding middleware support tailored for mobile, cellular networks, a field considered to be of rising importance in a world where mobile communication and particularly data services emerge rapidly, augmenting the globally interconnecting, wired Internet.	central processing unit;desktop computer;fault tolerance;middleware;mobile agent;mobile computing;prototype;requirement;scalability;software deployment;systems architecture;yet another	Steffen Rothkugel	2002			theoretical computer science;middleware;computer science;cellular network;distributed computing	Mobile	-40.114188021064884	46.453578533041906	138187

In particular, machine vision applications are expected to play a fundamental role in solving important problems in safety, security, environmental, and industrial issues on a global scale. With the proliferation of camera networks consisting of low-cost/high-performance image sensors, and recent increases in computational power, the basic infrastructure is now readily available to support smart systems for various applications such as factory automation, surveillance, intelligent transport systems, and sensor networks for environmental monitoring. Our current challenge is to develop keymachine vision technologies and systemswhich canmeet practical solutions of such applications.

773d26243a88131578bddcdff7367cf79c6af7f9	mutt: a watchdog for osn applications		Services such as Facebook and Twitter host and disseminate data on behalf of billions of users. Because these services often manage personal data, they allow users to specify access policies controlling how their data is shared with others within the service. However, services also act as programming platforms, exporting users' data to third-party applications via remote APIs. Nearly all of these third-party applications execute on server infrastructure that is not controlled by the service. As a result, a service has no way to guarantee that data shared with a third-party application will be managed according to users' policies. Delegation protocols such as OAuth allow a user and service to confer or deny an application's right to access a data item, but once the item has been released there is no oversight of what the application does with it. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a Multi-User Taint Tracker (MUTT), which ensures that third-party applications adhere to access policies defined by service users. We motivate MUTT's design by analyzing 170 Facebook apps and several services' Terms of Service, and demonstrate the feasibility of our design through experiments with a prototype implementation.	application programming interface;bittorrent tracker;data item;experiment;multi-user;oauth;personally identifiable information;prototype;server (computing);taint checking;terms of service;watchdog timer	Amre Shakimov;Landon P.

The paper also discusses how a relatively simple but efficient method of SMS pushing through a GSM modem can be implemented as a solution to this problem which is a one of a kind architecture and implementation.

The connection of audio and video devices through high speed multimedia pervasive networks will make the use of these systems more convenient. For example, many home appliances, such as video cameras, display monitors, video recorders, audio systems, and so on, will be equipped with a communication interface in the near future. Recently some platforms (i.e. UPnP, Jini, HAVi and so on) have been proposed for constructing multimedia pervasive networks, however, there are still some issues to be solved before we can achieve various services that connect different equipment via the network. In case of UPnP based on SOAP, it is necessary to standardize a way to control any feature of a new (undefined) device connected to the network and update the software in the controller device. Meanwhile, Jini based on RMI technology, or HAVi developed for intelligent AV equipment, has a mechanism to upload software module from a new device connected to the network to the controller device. Although standardizing the new devices’ features is not needed, HAVi devices require high CPU power and large memory. Considering that the targets of these home alliances are embedded systems, this situation raises issues of software and hardware complexity, cost, power consumption, and so on. In this study, we developed SONICA, a service oriented network architecture for the control and management of home appliances to address the issues described	central processing unit;embedded system;ieee 1394;interoperability;network architecture;pervasive informatics;soap;ubiquitous computing;undefined behavior;universal plug and play;upload;videocassette recorder;jini	Hiroshi Hayakawa;Takahiro Koita;Kenya Sato	2006			computer science;software engineering;service design;distributed computing;computer network	HCI	-36.592604048029514	53.063420364373656	138585

Even though several protocols exist for desktop remote computing, we argue that these cannot be applied as-is for mobile-to-mobile remote computing. In this context, we introduce Peek, a remote computing protocol with i) multi-touch support, ii) context association, and iii) multi-modal frame compression. Through implementation on real devices, we show that Peek reduces the time taken to perform actions on a server by 62% on average, compared to Virtual Network Computing (VNC). We also test Peek's multi-modal frame compression, against VNC, on datasets and show that it has the potential to reduce 30% of the bytes sent on the network.	byte;cloud computing;data compression;desktop computer;input/output;modal logic;multi-touch;peek;remote computer;server (computing);smartphone;tablet computer	Uma Parthavi Moravapalle;Raghupathy Sivakumar	2016	2016 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2016.7440689	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;world wide web	HPC	-37.649078082939816	49.60418294763614	138704

People are able to distribute and play various media content with many types of networked multimedia devices for home multimedia entertainment in residential environments. This paper addresses a new idea of home-based IoT networks where home-networked devices are able to communicate with others in a friendly, networked manner instead of traditional manual configurations and wired cabling operations. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel intelligent media distribution system based on a home-based IoT network. The design of this system integrates UPnP, face recognition, intelligent human-machine interface, and family database technologies. UPnP-compatible HNDs With UPnP, networked devices can discover neighboring devices in a network. Face recognition is incorporated and so provides the UPnP networked devices with the capability of identifying the operating user in front of them. When a user moves in a home-based network, the intelligent human-machine interface allows a user to enforce any media content to be distributed to or displayed onto the UPnP-based device nearby the user. Furthermore, this paper presents a prototypical development, as well as a real demonstration with experimental UPnP-based network devices in home networks. Therefore, the study in this paper enables a ubiquitous media distribution service in home-based IoT network environments.	facial recognition system;penetration test;universal plug and play;user interface	Chih-Lin Hu;Hung-Tsung Huang;Cheng-Lung Lin;Nguyen Huu Minh Anh;Yi-Yu Su;Pin-Chuan Liu	2013	2013 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/ICPADS.2013.108	facial recognition system;universal plug and play;home automation;computer science;operating system;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Robotics	-38.2127658994297	50.8439072054145	139564

8d7e6e268e86a0727b48d4125368d1eeee98aac9	suids : a resource-efficient intrusion detection system for ubiquitous computing environments	qa75 electronic computers computer science	The background of the project is based on the notion of ubiquitous computing. Ubiquitous computing was introduced as a prospective view about future usage of computers. Smaller and cheaper computer chips will enable us to embed computing ability into any appliances. Along with the convenience brought by ubiquitous computing, its inherent features also exposed its weaknesses. It makes things too easy for a malicious user to spy on others. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a tool used to protect computer resources against malicious activities. Existing IDSs have several weaknesses that hinder their direct application to ubiquitous networks. These shortcomings are caused by their lack of considerations about the heterogeneity, flexibility and resource constraints of ubiquitous networks. Thus the evolution towards ubiquitous computing demands a new generation of resource-efficient IDSs to provide sufficient protections against malicious activities. SUIDS is the first intrusion detection system proposed for ubiquitous computing environments. It keeps the special requirements of ubiquitous computing in mind throughout its design and implementation. SUIDS adopts a layered and distributed system architecture, a novel user-centric design and service-oriented detection method, a new resource-sensitive scheme, including protocols and strategies, and a novel hybrid metric based algorithm.

1cb220d8e50f1d22ed6c42b51deeae265efea77c	editorial of special section on enabling technologies for industrial and smart sensor internet of things systems		Internet of things (IoT) makes human life much easier by enabling smart machines sensing, data-gathering, processing, interacting and communicating with each other in every aspect of our lives.Recently, there are growing interests in using IoT technologies in various industries. IoT is expected to provide promising solutions to many existing industrial processes and systems such as manufacturing, logistics, facility diagnostics, product inspection and power systems. Such expectations lead to rapid expansion to the new concept of Industrial IoT (IIoT) based on Smart Sensors (e.g., Industry 4.0, Smart Factory, etc.). In near future, IIoT will be broadly utilized in industrial enterprises to remotely monitor and control the status of machineries and facilities, and it can also manage the production parameters in industrial processes. However, the current IIoT technologies are still their infancy, and the salient characteristics and requirements for different industries continuously impose many research challenges to address for their industrial use, for example, embedded devices, networking, sensor deployment, cloud computing, big data analysis, security and privacy. In this special section, we solicited original and novel research in all areas of Industrial and Smart Sensor Internet of Things Systems, Applications, and Services. In a thorough and intensive peer-reviewed process, twenty four manuscripts were selected during first review process. The manuscripts were finally selected for this Special Section after the first and second review processes. Each manuscript selected was blindly reviewed by at least three reviewers consisting of guest editors and external reviewers. Finally, our thanks go to all editorial staffs and reviewers for their valuable support throughout the preparation andpublicationof this Special Section.Wearemost grateful	big data;cloud computing;embedded system;goto;ibm power systems;industrial pc;industry 4.0;interaction;internet of things;logistics;requirement;sensor;smart transducer;software deployment	Jaeik Cho;Naveen K.

This paper presents a primitive capability-based access control architecture that can model a variety of authorization policies for object-oriented systems. The architecture described is integrated at the meta-object level of the Meta-Object Operating System Environment, providing a common foundation for access control in heterogeneous object models.	access control;authorization;capability-based security;information security;metaobject;operating system	John Hale;Jody Threet;Sujeet Shenoi	1997			access control;information security;architecture;authorization;object-oriented programming;distributed computing;computer science	Security	-46.83256017461742	53.050064908065174	140076

The heterogeneity and complexity of corporate environments burdens the security administrator with writing equally complex policies. This paper proposes an architecture based on Web Services, policy provisioning, and authorization certificates, to build up a loosely coupled unified administrative control for corporate environments. A certificate-based permission management scheme is used to derive new policies in the local domains of each branch. These new policies will update the corporate repository which, in turn, will configure the corresponding policies in the local domains of each branch. The Web Services technology provides the underlying protocols for the development of a prototype which shows the feasibility of our proposal.	authorization;loose coupling;prototype;provisioning;public key certificate;web service;world wide web	Arlindo L.

For such purpose, the PN must securely accommodate heterogeneous technologies with uneven computational and communication resources. In particular, personal radio frequency identification (RFID) tags can enable seamless recognition of user’s context, provide user authentication, and enable novel services enhancing the quality and quantity of data handled by the PN. However, the highly constrained features of common RFID tags and their passive role in the network highlights the need of an adequate secure communication model with personal tags, which enables their participation as a member of the PN. In this paper, we present our concept of PN, with special emphasis on the role of RFID and sensor networks, and define a secure architecture for PNs including methods for the secure access to context-aware technologies from both local PN members and the Internet of Things. The PN architecture is designed to support differentiated security mechanisms to maximize the level of security for each type of personal device. Furthermore, we analyze which security solutions available in the literature can be adapted for our architecture, as well as the challenges and security mechanisms still necessary in the secure integration of personal tags.

Local councilshave promoted individual Smart Citypractices through investments in dif-ferent sensor systems, infrastructures,measurements and modernisation. Anenormous amount of data is now avail-able, collected from sensors with dif-ferent architectures and specifications.The challenge in turning this into rele-vant information for citizens. Thisproject aimed to research and develop asingle framework for the design of anintegral Smart City strategy based on asingle plugp the server (SERVER) givesintelligence to the system using algo-rithms that transforms the data into rele-vant information; and the users (CON-SUMERS) that query this informationin real-time.The layer of the data producers (PRO-DUCERS) is formed by three types ofsensors which are outlined in Table 1.The data produced by the sensors aresent to the server, where the occupancystatus of each parking spaces is stored.This layer is responsible for providingintelligence to the system, processing alldata captured and transforming theminto relevant information. Then the userscan access the services offered by thesystem from any device with internetaccess. They can check the real-timeoccupancy status of parking spaces andview the history of occupation. It is alsopossible to know if a space is under- orover-utlized.

An individual may use a LAN e-mail program at work, but when connecting from home they may not have access to the LAN. In an attempt to achieve several goals, The Ohio State University has put together a suite of applications designed to meet the needs of most of our end users. The purpose of this suite of software is to provide Internet access from the Home (HomeNet), Office (OfficeNet), Public Labs (LabNet). and Residence Halls (ResNet) in a seamless cohesive manner. A paper titled “Extending the Internet into the Home at The Ohio State University” was presented at the 1993 SIGUCCS conference that describes the basic design of what is now called HomeNet, OfficeNet, LabNet. and ResNet. It is sometimes jokingly refereed to as *net.	accessibility;canonical account;client–server model;communications protocol;cyclone;email;internet access;microsoft windows;operating system;seamless3d;server (computing);time complexity;user interface;windows 95;windows nt	Jerry Martin	1996		10.1145/262051.262084	client;reverse proxy;log shipping;operating system;internet authentication service;appleshare;client-side;database;server-side;fat client;upstream;world wide web;windows server;client–server model;server farm;remote evaluation	HCI	-34.856149236987065	50.823718855596596	140588

The customized security services support is based on a secure node architecture that includes an active node operating system security API, an active security guardian, and quality of protection provisions. The support of highly customized security services permits active nodes to satisfy the application-specific dynamic security and protection requirements. It associates quality of protection with network software and application security. Applications can dynamically select the suitable security configurations and services at each active routing node, based on their security and performance requirements. The secure node architecture, together with the support of dynamically customized security services, can provide a fundamental base for securing the active network infrastructure and active applications.	access control;active networking;application programming interface;application security;authentication;authorization;operating system;requirement;routing	Zhaoyu Liu;Roy H.

It is envisioned that smart living will enable a healthier, safer and more comfortable life while reducing resource consumption. Unfortunately, adoption of smart-living technologies and services has been very slow especially in residential environments. Several factors have contributed to such slow and limited deployment. First, installation and configuration of a smart system is usually complicated. Second, maintenance is always a headache for ordinary users. Any repair that requires rewiring is not only time consuming but also very costly. Finally, access to smart-living information and services was not properly addressed. In views of these challenges, a green and context-aware platform is proposed for smart living. In this platform, a full range of self-powered behavioral sensors are developed. These sensors connect objects including toilets, doors, windows, gas stoves, faucets and even tooth brushes to a home network so that various user/environment activities can be recorded. The platform, with the the help of our sensors, is able to provide customized, context-aware services without using any intrusive sensors such as cameras. The platform is implemented in an off-campus apartment to demonstrate its potentials.	context-aware network;home automation;killer application;microsoft windows;sensor;smart system;software deployment	Chun-Yu Chen;Yu-Jen Ku;Chih-Wei Ho;Yan-Ze Lin;Chun-Ting Chou	2013	2013 IEEE 6th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications	10.1109/SOCA.2013.22	green computing;embedded system;simulation;logic gate;computer science;operating system;computer security;ubiquitous computing;server;intelligent sensor	Mobile	-38.99035972299842	52.10908063905488	141499

In a SOA, software functionalities are represented as discoverable services that are accessed through a network. SOA is a promising approach for Enterprise Application Integration problems. As computing becomes ubiquitous and users are supported by a wide range of mobile devices, enterprises have to think about integrating mobile clients into a SOA. We introduce an architecture that supports communication between mobile devices and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems equipped with a Web Services Façade.

The need for systems such as STAC becomes critical when participants of crowd sensing applications hesitate to share their locations due to privacy concerns. In such applications, STAC enables effective task assignment capabilities without compromising the location privacy of workers and volunteers. STAC implements novel algorithms that handle uncertain task assignment, which is a challenging problem involving uncertain locations of participants as a result of location cloaking. We will demonstrate, from both synthetic and real data, that our methods achieve high sensing coverage with low cost using cloaked participant locations. We will also demonstrate a location-based mobile Q&A application that utilizes STAC for task assignment.	algorithm;augmented assignment;lempel–ziv–stac;synthetic intelligence	Layla Pournajaf;Li Xiong;Vaidy S.

a78cdcf8820791be10f4910349e4499e5a167ae1	offloadable apps using smartdiet: towards an analysis toolkit for mobile application developers		Offloading work to cloud is one of the proposed solutions for increasing the battery life of mobile devices. Most prior research has focused on computation-intensive applications, even though such applications are not the most popular ones. In this paper, we first study the feasibility of method-level offloading in network-intensive applications, using an open source Twitter client as an example. Our key observation is that implementing offloading transparently to the developer is difficult: various constraints heavily limit the offloading possibilities, and estimation of the potential benefit is challenging. We then propose a toolkit, SmartDiet , to assist mobile application developers in creating code which is suitable for energy-efficient offloading. SmartDiet provides finegrained offloading constraint identification and energy usage analysis for Android applications.

We describe the system architecture from sensor data acquisition to feature extraction, context inference and the publication of context information to well-known social networking services such as Twitter and Hi5. In the current prototype, context inference is based on decision trees, but the middleware allows the integration of other inference engines. Experimental results suggest that the proposed solution is a promising approach to provide user context to both local and network-level services.	bluetooth;data acquisition;decision tree;feature extraction;general-purpose markup language;inference engine;middleware;mobile device;prototype;real-time clock;sensor;sensor node;smartphone;social network;systems architecture;unobtrusive javascript	André C.

9931f54a95f5515f417a8c478ae37282da0c0f4c	personalised privacy in pervasive and ubiquitous systems	thesis	Our world is edging closer to the realisation of pervasive systems and their integration in our everyday life. While pervasive systems are capable of offering many benefits for everyone, the amount and quality of personal information that becomes available raise concerns about maintaining user privacy and create a real need to reform existing privacy practices and provide appropriate safeguards for the user of pervasive environments. This thesis presents the PERSOnalised Negotiation, Identity Selection and Management (PersoNISM) system; a comprehensive approach to privacy protection in pervasive environments using context aware dynamic personalisation and behaviour learning. The aim of the PersoNISM system is twofold: to provide the user with a comprehensive set of privacy protecting tools and to help them make the best use of these tools according to their privacy needs. The PersoNISM system allows users to: a) configure the terms and conditions of data disclosure through the process of privacy policy negotiation, which addresses the current “take it or leave it” approach; b) use multiple identities to interact with pervasive services to avoid the accumulation of vast amounts of personal information in a single user profile; and c) selectively disclose information based on the type of information, who requests it, under what context, for what purpose and how the information will be treated. The PersoNISM system learns user privacy preferences by monitoring the behaviour of the user and uses them to personalise and/or automate the decision making processes in order to unburden the user from manually controlling these complex mechanisms. The PersoNISM system has been designed, implemented, demonstrated and evaluated during three EU funded projects.	emoticon;our world;personalization;personally identifiable information;pervasive informatics;privacy policy;tree accumulation;ubiquitous computing;user profile	Elizabeth Papadopoulou	2015			context-aware pervasive systems;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-44.95185264699748	58.251149140332004	142964

We proposed a location-and orientation-based information support system using the compact battery-less information terminal (CoBIT). The CoBIT is a small, low cost communication terminal that uses only energy from the information carrier and the user. We realized an example of CoBIT, which downloads sound information and uploads users' positions and orientations along with signs from users. We emphasize the importance of focusing on event space as a first step toward realizing ubiquitous information support. We propose the use of CoBIT as a common terminal. Thereby, service embedded interactive map supported by various types of sensors and displays proposed to enhance benefits of the CoBIT.	cobit;embedded system;map;sensor;ubiquitous computing;upload	Takuichi Nishimura;Yoshiyuki Nakamura;Hideo Itoh;Hideyuki Nakashima	2004	24th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, 2004.

A principal goal for pervasive computing is to be able to have easy and secure access to services based on the context of the situation. Service discovery protocols are a key component in achieving this goal but the ability to successfully discover the appropriate services using service discovery is minimal. For many communication and collaborative sessions pushing of services to participants of the sessions is more effective.

9b4b0a56c9eef43b2cb3f55984009ea2e01fc15d	a collaborative internet of things architecture for smart cities and environmental monitoring		The collaborative Internet of Things (C-IoT) is an emerging paradigm that involves many communities with the idea of cooperating in data gathering and service sharing. Many fields of application, such as smart cities and environmental monitoring, use the concept of crowdsensing in order to produce the amount of data that such Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios need in order to be pervasive. In this paper we introduce an architecture, namely SenSquare, able to handle both the heterogeneous data sources coming from open IoT platform and crowdsensing campaigns, and display a unified access to users. We inspect all the facets of such a complex system, spanning over issues of different nature: we deal with heterogeneous data classification, mobile crowdsensing management for environmental data, information representation, and unification, IoT service composition and deployment. We detail our proposed solution in dealing with such tasks and present possible methods for meeting open challenges. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of SenSquare through both a mobile and a desktop client.	coexist (image);complex system;crowdsensing;data quality;data structure;desktop computer;file spanning;global variable;information sensitivity;internet of things;mobile app;natural language processing;personally identifiable information;programming paradigm;relational database;service composability principle;smart city;software deployment;unification (computer science);web application	Federico Montori;Luca Bedogni;Luciano Bononi	2018	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2017.2720855	computer network;distributed computing;complex system;environmental monitoring;data collection;data classification;software deployment;environmental data;architecture;computer science;mobile telephony	HCI	-42.4242978389056	48.65757827802927	143199
a50fbe66613e07eaa33cfb847c5ea254eabbbc98	adaptive threshold scheme for touchscreen gesture continuous authentication using sensor trust		In this study we produce a continuous authentication scheme for mobile devices that adjusts an adaptive threshold for touchscreen interactions based on trust in passively collected sensor data. Our framework unobtrusively compares real-time sensor data of a user to historic data and adjusts a trust parameter based on the similarity. We show that the trust parameter can be used to adjust an adaptive threshold in continuous authentication schemes. The framework passively models temporal, spatial and activity scenarios using sensor data such as location, surrounding devices, wi-fi networks, ambient noise, movements, user activity, ambient light, proximity to objects and atmospheric pressure from study participants. Deviations from the models increases the level of threat the device perceives from the scenario. We also model the user touchscreen interactions. The touchscreen interactions are authenticated against a threshold that is continually adjusted based on the perceived trust. This scheme provides greater nuance between security and usability, enabling more refined decisions. We present our novel framework and threshold adjustment criteria and validate our framework on two state-of-the-art sensor datasets. Our framework more than halves the false acceptance and false rejection rates of a static threshold system.	ambient occlusion;authentication;biometric device;biometrics;concept drift;interaction;mobile device;multi-touch;real-time clock;rejection sampling;secret sharing;sensor;touchscreen;usability	Max Smith-Creasey;Muttukrishnan Rajarajan	2017	2017 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS	10.1109/Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS.2017.284	computer network;computer security;ambient noise level;usability;computer science;global positioning system;touchscreen;mobile device;gesture;authentication	Mobile	-40.03975457199996	58.95148059005276	143367

Various technologies, such as Common Object Request Broker Architecture, Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, Java Message Service etc. are applied to realize Service-Oriented Architecture for different applications. Besides these approaches, two other techniques, REpresentational State Transfer, and web services are applied for the realization of Service-Oriented Architecture. Web services provide a platform independent communication scheme between applications. The security preservation among the composition of services is an important task for Service-Oriented Architecture. In this study, an attempt is made to incorporate security features in Service- Oriented Architecture with the help of software security patterns. This scheme is described by developing an architectural model integrated with security goals and security patterns. The structural and behavioral aspects of composition of web services incorporated with security features are presented using a Unified Modeling Language class diagram and a sequence diagram respectively. At the end of this study, an evaluation is performed between identified security patterns and critical security properties along with Service-Oriented Architecture design principles. A case study of an online banking system is considered to explain the use of security patterns.	application security;class diagram;common object request broker architecture;java message service;java platform, enterprise edition;online banking;representational state transfer;soap;sequence diagram;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;unified modeling language;web service	Ashish Kumar Dwivedi;Santanu Kumar Rath	2015	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/2693208.2693229	software security assurance;enterprise architecture framework;computer security model;web service;cloud computing security;web application security;reference architecture;space-based architecture;sherwood applied business security architecture;security information and event management;covert channel;computer science;applications architecture;software engineering;service-oriented architecture;human-computer interaction in information security;database;security service;distributed system security architecture;world wide web;computer security;enterprise information security architecture	SE	-46.78710498753695	54.01118272235155	143623

Federation performance is optimized using HLA Data Distribution Management (DDM) services and through a bypass of the normal HLA mechanisms for ownership transfer. Analysis of the running federation indicates that overhead due to federation processing is minimal - less than 6% of the total federation runtime (94% of the runtime is due to processing in the MANA simulations).	cellular automaton;overhead (computing);simulation	Emmet R.

Cider enhances the domestic operating system, Android, of a device with kernel-managed, per-thread personas to mimic the application binary interface of a foreign operating system, iOS, enabling it to run unmodified foreign binaries. This is accomplished using a novel combination of binary compatibility techniques including two new mechanisms: compile-time code adaptation, and diplomatic functions. Compile-time code adaptation enables existing unmodified foreign source code to be reused in the domestic kernel, reducing implementation effort required to support multiple binary interfaces for executing domestic and foreign applications. Diplomatic functions leverage per-thread personas, and allow foreign applications to use domestic libraries to access proprietary software and hardware interfaces. We have built a Cider prototype, and demonstrate that it imposes modest performance overhead and runs unmodified iOS and Android applications together on a Google Nexus tablet running the latest version of Android.	android;application binary interface;binary file;compile time;compiler;ecosystem;electrical connector;kernel (operating system);library (computing);machine code;operating system;overhead (computing);prototype;smartphone;tablet computer;ios	Jeremy Andrus;Alexander Van't Hof;Naser AlDuaij;Christoffer Dall;Nicolas Viennot;Jason Nieh	2014		10.1145/2541940.2541972	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;android	Arch	-34.83665877372253	52.49485221523801	144166

a9a1bf3e01f50c0a74062d8703eca2097fee3bcc	achieving targeted mobile advertisements while respecting privacy		Broadcasted mobile advertisements are increasingly being replaced by targeted mobile advertisements through consumer profiling. However privacy is a growing concern among consumers who may eventually prevent the advertising companies from profiling them. This paper proposes an agent-based targeting algorithm that is able to guarantee full consumer privacy while achieving mobile targeted advertising. We implemented a grocery discount-discovery application for iPhone that makes use of the new approach. We show that on modern hardware like on the iPhone, it’s feasible to run a client-based and privacy-preserving targeting algorithm with minimal additional computational overhead compared to a random advertising approach. We evaluated the targeting method by conducting a large-scale field-experiment with 903 participants. Results show that the computational overhead on user devices is well tolerated, compared to the control group with randomized advertising the targeting group showed a significantly increased application usage of 18%.	agent-based model;computation;computer user satisfaction;consumer privacy;digital distribution;mobile agent;overhead (computing);profiling (computer programming);randomized algorithm;randomness;tandy video information system	Elia Palme;Basil Hess;Juliana Sutanto	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-36632-1_14	engineering;marketing;advertising;internet privacy	Security	-40.722707783008715	59.726692000207834	144301

e78429fdee6aeae05f3711b42a80ce9f0c25f663	cloud-enabled web services for wireless sensor and actuator networks		Wireless sensors and actuators have limited resources and low bandwidth wireless communication ability while they are low-cost and energy-efficient. These devices can form ad hoc wireless networks and can be connected to the internet through the gateways. The resource constrained wireless devices cannot afford the general internet protocols so that they cannot be directly accessed through the internet. In this paper, we propose a cloud-enabled web services solution to address this issue. The functions of device are encapsulated into web services and submitted to the cloud; the client operates the device by invoking the web services; and the gateway converts messages between the device and the cloud. Using the standard web services architecture instead of customised SOA solutions and deploying services to the cloud instead of wireless nodes or gateways reduce the resource demand of nodes and gateways, simplify the wireless network design, and provide a uniform interface for using and managing devices.	web service	Shiyong Wang;Chunhua Zhang;Di Li	2018	IJAACS	10.1504/IJAACS.2018.10011792	computer network;the internet;wireless network;wireless sensor network;architecture;internet protocol;web service;cloud computing;distributed computing;default gateway;computer science	Mobile	-39.596233809601316	46.90613984871051	145064

However, since sensors are not placed under the control of one specific entity, it is difficult to retrieve appropriate information from the distributed sensors. In addition, when the same queries are sent by different users, same processes for collecting sensing data are repeated. The repetitive processing causes a load increase of sensors and network. In this paper, we propose a P2P-based architecture for managing distributed sensor information, which treats sensing data based on those semantic. The proposed architecture is constructed of three layers, 'raw layer', 'abstract layer' and 'logical layer', which enables to generate necessary information from retrieved data semantically. In addition, we propose a method to create virtual sensors by real peer. The virtual sensor manages processed data as a cache of real sensing data. We implemented the proposed architecture and method on PIAX, which is a development platform for agent-based P2P system. Then we evaluated the proposed virtual sensor placement method by simulations. By the simulation results, we confirmed that proposed method achieve a context-aware application with reducing the amount of network traffic.	agent-based model;cpu cache;information management;network traffic control;peer-to-peer;sensor;simulation;ubiquitous computing	Tomoya Kawakami;Bich Lam Ngoc Ly;Susumu Takeuchi;Yuuichi Teranishi;Kaname Harumoto;Shojiro Nishio	2008	2008 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet	10.1109/SAINT.2008.98	computer science;sensor;semantic web;peer-to-peer;database;distributed computing;sensor fusion;information management;world wide web;ubiquitous computing;data architecture;computer network	Mobile	-40.195610870569986	47.63140265836146	145232

In most cases, however, making the correct decision requires carefully comparing smart-client and Web-form technologies' application characteristics	.net framework;form (html);microsoft outlook for mac;multitier architecture;smart tv;smart client;software developer;thin client	Narayan Veeramani	2006	Computer	10.1109/MC.2006.278	smart client;web modeling;the internet;computer science;software development;operating system;database;user interface;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-34.888520667286286	50.34314862374906	145234

A brief survey of security issues found in various application domains is presented, based on a collection of over seventy papers in IEEE Xplore archived since 2011. Challenges and potential solutions to different kinds of hardware attacks and threats are discussed. Finally, specific hardware security challenges are connected and mapped to each application domain.	application domain;archive;ieee xplore;internet of things;threat (computer)	Kin Fun Li;Narges Attarmoghaddam	2018	2018 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2018.00136	application domain;field-programmable gate array;computer science;distributed computing;cryptography;hardware security module	EDA	-46.84588564605958	50.383986796062395	145408

We are surprised that no one has claimed that it will also help look after our kids-well, actually they have, just visit the App Store. Who would have thought that the power of an Internet-enabled laptop computer, mobile phone, iPod, Fitbit, bank card, and set of keys could be neatly packaged and strapped around your wrist. This begs the vital question: How will we change our behaviors based on the fact that we are walking around with a full-fledged computer that sits in contact with our bodies and communicates wirelessly with machines around us without our knowledge? Apparently, we're all going to look more athletic and stylish, be smarter and more accessible, and have a lot more convenience at our fingertips. But in actuality, we'll be reaching for the mute button, longing to be disconnected, and fed up with all the notifications interrupting us. That's when the novelty effect wears off.	activity tracker;app store;apple watch;digital signature;interrupt;laptop;mobile phone;mute;stylish;ipod	Katina Michael;M. G.

Many researchers attempted to achieve this work on volunteer grids where the corresponding computers are voluntary connected or disconnected. In fact, this kind of grids presents several advantages such as the possibility of the simultaneous utilization of the corresponding computers by different users or/and applications. The big challenge of such grids is how to guarantee to their users the trust and the required security. In this paper, we show how identity federation based on agent technology can be exploited to deal with this mentioned challenge.	computer data storage;federated identity;grid computing;volunteer computing	Maher Khemakhem;Abdelfettah Belghith	2009	2009 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications	10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069290	local area network;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;database;distributed computing;computer security;intelligent agent;computer network	HPC	-45.24127320208401	55.762052232704086	145631

The willingness and enthusiasm of service providers place abundant services at the disposal. But this abundance makes the efficiency of service discovery a critical issue. Centralized registries have severe drawbacks in such a scenario due to the dynamic and spontaneous nature of mobile peers. In the quest for a more appropriate approach for mobile web service discovery, we observed P2P to share very similar characteristics with behaviors of peers in mobile network. Hence we tried to find alternate mobile web service discovery mechanisms by using the features of the P2P networks like JXTA modules. The scalability analysis of the approach proves that the discovery can scale to the needs of large cellular networks.	categorization;centralized computing;jxta;mobile device;peer-to-peer;provisioning;scalability;service discovery;smartphone;spontaneous order;web service	Satish Narayana Srirama;Matthias Jarke;Hongyan Zhu;Wolfgang Prinz	2008	2008 Third International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services	10.1109/ICIW.2008.52	web service;cellular network;mobile search;mobile qos;mobile web;computer science;operating system;service discovery;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-37.674630290624144	51.84720621204219	145720

While space management has traditionally been done based on human observations, technology solutions are increasingly been considered. In this paper, we consider advanced sensing systems that provide location data at a certain spatio-temporal granularity. Location data analytics is then considered to realize two space management applications: (i) space utilization, and (ii) workspace recommendation. Towards this end, location data is processed to determine potential workspaces. The processed historic location data is used to compute defined metrics that characterize space utilization. Filtering of real-time location data is presented to recommend workspaces that may be potentially unoccupied and present to a user. Using datasets from an experimental office testbed, we evaluate the proposed sensing and analytics solution.	data as a service;image sensor;real-time clock;real-time data;requirement;space–time tradeoff;testbed;usage data;workspace	David Caicedo;Ashish Pandharipande	2017	2017 IEEE World Congress on Services (SERVICES)	10.1109/SERVICES.2017.10	database;computer science;workspace;data mining;granularity;testbed;analytics;data analysis	Embedded	-42.68358107603755	50.009470274865976	145721
83023dcc2e2330a1d10093a92a0fb1485fb231bb	distributed context-aware systems	design;distributed systems;experimentation;portable devices;measurement;performance	In this chapter we start with a motivation for distributed context-aware systems. This is mainly related to the growing need for people to efficiently communicate with each other independently of specific tasks and location. Current widely used tools such as instant messaging and e-mail lack several characteristics of face-to-face communication often found on colocated teams. A promising approach is context-aware applications; these are able to adapt their operations to current context without explicit user intervention. Such applications raise the issue of context propagation which clearly poses several challenges regarding scalability and privacy. In this chapter we clarify such challenges and conclude by emphasizing the distinctive features of the survey in this book: basically, we describe the possible options that an application developer has to consider regarding distributed contextaware applications, instead of just enumerating the requirements. 1.1 Distributed Context-Aware Systems Efficient communication and coordination among geographically dispersed teams is mostly done using traditional mechanisms such as instant messaging and email. However, these are not enough to accomplish such communication and coordination efficiently. No one denies that these mechanisms and other forms of direct communication1 have seen a tremendous evolution in the last years and are now essential for modern team collaboration; however, they still lack several characteristics of face-to-face communication often found on colocated teams. For example, it ought to be possible, for every team member, to become aware of what is going on: who belongs to the team, who is online, who is working on what, who is responsible for what, etc. [44]. This can be accomplished using direct 1Communication which is explicitly initiated by someone and whose recipient is known, be it an individual or a group. P. Ferreira and P.

For establishing the trust in the cloud, we propose the Trusted Service Domain (TSD), as a novel root of trust for the cloud. Being an independent functional domain, the TSD is able to provide the trusted service for the multiple user domains on the cloud virtualization platform. We firstly extend the existing trusted chain to secure the TSD, and generate the independent key hierarchies for the user domains in the TSD to support the cryptography service and secure storage. Then we design the secure communication mechanism to protect the inter-domain data, and present the migration scheme for the TSD in the cloud. Finally, we detailed our implementation of the prototype system and analyze the security of the TSD. Preliminary experiment results showed that the TSD has higher efficiency than the existing schemes on the trusted commands handling and the migration, which satisfied flexible deployment and rapidly migration requirements of the cloud virtualization platform.	chain of trust;cloud computing;cryptography;inter-domain;one-to-one (data model);overhead (computing);prototype;requirement;scalability;secure communication;software deployment;tsd;tag cloud;trust (emotion);trust anchor;trusted computing;trusted platform module;user interface;x86 virtualization	Dexian Chang;XiaoBo Chu;Yu Qin;Dengguo Feng	2012	2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2012.287	embedded system;direct anonymous attestation;cloud computing;engineering;computer security;computer network	Security	-47.05996638946221	56.178372669440826	145946

Different from existing works that heavily rely on intrusive sensing or full cooperation from probe vehicles, our system exploits the power of participatory sensing and crowdsources the traffic sensing tasks to bus riders’ mobile phones. The bus riders are information source providers and, meanwhile, major consumers of the final traffic output. The system takes public buses as dummy probes to detect road traffic conditions, and collects the minimum set of cellular data together with some lightweight sensing hints from the bus riders’ mobile phones. Based on the crowdsourced data from participants, the system recovers the bus travel information and further derives the instant traffic conditions of roads covered by bus routes. The real-world experiments with a prototype implementation demonstrate the feasibility of our system, which achieves accurate and fine-grained traffic estimation with modest sensing and computation overhead at the crowd.	computation;crowdsourcing;dummy variable (statistics);experiment;information source;mobile phone;overhead (computing);participatory monitoring;participatory sensing;prototype	Zhidan Liu;Shiqi Jiang;Pengfei Zhou;Mo Li	2017	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2017.2650215	embedded system;computer science;engineering;transport engineering;computer security	Mobile	-42.03098916853072	51.96331836935069	146061

Traditionally, networks and systems are manually managed. It usually takes one or more human operators to manage all aspects of a dynamically evolving computing and communicating system. The operator is tightly integrated in this management process, and his tasks range from defining high-level policies to executing low-level system commands for immediate problem solving. Although this form of human-in-the-loop management was appropriate in the past, it has become increasingly unsuitable for modern networked computing systems and telecommunication. The potential advantage that autonomic computing brings is reducing the cost and complexity of managing Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure(ICT). The objectives of this paper are to underline the characteristics of autonomic architectures and present an outline of our autonomic management architecture based on OGSA (Open Grid Services Architecture) and Peer-to-Peer model. The autonomic management architectures of CISCO and IBM are briefly described and compared with our autonomic management architecture.	autonomic computing;client–server model;high- and low-level;network switch;open grid services architecture;peer-to-peer;problem solving;prospective search;scalability;self-organization;server (computing);unification (computer science);web application	Anasser Ag Rhissa;Adil Hassnaoui	2005		10.1007/978-0-387-49690-0_16	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;services computing;grid computing;computer network;autonomic computing	DB	-33.90055024725641	47.430602057381854	146129

However, technologies from different providers lack both technical and semantic interoperability and hence the resulting health data is often deeply tied to specific service, which is limiting its re-usability and utilization in different services. We have designed a Wellness Warehouse Engine (W2E) that bridges this gap and enables seamless exchange of data between different services. W2E provides interfaces to various data sources and makes data available via unified REST API to other services. Importantly, it includes Unifier - an engine that allows transforming input data into generic units reusable by other services, and Analyzer - an engine that allows advanced analysis of input data, such as combining different data sources into new output parameters. In this paper, we describe the architecture of W2E and demonstrate its applicability by using it for uniting data from several consumer activity trackers. Finally, we discuss challenges of building Unifier and Analyzer engines for ever-enlarging number of new devices.	activity tracker;admissible rule;algorithm;application programming interface;internet;seamless3d;semantic interoperability;sensor;unification (computer science);usability;user interface	Mika Saaranen;Jakub Parák;Harri Honko;Timo Aaltonen;Ilkka Korhonen	2014	IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)	10.1109/BHI.2014.6864375	semantic interoperability;engineering;data mining;database;world wide web	HCI	-42.444118711554594	46.99098672392113	146219
3e34fda00a89303a0f7d1c312665f38b83bf6de6	coordinating analytics methods for mobile healthcare applications		Mobile healthcare applications enjoy increasing popularity and provide significant benefits to users who can take advantage of the general availability and the increasing set of sensors in mobile devices. Healthcare analytics services developed for a variety of conditions to provide insights and guidance to patients can augment the mobile applications with computationally intensive analysis at the server-side environment. Creating applications that are supported by analytics is challenging for different reasons: We must deal with the limited information to get relevant recommendations, or not enough to provide appropriate predictions (patients trajectory to reach goal such as weight loss). Moreover building an analytical model in the health domain brings its own challenges such as data ingestion, data curation, and service levels, etc. This paper proposes a software architecture framework that eases the support of analytics in the mobile health applications. The paper also discusses the various components that make up the framework by taking one analytical model as a use case.		Pawan Chowdhary;Sunhwan Lee;John T. E. Timm;Heiko Ludwig;Sarah E.

Currently personal data potentiality is not fully exploited due to “organization-centric” approaches in the management of personal data. This paper presents a “user-centric” model, which aims at unlocking such potentiality, by enabling individuals to control the gathering, management, use and sharing of data about them. In particular, the paper analyses a new personal data ecosystem centered around the role of “Bank of Individuals' Data” (BID), a provider of “personal data management services” enabling people to exploit their personal data. We call this role Bank as it manages data as commercial banks manage money. Finally, it discusses challenges and opportunities for Telcos to become a BID.	binary integer decimal;ecosystem;personal information management;personally identifiable information	Corrado Moiso;Roberto Minerva	2012	2012 16th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks	10.1109/ICIN.2012.6376027	personal information management;data mining;business;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-43.84278715699038	60.40312122996671	146449

Through, the connection of many different devices there are outstanding benefits such as an increasing automation and intelligent energy management. Nevertheless, the integration of legacy devices into the Internet of Things is a significant issue. Legacy meters, e.g., cannot provide metering data automatically and the installation of modern smart meters is cost-intensive and thus often unprofitable. An alternative approach is to extend legacy meters with an automatic meter reading system. Thus, they can be integrated into an intelligent system such as an efficient energy management. In this paper a robust and universal approach for automatic meter reading is proposed. The approach can be applied to water, gas, and electric meters and uses a Web service as standardized and open communication interface.

In this paper, we propose in-network software defined processing (ISDP) which can leverage these capabilities by allowing dynamic reconfiguration of the network topology. It is advantageous for the network to possess reliable and complete end-to-end network connectivity; however, even when the network is not fully connected, the system may act as conduits of information - either by connectivity gaps, or by distributing information from the network space. ISDP within the IoT that gradually refine the captured information while moving upstream to the application. The roles assigned to IoT nodes that can take advantage of the presence of side processing capabilities like system-on-chip (SoC) (GPUs, CPUs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) (DSPs). Such IoT devices have the inherent capability to offload computations to side processing elements and, thus, increase the efficiency of the involved complex tasks. Consequently, despite the advantages provided by the hardware implementations, dynamic reconfigurations of FPGA to perform other tasks on run time to increase further the value of the proposed framework for the information fusion in IoT.

Mobile phones with excellent computing power and added features especially with huge storage capacities are very common in the market. As the storage capacity grows on such a device, it becomes very tedious for users to manage and organize different type of files. The file system of such devices itself provide some managing mechanism to store same type of files separately however it proves scarce as the number of files grows. Furthermore, limited user interface on these devices makes file retrieval more difficult. This paper presents detailed analysis of meta-data significance in our proposed framework to annotate and search files on low-end mobile devices. File attributes are extracted from the underlying operating system of the device and used as metadata of the corresponding file. The meta-data is then used for searching the required file. The file search can be performed on the device itself or on other devices when connected in a Personal Area Network (PAN) through Bluetooth. The proposed framework is implemented in Java Micro Edition and a full featured application is developed to demonstrate its validity. The application provides annotation, search options, Bluetooth module, file sharing and transfer options. Results from various performance tests show significant improvement in searching a required file through our proposed framework.	bluetooth;file sharing;java platform, micro edition;mobile device;mobile phone;operating system;user interface	Sadaqat Jan;Maozhen Li;Ghaidaa Al-Sultany;Hamed S.

Over the last few years, several nations around the world have set up Grids to share resources such as computers, data, and instruments to enable collaborative science, engineering, and business applications. These Grids follow a restricted organisational model wherein a Virtual Organisation (VO) is created for a specific collaboration and all interactions such as resource sharing are limited to within the VO. Therefore, dispersed Grid initiatives have led to the creation of disparate Grids with little or no interaction between them. In this paper, we propose a model that: (a) promotes interlinking of islands of Grids through peering arrangements to enable inter-Grid resource sharing; (b) provides a scalable structure for Grids that allow them to interconnect with one another and grow in a sustainable way; (c) creates a global Cyberinfrastructure to support e-Science and eBusiness applications. This work identifies and proposes architecture, mechanisms and policies that allow the internetworking of Grids and allows Grids to grow in a similar manner as the Internet. We term the structure resulting from such internetworking between Grids as the InterGrid. The proposed InterGrid architecture is composed of InterGrid Gateways responsible for managing peering arrangements between Grids. We discuss the main components of the architecture and present a research agenda to enable the InterGrid vision.	computer;cyberinfrastructure;e-science;emoticon;gateway (telecommunications);interaction;internet;internetworking;peering;scalability;virtual organization	Marcos Dias de Assunção;Rajkumar Buyya;Srikumar Venugopal	2008	Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience	10.1002/cpe.1249	shared resource;computer science;peering;knowledge management;resource management;operating system;database;distributed computing;world wide web;grid computing	HPC	-33.79776542309396	55.60181002485062	147656

The term IoV is used in this paper for Internet of Vehicles. IoV is conceptualized for sharing traffic, safety and several other vehicle-related information between vehicles and end user. In recent years, the number of connected vehicles has increased allover the world. Having information sharing and connectivity as its advantage, IoV also faces the challenging task in the cybersecurity-related matters. The future consists of crowded places in an interconnected world through wearable's, sensors, smart phones etc. We are converging towards IoV technology and interactions with crowded space of connected peoples. However, this convergence demands high-security mechanism from the connected crowd as-well-as other connected vehicles to safeguard of proposed IoV system. In this paper, we coin the term of smart people crowd (SPC) and the smart vehicular crowd (SVC) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). These specific crowds of SPC and SVC are the potential cyber attackers of the smart IoV. People connected to the internet in the crowded place are known as a smart crowd. They have interfacing devices with sensors and the environment. A smart crowd would also consist of the random number of smart vehicles. With the future converging in to the smart connected framework for crowds, vehicles and connected vehicles, we present a novel cyber-physical surveillance system (CPSS) framework to tackle the security threats in the crowded environment for the smart automotive industry and provide the cyber security mechanism in the crowded places. We also describe an overview of use cases and their security challenges on the Internet of Vehicles.	computer security;interaction;interconnectedness;internet;mathematical model;mutual information;protologism;random number generation;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor;simulation;smartphone;traffic exchange;wearable computer	Dhananjay Singh;Gaurav Tripathi;Sayed Chhattan Shah;Rodrigo da Rosa Righi	2018	2018 IEEE 4th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)	10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355218	wearable computer;computer security;computer science;cyber-physical system;crowds;information sharing;the internet;cloud computing;automotive industry;intelligent transportation system	AI	-45.11500618974089	50.75201704577957	147822

4e84ebc3aec9195a03223002da9602e82353f70d	sensorhub: an iot driver framework for supporting sensor networks and data analysis		The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the surrounding everyday physical objects into an ecosystem of information that enriches our everyday life. The IoT represents the convergence of advances in miniaturization, wireless connectivity, and increased data storage and is driven by various sensors. Sensors detect and measure changes in position, temperature, light, and many others; furthermore, they are necessary to turn billions of objects into data-generating “things” that can report on their status and often interact with their environment. Application and service development methods and frameworks are required to support the realization of solutions covering data collection, transmission, data processing, analysis, reporting, and advanced querying. This paper introduces the SensorHUB framework that utilizes the state-of-the-art open source technologies and provides a unified tool chain for IoT related application and service development. SensorHUB is both a method and an environment to support IoT related application and service development; furthermore, it supports the data monetization approach, that is, provides a method to define data views on top of different data sources and analyzed data.The framework is available in a Platform as a Service (PaaS) model and has been applied for the vehicle, health, production lines, and smart city domains.	algorithm;big data;compiler;computer data storage;data security;data visualization;ecosystem;industry 4.0;internet of things;monetization;network traffic control;open-source software;platform as a service;privacy;requirement;sensor;server (computing);server-side;smart city;software development;toolchain;wireless router	László Lengyel;Péter Ekler;Tamas Ujj;Tamas Balogh;Hassan Charaf	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/454379	embedded system;data mining;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-42.563757559888344	49.09865359742156	147938

This is because the overall security of such systems depends on the security of the individual services they deploy and, hence, it is difficult to assess especially in cases where the latter services must be discovered and composed dynamically. This paper presents a novel approach for discovering secure compositions of software services. This approach is based on secure service orchestration patterns, which have been proven to provide certain security properties and can, therefore, be used to generate service compositions that are guaranteed to satisfy these properties by construction. The paper lays the foundations of the secure service orchestration patterns, and presents an algorithm that uses the patterns to generate secure service compositions and a tool realising our entire approach.

Increased number of people does not have a single work place, they are often using a variety of even remote equipment while requiring seemingly permanent contact among themselves and with corporate headquarters. This trend can be easily seen also at universities, where information, computational and other services are to be available for people moving literally around the globe. Increased number of people is being equipped with mobile devices, ranging from small personal ”wearable” devices like mobile phones and PDAs (personal digital assistants like Palm or recent iPAQ from Compaq) to more powerful systems like notebooks. All these devices can be in some way connected to other and increasing number of them provide ways to be connected directly to Internet, using some wireless connection system (infrared, GSM or similar cellular telephone systems, wireless network protocols like IEEE 802.11b etc.). When using such devices, people expect to be given the same range of applications regardless of actual place of use-they expect support for applications mobility.	asynchronous i/o;authentication;authorization;communication complexity;communications protocol;course (navigation);database;email;file sharing;graphical user interface;grid computing;ipaq;interaction;internet;laptop;mobile computing;mobile device;mobile phone;online and offline;palm os;personal digital assistant;point of view (computer hardware company);real-time transcription;real-time web;scientific visualization;server (computing);server-side;streaming media;warez;wearable computer	Ludek Matyska;Eva Hladká	2001			radio access network;mobile search;mobile web;computer science;theoretical computer science;mobile technology;distributed computing;mobile computing;mobile communications over ip;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Mobile	-38.584476753806754	54.45784537741963	148256
8ee90974fe60f1bc51ac7d8c41d009a7b486eda5	an evaluation of sentiment analysis for mobile devices	sentiment analysis;performance evaluation;mobile;android	Sentiment analysis has become a key tool to extract knowledge from data containing opinions and sentiments, particularly, data from online social systems. With the increasing use of smartphones to access social media platforms, a new wave of applications that explore sentiment analysis in the mobile environment is beginning to emerge. However, there are various existing sentiment analysis methods and it is unclear which of them are deployable in the mobile environment. In this paper, we provide the first of a kind study in which we compare the performance of 14 sentence-level sentiment analysis methods in the mobile environment. To do that, we adapted these methods to run on Android OS and then, we measure their performance in terms of memory, CPU, and battery consumption. Our findings unveil methods that require almost no adaptations and run relatively fast as well as methods that could not be deployed due to excessive use of memory. We hope our effort provides a guide to developers and researchers interested in exploring sentiment analysis as part of a mobile application and can help new applications to be executed without the dependency of a server-side API. We also share the Android API that implements all the 14 sentiment analysis methods used in this paper.	android;application programming interface;central processing unit;mobile app;mobile device;operating system;sentiment analysis;server (computing);server-side;smartphone;social media;social system	Johnnatan Messias;João Paulo Diniz;Elias Soares;Miller Ferreira;Matheus Araújo;Lucas Bastos;Manoel Miranda;Fabrício Benevenuto	2017	Social Network Analysis and Mining	10.1007/s13278-017-0437-2	android (operating system);sentiment analysis;data mining;internet privacy;computer science;social media;mobile device	Web+IR	-36.10605983969473	55.80120061547996	148612

Digital identity management functionalities are increasingly delivered as sets of services, rather than monolithic applications. So, an identity layer in which identity and privacy management are interoperable could be more realistic and an acceptable situation in the context of distributed environments. Such interoperability could be offered through the design of a set of loosely coupled, publicly hosted and available to on-demand calls services and the implementation on open standards basis. The aim of the article is to disassemble digital identity-related privacy requirements that are drawn from global, domestic and business-specific privacy policies into a set of eight readyto-use, granular and loosely coupled services that could accommodate a serviceoriented architecture (SOA).

ad8e242babd500a53b28c0a3cdd78e59d9b66903	efficient multisensor localization for the internet of things: exploring a new class of scalable localization algorithms		In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), efficient localization is essential for emerging mass-market services and applications. IoT devices are heterogeneous in signaling, sensing, and mobility, and their resources for computation and communication are typically limited. Therefore, to enable location awareness in large-scale IoT networks, there is a need for efficient, scalable, and distributed multisensor fusion algorithms. This article presents a framework for designing network localization and navigation (NLN) for the IoT. Multisensor localization and operation algorithms developed within NLN can exploit spatiotemporal cooperation, are suitable for arbitrary, largenetwork sizes, and only rely on an information exchange among neighboring devices. The advantages of NLN are evaluated in a large-scale IoT network with 500 agents. In particular, because of multisensor fusion and cooperation, the presented network localization and operation algorithms can provide attractive localization performance and reduce communication overhead and energy consumption.	algorithm;computation;information exchange;internet of things;location awareness;overhead (computing);scalability	Moe Z.

Since young people are not capable of sustaining an adequate healthcare for elderly people, new healthcare fields have to be devised. Recent advances in information and communication technology enable the support of elderly people in their domestic environment. The EU project RADIO will design of an old age compliant smart home environment which specializes in fulfilling the needs of elderly people. This is partially achieved through a mobile robot platform which serves as an assistant to the respective elderly person. Apart from this, the robot also functions as a mobile sensor platform. Under this context, unobtrusiveness is of paramount importance since the robot should be a natural participant of patients' daily life. This paper discusses such a healthcare facility, analyses its requirements and poses the challenges towards this direction.	algorithm;cognition;field-programmable gate array;home automation;mobile robot;requirement;the verge	Fynn Schwiegelshohn;Philipp Wehner;Jens Rettkowski;Diana Göhringer;Michael Hübner;Georgios Keramidas;Christos P.

The very nature of the context in which service-oriented computing thrives imposes unique security requirements. Large scale interconnection of systems and services, rapidly changing service compositions and ad-hoc composition and invocation of services require a flexible security model that is able to adapt to these changes.

Access control for SaaS should enable the tenant to control access to data that are located at the provider side, based on tenant-specific access control policies. Moreover, with the growing adoption of SaaS by large enterprises, access control for SaaS has to integrate with on-premise applications, inherently leading to a federated set-up. However, in the state of the art, the provider completely evaluates all policies, including the tenant policies. This (i) forces the tenant to disclose sensitive access control data and (ii) limits policy evaluation performance by having to fetch this policy-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose to decompose the tenant policies and evaluate the resulting parts near the data they require as much as possible while keeping sensitive tenant data local to the tenant environment. We call this concept policy federation. In this paper, we motivate the need for policy federation using an in-depth case study analysis in the domain of e-health and present a policy federation algorithm based on a widely-applicable attribute-based policy model. Furthermore, we show the impact of policy federation on policy evaluation time using the policies from the case study and a prototype implementation of supporting middleware. As shown, policy federation effectively succeeds in keeping the sensitive tenant data confidential and at the same time improves policy evaluation time in most cases.	access control;algorithm;cloud computing;confidentiality;middleware;on-premises software;prototype;software as a service;web application	Maarten Decat;Bert Lagaisse;Wouter Joosen	2013	Journal of Internet Services and Applications	10.1186/1869-0238-5-1	performance;computer science;information security;access control;operating system;software as a service;database;computer applications;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-47.24569142937521	58.56995390183338	149702

This evolution of distributed computing and applications has put new challenges on models, architectures and systems. In essence, we should look for paradigms that help us reconcile uncertainty with predictability. Grand challenges require drastic changes, and they are happening: in the hybrid, dynamic and decentralised way we start looking at system design, once quite homogeneous, static, centralised, and in the cross-fertilising way we now look at previously disjoint scientific fields. Two issues are central to modern design of dependable and secure dynamic distributed systems: the confluence between classical dependability and security, met essentially but not only by the concept of common ’accidental fault and malicious intrusion tolerance’. and the necessary but often forgotten link between trust (dependence or belief on some system’s properties) and trustworthiness (the merit of that system to be trusted, the degree to which it meets those properties, or its dependability). The uncertainty described above, together with the vast amount of exposure to wrong-doing endured by current systems, forms an explosive combination. In order to handle it and obtain assurance on the correct operation of systems, all efforts are not too much. The tolerance perspective on security, currently termed intrusion tolerance, shed new light on a road darkened by the growing difficulty of preventing every intrusion on large and complex and uncertain installations. The combination of fault and intrusion tolerance closes the final gap, by allowing the design of systems that become simultaneously secure and dependable through the same class of mechanisms. This is not enough though, we need system design principles that ensure a global and accurate view of the relation between trust and trustworthiness. This goes well beyond technological factors: if an ICT-based society will not be able to provide trustable services, services that are trusted because justifiably they rely on trustworthy components and infrastructure, then, such services, which will nevertheless be deployed due to market pressure: will be perceived with suspicion by users; will be managed by a restricted group of """"experts"""", increasing info-exclusion; may very well be mismanaged, yielding cyber-crime, e-frauds, cyber terrorism and sabotage."""	access network;centralisation;confluence;cybercrime;cyberterrorism;dependability;distributed computing;grand challenges;instability;intrusion tolerance;systems design;the verge;trust (emotion);trustworthy computing	Paulo Veríssimo	2006	26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW'06)	10.1109/ICDCSW.2006.108	information and communications technology;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;information security;operating system;database;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Embedded	-45.89207325125271	57.57842378996816	149746

In our opinion such an agile framework is needed for two main reasons. At first the cycle of introducing new services in the telecommunication industry usually takes several months, while the general cycles in the Web domain are much faster. Besides, customers want to use a flexible amount of services from different kinds of sources (e.g. Google, Facebook). The proposed agile service environment is intended to interact with services of the traditional telecommunication industry and is enabling the third party development process to support services coming from all kind of domains. Service platforms for Next Generation Networks adapting the principles of Service Oriented Architectures and the initial steps in the standardization towards service delivery frameworks are done. Special requirements that have to be considered are aspects of service life-cycle management and service composition that are critical regarding high performing real-time communication processes as needed in a telecommunications environment. Beyond the requirements of dynamic service deployment, management, evolution and service termination there is the intention of a well performing agile service composition mechanism. In order to fulfill the discussed requirements some related work in this area is presented and the promising IT / Network standards are enlightened. Furthermore, the architectural design of the developed framework is presented. Finally the paper demonstrates a practical use case scenario that shows the dynamic integration and combination of telecommunication services with services of the Web domain.	agile software development;business process execution language;cloud computing;computer cluster;fits;itil;identity management system;library (computing);microsoft outlook for mac;next-generation network;oma;osgi;prototype;real-time transcription;requirement;service composability principle;service-oriented architecture;software deployment;upload;user profile;world wide web	Lajos Lange;Alexander Blotny;Thomas Magedanz	2011	2011 4th IFIP International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security	10.1109/NTMS.2011.5720648	service provider;service level requirement;service level objective;mobile qos;next-generation network;service product management;telecommunications;differentiated service;computer science;service delivery framework;service design;service guarantee;computer network;service system	HPC	-36.74900351216968	49.32449500535605	149809

Current works consider wireless sensor networks are focusing on specific application. But for such applications, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) cannot operate as stand-alone networks; there must be an effective way for user to gain access to the data produced by the wireless sensor networks. At the same time, it is envisioned that WSN would be pervasive and ubiquitous. It makes a lot of sense to integrate WSNs with Internet. Some crucial issues are discussed in the article. In the paper, a service-oriented model with application agent, resource manager, register agent, and multi-gateway is designed, and its components have been illustrated. With our architecture, it can put the required data as close as possible to the users and filter data as close as the source. From the simulation results about load balancing and delay time, we can get that it performs well in flexible and reliable for different applications and can easily connect with different protocols used for WSNs.	computation;computer simulation;database;internet;load balancing (computing);pervasive informatics;proxy server;sensor;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented modeling;simulation;software deployment;systems architecture	Jinglun Shi;Weiping Liu	2005	The Fifth International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT'05)	10.1109/CIT.2005.49	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Mobile	-39.35976553561076	47.41950870645098	149873

Our model offers traditional component services like naming, activation, event notifications, and persistence on top of a structured peer-to-peer overlay. We benefit from the peer-to-peer substrate to implement these services in a decentralized and efficient way. The innovative contributions of our approach are a lightweight distributed container model, an adaptive component activation mechanism, which takes into account network locality, and a decentralized component location and deployment service. We focus on how the services provided by p2pCM can be used to implement essential computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) services, like shared session management, awareness and coordination policies, and show a sample application which uses them. We believe that all of the features our component-oriented model provides can be very promising for the development of future wide-area distributed CSCW applications.	computer-supported cooperative work;locality of reference;peer-to-peer;persistence (computer science);session (computer science);software deployment	Carles Pairot;Pedro García López;Rubén Mondéjar;Antonio F.

Presents a practical method that can be employed in an enterprise environment to manage security policies using eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Based on ORBAC security policy expressed in XML, a role assignment algorithm is presented.

Users moving outside the office should be able to maintain an office-like environment at their current locations. First, the agents within our proposed architecture negotiate the different communication and interaction factors autonomously and dynamically. Moreover, we needed to develop a user agent in addition to service and system agents that could negotiate the requirements and capabilities at run time to furnish best possible service results. Thus we designed and integrated a video indexing and key framing service within our overall agent-based architecture. We integrated this video indexing and content-based analysis service to adapt the video content according to run time conditions. We designed a video XML schema to validate the media content out of this multimedia service according to specific requirements and features, as we will describe later.	agent-based model;block cipher mode of operation;digital video;distributed computing;framing (world wide web);mobile agent;mobile computing;online and offline;personalization;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);software agent;speech recognition;tom;user agent;user profile;web service;xml schema	Mohamed Ahmed;Hamid Harroud;Roger Impey;Ahmed Karmouch	2007	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-007-0113-z	user agent;xml;computer science;xml schema;database;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-37.23544691553214	49.657437659491556	150546

In this approach, individual discovery protocols, access models and authentication mechanisms are represented as software components called handlers. Handlers are registered with and coordinated by a software framework called a discovery agent. Configured with a battery of handlers, a discovery agent answers query and advertisement requests on behalf of mobile and other applications and applies authentication and access control policies. Based on its set of handlers, a diversity of request types and formats can be routed, translated, and fulfilled by a discovery agent. Discovery agents can easily be reconfigured, adapted, and extended as new underlying discovery protocols or client request types must be supported. A discovery agent can operate as a Web service, and can be deployed by an enterprise to service discovery requests on behalf of visiting clients. A discovery agent can also operate as a trusted co-module running on a device, and is useful for supporting mobile applications which move among environments and must accommodate a diversity of local discovery protocols.	access control;application programming interface;authentication;client (computing);component-based software engineering;computation;computational resource;hoc (programming language);mobile app;pervasive informatics;result set;routing;service discovery;software framework;text simplification;unreachable memory;web service;jini	Stefan Berger;Scott McFaddin;Carl Binding;Christian Hörtnagl;Anand Ranganathan	2004	IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management, 2004.

These profiles can then be used to perform practices such as price discrimination, poor judgment, etc. The use of pseudonyms and, specially, changing pseudonyms from time to time are known to minimize profiling. Although there are some agent frameworks and platforms that support pseudonym change, there are few proposals that suggest or directly change the pseudonym in an automatic fashion. Instead, users are usually provided with the mechanisms to change pseudonyms but without any mechanism that aids them to decide when to change their pseudonyms. We present in this paper an approach to pseudonym change based on human privacy attitudes.	agent-based model;e-commerce;profiling (computer programming);pseudonymity	Jose M.

An online automatic unattended disaster monitoring system can prevent and reduce the geology disaster to protect the safety of life and property. At present, most GSN are independent and usually service for respective community. The observations data of GSN are bigger and complex , and GSN is mostly heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. So this paper proposes a novel GSN disaster monitoring overall architecture, This architecture can seamlessly integrate sensors for long- term, remote, and near-real-time monitoring. In the architecture, there are four layers are used to collect, manage , transport and processing observation data. Among them, the data server layer applies the OGC SWE standards to integrate and share heterogeneous monitoring data. sensor metadata and observation data are packaged into a virtual sensor that are is transported from data center to application layer through Sensor Observation Service (SOS). To demonstrates the applicability of our proposed method, we use a case named PS-MDMs which are developed and deployed to support mine disaster monitoring and modeling research.	network architecture	Jianmin Wang;Xiaoqin Yang	2018	iJOE		engineering;computer network;application layer;wireless sensor network;network architecture;architecture;metadata;sensor observation service;sensor web;data center	ML	-41.53784505523869	47.39594102243073	151098

Combined with explicit risk analysis, this enables unobtrusive information exchange, while limiting access to confidential information. This is illustrated with applications such as personal address books and electronic diaries. Recommendations associate categories with data and with each other with degrees of trust belief and disbelief. Since categories also in turn confer privileges and restrict actions, they are analogous to roles in a role-based access control system, while principals represent their trust policies in recommendations. Participants first compute their trust in information, by combining their own trust assumptions with others' policies. Actions are then moderated by a risk assessment, which weighs up costs and benefits, including the cost of the user's time, before deciding whether to allow or forbid the information exchange, or ask for help. By unifying trust assessments and access control, participants can take calculated risks to automatically yet safely share their personal information.	book;computer;confidentiality;control system;information exchange;mobile device;personally identifiable information;recommender system;risk assessment;role-based access control;ws-trust	Brian Shand;Nathan Dimmock;Jean Bacon	2003	Proceedings of the First IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, 2003.

dc955358c47b3cf54f914df7e8e9e7e363c852a4	adapting heterogeneous devices into an iot context-aware infrastructure		The Internet of Things will expose services enabling developers to easily explore data generated by an enormous number of devices. These devices, such as industrial sensors and actuators, and house appliances can have different interfaces, interaction protocols, and payload data semantics. Manual, ad hoc, integration of these different devices would become infeasible. This paper presents an approach to dynamically integrate devices into an IoT context-aware infrastructure, which includes a well-defined architecture and a reflective description model. This infrastructure, named ContQuest, also offers a set of middleware services for context-aware applications, which rely on the reflective data to provide adaptation capabilities. In ContQuest, a device is considered a resource and is represented by Resource Agent. Each Resource Agent is structured following an architecture that aims to ease the integration and deployment of heterogeneous devices, including design solutions to adapt devices that can have different communication protocols. The approach is demonstrated using examples: (i) a wireless sensor network and (ii) a RFID reader.

However most MSN applications regard mobile terminals just as entry points to existing social networks, in which centralized servers (for storage and processing of all application/context data) and continual Internet connectivity are prerequisites for mobile users to exploit MSN services, even though they are within proximity area (like campus, event spot, and community, etc.), and can directly exchange data through various wireless technologies (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi Direct, etc.). In this paper, we focus on mobile social networking in proximity (MSNP), which is explicitly defined in our paper as: MSNP is wireless peer-to-peer (P2P) network of spontaneously and opportunistically connected nodes, and uses geo-proximity as the primary filter in determining who is discoverable on the social network. In this paper, first, primary support approaches related to MSNP available in literature, are summarized and compared, including MSN, mobile P2P and opportunistic networks. And then, we offer the special characteristics of MSNP, open issues and potential solutions. A networking technologies and platform independent architecture is proposed for developing MSNP applications, and proof-of-concept implementation of WiFi direct based MSNP application is also provided. Our primary goal is to identify the characteristics, technical challenges and potential solutions for future MSNP applications, capable to flexibly adapt to different application domains and deployment requirements.	mobile social network	Yufeng Wang;Athanasios V.

Many research groups have focused on optimizing the hardware of mobile devices, as well as their middleware and applications, increasing both the devices' uptime and their users' satisfaction. However, only scarce work has analyzed whether users notice and care about energy-efficiency problems in mobile applications. Thus, in this paper, we address these questions by evaluating a large set of user comments extracted from the Google Play market place for Android applications.

45f7ef0173bfe6ae1ca3109041acdcf21f4ad124	context- and template-based compression for efficient management of data models in resource-constrained systems	wireless sensor networks (wsn);ad hoc networks;compression;cyber physical systems;data models;resource-constrained devices	The Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) paradigm is based on the deployment of interconnected heterogeneous devices and systems, so interoperability is at the heart of any CPS architecture design. In this sense, the adoption of standard and generic data formats for data representation and communication, e.g., XML or JSON, effectively addresses the interoperability problem among heterogeneous systems. Nevertheless, the verbosity of those standard data formats usually demands system resources that might suppose an overload for the resource-constrained devices that are typically deployed in CPS. In this work we present Context- and Template-based Compression (CTC), a data compression approach targeted to resource-constrained devices, which allows reducing the resources needed to transmit, store and process data models. Additionally, we provide a benchmark evaluation and comparison with current implementations of the Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) processor, which is promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and it is the most prominent XML compression mechanism nowadays. Interestingly, the results from the evaluation show that CTC outperforms EXI implementations in terms of memory usage and speed, keeping similar compression rates. As a conclusion, CTC is shown to be a good candidate for managing standard data model representation formats in CPS composed of resource-constrained devices.	addresses (publication format);application-level gateway;benchmark (computing);central processing unit;clinical use template;compiler;consortium;data (computing);data compression;deploy;devices;efficient xml interchange;embedded system;embedding;end-to-end principle;generic drugs;genetic heterogeneity;in-memory database;interoperability;json;machine code;mental representation;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;seamless3d;standard data model;time complexity;web service;web standards;world wide web;format;registration - actclass;standards characteristics	Jorge Berzosa Macho;Luis Gardeazabal Montón;Roberto Cortiñas Rodriguez	2017		10.3390/s17081755	electronic engineering;xml;embedded system;data compression;json;data modeling;cyber-physical system;interoperability;distributed computing;external data representation;efficient xml interchange;computer science	HPC	-41.49699941267381	46.903952615021566	151699

However, sensor stream data, which is generated from sensors used in many USN domain applications, is too fast to control each of them and the volume is too huge to store the whole data. Hence, in order to provide rapid and reliable context analysis service over such sensor stream data, a context analysis system which supports the functionality of sliding window is needed. The context model used in this system is a WHEN-DO context analysis model. This context analysis model is designed to be used as follows: If the sensor stream data satisfies condition in ‘WHEN’ clause, then it will execute actions specified in ‘DO’ clause in WHEN-DO context analysis model. Hence, this system also works as the same way. First determine if the received sensor stream data satisfies condition in ‘WHEN’ clause, if the condition is satisfied with the value of received sensor stream data, then it will execute action in ‘DO’ clause in WHEN-DO context analysis model. Using WHEN-DO context analysis model in this system can take corresponding actions according to user defined conditions. Our proposed context analysis system can be applied to many other USN environment applications such as monitoring the status of a building and then taking actions to that condition.	sensor	Cheng Hao Jin;Yongmi Lee;Gyoyong Sohn;Hi-Seok Kim;Keun Ho Ryu	2009	2009 Sixth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations	10.1109/ITNG.2009.263	real-time computing;context analysis;computer science;data mining;context model;world wide web;ubiquitous computing	SE	-40.19833101373579	47.69006028690936	151817

Interacting devices or groups have highly heterogeneous resources and security and privacy concerns, and invariably belong to different security or administrative domains. Flexible and automated mechanisms are needed to achieve effective cross-domain interoperation that leads to a service or resource sharing agreement. We describe how policies representing system state, requirements and intent can be used to negotiate agreements between mutually unknown and untrusted systems that differ widely in their characteristics. Our negotiation protocol uses a small number of message types, which we have found to be sufficient for supporting a wide variety of application scenarios that occur on the Web, and that will likely be important in the ubiquitous computing environments of the future.	hoc (programming language);interoperation;privacy;requirement;ubiquitous computing;world wide web	Venkatraman Ramakrishna;Kevin Eustice;Peter L.

Most research systems and emerging commercial DDBMSs have assumed site autonomy as a guiding principle. This paper presents some general problems associated with autonomy and administration in a DDBMS, and discusses the incompatibility between replication transparency and site autonomy. In a DDBMS which supports replication transparency, the degree of site autonomy in a system should properly be a policy decision made by system administrators. Parameterization of the degree of site autonomy in a DDBMS involves careful design of a mechanism involving storage structures, operations, and authorization. A mechanism which extends the ANSI SQL authorization model is described, and examples of how users can use the mechanism to implement both centralized and decentralized administration policies are presented.	ansi c;authorization;autonomy;centralized computing;distributed database;sql;software incompatibility;system administrator	Kenneth R.

These smart devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have changed many aspects of modern life. They have also enabled whole new industries to grow up that develop and manufacture """"companion products"""" of the smart devices. These companion products, however, are mostly built around the smart devices, instead of being tightly integrated into them, and fail to utilize the full capabilities of the smart devices. The main cause for their failure is that the software platforms these smart devices are built on are not fully open. This hinders efforts by device manufacturers or software developers to create innovative new products or product categories based on those software platforms.

Our framework can be differentiated from others. First, unlike other frameworks, it is interested in a successful completion of e-commerce transactions by supporting a non-repudiation security service. Second, the proposed framework is based on a dynamic mapping mechanism that improves the performance of e-commerce transactions. We made a set of experiments to measure the performance of three software frameworks—SSL, SET, and our NA framework. The experimental results show that our framework improves the performance of e-commerce transactions while providing a high quality of security services for desired e-commerce transactions.	e-commerce;internet;non-repudiation;software framework	Sungwoo Tak;Yugyung Lee;E.

While its network architecture is highly distributed, the network architecture aims at aggregating data into a centralized location, mainly the cloud-based data center. With such an architecture, we can bring data from distributed sensing sources to centralized cloud-based data andanalytics services, however, it does not foster edge analytics atop LoRaWAN, which is highly suitable for scenarios in developing countries due to connectivity and cost constraints. We outline a conceptual architecture and design augmenting LoRaWAN software architecture for edge analytics. In this paper we develop techniques for edge analytics working with LoRaWAN core network functions. We present key principles of shared data for edge analytics with LoRaWAN. Based on that, we describe main services, their interactions and data models for connecting edge analytics to LoRaWAN infrastructures.

However, as storage systems become ever more distributed, shared, and dynamic, it becomes necessary to enforce security at the boundaries of each storage device, rather than around the system as a whole. This form of decentralized security presents several new challenges in the design and implementation of distributed storage systems. We explore challenges in distributed file systems, third party transfer, active storage, and group management in the context of a 200-node cooperative storage system deployed at the University of Notre Dame.

Moreover, with the inseparable relations between human and devices, the paradigm of Social IoT (SIoT) is gaining popularity in recent years. How to effectively facilitate the access to quality services and credible devices in largescale networks via defining, establishing, and managing social architectures among things has become a critical issue. In this paper, a scheme of access service recommendation for the SIoT is presented with the understanding of inherent constraints and factors that influence the security and stability of IoT networks. In which, timeliness properties are considered in each transaction for dynamic performance enhancements. With the benefits of promoting service discovery and composition, social relationships among things are introduced in the proposed scheme. An energy-aware mechanism is also utilized as a restrictive factor in trustworthiness evaluation. Finally, the recommendation is based not only on the past performance but also on the social relationship and the energy status of nodes. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of our scheme from three aspects including rating accuracy, dynamic behavior, and network stability.

This problem arises whenever organizations, such as educational or research groups or institutions, share resources for business and scientific reasons. In such settings, each user's usage of a licensed resource is typically supported by the user's organization. License administration involves satisfying legal requirements while applying organizational strategies for effective resource usage, and carrying out suitable accounting and audit controls. We propose an approach, Licit, wherein an agent represents each resource sharing site and administers licenses in collaboration with other agents. We show how to represent a variety of usage licenses formally as executable policies and provide a simple information model using which each party can specify both the attributes involved in its licenses and how to resolve them. Our architecture naturally accommodates a variety of site-specific (i.e., custom) strategies for license administration. Licit has been implemented in a popular open source framework for virtual computing, and yields performance results indicating its practical feasibility.	executable;information model;open-source software;requirement	Prashant C.

af4acefa95b66a7f2d4356d19e17cc404ce66a98	a security infrastructure for massive mobile data distribution	computer security;context aware systems;mobile computing	Many modern mobile applications have to address the challenge of enabling communication and managing a very large amount of mobile nodes. Examples of those applications include fleet management, workforce coordination, Intelligent Transportation Systems, cooperative mobile robots, rescue and emergency management, and environmental surveillance. Data distribution is an essential part of those systems, and the data traffic often contains sensitive information - thus enforcing the need of the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity and availability). This work presents a data distribution layer based on the OMG DDS standard, developed to enforce CIA for data distribution through the usage of PKI and symmetric cryptography. This layer provides all required PKI-related functionality and symmetric key management, offering mobile devices an affordable data distribution solution.	access control;confidentiality;cryptography;encryption;information security;information sensitivity;key distribution center;key management;middleware;mobile app;mobile device;mobile robot;overhead (computing);public key infrastructure;publish–subscribe pattern;secure communication;security descriptor definition language;security association;session key;stationary process;symmetric-key algorithm;tag (metadata)	Jesseildo Figueredo Goncalves;Francisco José da Silva e Silva;Rafael Vasconcelos;Gustavo Baptista;Markus Endler	2013		10.1145/2508222.2508237	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-44.223292826587894	58.99834927065746	153236

Consequently, many mechanisms, e.g. broadcast dissemination, hoarding, or specialized caching mechanisms have been developed to overcome the disadvantages of wireless communication systems, which are usually used to access the information. To evaluate such mechanisms a simulation tool is needed that simulates both the users' mobility and their information access patterns. Since most existing user models either model only the mobility or the information access, we developed a new model that covers both aspects. Based on this model, we realized a flexible framework that allows to simulate all aspects of a mobile information access.	information access;simulation	Uwe Kubach;Mario Hegele;Kurt Rothermel	2001		10.1109/ISCC.2001.935422	radio access network;cellular network;mobile search;simulation;user modeling;mobile web;imt advanced;public land mobile network;mobile database;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;distributed computing;mobile station;mobility model;mobile computing;computer network;autonomic computing;mobile payment	NLP	-34.99693347755547	48.9718718871724	153269

In this article we discuss the design issues for the security and privacy of OSNs. We find there are inherent design conflicts between these and the traditional design goals of OSNs such as usability and sociability. We present the unique security and privacy design challenges brought by the core functionalities of OSNs and highlight some opportunities of utilizing social network theory to mitigate these design conflicts.	chi;computer engineering;data security;distributed computing;electrical engineering;interaction;linear network coding;mobile computing;network security;network theory;poo-chi;privacy;social network;systems engineering;time complexity;usability	Chi Zhang;Jinyuan Sun;Xiaoyan Zhu;Yuguang Fang	2010	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2010.5510913	social relation;exponential growth;the internet;information privacy;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;social network	Security	-47.04740610579132	60.19702138015942	153469

To realise the wider vision of pervasive computing it must be possible for system components to be used for various purposes, when and as necessary, perhaps in ways beyond those envisaged by their creators.ComFlux is an open source middleware platform that offers the means to dynamically ‘instruct’ system components as to how, when and with whom they should interact, accounting for usability, modularity and access control considerations. This paper provides an overview of ComFlux, describing its architecture and how it supports an external management regime.	access control;application programming interface;documentation;middleware;mobile device;open-source software;pervasive informatics;research diagnostic criteria;sensor;ubiquitous computing;usability	Raluca Diaconu;Jie Deng;Jean Bacon;Jatinder Singh	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops)	10.1109/PERCOMW.2018.8480214	architecture;distributed computing;access control;computer science;ubiquitous computing;mobile device;usability;modularity;internet of things;middleware	Robotics	-42.399833432387126	46.418402194527424	153798

122032c2f84f7fcd908c1b546d9ccc97e27e5644	a resilient internet of things architecture for smart cities		Nowadays, technology is such an integral part of our lives that the dependency on its benefits is growing faster than ever. With the arrival of the paradigms of smart cities and the Internet of Things, citizens are able to improve their quality of life. Given that sensors and actuators deployed in smart cities usually have limited resources, today, it is a common practice to use cloud computing to extend the scope and benefits of smart cities. Taking into consideration that communication between applications and devices is vital for a good performance of services in a smart city, it is necessary to design new architectures and mechanisms to provide reliability in communications. A key aspect that has to be addressed by the new communications approaches is the possibility to recover the network and its services in case of faults, without human intervention. In this paper, a novel architecture to improve the resilience level of the infrastructure in the Internet of Things is proposed. Moreover, technologies to implement the components from the architecture are suggested. This proposal is discussed within the scope of the SusCity project.	internet of things;smart city	David Perez Abreu;Karima Velasquez;Marília Curado;Edmundo Monteiro	2017	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/s12243-016-0530-y	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer security;internet of things;computer network	ECom	-44.108863381558635	48.86919532955253	154241

Driven by a technological revolution offering “low-power many things and wireless almost everything,” we could, in only a decade, envision and prototype impressive smart space systems that improve quality of life, enhance awareness of resources and the environment, and enrich users' experience. However, prototyping is one thing and actual large-scale deployments are another. The massive scale of sensors and devices that will be deployed in smart cities of the future will be challenging. Without an ecosystem and a scalable architecture in place, it will be extremely difficult to manage or program such an expanding and massive IoT. In this paper, we introduce the Cloud-Edge-Beneath (CEB) architecture and present its salient scalability features. We also present a validation study based on an event-driven programming model demonstrating CEB's scaling behavior in face of IoT expansion and under dynamically increasing loads.	built-in self-test;cloud computing;ecosystem;event-driven programming;experiment;image scaling;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;pervasive informatics;programming model;prototype;requirement;ssi ceb;scalability;sensor;smart city;ubiquitous computing	Yi Xu;Abdelsalam Helal	2016	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2015.2455555	space-based architecture;ecosystem;simulation;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;computer network;intelligent sensor	HCI	-43.38190121404399	49.3077782021131	154389

Due to limited deployment scale of sensors and devices, in early years context-aware computing focused mainly on understanding and exploiting personal context in single smart spaces. As a result of the recent explosion of sensor-equipped mobile phones, the phenomenal growth of Internet and social network services, the broader use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in all types of public transportation, and the extensive deployment of sensor network and WiFi in both indoor and outdoor environments, the digital footprints left by people while interacting with cyber-physical spaces are accumulating with an unprecedented speed and scale. The technology trend towards crowd sensing is creating new challenges and opportunities for context-aware computing - with huge amount, large scale, multi-modal, different granularity, diverse quality of data from various data sources. In this talk, I will present a new research direction called “social and community intelligence (SCI)” as a natural extension of context-aware computing in the era of crowd sensing, with emphasis on extracting community and society level context; in particular I will introduce our work in mining large scale taxi GPS data, mobile phone data and social media data for enabling innovative applications in smart cities. Finally I will briefly summarize the difference between traditional context-aware computing and SCI in terms of data acquisition, modeling, inference, storage and context inferred.	context awareness;data acquisition;digital footprint;global positioning system;interaction;mobile phone;modal logic;sensor;smart tv;smart city;social media;social network;software deployment	Daqing Zhang	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops)	10.1109/PerComW.2013.6529446	embedded system;simulation;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	HCI	-42.918338450814595	50.06089420115912	154429
4790a594c7b370241b5a4200e59fc09df91ff774	an extended attribute based access control model with trust and privacy: application to a collaborative crisis management system	trust;crisis management system;abac;access control;distributed collaboration;context;privacy	Many efforts in the area of computer security have been drawn to attribute-based access control (ABAC). Compared to other adopted models, ABAC provides more granularity, scalability, and flexibility. This makes it a valuable access control system candidate for securing platforms and environments used for coordination and cooperation among organizations and communities, especially over open networks such as the Internet. On the other hand, the basic ABAC model lacks provisions for context, trust and privacy issues, all of which are becoming increasingly critical, particularly in high performance distributed collaboration environments. This paper presents an extended access control model based on attributes associated with objects and subjects. It incorporates trust and privacy issues in order to make access control decisions sensitive to the cross-organizational collaboration context. Several aspects of the proposed model are implemented and illustrated by a case study that shows realistic ABAC policies in the domain of distributed multiple organizations crisis management systems. Furthermore, the paper shows a collaborative graphical tool that enables the actors in the emergency management system to make better decisions. The prototype shows how it guarantees the privacy of object's attributes, taking into account the trust of the subjects. This tool incorporates a decision engine that relies on attribute based policies and dynamic trust and privacy evaluation. The resulting platform demonstrates the integration of the ABAC model, the evolving context, and the attributes of actors and resources.	access control	Waleed W.

Although many service oriented applications deliver their promised services yet it is rather difficult for them to maintain the QoS from user perspective. In this paper we develop an approach based on multi-agent system that helps to achieve the desired level of QoS by negotiating and coordinating between agents at the application layer. These service oriented applications may use the Web services of an agent based service in order to realize a service oriented architecture. In this paper, we propose an agent based approach to address QoS issues in service oriented applications. This approach is based on a unified framework that is applicable to both Web services and agent based services.	agent-based model;heuristic;interactivity;multi-agent system;quality of service;soap;service-oriented architecture;unified framework;web services description language;web service;world wide web	Nazaraf Shah;Rahat Iqbal;Anne E.

Unawareness of the energy consumption characteristics of Web service-based applications during development may cause the battery of devices, e.g., smartphones, to run out more frequently. Compared to related experimental energy consumption studies, the work at hand is the first work that focuses on factors which are specific to services computing, such as the timing of Web service invocations and the Web service response caching logic. Further, Web service invocations are the only variable energy-consuming activity included in the experiments. Based on the results, it is shown, firstly, how the execution of exactly the same Web service invocations may lead to energy consumption results that present differences of up to ca. 15% for WLAN and ca. 60% for UMTS connections, and, secondly, how rules and techniques for energy-efficient development of mobile Web service-based applications can be extracted from the gained knowledge.	cache (computing);circa;cluster analysis;download;experiment;microsoft outlook for mac;mobile app;services computing;smartphone;web service;world wide web	Apostolos Papageorgiou;Ulrich Lampe;Dieter Schuller;Ralf Steinmetz;Apostolos Bamis	2012	2012 IEEE First International Conference on Mobile Services	10.1109/MobServ.2012.12	web service;web application security;embedded system;mobile search;web analytics;mobile web;engineering;ws-policy;world wide web;computer network	SE	-36.55211233444203	54.96523088251367	154776

a11d0b71e1ae215e3222ac29e72cfce72666e236	seamless resources sharing in wearable networks by application function virtualization		The prevalence of smart wearable devices is increasing exponentially and we are witnessing a wide variety of fascinating new services that leverage the capabilities of these wearables. Wearables are truly changing the way mobile computing is deployed and mobile applications are being developed. It is possible to leverage the capabilities such as connectivity, processing, and sensing of wearable devices in an adaptive manner for efficient resource usage and information accuracy within the personal area network. We show that application developers are not yet taking advantage of these cross-device capabilities, however, instead using wearables as passive sensors or simple end displays to provide notifications to the user. We thus design AFV (Application Function Virtualization), an architecture enabling automated dynamic function virtualization and scheduling across devices in a personal area network, simplifying the development of the apps that are adaptive to context changes. AFV provides a simple set of APIs hiding complex architectural tasks from app developers whilst continuously monitoring the user, device and network context, to enable the adaptive invocation of functions across devices. We show the feasibility of our design by implementing AFV on Android, and the benefits for the user in terms of resource efficiency, especially in saving energy consumption, and quality of experience with multiple use cases.	android;mobile app;mobile computing;scheduling (computing);seamless3d;sensor;simple set;wearable computer;wearable technology;while	Harini Kolamunna;Kanchana Thilakarathna;Diego Perino;Dwight J.

5f4ab5672a62631a68e37e3a71b6cbfffb7fbdd9	trust assessment of security for e-health systems	trust;e health;security;architecture;assessment	The expansive connectivity of emerging information systems has set the stage for pervasive access to healthcare services via e-health systems for selecting the best possible healthcare services. Emerging systems are expected to be highly dynamic open environments connecting diverse number of healthcare services and autonomous entities that are autonomous agents or software applications representing patients. Entities in such dynamic environments may have different security needs from e-health systems raising the challenge of trust computations regarding security. In this research, we proposed a trust assessment model of an e-health service from the viewpoint of an entity. The model contains a comprehensive architecture applicable to different types of entities, and a novel set of trust assessment metrics may be used to assess a specific property of a security system (i.e. partial metrics) or all properties (i.e. total metrics). The simulation based evaluation of proposed model in the context of a Hospital Online Appointment Service has shown that the proposed model provides better trust computation results than existing trust models for e-health systems. Furthermore, the entities are also able to assess the trust even with incomplete security information. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The smart-card application maintains the user identification, user profile, credit card information, terminal's IPv6 address, 3P-AAA data, X.509 certification, etc. After being successfully authenticated by the CIM system, the mobile user is able to receive the 'best' service instances from the UCWW cloud under the always best connected and best served (ABC&s) paradigm.	aaa (video game industry);authentication;client (computing);computer-integrated manufacturing;mobile app;mobile phone;programming paradigm;server (computing);smart card;trusted execution environment;user profile;x.509	Ivan Ganchev;Zhanlin Ji;Mairtin O'Droma;Chenxu Dai	2015	2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/CyberC.2015.63	embedded system;java card;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;database;java;computer security;android;computer network	Mobile	-38.940577919678	53.46848314675404	155459

In parallel with that trend, people rely more on context-aware service and devices in many aspects, such as health care and elderly home care. However, traditional sensors are typically locked into closed systems, which hinder the access to such sensors that can be available in other information systems. Establishing free communication between human and physical things will help build a network with hybrid intelligence and amazing services. In order to share information and enable the communication between both physical devices and human, we proposed a SWoT (Social Web of Thing) framework in this paper that establishes social networking between embedded devices, services and human. Through the supernetwork approach, we discussed the service discovery in the SWoT system with heterogeneous social relations. At last, we introduced the MagicHome prototype of SWoT.	application programming interface;closed system;ecosystem;embedded system;information system;internet of things;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;prototype;semantic interpretation;sensor;service discovery;social network;socialization;supernetwork;user experience;web of things	Cheng Cheng;Chunhong Zhang;Xiaofeng Qiu;Yang Ji	2014	JCP	10.4304/jcp.9.2.345-352	web of things;computer science;knowledge management;semantic web;service discovery;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;social network	HCI	-42.13474401222255	47.45973266810005	155519

At the frontend, we create two types of Internet-connected particulate matter (PM2:5) monitors -- AQM and miniAQM, with carefully designed mechanical structures for optimal air-flow. On the cloud-side, we create an air-quality analytics engine that learn and create models of air-quality based on a fusion of sensor data. This engine is used to calibrate AQMs and mini-AQMs in real-time, and infer PM2:5 concentrations. We evaluate AirCloud using 5 months of data and 2 month of continuous deployment, and show that AirCloud is able to achieve good accuracies at much lower cost than previous solutions. We also show three real applications built on top of AirCloud by 3rd party developers to further demonstrate the value of our system.	active queue management;analytical engine;cloud computing;continuous delivery;ecosystem;pervasive informatics;real-time clock;software deployment	Yun Cheng;Xiucheng Li;Zhijun Li;Shouxu Jiang;Yilong Li;Jianping Jia;Xiaofan Jiang	2014		10.1145/2668332.2668346	embedded system;air quality index;real-time computing;simulation	Mobile	-34.272176409935184	57.504097961111164	155768
b4369dfe0feae93353a4e739f7db889518a3df50	serpens: a tool for semantically enriched location information on personal devices	data gathering;location semantics;location awareness	Current mobile phones provide GSM cell information and many devices also support GPS or WiFi-based location information. A problem with raw location data is that it does not provide semantic information, which makes it hard to integrate location-awareness into applications. Moreover, to understand what kind of location information is important to users, researchers currently need to perform time consuming user studies. In this paper we introduce SerPens, a tool that enables gathering semantically enriched location information on personal devices. The main novelty of SerPens is that it enables users to share and gather semantic information in a collaborative fashion. The label information is tied to a taxonomy and is accessible to applications. SerPens has been developed on top of BeTelGeuse, a Bluetooth-based data gathering tool for J2ME compatible devices.	bluetooth;global positioning system;location awareness;mobile phone;taxonomy (general);usability testing	Sourav Bhattacharya;Joonas Kukkonen;Petteri Nurmi;Patrik Floréen	2008		10.4108/ICST.BODYNETS2008.2950	computer science;internet privacy;communication;world wide web	HCI	-39.717055863799615	49.325624967982996	156262

A necessary step towards energy conservation is to provide timely and fine-grained consumption information. This allows for users to identify energy saving opportunities and possibly adjust their behavior to conserve energy. In this paper, we present a device-level energy monitoring system that is based on off-the-shelf components and enables users to monitor, control, and compare the electricity consumption of their appliances. By providing a RESTful API, we seamlessly integrate the smart power outlets into the web and facilitate the development of extensions and novel features. We demonstrate this through the implementation of a web user interface and a mobile phone interface. We further confirm the suitability of our approach with the help of a 12 months pilot deployment. The results of a questionnaire provide insights into additional user features and the interviews conducted with developers who used our open sourced system illustrate the usefulness of the RESTful approach for the smart energy domain.	application programming interface;mobile phone;open-source software;representational state transfer;software deployment;user interface	Markus Weiss;Dominique Guinard	2010		10.1145/1899475.1899495	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;visualization;energy conservation;computer science;operating system;feedback;natural resource;user interface	HCI	-35.81851841390654	55.733701644851415	156381

Besides phone calling we use them for browsing, messaging, playing games and many other things which were possible only on a desktop computer several years ago. Although these devices are even more “smart”, but due to the growing resource requirements their batteries are discharging in a very short period. This is a very important phenomenon, which forces to find alternative ways to reduce the energy consumption of the smartphones. One of them is the method of “computation offloading” where a part of the processes are executed on a remote device (e.g. in the cloud). The creation of an energy-efficiency model consists of several steps. One of the hardest part is to understand how a smartphone behaves in different circumstances. During the execution of an application every step has its own energy cost. To make the execution energy-efficiency, we need first to measure and analyse these costs. In this paper we are going to present a measurement system which is used to analyse the energy consumption of smartphones. The measurements were made in different scenarios and the goal was to save energy through offloading some tasks. The offloading process is based on scheduling theory.	cloud computing;computation offloading;desktop computer;job scheduler;mathematical optimization;mobile device;mobile phone;requirement;scheduling (computing);smartphone;system of measurement	Krisztian Fekete;Kristóf Csorba;Bertalan Forstner;Tamás Vajk;Marcell Fehér;István Albert	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2013.6649248	embedded system;job shop scheduling;real-time computing;simulation;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;mobile computing	Embedded	-36.79560473888213	54.73504949909426	156458

Automated trust negotiation (ATN) is one approach that has been proposed for trust discovery and realisation, which enables entities viz. strangers to access resources across autonomous boundaries through iterative exchange of credentials. Various negotiation strategies have been proposed to protect credential disclosure during trust negotiations. However in some domains such as e-health, not all entities are willing to negotiate credentials or disclose access policies directly to strangers regardless of negotiation strategies and instead prefer to negotiate and disclose sensitive information only to strangers within what we refer to as a circle of trust. In this paper, we introduce a formal model to describe how locally trusted intermediary parties can provide multiple negotiation and delegations hops to protect credentials and access policies. We propose a dynamic trust negotiations (DTN) model that not only protects sensitive information from disclosure but also reduces semantic issues that exist with credentials in decentralized systems.

For the objects from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the cloud, it is a new trend that the objects establish social-like relationships with each other, which efficiently brings the benefits of developed sociality to a complex environment. As fog service become more sophisticated, it will become more convenient for fog users to share their own services, resources, and data via social networks. Meanwhile, the efficient social organization can enable more flexible, secure, and collaborative networking. Aforementioned advantages make the social network a potential architecture for fog computing systems. In this paper, we design an architecture for social fog computing, in which the services of fog are provisioned based on """"friend"""" relationships. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at an organized fog computing system-based social model. Meanwhile, social networking enhances the complexity and security risks of fog computing services, creating difficulties of security service recommendations in social fog computing. To address this, we propose a novel crowd sensing-enabling security service provisioning method to recommend security services accurately in social fog computing systems. Simulation results show the feasibilities and efficiency of the crowd sensing-enabling security service recommendation method for social fog computing systems."""	computation (action);confidentiality;data sources;fog computing;internet of things;otitis media with effusion;particle swarm optimization;phobia, social;physical object;provisioning;requirement;sy term type;security service (telecommunication);signature;simulation;social network;social welfare model;telecommunications network;virtual machine;benefit	Jun Wu;Zhou Su;Shen Yun Wang;Jianhua Li	2017		10.3390/s17081744	social organization;architecture;engineering;cloud computing;service discovery;internet privacy;social network;provisioning;computer security;security service;internet of things	Web+IR	-42.403261685698276	57.07848976284299	156872

Due to the different requirements regarding the reliability, latency, number of nodes, node density and range to communication systems there is no uniform standard for wireless communication covering all domains of automation. It is to be expected in the future on a strongly increasing number of radio technologies and protocol stacks on different platforms and operating systems. According to this uniform integration interfaces neither exist on the side of the radio technologies nor on that of classical control systems. For relaying between both systems the architecture and the structure of a convergence middleware are presented, which abstracts the technology-specific details and makes a uniform integration interface available for wireless industrial communication systems. Furthermore a system is presented, with which the integration of wireless technology into automation systems can be automated and thus contributes to the decrease of complexity.	automation;bluetooth;complexity;control system;iec 61131;iec 61131-3;internationalization and localization;library (computing);middleware;operating system;requirement;ultra-wideband;xml	Volker Schuermann;Aurel Buda;Jörg F.

We firstly discuss a reputation tracking scheme that quantifies uncertainty in its rating. We address what is an opinion, how to update opinions after interaction, neighborhood query and interaction protocols in detail. Then we present a prototype system and many experiment results to analyze the performance of this trust model.

Certainly, there are increasingly companies that use mobile devices integrated in their applications. Because of it, it is necessary the development of this type of applications. The above mentioned decision is of vital importance for the functioning, maintenance and cost of the application.

When deployed in an open network such as the Internet, MASs face some trust and security issues. Agents come and go, and interact with strangers. Assumptions about security and general trustworthiness of agents and their deployers are inadequate in this context. In this paper, we present the design of a security infrastructure applicable to MASs in general. Our design addresses both security threats and trust issues. In our design, we have mechanisms for ensuring secure communication among agents and secure naming and resource location services. And two types of trusts are addressed: trust that agents will not misbehave and trust that agents are really delegatees of whom they claim to be. To establish the rst type of trust, we make deployers of agents liable for the actions of their agents; to establish the second type of trust, we propose that agents prove that they know secrets that only their delegators know.	agent-based model;internet;multi-agent system;secure communication;trust (emotion)	H.

This paper presents Wishbone, a system that takes a dataflow graph of operators and produces an optimal partitioning. With Wishbone, users can run the same program on a range of sensor platforms, including TinyOS motes, smartphones running JavaME, and the iPhone. The resulting program partitioning will in general be different in each case, reflecting the different node capabilities. Wishbone uses profiling to determine how each operator in the dataflow graph will actually perform on sample data, without requiring cumbersome user annotations. Its partitioning algorithm models the problem as an integer linear program that minimizes a linear combination of network bandwidth and CPU load and uses program structure to solve the problem efficiently in practice. Our results on a speech detection application show that the system can quickly identify good trade-offs given limitations in CPU and network capacity.	algorithm;central processing unit;data-flow analysis;data-intensive computing;dataflow;java platform, micro edition;linear programming;sensor;smartphone;structured programming;tinyos;wishbone (computer bus)	Ryan Newton;Sivan Toledo;Lewis Girod;Hari Balakrishnan;Samuel Madden	2009			embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;database;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-35.59807542854186	55.69435966787474	158615

Echoing problems above, and having relentless devoted to software and hardware innovation and practice, we have independently developed a set of solution which is based on innovation and integration of router technology, mobile Internet technology, Internet of things technology, communication technology, digital-to-analog conversion and codec technology, and P2P technology among others. We have also established relevant protocols (without the application of protocols abroad). By doing this, we managed to establish a system with low and moderate price, superior performance, all-inclusive functions, easy installation, convenient portability, real-time reliability, security encryption, and the capability to manage home furnitures in an intelligent way. Only a new smart home system like this can inject new idea and energy into smart home industry and thus vigorously promote the establishment of smart home industry standard.	aqua;book;codec;digital-to-analog converter;display resolution;encryption;home automation;internet of things;little big adventure;peer-to-peer;purchasing;real-time transcription;router (computing);smart tv;software portability;technical standard;the industry standard;user experience	Hui Lin;Jianbiao Lin;Ke Ji;Jingjie Wang;Feng Lin	2015	2015 Science and Information Conference (SAI)		embedded system;home automation;computer science;operating system;computer security;internet of things;computer network	HCI	-40.035024686832536	55.95749522339874	159661

However, it is often believed that XML Web services will become too large a bottleneck in service performance, rendering the service unusable, as well as it can compromise service usage due to lack of security features. This paper provides a thorough study of these topics, i.e., a study of the typical performance of mobile services built on top of XML Web services, how security features can be introduced for these services and how these security features influence on the performance of services. The results of this paper should apply to any mobile services implementation based on XML Web services technologies.	request–response;usability;web service;xml	Thao Thanh Nguyen;Ivar Jørstad;Do Van Thanh	2008	Fourth International Conference on Networking and Services (icns 2008)	10.1109/ICNS.2008.41	web service;web application security;mobile search;business process execution language;service interface for real time information;mobile web;computer science;information security;ws-policy;service-oriented architecture;soap;ws-addressing;database;mobile business development;services computing;internet privacy;ws-i basic profile;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;devices profile for web services	Web+IR	-46.21520989545813	57.71302824330254	159673
f47b3bc56076fe83a1a351028e08bd983ea34c27	cybersecurity for smart cities: a brief review		By leveraging advancements in information and communications technology (ICT), Smart Cities offer many potential benefits like improved energy efficiency, management and personal security. However, this dependence on ICT also makes smart cities prone to cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the topic of cybersecurity for smart cities. We show how the specific characteristics of smart cities give rise to cybersecurity challenges, and review the different threats faced. Finally, we review some of the more important cybersecurity solutions for smart cities that have been proposed.	computer security;cyber security standards;smart city	Armin Alibasic;Reem Al Junaibi;Zeyar Aung;Wei Lee Woon;Mohammad Atif Omar	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-50947-1_3	architectural engineering;internet privacy;computer security	AI	-46.0325157553195	51.123088887527445	159805
18862ff8d28cf99892a19dbb26f8d15fd89d9fb1	node.dpws: high performance and scalable web services for the iot		Interconnected computing systems, in various forms, are expected to permeate our lives, realizing the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) and allowing us to enjoy novel, enhanced services that promise to improve our everyday lives. Nevertheless, this new reality also introduces significant challenges in terms of performance, scaling, usability and interoperability. Leveraging the benefits of Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) can help alleviate many of the issues that developers, implementers and end‐users have to face in the context of the IoT. This work presents Node.DPWS, a novel implementation of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) based on the Node.js platform. Node.DPWS can be used to deploy lightweight, efficient and scalable Web Services over heterogeneous nodes, including devices with limited resources. The performance of the presented work is evaluated on typical embedded devices, including comparisons with implementations created using alternative DPWS toolkits.	application programming interface;devices profile for web services;documentation;embedded system;image scaling;internet of things;interoperability;library (computing);list of toolkits;node.js;scalability;service-oriented architecture;usability;web service	Konstantinos Fysarakis;Damianos Mylonakis;Charalampos Manifavas;Ioannis Papaefstathiou	2015	CoRR			Mobile	-37.44955212414515	52.04620249811401	159846
3ebc44c7e270f60fd0af67532c469faeff813261	snps: an osgi-based middleware for wireless sensor networks		We are witnessing a widespread deployment of sensors and sensor networks in any application domain. These sensors produce huge amounts of raw data that need to be structured, stored, analyzed, correlated and mined in a reliable and scalable way. Some application environments also add real-time requirements which make things even harder to manage. The size of the produced data, and the high rate at which data are being produced, suggest that we need new solutions that combine tools for data management and services capable of promptly structuring, aggregating and mining data even just when they are produced. In this paper we propose a middleware, to be deployed on top of physical sensors and sensor networks, capable of abstracting sensors from their proprietary interfaces, and offering them to third party applications in an as-a-Service fashion for prompt and universal use. The middleware also offers tool to elaborate real-time measurements produced by sensors. A prototype of the middleware has been implemented.	middleware;osgi	Giuseppe Di Modica;Francesco Pantano;Orazio Tomarchio	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-45364-9_1	key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Embedded	-41.7148941338413	47.4864192916832	159847

A smart thing can be as simple as a web-enabled device that collects and transmits sensor data to a repository for analysis, or as complex as a web-enabled system to monitor and manage a smart home. Smart things present marvellous opportunities, but when they participate in complex systems, they challenge our ability to manage risk and ensure reliability. SDL, the ITU Standard Specification and Description Language, provides many advantages for modelling and simulating communicating agents – such as smart things – before they are deployed. The potential for SDL to enhance reliability and safety is explored with respect to existing smart things below. But SDL must advance if it is to become the language of choice for developing the next generation of smart things. In particular, it must target emerging IoT platforms, it must support simulation of interactions between pre-existing smart things and new smart things, and it must facilitate deployment of large numbers of similar things. Moreover, awareness of the potential benefits of SDL must be raised if those benefits are to be realized in the current and future Internet of Things.	complex systems;future internet;home automation;interaction;internet of things;simulation;smart tv;smart device;smart system;software deployment;specification and description language	Edel Sherratt;Ileana Ober;Emmanuel Gaudin;Pau Fonseca i Casas;Finn Kristoffersen	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24912-4_3	simulation;engineering;computer security;internet of things	AI	-43.655640871512766	47.10191185144683	160123

In this paper, we propose a solution for the particular problem by using a wireless sensor network based system to monitor the palm sap production of a large plantation area. We are using an enhanced version of TikiriDB which provides a database abstraction on the sensor network to make the process of data collecting and analyzing more efficient. TikiriDB can be used to reduce restrictions on accessing traditional sensor networks by enabling the user to access the sensor network using multiple queries through multiple access points simultaneously.	software deployment;wireless access point	Asanka P.

The emergence of industry-standard trusted computing technologies promises a revolution in this respect by providing roots of trust upon which secure applications can be developed. These technologies offer a particularly attractive platform for security in peer-to-peer environments. In this paper we propose a trusted computing architecture to enforce access control policies in such applications. Our architecture is based on an abstract layer of trusted hardware which can be constructed with emerging trusted computing technologies. A trusted reference monitor (TRM) is introduced beyond the trusted hardware. By monitoring and verifying the integrity and properties of running applications in a platform using the functions of trusted computing, the TRM can enforce various policies on behalf of object owners. We further extend this platform-based architecture to support user-based control policies, cooperating with existing services for user identity and attributes. This architecture and its refinements can be extended in future work to support general access control models such as lattice-based access control, role-based access control, and usage control.	algorithm;computer architecture;emergence;federal enterprise architecture;hardware restriction;lattice-based access control;peer-to-peer;reference monitor;role-based access control;software deployment;trusted computing;verification and validation	Ravi S.

The service delivery network that powers the MSA involves retail stores and their business partners such as manufacturers. This paper presents the core technologies that we developed in this cross-organizational service network to support the MSA and its personalized services, with focus on service delivery, customer behavior understanding and information sharing. Our event-based techniques allow customers, stores and manufacturers to deliver and consume the services in a loosely coupled manner, thus solving a critical store-specific real-time engagement problem in a seamless way. Service response tracking enables the stores to construct a comprehensive view of a customer’s in-store shopping behavior. Finally, the cross-organizational authorization-based access control mechanism effectively enforces information sharing between the stores and their partners.	access control;association rule learning;authorization;bridging (networking);ecosystem;itil;loose coupling;mobile app;personalization;prototype;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;seamless3d;usability testing	Jun Li;Ismail Ari;Jhilmil Jain;Alan H.

Access control is one of the most pervasive security mechanisms in use today and is present in almost all systems, from operating systems to database management systems. Access control is usually based on access permits, also called authorizations, specifying which subjects can access which objects for performing which actions. Access control, however, imposes great administrative and architectural challenges and also requires careful design. In particular, a relevant problem, especially when dealing with large systems, is represented by the complexity of access control administration. Access control administration deals with assigning and revoking authorizations.	access control list;database;elisa bertino;email;information security;operating system;role-based access control	Elisa Bertino	2003	Computers & Security	10.1016/S0167-4048(03)00609-6	computer access control;physical access;discretionary access control;computer science;information security;access control;role-based access control;data mining;database;network access control;computer security	Security	-47.03344827083747	53.90666113071227	161126

The potential for further convergence is then explored in terms of common embedded software platforms and common communication protocols, which could be used on both low-end IoT devices and low-cost robots.

In a case that the users of some application service locate within a short distance, it is inefficient for users to communicate with others via a remote server on the network. Communicating between users directly is much better and faster than being relayed by a remote server. In order to allow the direct interaction between groups of users located at short distances, the Multiuser Interaction Middleware (MIM) was designed and implemented. MIM functions include the API module, group management, security management, resource management, profile management, synchronization management, and communication management. These features make it possible for multiple users at close range interact without going through a central server. Application fields include multi-user mobile games, U-Learning service, interactive messenger applications.	application programming interface;middleware;mobile device;mobile game;multi-user;real life;security management;server (computing)	Young-Han Yun;Hoon Choi	2017	2017 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2017.7899540	synchronization;security management;real-time computing;mobile telephony;computer science;resource management;operating system;middleware;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;server;computer network	Mobile	-36.272830836066134	47.96385682059122	161642

As the amount of information to be shared grows, the need to restrict access only to specific users or for specific usage will surely arise. The protection of information in digital libraries, however, is difficult because of the peculiarity of the hypertext paradigm which is generally used to represent information in digital libraries, together with the fact that related data in a hypertext are often distributed at different sites. In this paper, we present an authorization model for distributed hypertext systems. Our model supports authorizations at different granularity levels, takes into consideration different types of data and the relationships among them, and allows administrative privileges to be delegated.	authorization;digital library;hypertext;library (computing);programming paradigm;superuser	Pierangela Samarati;Elisa Bertino;Sushil Jajodia	1996	IEEE Trans.

b742a8edeb5d7a562bf9ea38f4869644a5aaca46	an efficient architecture for trust management in ioe based systems of systems		Internet of Every things (IoE) is a network that integrates a variety of heterogeneous nodes, such as connected portable devices, connected cars, smart home appliances, humans, etc. to Internet. The constituents of IoE are heterogeneous, distributed by nature and also autonomous in most of cases, which meet the criteria of what we call Systems of Systems (SoS). These smart objects communicate and collaborate between each other in dynamic environments which are subject to several security attacks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical based blockchain trust management architecture with mobility support in highly distributed IoE based Systems of Systems. This architecture deals efficiently with scalability issues. It allows smart objects to disseminate the trustworthiness of the service providers they interact with them to the blockchain. This later makes the access to this information possible from anywhere and ensures a global view of trustworthiness information. Thanks to the blockchain technology, our architecture outperforms the existing trust management solutions especially in terms of scalability and mobility support.	apple sos;autonomous robot;bitcoin;connected car;home automation;internet;mobile device;scalability;smart objects;system of systems;trust (emotion);trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science);vii	Djamel Eddine Kouicem;Abdelmadjid Bouabdallah;Hicham Lakhlef	2018	2018 13th Annual Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SoSE)	10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428732	system of systems;architecture;service provider;scalability;home automation;the internet;dissemination;smart objects;distributed computing;computer science	DB	-44.90498922065259	51.752270055396444	162085

A framework for on-demand establishment of IoT services based on the automated formulation of societies of internet-connected objects is described and the interactions between architecture modules are explained in detail to validate this approach. The main building blocks of the functional framework and its operational components follow the utility-driven cloud-based computing model. The framework leverages well-known technologies i.e. linked sensor data and standards notably the W3C semantic sensor networks ontology. Finally, an example for service formulation and delivery of services for a smart campus scenario is provided and discussed.

Interesting researches related to integration techniques have taken place, they are primary based on the adoption of sharing data-mechanisms; furthermore in the last years, the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach has become predominant in many sensor network projects as it enables the cooperation and interoperability of different sensor platforms at an higher level of abstraction. In this paper we propose a novel architecture for the interoperability of sensor networks, which is based on web services technologies and on the definition of a common data model enriched with semantic concepts and annotations. The proposed architecture allows the development of complex application by integration of heterogeneous data, accessible through services, according to standard data format and standard protocols.	data model;global variable;interoperability;sensor;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;web service	Flora Amato;Valentina Casola;Andrea Gaglione;Antonino Mazzeo	2010	2010 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2010.124	sensor web;semantic interoperability;computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	DB	-40.732534949729185	46.84008545752535	162165

They are queried and assembled under specific requirement. Being a passive control technique for data security, access control should have the ability to work synergistically across different organizations to prevent unauthorized access to special data, while these services or organizations share same role hierarchy and resource hierarchy, there may be conflicts on the overall security policies. XACML can be used to describe security policies by these public services, as it is a standardized expressive language for access control policies. Whereas Description Logics has the capability of representing knowledge and reasoning, a method that maps XACML policies to Description Logics Knowledge Base was proposed, and then the conflict detection problem is transformed into a problem of consistency in ABox.	abox;access control;algorithm;authorization;data security;description logic;file synchronization;knowledge base;map;requirement;role hierarchy;role-based access control;sensor;software propagation;synergy;tbox;time complexity;web service;xacml	Feng Huang;Zhiqiu Huang;LinYuan Liu	2009		10.1145/1640206.1640222	computer access control;role-based access control;data mining;database;business;computer security	AI	-47.802231645466655	52.822546180873545	162289

Moreover, the characteristics of MMSN such as the Internetless activities and Wireless Mesh Network (WMN)-based connectivity provides various potentials including but not limited to business opportunities, scalable crowdsourcing or crowdsensing deployment, edge computing and so on. Although there exist a fair number of software platforms that help developers to implement MMSN, they still cannot fully overcome the limitation derived from the hardware resource constraint nature of the participative mobile devices. In order to enhance the MMSN in terms of cost efficiency, we introduce Fog Social Network (FSN) model, which utilises the computing and networking resources in users' close vicinity to improve the overall efficiency of MMSN. Further, the proposed FSN framework consists of an adaptive resource-aware cost-performance index (CPI) scheme, which performs dynamic approach selection autonomously at runtime to choose the most efficient route for the delivery of the messages for MMSN activities. With this intention, we have implemented and validated a proof-of-concept prototype.	business process;cloud computing;context awareness;cost efficiency;crowdsensing;crowdsourcing;distance fog;docker;edge computing;existential quantification;fog computing;management system;mobile device;prototype;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;social network;software deployment;virtual machine;wireless mesh network	Chii Chang;Mohan Liyanage;Sander Soo;Satish Narayana Srirama	2017	2017 IEEE 31st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2017.18	mobile telephony;cloud computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;database;distributed computing;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-39.994261556267304	57.07527877405073	162382

Especially, in the near future , embedding various types of sensors in our daily lives enables an application to customize their behavior according to its user's situation. Also, physical objects in our daily lives can be used to manipulate information in cyber spaces. however, the vision requires a new software infrastructure that collaborates various appliances in a spontaneous way. The paper proposes an architecture to realize the vision in our daily computing environments by creating a society of appliances. Our architecture is called Pervasive Servers, that embeds micro servers called stationary pervasive servers everywhere. Also, a personal pervasive server that is carried by each person coordinates the embedded servers that are near the person. The architecture is very attractive because it is easy to personalize the coordination according to each person's policy. We also show that there are several useful applications based on the architecture.	embedded system;personalization;pervasive informatics;seamless3d;sensor;server (computing);spontaneous order;stationary process;ubiquitous computing	Tatsuo Nakajima	2003	2003 The Ninth IEEE International Workshop on Object-Oriented Real-Time Dependable Systems	10.1109/WORDS.2003.1267525	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;server	Robotics	-38.34003117022975	48.84253283082332	162399

However, traditional thermostats are often ineffective due to physical inaccessibility, lack of information or limited responsiveness, which lead to occupant discomfort. Modern thermostat designs do overcome some of these limitations, but retrofitting them to existing buildings is prohibitively expensive. Software thermostats based on web or smartphone apps provide an alternate interaction mechanism with minimal deployment cost. However, their usage and effectiveness have not been studied extensively in real settings. We present Genie, a novel software thermostat that we designed and deployed in our university for over 21 months. We compare the use of Genie to traditional thermostats. Our data and user study show that due to the clarity of information and wider thermal control provided by Genie, users feel more comfortable in their offices. Furthermore, the improved comfort did not affect the overall energy consumption or lead to misuse of HVAC controls.	genie;mobile app;responsiveness;smartphone;software deployment;usability testing	Bharathan Balaji;Jason Koh;Nadir Weibel;Yuvraj Agarwal	2016		10.1145/2971648.2971719	thermal comfort;embedded system;simulation;building automation	HCI	-35.472663171170765	56.63968275782749	162850

Means to minimize this share of consumption depend upon accurate information about occupant behavior. Therefore, it is important to improve sensing systems for gathering such information. However, as research on occupancy sensing systems goes beyond basic methods, there is an increasing need for better comparison of proposed occupancy sensing systems. Developers of occupancy sensing systems are also lacking good frameworks for understanding different options when building occupancy sensing systems. This poster abstract motivates the need for working towards a better categorization framework to address both of these problems. For researchers, the categorization framework is also an aid when scoping out future research in the area of occupancy sensing systems.	categorization;quorum sensing;scope (computer science)	Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard;Sanja Lazarova-Molnar;Muhyiddine Jradi	2015		10.1145/2768510.2770947	simulation;engineering;transport engineering;computer security	Robotics	-42.072093508315554	51.33825406608142	162930

Our architecture supports traditional fixed clients and mobile clients addressing the connection adaptation and limited resources challenges presented by mobile devices. We describe the requirements of universally available personal digital libraries and illustrate their applicability with a user scenario. These requirements are addressed by our universal access architecture, which targets to support multiple device access, including mobile devices. The main components of the architecture are the Client-Side Applications, the Data Server and the Mobile Communication Middleware (MCM). Our work has focused on the mobile connection support provided by the interaction of mobile clients with the MCM, obtaining a constant response rate in spite of variability of network conditions. The architecture of a mobile software client that benefits from these mechanisms is described and supplemented with implementation notes showing how—in spite of the limited computing resources of mobile devices—it can interact with a data server that has not been designed to support client mobility via adaptation techniques implemented in	client (computing);client-side;digital library;heart rate variability;library (computing);middleware;mobile device;multi-chip module;personal digital assistant;requirement;scenario (computing);server (computing)	Francisco Alvarez-Cavazos;Roberto Garcia-Sanchez;David A.

066894fb19cbee73495b0eded1f33fa3c61c1d96	mobile sensing and social computing		With the rapid development of social networks and social environments, mobile sensing has increasingly emerged as one of the most important technologies to develop social computing solutions. Social computing is a general term for an area of computer science that is concerned with the intersection of social behavior and computational systems, providing a programmable combination of contributions from both humans and computers. A key factor for social computing is how social information is collected from the ubiquitous environments and can be widely used to provide social services in mobile environments. Mobile sensing is increasingly becoming part of everyday life, as smartphones are becoming the central personal computational device in people’s lives. Mobile sensing presents several challenges related to wireless sensor networks, machine learning, human–computer interaction, and mobile systems. Sensor-equipped mobile phones can be combined with wireless sensor networks installed in the environment to develop social machines in many sectors of our economy, including business, healthcare, social networks, environmental monitoring, and transportation. Some research efforts on social computing and mobile sensing have been in progress, including mobile sensing algorithms, applications and systems, and methods and techniques to develop virtual societies. This IJDSN Special Issue is an opportunity to bring multi-disciplinary experts, academics, and practitioners together to exchange their experience in the development and deployment of mobile sensing and social computing systems. This Special Issue brings together researchers and developers from industry and academy to report on the latest scientific and technical advances on the application of mobile sensing and social computing and to showcase the latest systems using these technologies. Filipe et al. compile and compare technologies and protocols published in the most recent researches, seeking Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) issues for medical monitoring purposes to select the most useful solutions for this area of networking. The most important features under consideration in our analysis include wireless communication protocols, frequency bands, data bandwidth, transmission distance, encryption, authentication methods, power consumption, and mobility. WBAN supporting healthcare applications are in early development stage, but offer valuable contributions at monitoring, diagnostic, or therapeutic levels. They cover real-time medical information gathering obtained from different sensors with secure data communication and low power consumption. Filipe et al. demonstrate that some characteristics of surveyed protocols are very useful to medical appliances and patients in a WBAN domain. Marcelino et al. present a solution to overcome barriers between elderlies and their information and communication technology (ICT) usage in order to potentiate all the benefits provided from mobile sensing and social computing. They present a survey on guidelines, standards, and advices regarding usability and accessibility issues when developing solutions for elderly people made having in mind that senior population have singular requirements due to age-related changes and also frequently technological illiteracy. The authors have identified and applied the most important guidelines to their own solution. A prototype was made using responsive design in order to be adaptable to any type of devices. Zong and Wen propose a new approach to calculate the smartphone orientation by detecting the vehicle starting action and then establish the coordinate system relationship between vehicle and smartphone. Furthermore, they trained the classified model offline to match the acceleration characteristics with traveling speed. In the model training process we compared different classification algorithms. Due to enclosed areas and intensive energy consumption, GPS or WiFi sometime are invalid. In this paper, Zong and Wen propose a new approach to estimate the traveling speed after analyzing the acceleration characteristics in time domain and frequency domain. Shuyun et al. propose a method used to calculate the link importance degree index, and the index is used to evaluate the link’s information. Besides, a multiobjective optimization model is proposed, its aim is to minimize the total cruise time under detecting as many important links as possible and minimize the information value undetected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the fuzzy operator is introduced to the constraint conditions.

However, if left uncontrolled, customizability may come at the price of lack of uniformity or lack of maintainability. Indeed, as the portal content and services evolve, they can break assumptions made in the definition of customized views. Also, uncontrolled customization may lead to certain content considered important by the web portal owners (e.g. advertisements), to not be displayed to end users. Thus, web portal customization is hindered by the need to enforce customization policies and guidelines with minimal overhead. This paper presents a case study where a combination of techniques was employed to semi-automatically enforce policies and guidelines on community-built presentation components in a web portal. The study shows that a combination of automated verification and semantics extraction techniques can reduce the amount of manual checks required to enforce these policies and guidelines.	bespoke;circuit complexity;overhead (computing);portals;semiconductor industry;uncontrolled format string	Siim Karus;Marlon Dumas	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77010-7_16	data mining;personalization;database;world wide web	Web+IR	-42.210236728688145	60.39877165027685	163201

Several models have been proposed to address privacy challenges. Successful design requires awareness of the technology's users and that their desires and concerns are understood. This is difficult as few empirical researches exist about potential pervasive users that designers can use. Complicating design further is the fact that pervasive systems are typically embedded or invisible, making it difficult for users to know when these devices are present and collecting data. As users have a limited understanding of the technology several privacy, design, and safety issues are raised. This paper discusses how privacy might be preserved in a pervasive computing environment. It presents some research developments in these areas to address privacy concerns.

acdf28785e03417f2bbc36ac84fe68a8304710ac	a framework for major stakeholders in android application industry to manage privacy policies of android applications		As Android’s permission-based system cannot fulfill the requirements of personal data protection, several countries around the world are requesting application developers to provide privacy policies for their applications. To address the issue, this study proposes a framework to Manage Privacy Policies of Android Applications (MaPPA). MaPPA provides standard format for application providers to present privacy policies in machine processable format and to embed the policies into applications. Application verifiers or marketplace providers can then verify whether an application complies with embedded privacy policies and envelop verification reports in the application. Therefore, users can extract privacy policies and verification reports from applications directly. Compared to providing URL links to privacy policies in marketplaces, the proposed framework can reduce the cost for application developers to maintain additional servers to provide privacy policies. Moreover, application users can obtain verification reports in an application to comfirm the consistency between privacy policies and application behavior. In light of this, the study can hopefully solve current problems of privacy policy notification for Android applications.	android	Shi-Cho Cha;Chuang-Ming Shiung;Tzu-Ching Liu;Sih-Cing Syu;Li-Da Chien;Tsung-Ying Tsai	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-44760-5_10	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-46.57857489980013	59.53872980479874	163553

The problem with the typical grid services approach (X. 509 proxy certificates) is that commercial Web services tooling fails to recognize these certificates or process them properly. The security assertion markup language (SAML) is a standardized XML-based framework for exchanging authentication, authorization and attribute information. SAML has broadening commercial support but lacks delegation capabilities. To address this shortcoming, we exploit SAML's inherent extensibility to create a delegation framework for Web and grid services that supports both direct and indirect delegation. We develop a set of verification rules for delegation tokens that rely on WS-Security X.509 signatures, but do not force any trust relationship between the delegatee and the target service. We have implemented the framework on two common Web service hosting environments: Java/Tomcat and .NET. By leveraging existing Web services standards, we make it easier for Grid practitioners to build and consume Web and grid services without resorting to grid-specific protocols.	.net framework;acm/ieee supercomputing conference;antivirus software;apache tomcat;authentication;authorization;extensibility;grid computing;java;koutetsu no kishi;middleware;omii-uk;saml 1.1;saml 2.0;san diego supercomputer center;security assertion markup language;surface web;ws-security;watts humphrey;web service;welch's method;world wide web;x.509;xml	David Del Vecchio;Marty Humphrey	2005	IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS'05)	10.1109/ICWS.2005.59	web service;computer science;information security;ws-policy;database;authorization;services computing;law;world wide web;computer security	HPC	-47.625238837313454	55.135488598825205	164313

Different places may have different requirements in how many protecting units should be nearby. If any place has less protecting units around than it requires, it is an unsafe place. This paper studies the Continuous Top-k Unsafe Places (CTUP) query, which continuously monitors the k least safe places while the protecting units keep sending their location updates to the server. The CTUP query is a novel addition to the family of continuous location-based queries, an emerging area due to the recent advances in dynamic location-aware environments. Solutions to existing continuous location-based queries and to the traditional top-k queries do not apply. This paper proposes two solutions to this new query, the BasicCTUP scheme and the OptCTUP scheme. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed solutions.	ibm notes;location awareness;requirement;server (computing);space partitioning;zhi-li zhang	Donghui Zhang;Yang Du;Ling Hu	2008	2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering	10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497442	information science;computer science;operating system;data mining;database;internet privacy;computational model;computer security;memory management	DB	-38.99734288427708	60.22513058802283	164527

Sensors and context sources are able to provide enormous amounts of valuable information about individuals that can be used to drive the behavior of services and applications, and adapt them to the specific conditions and preferences of each user. Thanks to advances in mobility, convergence and integration, increasingly larger amounts of these data are available in the Internet. However, this context information is usually fragmented, and traditionally applications have had to take care of context management themselves. This work presents a solution for a converged context management framework and how it can be employed in a future Internet to integrate data from all context sources and serve it to client applications in a seamless and transparent manner. This framework takes advantage of the intelligent and convergent features of next-generation networks, allowing seamless integration, monitoring, and control of heterogeneous sensors and devices under a single context-aware service layer. This layer is centered on a context intelligence module, capable of combining clustering algorithms and semantics to learn from user usage history and take advantage of that information to infer missing or high-level context data.	algorithm;care-of address;cluster analysis;future internet;high- and low-level;next-generation network;personalization;seamless3d;sensor;service layer	Carlos Baladrón Zorita;Javier M.

Cities are beginning to address this problem by implementing significant sensing and actuation infrastructure and building services on this infrastructure. However, as the density of sensing and actuation increases and as the complexities of services grow there is an increasing potential for conflicts across Smart City services. These conflicts can cause unsafe situations and disrupt the benefits that the services were originally intended to provide. Although some of the conflicts can be detected and avoided during designing the services, many can still occur unpredictably during runtime. This paper carefully defines and enumerates the main issues regarding the detection and resolution of runtime conflicts in smart cities. In particular, it focuses on conflicts that arise across services. This issue is becoming more and more important as Smart City designs attempt to integrate services from different domains (transportation, energy, public safety, emergency, medical, and many others). Research challenges are identified and then addressed that deal with uncertainty, dynamism, real-time, mobility and spatio-temporal availability, duration and scale of effect, efficiency, and ownership. A watchdog architecture is also described that oversees the services operating in a Smart City. This watchdog solution detects and resolves conflicts, it learns and adapts, and it provides additional inputs to decision making aspects of services. Using data from a Smart City dataset, an emulated set of services and activities using those services are created to perform a conflict analysis. A second analysis hypothesizes 41 future services across 5 domains. Both of these evaluations demonstrate the high probability of conflicts in smart cities of the future.	emulator;file synchronization;population;real-time locating system;sensor;smart city;watchdog timer	Meiyi Ma;Sarah Masud Preum;W.

Owing to the dynamic nature of the cloud, continuous monitoring on trust attributes is necessary to enforce service-level agreements. This study presents Cloud-Trust, an adaptive trust management model for efficiently evaluating the competence of a cloud service based on its multiple trust attributes. In Cloud-Trust, two kinds of adaptive modelling tools (rough set and induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator) are organically integrated and successfully applied to trust data mining and knowledge discovery. Using rough set to discover knowledge from trust attributes makes the model surpass the limitations of traditional models, in which weights are assigned subjectively. Moreover, Cloud-Trust uses the IOWA operator to aggregate the global trust degree based on time series, thereby enabling better real-time performance. Experimental results show that Cloud-Trust converges more rapidly and accurately than do existing approaches, thereby verifying that it can effectively take on trust measurement tasks in cloud computing.	cloud computing;service-level agreement	Xiaoyong Li;Junping Du	2013	IET Information Security	10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0232	information and communications technology;cloud computing;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;knowledge extraction;computer security;computational trust	ECom	-47.77466620020573	51.80654781978011	165203

In cloud computing, computing resources are provided as services over the Internet and users can access resources based on their payments. The issue of access control is an important security scheme in the cloud computing. In this paper, a Contract RBAC model with continuous services for user to access various source services provided by different providers is proposed. The Contract RBAC model extending from the well-known RBAC model in cloud computing is shown. The extending definitions in the model could increase the ability to meet new challenges. The Contract RBAC model can provide continuous services with more flexible management in security to meet the application requirements including Intra-cross cloud service and Inter-cross cloud service. Finally, the performance analyses between the traditional manner and the scheme are given. Therefore, the proposed Contract RBAC model can achieve more efficient management for cloud computing environments.	algorithm;cloud computing;communicating sequential processes;data center;design by contract;document structure description;internet;national supercomputer centre in sweden;programming paradigm;requirement;role-based access control;server (computing);solid-state drive;whole earth 'lectronic link	Hsing-Chung Chen;Marsha Anjanette Violetta;Cheng-Ying Yang	2013	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-013-1017-5	contract;cloud computing security;cloud computing;computer science;cloud testing;database;utility computing;internet privacy;computer security	HPC	-47.45260215062052	56.150370587966066	165294

However, due to the limited hardware resources, wireless sensor networks abstain from using verbose data formats like XML. Nevertheless, XML as a standardized data exchange format in wireless sensor networks is a means to support more complex data management and heterogeneous networks. Moreover, XML is a key feature towards service-oriented sensor networks that exchange structured information by using SOAP. Recent work has shown that XML can be compressed to meet the general hardware restrictions of sensor nodes while still supporting updates. In this work we outline the vision and benefits of XML usage in wireless sensor networks, show how to evaluate XML queries in wireless sensor networks and how query results can be compressed to lower the comunication overhead. We therefore present an XPath engine on updateable compressed XML data for sensor nodes and an experimental evaluation showing that the performance of our XPath engine fulfills the requirements of today's applications even on sensor nodes.	hardware restriction;overhead (computing);requirement;soap;semantic network;sensor;service-oriented device architecture;www;xml;xpath	Nils Hoeller;Christoph Reinke;Jana Neumann;Sven Groppe;Christian Werner;Volker Linnemann	2009		10.1145/1821748.1821790	xml encryption;wireless sensor network;data management;streaming xml;computer science;xml framework;soap;data mining;database;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;xml signature;mobile wireless sensor network;world wide web;efficient xml interchange;computer network;visual sensor network	DB	-40.85904932526708	47.228604052012884	165370

As data centres account for a large part of energy consumption in ICT, data centre operators strive to create opportunities to put more emphasis on reducing energy consumption. However, creating ICT Systems that are energy efficient by design remains a key challenge. In this paper, we identify and map contextual energy information about data centre operations in order to model their power related components. This contextual modelling is then mapped to deployment diagram where we introduce greenUML (gUML), an extension to UML diagrams to improve energy efficiency through energy analysis at design time. gUML will allow system architects to reason about the energy footprint of their applications at design time.	computer cooling;data center;deployment diagram;mobile device;server (computing);software deployment;unified modeling language	Nigar Jebraeil;Adel Noureddine;Joseph Doyle;Syed Islam;Rabih Bashroush	2017	2017 IEEE World Congress on Services (SERVICES)	10.1109/SERVICES.2017.19	operator (computer programming);deployment diagram;database;computer science;efficient energy use;energy consumption;software deployment;data center;unified modeling language;information and communications technology	Mobile	-44.21082707882198	49.69958224974026	165415

The enhancement of situation awareness, decision support and emergency notification systems that facilitate the safety and effectiveness of evacuation processes in a major incident is therefore of utmost importance. ICT, IoT and smart systems have gained much attention in many industries and application domains in the latest years as they can play a significant role by introducing novel systems and applications for intelligent, safe and fast evacuation of people. This work focuses on the development of a communication gateway that can support and improve emergency notification systems by providing appropriate, updated and accessible information to operators and people in affected zones in a reliable way. The presented approach uses an adaptable data model that can be applied to evacuation systems consisting of heterogeneous components, such as legacy systems, novel devices, sensors and actuators. The proposed communication gateway follows the publish/subscribe communication standard for real-time systems and is built on Data Distribution Service (DDS) of the Object Management Group (OMG). The evacuation systems are hereby transformed into interoperable, distributed, scalable, robust, and real-time IoT infrastructures.	as-interface;application domain;data distribution service;data model;decision support system;extensibility;interoperability;legacy system;mathematical optimization;notification system;programming paradigm;publish–subscribe pattern;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;robustness (computer science);scalability;smart system	Lazaros Karagiannidis;Fay Misichroni;Yannis Damigos;Athanasia Tsertou;Angelos Amditis	2016	2016 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577203	embedded system;communications protocol;quality of service;logic gate;computer science;sensor;operating system;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Embedded	-45.25438016045875	47.014939578016296	165526

Users wish to invoke services — such as controlling the lights, printing locally, gaining access to application-specific proxies, or reconfiguring the location of DNS servers — from their mobile devices. But a priori standardization of interfaces and methods for service invocation is infeasible. Thus, the challenge is to develop a new service architecture that supports heterogeneity in client devices and controlled objects while making minimal assumptions about standard interfaces and control protocols. Four capabilities are needed for a comprehensive solution to this problem: 1) allowing device mobility, 2) augmenting controllable objects to make them network-accessible, 3) building an underlying discovery architecture, and 4) mapping between exported object interfaces and client device controls. We motivate the need for these capabilities by using an example scenario to derive the design requirements for our mobile services architecture. We then present a prototype implementation of elements of the architecture and some example services using it, including controls to audio/visual equipment, extensible mapping, server autoconfiguration, location tracking, and local printer access.	auto-configuration;hoc (programming language);location-based service;mobile device;printer (computing);printing;prototype;proxy server;requirement;server (computing)	Todd D.

Therefore, access control is a core component when dealing with eHealth data and resources, discriminating which is available for a certain party. We consider that current systems that attempt to assure the share of policies between facilities are prone to system’s and network’s faults and do not assure the integrity of policies lifecycle. By approaching this problem with the use of a distributed ledger, namely a consortium blockchain, where the operations are stored as transactions, we ensure that the different facilities have knowledge about all the parties that can act over the e-Health resources while maintaining integrity, auditability, authenticity, and scalability.	access control;bitcoin;data integrity;distributed database;ecosystem;gnu nano;in-place algorithm;multimodal interaction;plausibility structure;scalability	João Pedro Dias;Luís Reis;Hugo Sereno Ferreira;Angelo Martins	2018	CoRR		access control;computer security;blockchain;computer science;permission	Security	-46.75146030457329	59.520528007903664	165695
671bddbfb96c43c38d1c1789ea02b04639c53bec	anonymous surveillance	video surveillance;data encapsulation;data privacy;security of data	Video surveillance is a very effective tool of surveillance that enables a single security agent to monitor wide areas. However, it compromises the privacy of the individuals. There have been attempts to obfuscate face and silhouette regions of the images to hide the identity of individuals. We recognize that in traditional surveillance systems, the viewer generally has sufficient contextual knowledge about location of the camera, time, and activity patterns; which can lead to identity leakage even when the visual cues (face and appearance) are not present. In this way, the viewer can relate the identity of individuals to the sensitive information in the video causing privacy loss. In order to provide robust privacy preservation, the context knowledge needs to be decoupled from the video; however, human monitoring of the videos is also necessary for the assessment of the situation. In this paper we propose anonymous surveillance framework that decouples the contextual knowledge and video to the minimal extent required for situation assessment. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework is very effective in protecting the privacy, yet does not affect much of the surveillance utility of the data.	information sensitivity;privacy;spectral leakage	Mukesh Kumar Saini;Pradeep K.

Since it uses the spectator cell phone to identify the person, this research proposes an extension of the interactive TV interface to the user's cell phone as well. The research explore two new approaches related to how TV is watched, using a Bluetooth cell phone and a Bluetooth set-top box connected to an digital TV network with return channel. The first approach is related to user's behavior analysis and program recommendation. Supposing that every viewer has Bluetooth cell phone, each cell phone will identify every spectator to the set-top box wirelessly. The set-top box will inform the TV service provider the list of people who are in front of TV in real-time. Based on the history of programs watched by these people, it will be identified their profile and preferences. The second approach is the use of cell phone as a smart remote control and as an extension of the TV. The cell phone connected to the set-top box can be used by the interactive TV programs to show messages to the viewer or execute interactive applications.	bluetooth;mobile phone;real-time transcription;recommender system;remote control;return channel;set-top box	Aislan Gomide Foina	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications	10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912812	radio-frequency identification;embedded system;digital television;telecommunications;behavioural sciences;computer science;operating system;multimedia;interactive television;world wide web;recommender system;computer network	Visualization	-39.387688294515215	54.54519019478643	165853

Major corporations such as Google and Microsoft started projects to present electric energy consumption data to residents via Web applications. Notwithstanding the two corporations' backing, these two efforts have not received the expected level of interest, and are thus being discontinued. We argue that electric energy consumption data become useful only if they are presented along related data (e.g., the residents' locations) which can provide the context in which consumption occurred. This is expected to help the residents change their consumption behavior, and thus have a positive impact on the electricity generation and distribution network as well. In this paper, we present Energy-Efficient Home (E2Home), a Web-based application for the interactive visualization of electricity consumption data and contextual information. Built on top of our FuseViz framework, the E2Home application fuses (i) residents' locations from Android smartphones and (ii) electric energy consumption from the electric utility Web page into a joint data stream using MapReduce. The joint data stream is then visualized on SVG-based interactive time charts and maps on a Web page, so that the user can explore them using well-established techniques such as brush-and-linking and panning and zooming to acquire actionable information to reduce electricity consumption. Based on our experiments in a real home, the improvement on energy efficiency brought about by E2Home is expected to exceed 10%.	android;chart;experiment;information visualization;interactive media;interactive visualization;map;mapreduce;scalable vector graphics;smart meter;smartphone;usage analysis;usage data;web application;web page	Giacomo Ghidini;Sajal K.

In order to allow fast and efficient development, deployment, and management of such services, a global system that allows the services to gain access to the context information needs to be created, maintained, and managed. We study the requirements for such a context distribution system. We deal with the architectural decisions regarding the definition of context items and the way context information becomes available to the CASs, and also the algorithmic aspects of disseminating this information. We demonstrate the advantages of the architecture and the proposed information dissemination algorithms by conducting a simulation study under realistic practical assumptions. Our results indicate that a modular approach in which context information is provided in many network locations by brokers through an open simple API is both powerful enough to provide the needed context information, and simple enough to be easily implemented.	algorithm;application programming interface;high availability;information needs;personal digital assistant;requirement;simulation;software deployment	Rami Cohen;Danny Raz	2004	2004 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium (IEEE Cat.

Thus, ubiquitous healthcare environment incorporate Trust Management systems or services for enabling the creation of confident and secure background required for the provision of healthcare services. In this paper the concept of personalized Trust Management service is introduced. However, since this approach makes the service vulnerable to user's subjectivity in this paper is proposed a mechanism that determines the proper in case personalization factor. Especially, it quantifies the Quality of trust Information that user has acquired from past interactions and determines if he/she is capable to discover and select healthcare providers. The introduced mechanism is deployed on a Fuzzy Interference System and its performance was evaluated through simulations in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.	interaction;interference (communication);matlab;management system;personalization;preprocessor;serial ata;simulation;simulink;trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Georgia N.

While many tools focus on the development of pervasive services by masking the complex technical side of a pervasive computing environment, the deployment of an application as a whole -- i.e. a set of services and user interfaces -- is often forgotten. We present an alternative design strategy and tool for pervasive applications in which pervasiveness is not considered a handicap, but rather as a situation that draws extra attention to the deployment of applications. By crafting pervasive applications and their services as independent context consumers and producers, we illustrate how the behaviour of a pervasive application deployed using our approach can be observed while it executes.	android;computational trust;desktop computer;hoc (programming language);microsoft windows;mobile phone;news aggregator;pervasive informatics;privacy;prototype;run time (program lifecycle phase);sensor;set-top box;software deployment;ubiquitous computing;user interface;while;windows mobile	Geert Vanderhulst;Kris Luyten;Karin Coninx	2010	2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Environments	10.1109/IE.2010.42	context-aware pervasive systems;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-39.723833977196996	50.30700109794486	166402

However, the current smart phone applications do not consider the circumstance or context in which the user is placed on, thus mainly the general services are being provided. In order to get the service proper for their place and situation when using the current applications, the users are required to enter their context information directly. Currently, there is almost no context-aware service platform which takes into account specific situation of users or if exiting, they are in beginning stage. To provide the context-aware services to the users, we have to identify the correct location of the user and also why and for purpose the place was chosen. Accordingly, the correct identification of the user's location is the essential technology to provide the context-aware services to the users. In this paper, we construct the location reasoning ontology using the smart phone sensors, user's application execution logs and keyword search logs, we also proposed the location reasoning method based on the constructed ontology.	context-aware network;mobile app;search algorithm;sensor;smartphone	Sang-Il Kim;Hwa-Sung Kim	2015	2015 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2015.7057957	estimation;cognition;global positioning system;computer science;ontology;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;statistics;intelligent sensor	HCI	-40.33554553342638	50.26756263199628	166442

aa03fa3811b93e73aafb5b44510aa30e96704482	low-power portable devices for metagenomics analysis: fog computing makes bioinformatics ready for the internet of things		Abstract Portable sequencing machines, such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION, are making the genome sequencing ubiquitous. This can be particularly interesting for identifying specific bacteria in air-filters or waters and for monitoring the microbioma composition in cultivated soils or in different animal samples, using a simple and portable approach. However, a main problem of these portable sequencing devices is that they stream huge amounts of data, which management can be actually challenging. Low-power System-on-Chip architectures represent a feasible way for designing a solution, based on the Fog computing paradigm, for processing locally the raw data, considering both the base calling step and the genome alignment part, and for sending only meaningful results over Internet. Cloud services can be then used to collect and integrate results in a Internet of Things framework, in order to trigger notifications or alarms and, in perspective, for more sophisticated applications based on statistical or machine learning approaches.	bioinformatics;fog computing;internet of things;metagenomics;mobile device	Ivan Merelli;Lucia Morganti;Elena Corni;Carmelo Pellegrino;Daniele Cesini;Luca Roverelli;Gabriele Zereik;Daniele D'Agostino	2018	Future Generation Comp.

The connected things are able to exchange data including their identities, physical properties and information gathered from the environment. Hence they actively participate in decision making. The identification technologies like RFID have empowered the concept of Internet of Things by enabling the unique identification of things. The cloud computing technology has made the tasks of processing huge amount of data produced by the devices easier. But in order to make the system scalable, it must be able to handle the devices that are growing day by day. Hence there is a need of proper identity management. This paper discusses requirement of identity management and then presents a framework for identity management for Cloud based Internet of Things.	cloud computing;identity management;internet of things;radio-frequency identification;scalability	Susmita Horrow;Anjali Sardana	2012		10.1145/2490428.2490456	web of things;cloud computing;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;identity management	Security	-43.6520500711347	49.52714288372941	167387

With the emergence of cloud computing and web technologies, electronic displays can be connected directly to cloud services from which they retrieve both configuration commands and HTML5 content. Cloud-based management makes it easy to update the displays, and the use of standard web languages enables rapid development of new dynamic applications. However, the remote management aspects and scalability from small personal deployments upwards have received limited attention in the literature. To this regard, our major contributions are the collection of requirements from actual digital signage deployments and the design of a system that encompasses all the different phases involved in the related lifecycle. We specifically design, implement and evaluate a flexible and user-friendly digital signage management system.	authorization;cloud computing;credential;digital signage;display device;emergence;html5;requirement;role-based access control;scalability;software deployment;usability	Mohit Sethi;Maria Lijding;Mario Di Francesco;Tuomas Aura	2015	2015 IEEE 12th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2015 IEEE 12th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2015 IEEE 15th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops (UIC-ATC-ScalCom)	10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP.2015.52	embedded system;simulation;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Visualization	-38.58225894260884	52.57606490998398	167390

Suppose a transaction T1 writes an object o2 after reading an object o1 and then another transaction T2 reads the object o2 and writes an object o3. Here, data in the object o1 might flow into o3 via o2. Unless T2 is granted a read access right of the object o1, illegal information flow occur. In order to prevent the illegal information flow, T1 marks the object o2 with the purpose of T1. T2 cannot read o2 unless the purpose of T2 includes a read right of o1. In result, the throughput is degraded. Objects whose information may flow into an object o are source objects of o.  An object is timed out if it takes some time units after the object is lastly written. While there occur no illegal information flow in our purpose marking (PM)protocol, transactions which imply illegal information flow are aborted.

3a5dfd141f3db4758f00c71a9cf3b11c636bf045	wireless sensor network architecture based on fog computing		Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been a focus for research in the last years due to the promising technology it embeds. This appears to be the most sustainable technology for environmental sensing whether it's about limited or large-scale monitoring, thanks to the ad-hoc wireless links, scalability and ease of implementation. However, main drawbacks are stemming from the limited capacity of network nodes for data storage, computing and accessing. To overcome these limitations, virtualized resources were appended allowing access to increased storage, processing and user-friendly accessibility. This came as a natural development of the common WSN architectures in the trend of modern concepts emerged with the IoT (Internet of Things) technologies proliferation. Despite the increasing usage of cloud-based WSN monitoring systems, there are still issues due to the drawbacks of cloud computing such as latency and storage costs. This paper discusses the improvements made to a cloud-based WSN architecture by adding a layer of computing at the edge of the network, a method that follows the novel model of analysing and acting on IoT data, entitled Fog Computing. Comparative analytics were performed to prove the improvements achieved through edge of the network computing.	accessibility;cloud computing;computer data storage;fog computing;hoc (programming language);internet of things;network architecture;scalability;stemming;usability	Viorel Mihai;Cristian Dragana;Grigore Stamatescu;Dan Popescu;Loretta Ichim	2018	2018 5th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)	10.1109/CoDIT.2018.8394851	wireless sensor network;architecture;scalability;computer network;node (networking);cloud computing;edge computing;computer science;analytics;computer data storage	HPC	-43.07763941980781	48.906567914718245	167736

It offers internet users a standardized, secure, efficient and trustable environment, which allows open and distributed access to global networks, services and information. There is a need for both researchers and practitioners to develop platforms made up of adaptive Future Internet applications. In this sense, the emergence and consolidation of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), Cloud Computing and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) give benefits, such as flexibility, scalability, security, interoperability, and adaptability, for building these applications.	future internet	Javier Cubo;Juan Boubeta-Puig;Howard Foster;Winfried Lamersdorf;Nadia Gámez	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-14886-1_1	wireless sensor network;the internet;adaptability;computer network;scalability;global network;interoperability;cloud computing;computer science	Arch	-44.330698201341434	47.13879736514647	167841

This convergence relates to communication, handheld devices and applications. The most common development platforms are Android, iOS, Windows Phone and Symbian. In most cases mobile application developers restrict the development to one or two platforms, since there is not strong multi-platform execution support. For example, an iOS application will not run on Android or another system. One solution is web development, but it presents some problems such as adaptability, overload on servers, low use of device capabilities, and poor code reuse. A better solution is to develop a middleware that helps to develop open applications. This paper gives an analysis of the problems involved in the design of open mobile applications, challenges and some solutions.	android;code reuse;microsoft windows;middleware;mobile app;mobile device;server (computing);smartphone;symbian;web development;windows phone;ios	Irene Monserrat Torres Hernandez;Amilcar Meneses Viveros;Erika Hernandez Rubio	2013	CONIELECOMP 2013, 23rd International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computing	10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2013.6525772	embedded system;real-time computing;mobile search;mobile web;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;mobile device;mobile computing	Mobile	-37.44102108929533	51.92685200635957	167888

27e9de21ed5edd61c717ac7e440e6082d95d0780	domain management of ims		The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) enables converged networking through an application-agnostic architecture that is independent of the access network. The convergence aspects of IMS naturally require a convergent approach to managing the variety of possible applications of IMS. The Navis® element management framework (EMF) shares this application-agnostic architecture principle with IMS and is thus the natural enabler for the required convergent management approach. This paper will explore the development of the management solution for IMS by means of Navis EMF and high-productivity technologies such as Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE∗) Enterprise JavaBeans∗ (EJB∗), Java∗, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA∗), and Extensible Markup Language (XML) and will illustrate the application of the management solution in a variety of wireline and wireless solutions, including third-generation (3G) code division multiple access (CDMA) and Universal Mobile Telephone Service (UMTS∗) networks. The management solution for IMS is the operations maintenance center-core network (OMC-CN), which is a domain manager for network devices in the IMS network domain.	access network;common object request broker architecture;eclipse modeling framework;enterprise javabeans;ip multimedia subsystem;java platform, enterprise edition;java version history;markup language;xml	Denise M.

This study of these basic problems has been carried out in cooperation between scientists at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Linkoping Institute of Technology and FOA 3 (Forsvarets Forskningsanstalt Planeringsbyran — Research Institute of National Defense, Operations Research Center).  The situation considered is an office with individual work stations having desktop computers. These communicate among themselves and share a host computer of higher capacity including special purpose input/output equipment.  Among questions discussed are:   •   ∗ problems related to the protection of data bases   •   ∗ ease of selectively designating addressees and authorisation to access data and messages; key distribution and protection   •   ∗ general requirements for equipment needed in such a local net environment.     No attempt has been made to predict when such distributed office computer systems will become commonly available in full scale. It does, however, seem clear that they are at least technically feasible already.	distributed computing	Rolf Blom;Jan-Olof Brüer;Viiveke Fåk;S.

Now smartphones not only provide the ordinary internal processes such as dialing or receiving phone calls, sending text messages, and doing mobile banking wherever we are, but they also are beginning to control various other devices that are part of our lives. Through the smartphone using mobile applications, we can remotely control a variety of external devices such as TVs, projectors for presentations, computers, and even cars. This paper presents the design and implementation of a remote lock system using wireless communications. The remote lock system is a lock system that can be controlled remotely by a dedicated Android application. The main function of the Android smartphone is equipped with Bluetooth so that a lock can be opened and managed via the application functions. The users' lock information in real time can be stored and managed in the database via a server that a server manager builds and manages. Even though users forget the password, our proposed lock system also guides them to find it easily, and provides the user's manual. Using this system, users can do a variety of management functions such as adding, deleting, modifying, and purchasing the user's own locks.	android;bluetooth;computer;entry point;lock (computer science);mobile app;mobile banking;movie projector;password;purchasing;server (computing);smartphone	Hae-Duck Joshua Jeong;Jiyoung Lim;WooSeok Hyun;Woojin Lee	2014	2014 Eighth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/IMIS.2014.63	embedded system;computer science;information security;operating system;mobile device;bluetooth;computer security;android;computer network	Mobile	-39.03405768460745	54.22785308127636	168358

As social network activities grows explosively, social trust among mobile users based on their daily interactions has had an increasingly significant effect on behaviors and secrecy of D2D cluster communications. We modify the well-known K-means algorithm to characterize the formation of our D2D clusters by taking both physical distance and social trust among nodes into account. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed scheme over other existing schemes in terms of system secrecy contribution.

There is an opportunity for developing cross-cloud applications that can be deployed pervasively over the Internet, dynamically adapting their internal topology to their needs. In this paper we explore the main challenges for fully realizing the potential of cross-cloud applications. First, we focus on the networking dimension of these applications. We evaluate what support is needed from the infrastructure, and what are the further implications of opening the networking side. On a second part, we examine the impact of a distributed deployment for applications, assessing the implications from a management perspective, and how it affects the delivery of quality of service and non-functional requirements.	applications architecture;cloud computing;data center;functional requirement;high- and low-level;internet;non-functional requirement;quality of service;software deployment;state (computer science);tag cloud;virtual machine	Félix Cuadrado;Álvaro Navas;Juan C.

Human attention refers to a user's ability to attend to his or her primary tasks, ignoring system-generated distractions such as poor performance and failures. By exploiting plentiful computing resources to reduce user distraction, Project Aura is creating a system whose effectiveness is considerably greater than that of other systems today. Aura is specifically intended for pervasive computing environments involving wireless communication , wearable or handheld computers, and smart spaces. Human attention is an especially scarce resource in such environments, because the user is often preoccupied with walking, driving, or other real-world interactions. In addition, mobile computing poses difficult challenges such as intermittent and variable-bandwidth connectivity, concern for battery life, and the client resource constraints that weight and size considerations impose. To accomplish its ambitious goals, research in Aura spans every system level: from the hardware, through the operating system, to applications and end users. Underlying this diversity of concerns, Aura applies two broad concepts. First, it uses proactivity, which is a system layer's ability to anticipate requests from a higher layer. In today's systems , each layer merely reacts to the layer above it. Second, Aura is self-tuning: layers adapt by observing the demands made on them and adjusting their performance and resource usage characteristics accordingly. Currently, system-layer behavior is relatively static. Both of these techniques will help lower demand for human attention. To illustrate the kind of world we are trying to create, we present two hypothetical Aura scenarios. Although these might seem far-fetched today, they represent the kind of scenarios we expect to make commonplace through our research. In the first scenario, Jane is at Gate 23 in the Pitts-burgh airport, waiting for her connecting flight. She has edited many large documents and would like to use her wireless connection to email them. Unfortunately , bandwidth is miserable because many passengers at Gates 22 and 23 are surfing the Web. Aura observes that, at the current bandwidth, Jane won't be able to finish sending her documents before her flight departs.

We propose a digital neighborhood watch (DNW) in which security cameras of individual homes work together to monitor the neighborhood. DNW could augment neighborhood watch by providing digital evidence of crime, increasing visibility of neighborhood activity, and automatically sending alerts when suspicious events occur. We investigate the appeal of sharing camera data with neighbors through semi-structured interviews with 11 households. Our participants validated the potential of sharing data with neighbors, particularly to provide evidence after an incident. But they also had security and privacy concerns about divulging their cameras' field of view and giving ongoing access to neighbors. For some participants, these concerns can be alleviated by enabling sharing of processed cameras views that include only the fore-ground activity or only public property (e.g., sidewalks).	closed-circuit television;digital camera;semiconductor industry	A.

However, most Android applications are downloaded to the CPEs directly to deem the telecom network as a pipe. To enrich telecom services and fulfill all-IP network evolution, the IMS is believed to be the core of NGN. To greatly catch the trend of apps market, an innovative ICT service creation approach is proposed to integrate IMS service platform and Android apps development. In this paper, an ICT service creation platform is implemented and presented, under that Android applications can be developed to allow multiparty collaboration be initiated by simply making a call. To illustrate the use of the platform, an Android online game is also developed. Based on the proposed service creation approach, a new ICT service model is revealed and the telecom operators can much more benefit from the Android application development.	android;application programming interface;constant phase element;download;emoticon;ip multimedia subsystem;information management system (ims);next-generation network;open api;openness;software development kit;ios	Chung-Shih Tang;Yi-Kai Chiang;Chin-Yuen Twu;Ying-Dian Tsou;Gong-Da Fan	2011	2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6076956	games;simulation;computer science;operating system;multimedia;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;android;collaboration	Mobile	-37.40033356067281	51.579521666764904	169053

This new scenario, often referred as Internet of Things (IoT), gives raise to different issues and challenges to be coped with. Indeed, each kind of physical device comes with different technology details, low level communication protocols and can exhibit different semantic behaviors. In addition, the interaction between human beings and the physical objects must be properly managed. Two main approaches exist to cope with the mentioned issues: (i) the development of new ad-hoc technologies and solutions to deal with the specific issues raising from the new scenario, or (ii) the exploitation of well-known technologies and solutions also in the new context so as to facilitate the integration of the physical stuff with the preexisting internet services. The latter approach is usually referred as Web of Things (WoT). This paper proposes a possible implementation of the WoT vision. The resulting architecture allows creating complex applications where physical resources, internet resources and human resources can properly interact with each other. The objects of the physical world are virtualized and managed through the Smart Object (SO) concept. The SOs are enclosed in a Smart Gateway which exposes them to the world through an uniform web API based on REST paradigm. The human beings interaction is achieved using the popular micro-blogging platform Twitter. The integration between all the entities is provided by adopting a WS-BPEL workflow technology. To validate the approach an example of a smart room environment controlled through Twitter in a crowd source fashion is detailed.	application programming interface;blog;business process execution language;computer science;crowdsourcing;embedded system;entity;hardware virtualization;hoc (programming language);internet of things;internet protocol suite;peripheral;programming paradigm;smart objects;web api;web of things	Andrea Giordano;Giandomenico Spezzano;Harry Sunarsa;Andrea Vinci	2015	2015 IEEE 19th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)	10.1109/CSCWD.2015.7230985	web of things;knowledge management;operating system;database;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;internet of things	Robotics	-43.30274128556142	47.60261089767528	169140

The goal of the system is to furnish user interfaces that are able to migrate across different devices, in such a way as to support task continuity for the mobile user. This is obtained through a number of transformations that exploit logical descriptions of the user interfaces to be handled. The migration environment supports the automatic discovery of client devices and its architecture is based on the composition of a number of software services required to perform a migration request.	ajax (programming);interaction;scott continuity;user interface	Fabio Paternò;Carmen Santoro;Antonio Scorcia	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-85992-5_28	user interface design;user;user modeling;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;mobile device;multimedia;mobile station;natural user interface;user interface;world wide web	HCI	-37.694538712991374	48.92922371242506	169340

Each of these smart objects only offers a very limited amount of computational power since it is only specialized in a limited set of tasks. In order to achieve complex goals, the devices have to interact with each other. Therefore, they do not only need to be interconnected either by wire or through wireless technology but also need a set of common protocols to enable vendor-independent communication. In the past years, various protocols pursuing this objective have emerged. One of the most promising approaches is the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) because it offers high interoperability and very low communication overhead at the same time. Typical IoT applications include the observation and manipulation of their environment through sensors and actuators. Since the physical world is continuous in time and does not wait for calculations to finish, it is essential that the execution times of the applications stay within certain boundaries. These timing constraints are referred to as real-time requirements. However, current protocol implementations do not consider real-time requirements for IoT applications. In this paper, we introduce the jCoAP communication stack as a lightweight Java implementation of CoAP. We give a brief introduction to real-time communication and CoAP and provide insight in the design concept of jCoAP and the offered functionalities. Furthermore, a performance evaluation is done in order to point out the suitability of the jCoAP framework for real-time IoT applications.	as-interface;computation;constrained application protocol;embedded system;internet of things;interoperability;lightweight java;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;real-time clock;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;requirement;sensor;smart device;smart objects;test case	Björn Konieczek;Michael Rethfeldt;Frank Golatowski;Dirk Timmermann	2015	2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Real-Time Distributed Computing	10.1109/ISORC.2015.35	embedded system;communications protocol;interoperability;payload;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;internet of things;server	Embedded	-38.06621196564923	46.97033960764321	169770
4007e9b4d92fc2ce71815ef94fce13fca07d5363	towards a cloud-assisted and agent-oriented architecture for the internet of things		In the Internet of Things (IoT), all things (e.g. sensors, actuators, smart devices, smart objects, RFID, embedded computers, robots) have their identities, physical attributes, and interfaces. They will be seamlessly integrated into the information network such that they will become active participants in business, information and social processes wherever and whenever needed and proper. The technical realization of this vision is a complex challenge as distributed heterogeneous IoT components at different levels of abstractions need to cooperate among themselves, with conventional networked IT infrastructures, and also with human users. To cope with this issue, we propose the synergic exploitation of two complementary mainstream paradigms for large-scale distributed computing: the agent-oriented and the cloud computing paradigms. While the former can support the development of decentralized, dynamic, cooperating and open IoT systems in terms of multi-agent systems, the latter can empower the IoT objects with more computing and memory resources and effectively support system-wide higher-level mechanisms and policies. In this paper, we introduce a cloud-assisted and agent-oriented vision for IoT based on layered reference architecture. Finally, we briefly overview our agent-oriented middleware for cooperating smart objects and a sensor-cloud infrastructure that represent the basic building blocks for technically achieving such vision.	cloud computing;computer;distributed computing;embedded system;internet of things;middleware;multi-agent system;radio-frequency identification;reference architecture;robot;sensor;smart device;smart objects;synergy	Giancarlo Fortino;Wilma Russo	2013			the internet;cloud computing;architecture;reference architecture;abstraction;web of things;smart objects;middleware;distributed computing;computer science	AI	-42.9360423365118	46.5810772633447	169915

Traditionally, access control has dealt only with authorization decisions on a subject’s access to target resources. Obligations are requirements that have to be fulfilled by the subject for allowing access. Conditions are subject and object-independent environmental requirements that have to be satisfied for access. In today’s highly dynamic, distributed environment, obligations and conditions are also crucial decision factors for richer and finer controls on usage of digital resources. Traditional authorization decisions are generally made at the time of request but typically do not recognize ongoing controls for relatively long-lived access or for immediate revocation. Moreover, mutability issues that deal with updates on related subject or object attributes as a consequence of access have not been systematically studied. In this paper we motivate the need for usage control, define a family of ABC models as a core model for usage control and show how it encompasses traditional access control, such as mandatory, discretionary and role-based access control, and more recent requirements such as trust management, and digital rights management. In addition, we also discuss architectures that introduce a new reference monitor for usage control and some variations.	authorization;digital rights management;discretionary access control;immutable object;next-generation access;reference monitor;requirement;role-based access control;scott continuity;trust management (information system)	Ravi S.

The Extensible Authentication Protocol GSS-API mechanism allows an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) peer to provide authorization attributes alongside an authentication response. It also supplies mechanisms to process Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) messages provided in the AAA response.

3255af7f810f4d9c208d7d5d48b90083dec60333	a context-aware healthcare architecture for the elderly		In order to provide dependable healthcare services for the elderly, it is necessary to have a patient-centric system in which service automation dominates through the use of context-awareness. Healthcare service automation has the virtues to overcome the disadvantages arising from the disabilities that are inherent in the elderly population, physically challenged, and those who live in remote areas. In order that patients trust the healthcare services provided by the system, the creation of healthcare services must be founded on accurate model of patients, and must be delivered by experts through dependable medical devices and secure channels. Motivated by this goal, we propose a healthcare architecture based on a generic Context Awareness Framework (CAF) adapted to the elderly. The automation aspects of healthcare services based on this architecture are discussed.	communications security;context awareness;dependability;living systems;privacy policy;prototype;sap composite application framework;vulnerability (computing)	Tolulope Peter Oyekanmi;Nhat Nguyen;Vangalur S.

The more powerful these devices get, the more likely it is that they will generate and share content locally, through ad hoc opportunistic connectivity, leading to the presence of distributed information sources and forwarders and the diminishing role of centralized, infrastructure-based servers. Despite this interesting portrait, the mobile and volatile nature of this network presents severe challenges demanding new networking techniques able to cope with the unpredictable and resource-constrained nature of mobile entities comprising it. In this context, we discuss novel data gathering and dissemination strategies in urban scenarios which do not rely on strict infrastructure mediation. While preserving the general aspects of our study and without loss of generality, we focus our attention toward practical applicative case studies which help us capture the characteristics of ad hoc opportunistic communication networks, and devise efficient solutions for use in real applicative contexts.	applicative programming language;centralized computing;entity;handheld game console;hoc (programming language);internet;programming paradigm;synergy;telecommunications network;wearable technology	Claudio E.

Cooperative information systems are autonomous and heterogeneous systems, distributed geographically, but interconnected. Web Services provides a set of interoperable standards that can be used to connect distributed applications. On this environment, security is a critical issue, and an attack can expose systems services without authentication. An end-to-end connection, like the ones involved in such systems, usually requires that an authentication can be shared between different information systems. Web Services security model is not yet fully defined and a lot of proposals are emerging, delaying the adoption of this technology in many situations. In this paper we present multiplatform authentication control system based on an extension of SRP protocol, using SAML. Within this solution, authentication control can be leveraged, even with weak passwords and an authentication assertion can be exchanged with different cooperative information systems.	assertion (software development);authentication;autonomous robot;control system;distributed computing;end-to-end principle;information system;interoperability;password strength;scsi rdma protocol;security assertion markup language;ws-security;web service	Flávio Oliveira Silva;João A.

As the realization of IoT concept is still in its early stages, manufacturers of Internet-connected devices and IoT web service providers are defining their proprietary protocols based on their targeted applications. Consequently, IoT becomes heterogeneous in terms of hardware capabilities and communication protocols. Addressing these heterogeneities by following open standards is a necessary step to communicate with various IoT devices. In this research, we assess the feasibility of applying existing open standards on resource-constrained IoT devices. The standard protocols developed in this research are OGC PUCK over Bluetooth, TinySOS, SOS over CoAP, and OGC SensorThings API. We believe that by hosting open standard protocols on IoT devices, not only do the devices become self-describable, self-contained, and interoperable, but innovative applications can also be easily developed with standardized interfaces. In addition, we use memory consumption, request message size, response message size, and response latency to benchmark the efficiency of the implemented protocols. In all, this research presents and evaluates standard-based solutions to better understand the feasibility of applying existing standards to the IoT vision.	actuator device component;advance directive - proxy;apple sos;application program interface;application programming interface;benchmark (computing);bluetooth;categorization;choose (action);component-based software engineering;computational resource;constrained application protocol;contain (action);data (computing);deploy;embedded system;embedding;experiment;genetic heterogeneity;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;handling (psychology);interface device component;internet access;internet of things;internet protocol suite;interoperability;netduino;pressure sensor device component;processor register;protocol stack;protocols documentation;puck;random-access memory;read-only memory;real-time transcription;slc25a11 gene;sensorthings api;software deployment;solutions;spectral efficiency;stage level 2;transceiver device component;upload;web service;while;xml;cyclophosphamide/cytarabine/prednisone/vincristine protocol;registration - actclass;sensor (device);standards characteristics	Mohammad Ali Jazayeri;Steve H.

We propose an approach to address risks in work environments through trusted web services widespread on the various devices which monitor and control the safety status of the environment. We integrate the notion of risks in an environment with trust, such that one drives the other providing feedback for dynamic alerts based on the environment's constraints. A trusted cooperation protocol for services is outlined so that services can interact along wireless lines or service grids. We outline the technological features of a service system, which collects data from sensors and implements safety control technologies in work areas.	first-class function;pervasive informatics;prototype;risk management;run time (program lifecycle phase);sensor;trust management (information system);web service	Maria Grazia Fugini;George C.

In existing centrally managed solutions, the results of location-based search are often incomplete or outdated. Additional information about the searched object (e.g. the menu, facilities, prices) is usually not available, as such a huge amount of data and frequent updates (e.g. the number of free places in restaurant) would overload the server.	exploit (computer security);location-based service;overlay network;peer-to-peer;personalization;server (computing)	Aleksandra Kovacevic	2009		10.1145/1874413.1874415	computer science;location-based service;database;services computing;internet privacy;world wide web;search engine;computer network	DB	-38.77206325623625	59.905838634049225	171459
4201880e1bce3cd704f249af1d81e23da30ad9a5	implementation and evaluation of a sleep-proxy for energy savings in networked computers		In enterprise networks, idle desktop machines rarely sleep, because users and IT departments want them to be always accessible. While some solutions have been proposed, few of them have been implemented even more evaluated in real network environments. In this paper, we implement and evaluate a sleep proxy system, based on existing proposed architecture for this Proxy. This system is tested in 6 different PC machines of a real network. The results of the experiments show that machines can sleep almost 55% of the experimenting time (which is translated into energy savings) while maintaining their network accessibility to user satisfaction. However, there is a need of “cooperation” between IT procedures and sleep proxy system in order to gain better performance and thus less dissipated energy.	accessibility;bonjour sleep proxy;desktop computer;experiment	Enida Sheme;Neki Frasheri;Marin Aranitasi	2012			real-time computing;architecture;simulation;idle;computer science	OS	-35.2148549771166	52.9469772098251	171559

While many programmers are familiar with creating traditional desktop applications, they are not familiar with the challenges of the wireless mobile domain. Instead of having keyboards, mice, and high-resolution screens, the mobile application designer is constantly reminded that the handheld, mobile application is a very different (not deprived) input/output device. In the following paper, we describe our attempt to use these devices in creating a wireless corporate information application. The paper can be broken into several key efforts. First, we examine the hardware/networking requirements of the problem. Second, we examine our development environment for application coding and testing.

The label type and label access policy can be defined according to the requirements of applications. In order to preserve the integrity of data in XML databases, a constraint between a read access rule and a write access rule in label access policy is introduced. Rules for label assignment and propagation are proposed to alleviate the workload of label assignment. Also, a solution for resolving conflicts of label assignments is proposed.

Security is a principal concern in offering an infrastructure for the formation of general-purpose computational grids. A number of grid implementations have been devised to deal with the security concerns by authenticating the users, hosts and their interactions in an appropriate fashion. Resource management systems that are sophisticated and secured are inevitable for the efficient and beneficial deployment of grid computing services. The chief factors that can be problematic in the secured selection of grid resources are the wide range of selection and the high degree of strangeness. Moreover, the lack of a higher degree of confidence relationship is likely to prevent efficient resource allocation and utilisation. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for the secured selection of grid resources, so as to achieve secure execution of the jobs. This approach utilises trust and reputation for securely selecting the grid resources. To start with, the self-protection capability and reputation weightage of all the entities are computed, and based on those values, the trust factor (TF) of all the entities are determined. The reputation weightage of an entity is the measure of both the user's feedback and other entities' feedback. Those entities with higher TF values are selected for the secured execution of jobs. To make the proposed approach more comprehensive, a novel method is employed for evaluating the user's feedback on the basis of the existing feedbacks available regarding the entities. This approach is proved to be scalable for an increased number of user jobs and grid entities. The experimentation portrays that this approach offers desirable efficiency in the secured …	authentication;computation;distributed computing;emergence;entity;feedback;general-purpose markup language;grid computing;interaction;job stream;numerical analysis;primary source;reputation;scalability;software deployment;trust (emotion)	V.

We investigate how piecewise consideration of wired and wireless elements of the framework architecture benefits service advertisement and discovery and network-awareness techniques. We also discuss scalability of the NAS framework with respect to platform computing capabilities. The framework is suitable for a wide range of computing devices, from powerful ones with multi-tasking operating systems (OS) to small ones with lightweight OS. Case studies applying the NAS framework to sensor monitoring in home networks and data streaming in pervasive multimedia computing are presented. The analytical results on the performance of the NAS framework in these case studies show that it has significant advantages over traditional network-awareness frameworks in terms of reducing wireless bandwidth consumption and saving battery energy of mobile devices.	computer multitasking;lightweight kernel operating system;mobile device;scalability;ubiquitous computing	Liang Cheng;Ivan Marsic	2002	MONET	10.1023/A:1015459227426	embedded system;real-time computing;context-aware pervasive systems;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-38.136634683334826	46.43472718543869	172011

The key enablers are the smart phones (e.g., iPhones and Android phones) equipped with onboard sensors (e.g., cameras, accelerometer, compass, GPS), and various wireless devices (e.g., WiFi and 2/3G). The goal of this paper is to design a scalable sensor networking platform where millions of users on the move can participate in urban sensing and share location-aware information using always-on cellular data connections. We propose a two-tier sensor networking platform called GeoServ where mobile users publish/access sensor data via an Internet-based distributed P2P overlay network. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold: a location-aware sensor data retrieval scheme that supports geographic range queries, and a location-aware publish-subscribe scheme that enables efficient multicast routing over a group of subscribed users. We prove that GeoServ protocols preserve locality and validate their performance via extensive simulations.	android;data retrieval;global positioning system;high availability;locality of reference;location awareness;mobile device;multicast;multitier architecture;overlay network;peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;publish–subscribe pattern;range query (data structures);routing;scalability;sensor;simulation;smartphone	Jong Hoon Ahnn;Uichin Lee;Hyun Jin Moon	2011	2011 11th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing	10.1109/CCGrid.2011.10	the internet;overlay network;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;peer-to-peer;database;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;publish–subscribe pattern;data acquisition;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	-41.176653482917146	50.48790659301159	172218

While its greatest commercial impact has een in the area of consumer electronics, with the smartphone evolution and the uptake of wearables, connecting humans is only art of a greater trend toward the interconnection of the physical orld with the digital world. While the Internet is a communication network connecting eople to information, the Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconected ecosystem of uniquely addressable physical objects with arying degrees of sensing, processing, and actuation capabilities, haring the ability to communicate and interoperate through the nternet as their common denominator [1] . With the IoT paradigm, sensor-equipped devices can provide ne-grained information about the physical world, allowing cloudased resources to extract value from such information and posibly make decisions to be implemented by actuator-equipped deices, blurring the line between the IoT and the broader concept of yber-Physical Systems [2–4] , which does not necessarily presupose Internet connectivity per se. The vagueness of the term “Things”makes it hard to define the ver expanding boundaries of the IoT, but at the same time offers clear idea of its heterogeneity and its virtually limitless applicaion potential. This has spawned very encouraging projections from arket analysts and corporate players who envision a multi-trillion ollar market for the IoT. As commercial success materializes, the IoT continues to offer a eemingly boundless supply of opportunities for both business and esearch. This special issue of Computer Communications is dediated to the latter, offering a varied collection of research contriutions to cutting-edge themes within the IoT space. This special ssue complements [5] , which focused on architectures, protocols, nd services.	ecosystem;interconnection;internet of things;interoperability;programming paradigm;smartphone;telecommunications network;vagueness;ver (command);wearable computer	Eleonora Borgia;Danielo G.

In the MOWAHS transaction system, mobile transactions can exchange data in a mobile sharing space, called export-import repository, in both synchronous and asynchronous manner. The database consistency in the mobile affiliation is ensured by export and import transactions. We show that our mobile affiliation model has superior power for supporting mobile transactions by taking into account the disconnection of wireless networks, the limitation of computing power of mobile devices, and the mobility of computing hosts.	acid;blocking (computing);database server;distributed transaction;mobile device;schedule (computer science);stationary process	Hien Nam Le;Mads Nygård	2005	16th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA'05)	10.1109/DEXA.2005.136	radio access network;mobile identification number;mobile search;mobile web;imt advanced;transaction processing;public land mobile network;wireless application protocol;gsm services;distributed transaction;mobile database;computer science;operating system;wireless network;mobile technology;mobile agent;mobile device;database;distributed computing;mobile station;mobile computing;wireless;computer network;mobile payment	Mobile	-35.09646234785229	48.63654700333907	172575

4ebe67f1cd924d1f73dea6452ff3ee2b939d8c37	do you feel what i hear? enabling autonomous iot device pairing using different sensor types		Context-based pairing solutions increase the usability of IoT device pairing by eliminating any human involvement in the pairing process. This is possible by utilizing on-board sensors (with same sensing modalities) to capture a common physical context (e.g., ambient sound via each device's microphone). However, in a smart home scenario, it is impractical to assume that all devices will share a common sensing modality. For example, a motion detector is only equipped with an infrared sensor while Amazon Echo only has microphones. In this paper, we develop a new context-based pairing mechanism called Perceptio that uses time as the common factor across differing sensor types. By focusing on the event timing, rather than the specific event sensor data, Perceptio creates event fingerprints that can be matched across a variety of IoT devices. We propose Perceptio based on the idea that devices co-located within a physically secure boundary (e.g., single family house) can observe more events in common over time, as opposed to devices outside. Devices make use of the observed contextual information to provide entropy for Perceptio's pairing protocol. We design and implement Perceptio, and evaluate its effectiveness as an autonomous secure pairing solution. Our implementation demonstrates the ability to sufficiently distinguish between legitimate devices (placed within the boundary) and attacker devices (placed outside) by imposing a threshold on fingerprint similarity. Perceptio demonstrates an average fingerprint similarity of 94.9% between legitimate devices while even a hypothetical impossibly well-performing attacker yields only 68.9% between itself and a valid device.	autonomous robot;fingerprint;home automation;microphone;modality (human–computer interaction);motion detector;on-board data handling;sensor;usability	Jun Han;Albert Jin Chung;Manal Kumar Sinha;Madhumitha Harishankar;Shijia Pan;Hae Young Noh;Pei Zhang;Patrick Tague	2018	2018 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)	10.1109/SP.2018.00041	physical context;computer science;computer security;home automation;human–computer interaction;microphone;fingerprint;usability;motion detector;internet of things;pairing	Security	-39.621947840506024	58.344594622304115	173138

Most mobile devices today are equipped with powerful processors, various sensors, large memories, and fast wireless communication modules, etc. Due to the integration of these sophisticated components, mobile devices have become one kind of the important tools to sense, communicate, and compute data. For instance, smartphones can be used to collect video/image data (with cameras), acoustic data (with microphone), location information (with GPS), and other useful contextual information (with a gyroscope and accelerometers), etc. They can also transmit data via cellular networks, WiFi, and bluetooth, etc. According to the forecasts from Canalys, worldwide mobile device shipments, including notebooks, tablets, smart phones, etc., will exceed 2.6 billion units by 2016. Those powerful mobile devices not only make the crowdsourcing tasks easier to be taken by the crowd, but also enrich the diversity of crowdsourcing tasks.	acoustic cryptanalysis;bluetooth;central processing unit;crowdsourcing;global positioning system;gyroscope;microphone;mobile device;outsourcing;sensor;smartphone;undefined behavior	Xuemin Shen	2015	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2015.7113217	mobile identification number;mobile search;mobile web;mobile telephony;crowdsourcing software development;telecommunications;mobile database;computer science;sensor;operating system;mobile technology;internet privacy;mobile station;mobile computing;privacy;world wide web;computer security;crowdsourcing;computer network;mobile payment	Mobile	-40.03090676643436	54.115403424228084	173543

For example, the commodity mobile devices contain a wide variety of sensors such as GPS, accelerometers, and other kinds of data. Many other kinds of technology such as RFID-enabled sensors also produce large volumes of data over time. This has lead to a need for principled methods for efficient sensor data processing. This chapter will provide an overview of the challenges of sensor data analytics and the different areas of research in this context.

We previously presented a generalized access control model that makes significant use of contextual information in policy definition. This document provides a concrete realization of such a model by presenting a system-level service architecture, as well as early implementation experience with the framework. Through our context-aware security services, our system architecture offers enhanced authentication services, more flexible access control and a security subsystem that can adapt itself based on current conditions in the environment.

(middleware pour l'internet des objets intelligents)		The Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized by a wide penetration in the regular user’s life through an increasing number of Things embedding sensing, actuating, processing, and communication capacities. A considerable portion of those Things will be mobile Things, which come with several advantages yet lead to unprecedented challenges. The most critical challenges, that are directly inherited from, yet amplify, today’s Internet issues, lie in handling the large scale of users and mobile Things, providing interoperability across the heterogeneous Things, and overcoming the unknown dynamic nature of the environment, due to the mobility of an ultra-large number of Things. This thesis addresses the aforementioned challenges by revisiting the commonly employed Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) which allows the functionalities of sensors/actuators embedded in Things to be provided as services, while ensuring loose-coupling between those services and their hosts, thus abstracting their heterogeneous nature. In spite of its benefits, SOA has not been designed to address the ultra-large scale of the mobile IoT. Consequently, our main contribution lies in conceiving a Thing-based Service-Oriented Architecture, that revisits SOA interactions and functionalities, service discovery and composition in particular. We concretize the novel architecture within MobIoT, a middleware solution that is specifically designed to manage and control the ultra-large number of mobile Things in partaking in IoT-related tasks. To assess the validity of our proposed architecture, we provide a prototype implementation of MobIoT and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments that demonstrate the correctness, viability, and scalability of our solution.

Centralized access control determination fails to work in unstructured networks, as the information necessary for pre-configuration is not available. This situation is exacerbated by the dynamic nature of the environment's membership, so that the time and resources expended in off-line management are largely wasted. This paper presents a decentralized access control system that implements sociological trust constructs in a quantitative system to evaluate potential associates for collaborative interaction. A distributed, node-centric approach to trust management processes behavior grades into a reputation that nodes use to determine trustworthiness their peers before establishing associations. The application of a reputation against a dynamic risk assessment gives a measure of expectation of a peer's behavior, based on past performance and current the network environment.

Reputation systems are one possibility to support individuals in distinguishing trustworthy partners from malicious and unreliable parties. In this paper, we discuss possibilities and limitations of different types of reputation systems and their underlying trust models. We address in especially the properties of trust relations, the quantification and representation of trust values as well as reasoning and computation with trust.	algorithm;approximation;computation;distrust;entity;existential quantification;information;malware;microsoft outlook for mac;personal network;reputation system;sybil attack;trust (emotion);vertex-transitive graph	Andreas Gutscher;Jessica Heesen;Oliver Siemoneit	2008			trustworthiness;computation;business;reputation;knowledge management	ECom	-43.5711781015203	57.271955216550865	174202

At the core of WS technology lie a number of XML-based standards, such as the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), that have successfully ensured WS extensibility, transparency, and interoperability. Nonetheless, there is an increasing demand to enhance WS performance, which is severely impaired by XML's verbosity. SOAP communications produce considerable network traffic, making them unfit for distributed, loosely coupled, and heterogeneous computing environments such as the open Internet. Also, they introduce higher latency and processing delays than other technologies, like Java RMI and CORBA. WS research has recently focused on SOAP performance enhancement. Many approaches build on the observation that SOAP message exchange usually involves highly similar messages (those created by the same implementation usually have the same structure, and those sent from a server to multiple clients tend to show similarities in structure and content). Similarity evaluation and differential encoding have thus emerged as SOAP performance enhancement techniques. The main idea is to identify the common parts of SOAP messages, to be processed only once, avoiding a large amount of overhead. Other approaches investigate nontraditional processor architectures, including micro- and macrolevel parallel processing solutions, so as to further increase the processing rates of SOAP/XML software toolkits. This survey paper provides a concise, yet comprehensive review of the research efforts aimed at SOAP performance enhancement. A unified view of the problem is provided, covering almost every phase of SOAP processing, ranging over message parsing, serialization, deserialization, compression, multicasting, security evaluation, and data/instruction-level processing.	common object request broker architecture;extensibility;grid computing;heterogeneous computing;interoperability;java remote method invocation;list of toolkits;loose coupling;multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);parallel computing;parsing;soap;serialization;server (computing);service-oriented architecture;ws-security;web service;world wide web;xml	Joe Tekli;Ernesto Damiani;Richard Chbeir;Gabriele Gianini	2012	IEEE Transactions on Services Computing	10.1109/TSC.2011.11	web service;parallel processing;throughput;message passing;xml;computer science;operating system;service-oriented architecture;soap;data mining;database;distributed computing;programming language;java;world wide web;computer security;grid computing;encoding;computer network	HPC	-33.84291615959828	50.131963505301655	174669

For large wiki-based collaboration systems these characteristics can be beneficial as well. However, a fully decentralized P2P-based collaboration system requires appropriate incentives for users to (a) contribute resources for storing and providing documents, and (b) to participate in collaborative control mechanisms for keeping content quality at a high level. Therefore, this position paper proposes a score-based incentive scheme for voting-based quality control and document storage in a P2P-based collaboration system. The approach is based on the PeerVote mechanism, which enables users to vote on content modifications. In order to encourage peers to store and vote on documents, each peer is assigned a score related to its contribution. Peers have an incentive to achieve a high score which allows them to create and approve new documents. The scheme proposed is resistant to fraud, since the score can be verified by any other peers.	client–server model;control system;emoticon;fault tolerance;high-level programming language;load balancing (computing);peer-to-peer;scalability;server (computing);wiki	Thomas Bocek;Fabio Victora Hecht;David Hausheer;Dalibor Peric;Burkhard Stiller	2009	2009 18th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises	10.1109/WETICE.2009.43	fault tolerance;decision support system;computer science;load balancing;database;distributed computing;management;world wide web;computer security	HPC	-44.129770811174986	56.51679296161074	174988
a39c808b18706732be87b11c622e93231eb15c3e	trust*: using local guarantees to extend the reach of trust	conference paper	We propose a new concept called trust* as a way of avoiding the necessity to transitively trust others in a range of distributed environments. The trust* approach uses guarantees based upon already established trust relationships. These localised guarantees are then used to extend trust to a new relationship (which we call trust*) which can hold between principals which are unknown to and do not trust one another. Such chains of guarantees enable the risk involved to be shifted to another party (in a similar way to real world guarantees). If a guarantee is broken, some kind of ‘forfeit’ is imposed, either to compensate the client or to deter the server from doing it habitually. Due to trust (and hence also forfeits) being localised, the specific micro-payment and trust management mechanisms that are used to implement the protocol can be heterogeneous. This paper describes the concept of trust* and some possible applications within a domain where the service being provided is also electronic.	micropayment;server (computing);trust management (information system)	Stephen William Clarke;Bruce Christianson;Hannan Xiao	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-36213-2_21	web of trust;express trust;trust anchor;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computational trust	Security	-44.49566752887923	57.03740864061542	175182

However, the current technology is still far from meeting the practical requirements of autonomous driving. The existing control approaches are mainly based on expensive sensors and cameras equipped in vehicles. Thanks to the rapid development of advanced communication and computation techniques, vehicles easily communicate and cooperate to each other [item 2) in the Appendix]. Meanwhile, the control of vehicles become more reliable and cost-efficient with the communication between vehicles [item 3) in the Appendix]. Therefore, communication, computing and control (3C) will play a critical role in the development of next generation intelligent vehicular systems [item 4) in the Appendix].

cda7978a4d234b7775fbb2281770ccd545b3e480	supporting a cloud platform with streams of factory shop floor data in the context of the intustry 4.0		Industry 4.0 is about the interconnectivity and digitalisation of industrial systems that need to be integrated in order to improve the efficiency of resources and, in turn, processes. Both research and commercial sectors are working towards addressing specific challenges, such as data modelling, collection and processing. A correct manipulation and interpretation of data is critical and, now, more difficult than ever due to the dramatic increment of the amount of data generated at different levels of enterprises. Ultimately, this research work presents a solution, integrated with an existing cloud-based platform, for collecting and processing real-time factory shop floor streams of data. Such solution is an IoT-based development, which consist on both IoT hub and gateway that permit the consumption and communication of device information. The required message exchange is done within state of the art technologies and protocols e.g., MQTT protocol and REST-based interface. The implementation of the solution is demonstrated through an industrial-based scenario.	c2net;cloud computing;data modeling;google cloud platform;industry 4.0;interconnectedness;mqtt;real-time transcription;usb hub	Wael M.

These data are employed, in a particular way, by fundamental techniques for context-aware connectivity management, e.g. mobility predictors, handoff mechanisms and mobility management. For instance, mobility and QoS predictors use, as input, previous georeferenced network context data. Normally, context data are available in hardly updated databases with considerable size. In this paper, we propose a social-based methodology to allow mobile users collaborate to discover wireless connectivity islands. The methodology is composed by methods to gather, combine, summarize and share context data inside the users' social circles. We, also, designed a schema to mashup context data with location-based social media. It is result of a prototyping effort and we focus the discussion on its feasibility and limitations in terms of storage size, power consumption and QoS metrics.	database schema;download;experiment;location-based service;mashup (web application hybrid);prototype;quality of service;rss;replay attack;social media;socialization;unfolding (dsp implementation);wireless access point	Roberto Rigolin Ferreira Lopes;Bert-Jan van Beijnum;Edson dos Santos Moreira	2011	2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2011.6085398	quality of service;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;mobility model;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-38.1706070625849	57.76166241187797	175986

0d0f533cf5d4759a92b1b8ef499105f6794a62fc	certificate-based access control for widely distributed resources	performance measure;satisfiability;distributed computing environment;access control	We have implemented and deployed an access control mechanism that uses digitally-signed certificates to define and enforce an access policy for a set of distributed resources that have multiple, independent and geographically dispersed stakeholders. The stakeholders assert their access requirements in use-condition certificates and designate those trusted to attest to the corresponding user attributes. Users are identified by X.509 identity certificates. During a request to use a resource, a policy engine collects all the relevant certificates and decides if the user satisfies all the requirements. This paper describes the model, architecture and implementation of this system. It also includes some preliminary performance measurements and our plans for future development of the system. 1. Motivation: Distributed Computing Environments In distributed computing environments such as research collaborations spanning several institutions, there may be independent and geographically dispersed individuals with authority to control access to the resources [18]. We wish to provide an automated system to allow these stakeholdersto assert their authority over a resource in a flexible manner, consistent with the scope of their authority. Our immediate motivation is to enable sharing over open networks of valued resources within the scientific community generally, and for distributed collaboratories in the DOE2000 project [8] in particular. The Department of Energy (DOE) supports a number of collaborative research environments in which people from universities and companies work with DOE national laboratory personnel and resources. The Lab resources consist of large scientific instruments such electron microscopes or high-energy light source supercomputers or other high-end compute servers; a large-scale storage systems. Researchers from any the groups may contribute software and data to shared by other members of the group. The owners software and data want to be able to securely store d or use their software on hardware that is owned b another entity. The owners of hardware resources wa to be able to control their uses. These stakeholders m want to share with some, but not all members of the co laboratory. For example, commercial members ma want to use common compute hardware, but share th data and results only with other members of their ow organization. Such an environment requires that the stakeholders able to enforce access policy on their resources ev when those resources are physically controlled by a d ferent administrative domain. Each stakeholder must willing to trust that the resource server will enforce access control, but the stakeholder should be able flexibly specify access requirements for its resources. Traditionally, stakeholders have relied on access cont lists (ACLs), stored on the resource server, to expre access policy. However, such ACLs typically require central administrator to make all changes, which mea both that the administrator must be trusted by all stak holders and that the administrator is potentially a bottl neck to rapid updating of the policy. Also, ACLs usually require the server domain to maintain accounts a other administrative support for both stakeholders a users. These problems are all exacerbated when som all stakeholders and users are administratively and ge graphically remote from the server. Another problem that arises in distributed research en ronments is that there may be multiple principals from different administrative domains who need to have inp to the access control policy for a single resource. Th attempted execution of proprietary code (e.g., a lar scientific modeling program) owned by a third party o a remote supercomputer is an example of such a mu This work is supported by the U. S.

However, mobile devices still do not have the computing power or battery life that will allow them to perform effectively over long periods of time or for executing applications that require extensive communication or computation, or low latency. Cyber-foraging is a technique enabling mobile devices to extend their computing power and storage by offloading computation or data to more powerful servers located in the cloud or in single-hop proximity. This paper presents a catalog of architectural tactics for cyber-foraging that was derived from the results of a systematic literature review on architectures for cyber-foraging systems. Elements of the architectures identified in the primary studies were codified in the form of Architectural Tactics for Cyber-Foraging. These tactics will help architects extend their design reasoning towards cyber-foraging as a way to support the mobile applications of the present and the future.	cloud computing;computation;cyber foraging;interaction;internet;mobile app;mobile device;social media;systematic review	Grace A.

Business processes require the disclosure of personal data to third parties and users are not able to control their usage and so their further disclosure. Existing privacy-enhancing technologies consider access control but not usage control of personal data. The current work on usage control mainly considers formalization of usage rules, i.e. obligations, and their enforcement by using the mechanisms of digital rights management, secure logging of access requests for ex post enforcement, and non-linkable delegation of access rights to personal data. However, either these enforcement mechanisms do not consider a disclosure of personal data to third parties or they assume trustworthy data consumers or data providers. We investigated digital watermarking as a way of enforcing obligations for further disclosure of personal data without mandatory trust in service providers.	access control;business process;digital rights management;digital watermarking;microsoft windows;mobile device;operating system;personalization;personally identifiable information;pervasive informatics;privacy-enhancing technologies;s60 (software platform);symbian;windows mobile	Antonio Savoldi;Paolo Gubian;Isao Echizen	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.314	embedded system;software architecture;mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;mobile computing;computer security	Security	-45.024224603090914	60.13945126454368	176712

We address the problem of search in peer-topeer file sharing by allowing the end user to add metadata to shared documents. Each file-sharing community allows the sharing of a particular structured document type. Communities are themselves modeled as structured documents, thus enabling their sharing and discovery just like any other document. The creator of a particular community specifies, among other properties, the document type that it shares and the deployment model. U-P2P’s extensible architecture allows developers to create new properties or extend existing ones. For example, developers can provide new deployment models or custom privacy and authentication features. U-P2P makes use of other open source projects such as Jakarta Tomcat and eXist, an XML database system.	apache tomcat;authentication;exist;file sharing;open-source software;peer-to-peer;software deployment;xml database	Neal Arthorne;Babak Esfandiari;Aloke Mukherjee	2003			shared resource;computer science;peer-to-peer;xml database;database;internet privacy;world wide web;file sharing	Web+IR	-48.17988923471844	51.20235854211897	176878

In this paper, we describe a framework for identity management in mobile services that empowers users to govern the use and release of their personal information. Our framework is based on a brokering approach that intermediates between the mobile operator’s information services and the Web service providers. By leveraging on Web services, identity management infrastructure and privacy enhancing technologies, our framework provides an effective, privacy-considerate delivery of services over the mobile Web environment.

The architecture should offer efficient and secure standard environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Enterprise Application Framework (EAF) which includes a standard communication protocols, security functions, and abstract level business processes. EAF uses SPKI/SDSI and GRBAC-based security since existing PKI technology has some limitations. Also it offers abstract class as well as concrete class to deal with a specific business, thus the domain programmer could construct their own specific programs efficiently and easily using the derived classes. The suggested framework is expected to provide secure management and software reuse in the dynamic RFID environments.	abstract type;application framework;business process;code reuse;enterprise architecture framework;enterprise software;programmer;public key infrastructure;radio-frequency identification;simple public-key infrastructure;smoothing	Mokdong Chung;Jaehyuk Choi;Kiyeal Lee;Shi-Kook Rhyoo	2007	Sixth International Conference on Advanced Language Processing and Web Information Technology (ALPIT 2007)	10.1109/ALPIT.2007.112	systems engineering;business;computer security;computer network	DB	-46.003901351751324	54.346383796969846	177362

Developing an architecture that allows for targeted applications to be developed for end users of these enhanced mobile networks is of great importance. Examining how contextual data, extracted from these mobile networks, can be used to make inference and provide benefit to end users is both a technical and sophisticated challenge to be discussed in this paper.	algorithm;ambient intelligence;bayesian network;experiment;extensibility;instant messaging;java business integration;mobile phone;propagation of uncertainty;scalability;software deployment;triangulation (geometry);vii	Shane Dempsey;Brendan Jennings;Jonathan Brazil;Jason Madigan	2011	2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Environments	10.1109/IE.2011.74	embedded system;mobile search;telecommunications;engineering;mobile computing;computer network	Robotics	-39.27145073843125	50.43855779112089	177841

OCS is about enterprises strategically contributing and utilizing spare IT resources as cloud services. One of the major challenges that such a platform faces is data security and trust management issues. This paper presents a trust management system for OCS platforms. It models the concept of trust and applies it to OCS platforms. The trust model and the trust management system are verified through the simulation of the computation of the trust values with Infrastructure as a Service, and Software as a Service, usage scenarios.	cloud computing;computation;data security;decision support system;original chip set;scalability;service-level agreement;simulation;software as a service;trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science);usability;verification and validation	Eric Kuada	2013	2013 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Networking (CloudNet)	10.1109/CloudNet.2013.6710555	cloud computing security;business;world wide web;computer security;computational trust;computer network	SE	-48.01349797610549	56.8954824862213	177940
d7048a89d1c032f5738fe85ec1842358f19a9805	context-based security (and safety) meta-policies for pervasive computing environments: the case of smart momes		Context-based security is an approach for modeling adaptive security solutions based on the situation of use of the system. Security policies in this approach are not static as it used to be in traditional systems. The security actions to be taken are based on the knowledge of the combination of various factors such as the location of the user, the surroundings, time, temperature etc making the security policies more adaptive. The aim of this paper is to present security meta-policies based on an existing approach known as Contextual Graphs and the multilevel access model, which we presented in our previous paper. These meta-policies determine within what contexts actions in other policies should be taken – it is in this sense that we have the notion of other policies “embedded” within the meta-policy. Our approach can be easily used in various smart environments, even for context-aware safety meta-policies. The paper presents their use in a smart home scenario.	authentication;distributed operating system;embedded system;home automation;sensor;smart environment;ubiquitous computing	Pravin Shetty;Seng Wai Loke	2005			context-aware pervasive systems;ubiquitous computing;home automation;computer science;computer security;cloud computing security;graph;smart environment;security policy	Security	-45.442173130767735	51.93925639345089	178283

We present in this paper a practical solution that establishes a trust infrastructure, enables authenticated and secure communication between users in the social network and provides personalized, fine grained data access control.

The characteristics of mobile devices and requirements of services in social environments raise a challenge on building a platform for mobile social services. In this paper, we elaborate a flexible system architecture based on the service-oriented specification to support social interactions in campus-wide environments. In the client side, we designed a mobile middleware to collect social contexts such as the proximity, the cell phone log etc. The server backend, on the other hand, aggregates such contexts, analyses social connections among users and provides social services to facilitate social interactions. A prototype of mobile social networking system is deployed on campus, and several applications are implemented based on the proposed architecture to demonstrate the effectiveness of the architecture.	client-side;interaction;middleware;mobile device;mobile phone;mobile social network;osgi;prototype;requirement;scalability;server (computing);service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;smartphone;systems architecture	Zhiwen Yu;Yunji Liang;Bukan Xu;Bin Guo	2011	2011 International Conference on Internet of Things and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.55	social web;social environment;mobile search;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;social computing;computer network	Mobile	-38.727475856820476	50.975423954006914	179841

Lincoln Laboratory has been developing LARIAT to support IO test design, development, and execution with high-fidelity user simulations. As LARIAT becomes more advanced, enabling larger and more realistic and complex tests, effective management software has proven essential. In this paper, we present the Director, a graphical user interface that enables experimenters to quickly define, control, and monitor reliable IO tests on a LARIAT testbed. We describe how the interface simplifies these key elements of testbed operation by providing the experimenter with an appropriate system abstraction, support for basic and advanced usage, scalable performance and visualization in large networks, and interpretable and correct feedback.	centralized computing;database;graphical user interface;heat map;high- and low-level;information overload;information seeking;population;relay;scalability;simulation;structural complexity (applied mathematics);test design;testbed;usability	T.

With so many different hardware components in modern smartphones, there are situations where certain components may be powered down or reduced in functionality without disrupting the user experience. We propose a transparent correlation-based scheme for energy efficient context sensing and fusion under Android systems. We experiment with the idea of disabling hardware functionality based on context. Our scheme focuses on inferring a user's location and subsequently disabling the GPS, which is considered to be one of the most energy-expensive components included in a smartphone. For example, when a user has connected to a Wi-Fi network with a known location, we disable GPS navigation and deliver the known location in its place. Based on our experiments, we conclude that this approach can significantly improve a device's battery life.	android	Nicholas Capurso;Liran Ma;Tianyi Song;Xiuzhen Cheng	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07782-6_58	embedded system;global positioning system;operating system;efficient energy use;internet privacy;location;computer security	Mobile	-38.81111001001431	56.46131867160649	179980

As more and more data stream processing engines (and services) will be deployed in the cloud, we feel it is critical to enable the data stream owners to control who can access their data streams for what purposes under what conditions. Therefore, we design an architecture to support data stream management in the cloud with privacy-preserving capabilities. In this paper, we focus on one of the premier principles of data privacy, limited disclosure. We design an access control framework, to define privacy policies and efficiently enforce these privacy policy rules from stream-level to tuple-level granularity.	access control;authorization;cloud computing;data access;database;elasticity (cloud computing);information privacy;pervasive informatics;privacy policy;real-time transcription;rewriting;streams;sensor;stream processing	Wee Siong Ng;Huayu Wu;Wei Wu;Shili Xiang	2012			internet privacy	DB	-42.81092026563175	60.322710113780836	180154

Mobile users tend to adopt the fast food trend even in consuming online mobile services and functionalities. The Web service approach promises great flexibility in offering software functionality over the network, while maintaining interoperability between heterogeneous platforms. However, the diversity that exists in mobile devices and their platforms with variations in capabilities present unique challenges in developing services that can accommodate such diversity. Recent years have witnessed the rise of user-facing service developments that can be consumed on the go with standard interface, such as RESTful Web services. However, the discovery of such services does not match their growing popularity. In addition, existing discovery approaches lack supporting mechanisms that ensure the proper functioning of discovered services within the user context and failing to match personal preferences. This paper introduces personalized Web service discovery for mobile environments. Preliminary results show that incorporating user preferences and context significantly improves the overall precision of service discovery.	computer form factor;fits;failure;fast food;interoperability;mobile device;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;personalization;prototype;representational state transfer;server (computing);server-side;service discovery;usb on-the-go;ubiquitous computing;user (computing);web service;world wide web	Khalid Elgazzar;Patrick Martin;Hossam S.

It describes a set of cooperative agents distributed over different sites that work together to provide personalized services for mobile users over the Internet. Users moving outside the office are able to maintain an office-like environment at home, or at temporary locations such as a meeting at another company, a business trip, or a hotel. Agents representing the end-users and the system agents engage in a negotiation process to facilitate access to personalized services at other sites. This access is obtained in accordance with the users’ home policies as well as those at their current location. An Adaptive Service Presentation agent is used to adapt the service presentation to the capabilities of the users’ workstations, laptops, phones, PDAs, or other devices. This work is conducted in Canada as part of the Mobile Agent Alliance project involving the University of Ottawa, the National Research Council, and the Mitel Corporation.	agent-based model;entity;internet;laptop;mobile agent;mobile computing;personal digital assistant;personalization;prototype;provisioning;user profile;workstation	Hamid Harroud;Mohamed Ahmed;Ahmed Karmouch	2003	IEEE Trans.

In response, this article proposes a method of interoperable service-driven information distribution on the edge side to enhance the service-level interoperability with feature-level interoperability by self-adapting data sharing according to the service needs, which will also help to release incremental data pressure and provide better data privacy by conducting service-driven and relevance-based data sharing.	interoperability;pervasive informatics	Bin Xiao;Rahim Rahmani;Yuhong Li;Theo Kanter	2017	Pervasive and Mobile Computing	10.1016/j.pmcj.2017.07.002	computer network;semantic interoperability;distributed computing;interoperability;database;computer science;data sharing;information privacy;cross-domain interoperability;internet of things	HCI	-43.181312438514006	53.971334749728534	180502

The use of this collection sensors as sensor-network infrastructures (towards what we call Social Networks of Sensors'', or SNoS) may be very fruitful and economically advantageous. However, it also introduces some new research challenges, one of which relates to understanding the potential impact of social mobility patterns to the performances of sensor infrastructures. This paper delves into such issue and analyses how the presence of mobile sensors moving according to social mobility patterns can impact the performances of fixed sensor network infrastructures and their design choices. Simulation results show that such integration can lead to increased efficiency of the integrated SNoS infrastructure for both sensing coverage and data delivery.	performance;sensor;simulation;smartphone;social dynamics;social network;tablet computer	Marcello Tomasini;Franco Zambonelli;Ronaldo Menezes	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.125	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-42.01019100019587	51.18347814758196	180534

This paper elaborates on the design of a privacy protection framework for Personal Self-Improving Smart Spaces (PSSs), a concept introduced by the Persist project Consortium. Compared to other smart spaces, such as smart homes and vehicles, this new paradigm provides a truly ubiquitous and fully personalisable user-centric environment. However, the information that needs to be collected, processed and distributed in such an environment is by nature highly privacy-sensitive, as it includes user profile data and preferences, as well as data regarding the past, current and even future user activities and context in general. In this respect, the designed privacy framework aims to address all privacy issues that arise by providing facilities which support multiple digital identities of PSS owners and privacy preferences for deriving privacy policies based on the context and the trustworthiness of the third parties that interact with PSSs.	authorization;consortium;identity management;in the beginning... was the command line;information privacy;internet privacy;personally identifiable information;physical symbol system;privacy policy;programming paradigm;prototype;smart tv;spaces;trust (emotion);trust management (information system);user profile	Nicolas Liampotis;Ioanna Roussaki;Elizabeth Papadopoulou;Yussuf Abu-Shaaban;M.

40e1ff286bb5d840d7825904b6ae4170b22491f3	a comprehensive survey on addressing methods in the internet of things		Over the last 10 years, the Internet of Things has gain a great deal of attention and many papers have been written in this field. The aim of the IoT is to connect all things around us to the Internet and provide us with smarter cities, smarter homes, and generally smarter lives. The number of connected devices to the Internet is progressively increasing and supporting all these devices has caused several challenges for the IoT. One of the IoT challenges is addressing billions of things around the world including computers, tablets, smart phones, wearable devices, sensors and etc. In this paper, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on addressing methods and we have tried to investigate all proposed methods in this field carefully. In addition, we provide advantages and disadvantages of each presented method at the end of each discussion in Section “Remarks”. We also present some metrics for evaluating all discussed methods and compare these methods based on our metrics.

f3738317bcab84d9c7aa8a2f130d1cf47297b8cf	a service-oriented middleware framework for manufacturing industry 4.0		The advantages of the Internet of things (IoT) initiated the vision of Industry 4.0 in Europe and smart manufacturing in USA. Both visions aim to implement the smart factory to achieve similar objectives by utilizing new technologies. These technologies include cloud computing, fog computing, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and data analytics. Together they help automate and autonomize the manufacturing processes and controls to optimize the productivity, reliability, quality, cost-effeteness, and safety of these processes. While both visions are promising, developing and operating Industry 4.0 applications are extremely challenging. This is due to the complexity of the manufacturing processes as well as their management, controls, and integration dynamics. This paper introduces Man4Ware, a service-oriented middleware for Industry 4.0. Man4Ware can help facilitate the development and operations of cloud and fog-integrated smart manufacturing applications. Man4Ware offers many advantages through service level interfaces to enable easy utilization of new technologies and integration of different services to relax many of the challenges facing the development and operations of such applications1.	cloud computing;computer data storage;cyber-physical system;dfa minimization;distance fog;edge computing;fog computing;high-level programming language;industry 4.0;information system;integrated computer-aided manufacturing;internet of things;lean software development;real-time transcription;robot;seamless3d;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented middleware	Jameela Al-Jaroodi;Nader Mohamed;Imad Jawhar	2018	SIGBED Review	10.1145/3292384.3292389	engineering management;distributed computing;emerging technologies;industry 4.0;cyber-physical system;cloud computing;factory;computer science;manufacturing;middleware;service level	Robotics	-46.034113831424584	47.663856702496645	181524

Having this vision in mind, Community Context-attribute-oriented Collaborative Information Environment (CCCIE) based Autonomous Decentralized Community System (ADCS) is proposed to enable provision of services to specific users in specific place at specific time considering various context-attributes. This paper presents autonomous community construction technology that share service discovered by one member among others in flexible way to improve timeliness and reduce network cost. In order to meet crucial goal of real-time and context-aware community construction (provision of service/ service information to users with common interests), and defining flexible service area in highly dynamic operating environment of ADCS, proposed progressive ripple based service discovery technique introduces novel idea of snail’s pace and steady advancing search followed by swift boundary confining mechanism; while service area construction shares the discovered service among members in defined area to further improve timeliness and reduce network cost.

In a VC, underutilized vehicular resources including computing power, storage, and Internet connectivity can be shared between drivers or rented out over the Internet to various customers. Clearly, if the VC concept is to see a wide adoption and to have significant societal impact, security and privacy issues need to be addressed. The main contribution of this work is to identify and analyze a number of security challenges and potential privacy threats in VCs. Although security issues have received attention in cloud computing and vehicular networks, we identify security challenges that are specific to VCs, e.g., challenges of authentication of high-mobility vehicles, scalability and single interface, tangled identities and locations, and the complexity of establishing trust relationships among multiple players caused by intermittent short-range communications. Additionally, we provide a security scheme that addresses several of the challenges discussed.	authentication;cloud computing;device driver;internet;privacy;scalability;tag cloud	Gongjun Yan;Ding Wen;Stephan Olariu;Michele C.

One of the fundamental problems associated with the issue is the lack of support of a user-centric approach to managing and sharing user profile information in current SN systems. In this paper we present a user-centric approach based on a credential system to enabling a user-controlled attribute (persona) sharing in online SN sites. Specifically we extend a Google-initiated open source project called OpenSocial, which provides a framework to support user attribute sharing between gadgets and online SN sites, in order to allow users to selectively share their attributes among online SN sites.

System autonomy and resource-awareness are challenging requirements making local image processing for event-based communication a necessary design constraint. In this paper we present the distributed event space (DES)---a middleware service for the resource-aware management of distributed event data. The DES architecture is based on a decentralized tuple space which describes local events by tuples consisting of position and time of the events as well as a set of features describing the detected objects. The DES supports prompt distribution of detected local events and application-specific functions for sophisticated event filtering. We present a distributed tracking application to demonstrate its applicability.	design closure;image processing;middleware;multi-function printer;pervasive informatics;requirement;smart camera;tuple space	Wolfgang Schriebl;Bernhard Rinner	2010		10.1145/1865987.1866001	smart camera;embedded system;computer vision;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;image processing;computer science;tuple space;middleware;distributed computing;emerging technologies;visual sensor network	HCI	-41.164386227908764	48.12673233712041	181920

In this work, we propose to model the multiple facets of one digital life from the data available on his smartphone. More specifically, we investigate the interactions and connections that may exist between the multiple digital faces of an individual. We provide a set of indicators that measure the level of imbrication of a contact that belongs to the egocentric social network of a smartphone user. We prove the efficiency of these features for the detection of illegitimate contacts by link prediction on a case study of Facebook.

Today, security is going down that road and the term security as a service is emerging. Authorization that consists in managing permissions is one of the main classic security services. We propose in this article to study how authorization could be delivered/consumed as a Service. We focus on the XACML standard that has been adopted by the cloud security community because of its native flexibility and adaptability properties. Although XACML seems to fulfill the requirements of authorization as a Service in theory, it is very complex to realize it in practice. We propose a service oriented component architecture together with the concept self-contained policy to cope with this issue. This approach allows both the cloud consumers to adapt the authorization system to their authorization policies and the cloud providers to minimize the cost of providing a flexible authorization service.	authorization;xacml	Romain Laborde;François Barrère;Abdelmalek Benzekri	2013			database;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-47.554799295288205	55.32350236110888	182046

We tackle this challenge by taking advantage of both static and dynamic context and semantics from mobile users (e.g., Geolocation, social network, expertise/interest, device sensor profiles, battery level) to identify sources of information (i.e., Workers) that are trusted by the user and accurate enough for the questions at hand. Given a question, the Smart Source broker middleware executes a scalable and efficient worker selection algorithm that uses a Lyapunov optimization framework to maximize the utility of worker selection while guaranteeing the stability of the overall system. An associated assignor selection is used to scale the selection process to a large number of users. We implement the Smart Source prototype system on an Android test bed and thoroughly evaluate the system using real world applications and data, in particular those that involve geospatial questions and answers. Evaluation results indicate that Smart Source is efficient and provides superior worker selection compared to baseline approaches. Smart Source is also highly customizable: it employs a general utility function and provides a control knob to tradeoff the optimality and responding time. We believe that Smart Source will pave a way for new mechanisms of interaction among mobile users.	android;baseline (configuration management);control knob;crowdsourcing;geolocation;google questions and answers;lyapunov fractal;lyapunov optimization;mathematical optimization;middleware;prototype;scalability;selection algorithm;social network;testbed;utility	Ye Zhao;Chen-Chih Liao;Ting-Yi Lin;Jikai Yin;Ngoc Minh Do;Cheng-Hsin Hsu;Nalini Venkatasubramanian	2015	2015 16th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management	10.1109/MDM.2015.73	mobile search;computer science;operating system;middleware;database;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;crowdsourcing;computer network	Mobile	-40.19170337857632	58.178338358872416	182524

In this paper, we propose a service-oriented framework that provides these much needed infrastructure services. Using the framework, service providers can prepare their business applications for publishing as Web services, and specify access controls on their services in the registry while service requestors can find suitable service providers and invoke their services dynamically. The framework ensures that all transactions are secure, monitored for service level agreements and logged for audit purposes. By providing business utility services and automation technology founded on Web services, we believe that, our framework takes Web services to the next level in supporting dynamic e-business.	access control;electronic business;service-level agreement;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented infrastructure;service-oriented software engineering;web service	David Flaxer;Rama Akkiraju;Ray M.

Effective sensors such as ultra low-cost wireless sensors, smart phones and pads allow us to couple real objects, people, places, and environment with the corresponding entities in the cyber space. Similarly, soft sensors such as blog, facebook, twitter, foursqure and other applications create new types of sensed data for cyber-physical coupling. for In this paper, we describe sensor enabled cyber-physical coupling for creating ubiquitous services in the SenseCampus project. We first classify cyber-physical coupling and ubiquitous services in the project. Several ubiquitous services, such as SensingCloud, DIY smart object services, Twitthings, Airy Notes, and Mebius Ring, are described. We then address the challenges in cyber-physical coupling for creating advanced ubiquitous services particularly for educational facilities.	as-interface;blog;cyberspace;entity;sensor;smartphone;wireless router	Hideyuki Tokuda;Jin Nakazawa	2012	JIP	10.2197/ipsjjip.20.45	embedded system;ubiquitous commerce;computer science;ubiquitous robot;cyber-physical system;world wide web;computer security;computer network	HCI	-39.936305205439055	51.12599413508618	183168

They are an elegant technology to solve problems that can not be easily solved in other way. The Scientific Community has proved that the use of the software agents approach simplifies the solution of difierent type of traditional computing problems. A proof of this is that several important applications exist based on this technology. It is clear that software agents have so many benefits, but unfortunately, a lack of the appropriate security mechanisms for systems based on them represents a barrier for the widespread use of this paradigm in the industry. The application of the current security mechanisms is not trivial for agent based system developers, since they usually are not security experts and consequently do not count on the appropriate expertise. This paper presents a new protection infrastructure solving the problem known as malicious host in mobile agent systems. This protection infrastructure implements a secure protocol to migrate agents from host to host relying in hardware elements, particularly it is based on the recent advances in Trusted Platforms Modules (TPM) computing. In order to provide an easy way of using the proposed infrastructure we provide it by means of an extension to the Java Agent Development framework (JADE). Finally, the migrating protocol presented has been validated using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) framework, this validation is presented in this paper.	agent-based model;internet security;jade;java;mobile agent;programming paradigm;software agent;trusted platform module	Antonio Muñoz;Antonio Maña;Daniel Serrano	2009	IJCSA		scientific communication;mobile agent;software agent;computer security;cryptographic protocol;internet security;computer science;trusted platform module;java	SE	-45.805544946324254	55.349293424170725	183467
afa812020a2fd2bb2ccde0ab72c8e787b789e7a6	editorial: special issue on internet of things: convergence of sensing, networking, and web technologies	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Internet is quickly progressing toward the seamless interaction of objects, sensors, and computing devices, usually indicated as the Internet of Things (IoT). Several examples exist where wireless sensor networks, mobile equipments, RFID tags, home appliances, cars, and many other daily objects talk to each other, exchange information, generate aggregated knowledge, and allow to quickly develop new advanced services for the final user. A comprehensive reference scenario is smart grids, i.e., electricity networks that can intelligently integrate the behavior and actions of all objects connected in order to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic, and secure electricity supplies using a two-way digital communication technology. The IoT requires powerful networking environments on one side and sophisticated data aggregation and processing technologies on the other. As sensing technologies perceive the world without human intervention, the amount of generated data is far beyond the one we are used to, where operators traditionally provide input data. Thus, the IoT is becoming a unifying concept where sensing, computing, and web technologies converge, interact, and integrate each other. For IoT to become a reality, several technical, social, and economical problems still need to be addressed. This Special Issue of the EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking highlights some of the emerging issues in IoT and associated systems, along with their applicability in an innovative and insightful way. The papers in this Special Issue are organized into three thematic groups.

242710bcfa70c98626d93bd7d160dd5539935e23	smart space deployment in wireless and mobile settings of the internet of things		A smart space enhances a networked computing environment by enabling information sharing for digital devices. We consider the emerging case of Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where the role of wireless communication and mobile participation becomes crucial. This paper studies smart spaces created by deploying a Semantic Information Broker (SIB). The latter defines an information hub such that any participant uses it as a knowledge base of the IoT environment. We discuss two directions for SIB deployment options: (i) SIB deployment in dependence on a hosting computing environment and (ii) augmented software deployment with SIB to perform specified knowledge processing. The deployment options are analyzed in respect to such application domains as collaborative work, electronic tourism (e-Tourism), and mobile healthcare (m-Health). Our experimental evaluation study indicates that the deployment options support overcoming the performance issues caused by the wireless and mobile settings of IoT environments.	hypervisor;internet of things;knowledge base;laptop;mhealth;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);server (computing);service implementation bean;single-board computer;software deployment;usb hub;virtual machine	Dmitry G.

The framework consists of four functional components: WSN, mobile gateway, context management platform, and mashup server. The WSN deployed in the application domain senses the physical phenomena and the human-environment interaction and expresses them in sensor readings. The mobile phone is used as the gateway to the WSN, which can directly communicate with the sensor nodes and collect the user related sensor data. On the mobile phone, the raw sensor data is preprocessed and the user-centric contexts are extracted. The context management platform stores all contexts according to the predefined context ontology, detects the inconsistent information, deduces the high level knowledge using heuristic rules and provides web service application programming interfaces (APIs) to mashup server. The mashup server integrates the context information obtained from the context management platform with the information from other mashup data sources, and provides services to users through mobile phone. The proposed framework can be used in exhibition center, shopping mall, smart office/home, and many other scenarios.	application domain;application programming interface;heuristic;high-level programming language;mashup (web application hybrid);mobile phone;sensor;server (computing);web service	Shuangquan Wang;Canfeng Chen;Jian Ma	2009	2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering	10.1109/CSIE.2009.805	application programming interface;computer science;operating system;database;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;mashup;computer network	Mobile	-40.05039867734836	47.07501667477911	183979

021ece79d776e9099059d40a9423e8ae0b6a5cd3	enabling collaborative administration and safety fences: factored privileges in sql databases	inference rule	An access policy has many aspects, concerning both information and physical execution. Agglomerating them into a single SQL grant makes policies much harder to administer, especially at enterprise scale where administrators need to collaborate. We present a way to specify policies as a conjunction of factors, in a simple, regular way. Each factor decision poses a simple question, and when a circumstance changes, only the relevant factor needs to be revisited. Factors are also helpful for establishing “safety fences” on an administrator’s work, and for separating (global) information privileges to enable more powerful inference rules. To ease integration into existing systems, factor privileges employ the same interfaces and rules as ordinary SQL privileges, rather than multiple new top-level, awkwardly-interacting constructs (such as “autonomy” and “prohibition”).	access control;autonomy;database;interaction;sql	Arnon Rosenthal;Edward Sciore	2004	IEEE Data Eng.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop security mechanisms and protocols to protect them. These mechanisms must become an integral part of the software architecture and network stack of a sensor node. A question that remains is how to achieve this integration. In this paper we check how both academic and industrial solutions tackle this issue, and we present the concept of a transversal layer, where all the different security mechanisms could be contained. This way, all the elements of the architecture can interact with the security mechanisms, and the security mechanisms can have a holistic point of view of the whole architecture. We discuss the advantages of this approach, and also present how the transversal layer concept was applied to a real middleware architecture.

In this paper, we explain why such mechanisms should be integrated into a WSN software architecture as a transversal layer. This transversal layer retains the benefits of layered architectures (modularity, interoperability, design longevity), while the advantages of cross-layer architectures (optimization, tunable design) are maintained and its disadvantages (hidden dependencies, poor design) are adequately controlled.)

During the trip, he gave three suggestions for the national development strategy and in particularly indicated the importance of the “Cognitive Sense of China”. Cognitive Sense of China, the vision that physical systems such as intelligent utility networks (or smart grids), intelligent transportation systems, and various environmental monitoring systems should become accessible to the online world and to the people; this vision is more and more becoming a reality. With the Cognitive Sense of China, ubiquitous Machine to Machine (M2M) services will become feasible and make major changes to our future daily life and the future human society. Cognitive Sense of China points out the importance of knowledge cognition from various collections of sensed data. Indeed China is setting forth an ambitious plan to accelerate research and development as well as application of sensing and cognition in China. The aim of this special issue is to bring together the state-of-art research on cognitive sense of China. Building on the great potential benefits to the future, Cognitive Sense of China poses a number of key challenges, not only due to the nature of the enabling technologies but also due to the sheer scale of their deployment. These challenges, as indicated by the term of the cognitive sense, fall into two major categories. The first category mainly involves the sensing operations, more specifically, the collection of the sensing data from various sensing, monitoring, surveillance systems. Recently, a more general concept of these sensing systems, the Internet of Things, has become the subject of a great many research works. China is increasing the speed of development of the Internet of Things, making it a new engine for economic growth and an opportunity to catch up with the developed countries. The Internet of Things has the following unique characteristics: physical objects, network of objects, intelligence and interaction of objects. Its definition varies depending on the perspective that is taken. From the functionality and identity perspective it can be defined as Internet-enabled objects having identities and virtual personalities operating in smart spaces using intelligent interfaces to connect and communicate within social, environmental, and user contexts. The key enabling technologies include RFID, Wireless Sensor Networks, smart phones and mobile computing, pervasive computing and ubiquitous wireless communications. The other major challenge involves the cognitive, i.e., the processing of the sensing data to obtain new information and knowledge. This category of enabling technologies includes extreme-scale data storage and processing, data interaction and evolution, information retrieval, database management and data mining. Different from the traditional studies in these fields, one unique requirement of Cognitive Sense of China is the extreme-scale. The data volume that needs to be processed in a real-time manner (say, within a second) is typically on the order of petabytes (1 PB = 10Bytes and roughly speaking, 1 PB is 1000million MB). This data demand is increasing exponentially according to the current trends. Processing on such a scale, brings great challenges to the traditional research and technologies in these fields. Fortunately, for many applications the basic processing technologies are quite mature, and moreover, in many cases incomplete, and imperfect processing results are tolerable and acceptable. In other words, we may need to alter our research philosophy in these fields, changing our design objectives from the accuracy and efficiency to true scalability.	cognition;computer data storage;data mining;database;ibm websphere extreme scale;information retrieval;internet of things;machine to machine;mobile computing;petabyte;radio-frequency identification;real-time transcription;scalability;smart tv;smartphone;software deployment;ubiquitous computing	Lionel M.

Consequently, the IoT has been an important topic of study in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) for several years in different Study Groups. The new ITU-T Study Group 20 has just been established in June 2015 for further promoting coordinated progress of global IoT technologies, services and applications. In this paper, we review the IoT related activities being pursued in ITU by presenting the IoT reference model. We then describe a number of key requirements the IoT infrastructure should satisfy to make it economically and technologically deployable for useful services and applications. We present some prospective technologies, such as software-defined networking, information-centric networking, and ID-based communication, while pointing out to the related technologies that are worth further study in ITU.	big data;edge computing;internet of things;location-based service;prospective search;reference model;requirement;sensor;software-defined networking;telecommunications network	Ved P.

139b69f47d9e0bb9224844b421d3451e2b3068b9	transforming grid to cloud services for multimodal biometrics		Various barriers due to performance, security and privacy issues associated with shared heterogeneous data centres impede the diffusion of multimodal biometrics that could enhance secured systems in our everyday lives. This paper identifies the issues associated with multimodal fusion and privacy risks and provides means of addressing them. It presents the need for transforming from grid-based services to cloud-based services in order to address these issues, paving the way towards a successful user acceptance of biometric systems. Though grid services could provide heterogeneous resource sharing capabilities and security, multimodal biometrics require scalability and pricing flexibility for gaining user-acceptance and easy adoption. By leveraging u0027on-the-demandu0027 services offered in cloud computing, reliable and context-sensitive privacy policies could be applied for multimodal biometrics to cater to the different business and user requirements. Further, the paper combines the concept of cloud services along with momentum back propagation induced artificial neural network MBP-ANN model of machine learning for efficient multimodal fusion and flexible authentication schemes. The paper also describes a case scenario of how this model could be adopted by applying the varying security requirements and user privacy preferences for a successful diffusion of multimodal biometrics in the cloud.	biometrics;cloud computing;multimodal interaction	Sitalakshmi Venkatraman	2016	IJCSE	10.1504/IJCSE.2016.10000004	cloud computing;computer science;operating system;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;artificial neural network	HPC	-43.44621900585625	58.38498045750107	186720

In fact, client side storage can be achieved by external plugins, libraries or HTML5 APIS. It ensures a high user's quality of experience, offline application usage and server load reduction. In this work, we focus on the privacy and availability of confidential data explored by HTML5 Local Storage API. In our approach, the browser devotes to each user a secure space for data storage. Thus, all data will be stored safely in the client side before their synchronization over the different machines of the same user using the Cloud. As the HTML5 is standardized and adopted by the majority of recent versions of browsers, the data protection can be applied either on PC or on smart-phone for mobile Internet application.	application programming interface;client-side;cloud computing;computer data storage;confidentiality;html5;information privacy;library (computing);online and offline;plug-in (computing);rich internet application;server (computing);server-side;smartphone;web storage	Mayssa Jemel;Ahmed Serhrouchni	2014	2014 International Conference and Workshop on the Network of the Future (NOF)	10.1109/NOF.2014.7119784	converged storage;computer science;database;internet privacy;information repository;world wide web	OS	-42.66232027970967	59.268328355970006	186950

Many proposals are addressing the perceived problems, ranging from new enhanced protocols to fix specific problems up to the most radical proposal to redesign and deploy a fully new Internet. Most of the problems in the current Internet are rooted in the tremendous pace of increase of its use. As a consequence there was little time to address the deficiencies of the Internet from an architectural point of view.  Within FP7, the European Commission has facilitated the creation of European expert groups around the theme FIRE """"Future Internet Research and Experimentation"""". FIRE has two related dimensions: on one hand, promoting experimentally-driven long-term, visionary research on new paradigms and networking concepts and architectures for the future Internet; on the other hand, building a large-scale experimentation facility supporting both medium- and long-term research on networks and services by gradually federating existing and new testbeds for emerging or future Internet technologies. By addressing future challenges for the Internet such as mobility, scalability, security and privacy, this new experimentally-driven approach is challenging the mainstream perceptions for future Internet development. This new initiative is intended to complement the more industrially-driven approaches which are addressed under the FP7 Objective """"The Network of the Future"""" within the FP7-ICT Workprogramme 2007-08. FIRE is focused on exploring new and radically better technological solutions for the future Internet, while preserving the """"good"""" aspects of the current Internet, in terms of openness, freedom of expression and ubiquitous access. The FIRE activities are being launched in the 2nd ICT call, which closes in October 2007, under the FP7-ICT Objective 1.6 """"New Paradigms and Experimental Facilities"""" (budget ε40m).

We consider that every physical object can be a living smart object and any services can be a living phenomenon. The goal of EiA is to make everything alive to make our lives revive with the objective to make use of all objects and services surrounding us to make our life better. Our project is goal-oriented, and the scope of this project is broad, encompassing Ubiquitous Intelligence, Cyber-Individual, Brain Informatics, and Web Intelligence. In this paper, we discuss how those technologies can be integrated together and fit into a seamless cycle like the one proposed in the Wisdom Web of Things (W2T). We also provide two case studies from our EiA project. The first case study is to demonstrate how a concept first tested in a virtual environment can be successfully implemented in the real world later when technological advances finally caught up. The data collection step and the ability to manually control smart objects of the W2T cycle are fulfilled in this step. The second case study is to show how the software simulator and hardware implementation are abstracted from the underlying algorithm, and thus, it serves as an example of how virtual worlds can be used as a test bed for W2T, especially with regards to the development of the remaining steps of the W2T cycle.	abstraction layer;algorithm;anytime algorithm;autonomous robot;best practice;centralized computing;computer;domestic robot;humans;informatics;mobile computing;mobile robot;ontology (information science);outline of object recognition;seamless3d;semiconductor industry;smart device;smart objects;smartphone;testbed;ubiquitous computing;virtual reality;virtual world;web intelligence;web of things	Akihiro Eguchi;Hung Nguyen;Craig W.

Such objects will be able to be monitored and monitor their physical environments, and of executing actions on such environments in benefit of human users. Moreover, these so-called smart objects will be endowed with wireless communication capabilities. By being uniquely addressed, wireless endowed and through the use of existing protocols and standardized formats, smart things can be integrated in the Internet and accessed as any other Web resource. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges as a paradigm in which smart things actively collaborate among them and with other physical and virtual objects available in the Web, providing value-added information and functionalities for users. The IoT paradigm has recently showed its potential of considerably impacting the daily lives of human beings mainly due to the use and interaction of physical devices in several domains, including complex systems composed of other systems. In this paper we discuss the IoT paradigm from the perspective of Systems-of-Systems and present EcoDiF, a IoT platform that integrates heterogeneous devices to provide real-time data control, visualization, processing, and storage. In EcoDiF, devices, information, users and applications are integrated to create an IoT ecosystem in which new ideas and products can be developed in an organic way.	complex systems;ecosystem;internet of things;programming paradigm;real-time clock;real-time data;smart objects;system of systems;web resource;world wide web	Flávia Coimbra Delicato;Paulo F.

a7ac38fe28744f2c5da1f55beeee40224ce3ae82	corus: blockchain-based trustworthy evaluation system for efficacy of healthcare remedies		We present a healthcare remedy evaluation system, called CORUS, using blockchain-based crowdsourcing on a cloud computing platform. Efficacy of healthcare remedies such as functional foods and dietary supplements usually spreads by subjective word of mouth. Though regular clinical trials could be employed, it requires significant cost in time and budget. We expect crowdsourcing can be an effective and efficient alternative to the costly clinical trials to achieve objective evaluation on healthcare remedies. The blockchain technology can alleviate the problem of information quality in most of crowdsourcing systems. Properly designed reward distribution schemes can motivate voluntary participants to provide with credible information. The distributed replication of blockchains can increase the information credibility by prohibiting malicious forgery. We also utilize the Amazon cloud system to enhance availability and scalability. To our knowledge, CORUS is the first system to utilize crowdsourcing, blockchains, and cloud computing for healthcare remedy evaluation. It is available at https://corus.kaist.edu.

However, the poor computational capability and limited power capacity of current wearable devices degrade runtime performance and sustainability. Computational offloading strategy has been proposed to outsource computation to remote cloud for improving performance. Nevertheless, comparing with mobile devices, the wearable devices have their specific limitations, which induce additional problems and require new thoughts of computational offloading. In this paper, we propose several guidelines of computational offloading for AR applications on wearable devices based on our practical experiences of designing and developing AR applications on Google Glass. The guidelines have been adopted and proved by our application prototypes.	augmented reality;computation;glass;mobile device;outsourcing;run time (program lifecycle phase);software prototyping;synergetics (haken);wearable computer;wearable technology	Bowen Shi;Ji Yang;Zhanpeng Huang;Pan Hui	2015		10.1145/2733373.2806402	embedded system;augmented reality;simulation;computer hardware;computer science	Mobile	-34.842132331507614	54.821816019051866	189274

In this environment, the way to access heterogeneous sensor networks and the way to integrate various sensor data are very important. The COSMOS is a kind of USN middleware that plays a central service platform part in USN service environment. The COSMOS provides its own services (sensor network abstraction query processing, etc) using multiple heterogeneous sensor networks to the various USN applications. Multiple applications share USN middleware services with other USN applications. Therefore, access control to COSMOS is very important for the applications which shares USN middleware services. This paper introduces the access control model which is implemented in COSMOS to control multiple applications’ access to COSMOS.	access control;database;intelligent environment;middleware	Marie Kim;Hyochan Bang;Hwang Jae Gak;Cheol Sig Pyo	2009	2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC	10.1109/NCM.2009.353	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science;computer security;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Mobile	-40.01756904723972	47.80628626818436	189334
14442abee63209cd235fdfea6e8a86f45a864232	designing usable and secure authentication mechanisms for public spaces	fakultat fur mathematik informatik und statistik;ddc 004;ddc 000	Usable and secure authentication is a research field that approaches different challenges related to authentication, including security, from a human-computer interaction perspective. That is, work in this field tries to overcome security, memorability and performance problems that are related to the interaction with an authentication mechanism. More and more services that require authentication, like ticket vending machines or automated teller machines (ATMs), take place in a public setting, in which security threats are more inherent than in other settings. In this work, we approach the problem of usable and secure authentication for public spaces.#N##N#The key result of the work reported here is a set of well-founded criteria for the systematic evaluation of authentication mechanisms. These criteria are justified by two different types of investigation, which are on the one hand prototypical examples of authentication mechanisms with improved usability and security, and on the other hand empirical studies of security-related behavior in public spaces. So this work can be structured in three steps:#N##N#Firstly, we present five authentication mechanisms that were designed to overcome the main weaknesses of related work which we identified using a newly created categorization of authentication mechanisms for public spaces. The systems were evaluated in detail and showed encouraging results for future use. This and the negative sides and problems that we encountered with these systems helped us to gain diverse insights on the design and evaluation process of such systems in general. It showed that the development process of authentication mechanisms for public spaces needs to be improved to create better results. Along with this, it provided insights on why related work is difficult to compare to each other. Keeping this in mind, first criteria were identified that can fill these holes and improve design and evaluation of authentication mechanisms, with a focus on the public setting.#N##N#Furthermore, a series of work was performed to gain insights on factors influencing the quality of authentication mechanisms and to define a catalog of criteria that can be used to support creating such systems. It includes a long-term study of different PIN-entry systems as well as two field studies and field interviews on real world ATM-use. With this, we could refine the previous criteria and define additional criteria, many of them related to human factors. For instance, we showed that social issues, like trust, can highly affect the security of an authentication mechanism.#N##N#We used these results to define a catalog of seven criteria. Besides their definition, we provide information on how applying them influences the design, implementation and evaluation of a the development process, and more specifically, how adherence improves authentication in general. A comparison of two authentication mechanisms for public spaces shows that a system that fulfills the criteria outperforms a system with less compliance. We could also show that compliance not only improves the authentication mechanisms themselves, it also allows for detailed comparisons between different systems.	authentication;spaces	Alexander De Luca	2011			simulation;engineering;data mining;computer security	Crypto	-46.35634356339142	58.450217350235256	189398

This fact has pushed the need for designing new and more pervasive healthcare systems. In this field, distributed and networked embedded systems, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), are the most suitable technology to achieve continuous monitoring of aged people for their own safety, without affecting their daily activities. This paper proposes recent advancements in this field by introducing WSN4QoL, a Marie Curie project which involves academic and industrial partners from three EU countries. The project aims to propose new WSN-based technologies to meet the specific requirements of pervasive healthcare applications. In particular, in this paper, a Network Coding (NC) mechanism and a distributed localization solution are presented. They have been implemented on WSN testbeds to achieve efficiency in the communications and to enable indoor people tracking. Preliminary results in a real environment show good system performance that meet our expectations.	embedded system;linear network coding;pervasive informatics;requirement;self-organization;testbed	Stefano Tennina;Elli Kartsakli;Aris S.

The absence of protection would increase the risk of piracy to such a level that the economy of this sector would be weakened, perhaps even destroyed.

This paper presents an approach for leveraging insights onto the lifestyle and routines of the users in order to control heating in a smart home through the use of individual climate zones, while ensuring system efficiency at a grid-level scale. Organizing smart living spaces into controllable individual climate zones allows us to exert a more fine-grained level of control. Thus, the system can benefit from a higher degree of freedom to adjust the heat demand according to the system objectives. Whereas district heating planing is only concerned with balancing heat demand among buildings, we extend the reach of these systems inside the home through the use of pervasive sensing and actuation. That is to say, we bridge the gap between traditional district heating systems and pervasive technologies in the home designed to maintain the thermal comfort of the user, in order to increase efficiency. The objective is to automate heating based on the user's preferences and behavioral patterns. The control scheme proposed applies a learning algorithm to take advantage of the sensing data inside the home in combination with an optimization procedure designed to trade-off the discomfort undertaken by the user and heating supply costs. We report on preliminary simulation results showing the effectiveness of our approach and describe the setup of our forthcoming field study.	aggregate data;algorithm;behavioral pattern;fairness measure;field research;home automation;köppen climate classification;mathematical optimization;pervasive informatics;planning;robbins v. lower merion school district;scheduling (computing);seamless3d;simulation;user experience	Radu-Casian Mihailescu;Paul Davidsson	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops)	10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917616	embedded system;simulation;computer science;computer security;hidden markov model;intelligent sensor	HCI	-41.88379929444555	51.66285926178262	189642

It allows to retrieve applications and aspects and weave them together in several ways. Applications and aspects can be loaded from Google Play, personal repositories, or the local memory of a device. Then, two complementary weaving modes are provided: local or remote, using the embedded aspect compiler or the compiler in the cloud, respectively. This provides flexibility and preserves the mobility of the target devices. Weave Droid opens a world of possible applications, not only by benefiting from the already existing uses of AOP on standard machines, but also by the various uses related to the mobile devices. Effectiveness of Weave Droid is demonstrated by weaving aspects with off-the-shelf applications from Google Play.	android;aspect-oriented programming;cloud computing;compiler;embedded system;mobile device;play store;usability	Yliès Falcone;Sebastian Currea	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 27th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering	10.1145/2351676.2351744	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;mobile device;mobile computing	SE	-36.5577387018404	52.24458872566435	190116

Based on RFID technology, it is efficient and feasible to combine the indoor navigation management system with LBS technology. The LBS system provides the functions of mobile device location, communication and service, and RFID based indoor positioning provides the function of locating objects indoor environment. The combination of the two technologies can further facilitate the positioning and navigation in our lives. In this paper, a novel indoor navigation system based on RFID and LBS is presented.

However, there is still no widely accepted standard format to satisfy cloud service providers and users requests. Consequently, it caused the issue of interoperability among them. This paper proposes a cloud service orchestration protocol based on multicast. This protocol separates the network view of service information and the application view of service information when exchanging service information to support interoperability and it uses multicast at various point of protocol to support scalability. Cloud system may have a lot of services and users to communicate with each other. Hence, there are some needs for effective transfer method and the multicast is one of the ideal solutions for this problem. This protocol helps to interoperate with various cloud services like web services and embedded devices.	cloud computing;distributed computing;embedded system;interoperability;multicast;orchestration (computing);scalability;web service	Minseok Pyo;Sangwook Bae;Sunyoung Han	2013	2013 International Conference on IT Convergence and Security (ICITCS)	10.1109/ICITCS.2013.6717860	cloud computing security;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;cloud computing;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;cloud testing;distributed computing;utility computing;world wide web;xcast;computer network;multicast address	HPC	-35.431835654312565	48.691621079179335	190529

Sensor handling is a complicated issue that makes it hard and time-consuming to develop context-aware applications.

The emerging model of cloud-based integration platforms extends these scenarios by transferring business process execution entirely to the cloud. Although this approach provides numerous benefits and opens a new range of opportunities, its adoption requires reconsideration of currently applied practices and their adjustment to a new perspective.  In this work, we analyze the existing approaches to cross-domain service composition based on cloud integration platforms. We particularly focus on the security of these approaches, considering currently dominant OAuth 2.0 web authorization protocol and emerging UMA protocol. For this purpose, we present a new tool that enables UMA support in Apache Camel integration framework. We then analyze and discuss the integration flows relying on both protocols. Finally, based on RMIAS framework, we provide a security assessment of both approaches, presenting an overview of issues and challenges for future work.	apache camel;authorization;business process;cloud computing;cloud-based integration;oauth;on-premises software;reference model of information assurance and security;service composability principle;uniform memory access;user-managed access	Bojan Suzic	2016		10.1145/2851613.2851622	cloud computing security;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;data mining;database;data security;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-48.07004282972907	55.48030861406171	190916
3281ca56d344eb69499f0206c5582aab8c9b7f43	paco: a system-level abstraction for on-loading contextual data to mobile devices		Spatiotemporal context is crucial in modern mobile applications that utilize increasing amounts of context to better predict events and user behaviors, requiring rich records of users’ or devices’ spatiotemporal histories. Maintaining these rich histories requires frequent sampling and indexed storage of spatiotemporal data that pushes the limits of resource-constrained mobile devices. Todayu0027s apps offload processing and storing contextual information, but this increases response time, often relies on the useru0027s data connection, and runs the very real risk of revealing sensitive information. In this paper, we motivate the feasibility of on-loading large amounts of context and introduce Programming Abstraction for Contextual On-loading ( P aco ), an architecture for on-loading data that optimizes for location and time while allowing flexibility in storing additional context. The P aco APIu0027s innovations enable on-loading very dense traces of information, even given devices’ resource constraints. Using real-world traces and our implementation for Android, we demonstrate that P aco can support expressive application queries entirely on-device. Our quantitative evaluation assesses P aco u0027s energy consumption, execution time, and spatiotemporal query accuracy. Further, P aco facilitates unified contextual reasoning across multiple applications and also supports user-controlled release of contextual data to other devices or the cloud; we demonstrate these assets through a proof-of-concept case study.	android;application programming interface;cloud computing;computer data storage;information sensitivity;mobile app;mobile device;personally identifiable information;response time (technology);run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);tracing (software);user interface	Nathaniel Wendt;Christine Julien	2018	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2018.2795604	contextual design;real-time computing;architecture;android (operating system);cloud computing;mobile computing;abstraction;mobile device;distributed computing;response time;computer science	Mobile	-35.91128982041727	55.854267439712075	191255

In this paper, we present our experiences deploying large-scale residential sensing systems in over 20 homes. Deploying small-scale systems in homes can be deceptively easy, but in our deployments we encountered a phase transition in which deployment effort increases dramatically as residential deployments scale up in terms of 1) the number of nodes, 2) the length of time, and 3) the number of houses. In this paper, we distill our experiences down to a set of guidelines and design principles to help future deployments avoid the potential pitfalls of large-scale sensing in homes.	hazard (computer architecture);quorum sensing;sensor;software deployment;testbed	Timothy W.

91bfd880f4ff30f374383db2f29a8951d813aecc	on the accuracy of data sensing in the presence of mobility		Smart Cities aim to improve living conditions by enabling new intelligent services for citizens. These services typically require environmental awareness obtained from distributed sensing systems. The implementation of such sensing systems on a city-wide scale is challenging, as the number of sensors needed can become unpractical. In this paper, we evaluate the utilization of mobile sensors as a possible approach to cover wider areas with fewer sensors and to use opportunistic communication to solve connectivity issues. In this direction, we propose a mobile sensor network using the public transportation system. To validate the feasibility of our proposal, we start by evaluating the performance of important commercial sensors in a mobile scenario, comparing measurements of static and mobile sensors of temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and luminosity. Our findings suggest that there is no or neglectful speed dependency on the measurements taken.	sensor;smart city	Pedro Cruz;João B. Pinto Neto;Miguel Elias M.

These sets of patterns, called mobile-UiTS patterns, are derived from mobile platform vendors’ style guidelines and the common practices found in existing mobile apps. The resulting patterns provide solutions in specific contexts for the transition of mobile app UI design and interaction from one platform to the other ones, and also tackle the scaling issues that arise when moving a mobile app from small-size smart devices (phones) to large-size smart devices (tablets) and vice versa. In this work, we focus mainly on the categorization of these patterns and provide a template for writing the pattern description.	categorization;image scaling;mobile app;mobile device;mobile operating system;scalability;smart device;user interface design	Shah Rukh Humayoun;Steffen Hess;Felix Kiefer;Achim Ebert	2014			mobile search;mobile web;human–computer interaction;computer science;mobile technology;multimedia;mobile deep linking;mobile computing;world wide web	Mobile	-38.2322842725451	52.37401789712596	191705

6c0121c3ffcc14649c602294af34844f2197e5ae	when willeke can get rid of paperwork: a lean infrastructure for qualified information exchange based on trusted identities		As a frequent participant in eSociety, Willeke is often preoccupied with paperwork because there is no easy to use, affordable way to act as a qualified person in the digital world. Confidential interactions take place over insecure channels like e-mail and post. This situation poses risks and costs for service providers, civilians and governments, while goals regarding confidentiality and privacy are not always met. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate an alternative architecture in which identifying persons, exchanging information, authorizing external parties and signing documents will become more user-friendly and secure. As a starting point, each person has their personal data space, provided by a qualified trust service provider that also issues a high level of assurance electronic ID. Three main building blocks are required: (1) secure exchange between the personal data space of each person, (2) coordination functionalities provided by a token based infrastructure, and (3) governance over this infrastructure. Following the design science research approach, we developed prototypes of the building blocks that we will pilot in practice. Policy makers and practitioners that want to enable Willeke to get rid of her paperwork can find guidance throughout this paper and are welcome to join the pilots in the Netherlands.	confidentiality;dataspaces;digital identity;eidas;email;high-level programming language;information exchange;interaction;personal information management;personally identifiable information;smart contract;trust service provider;usability	Sander Dijkhuis;Remco van Wijk;Hidde Dorhout;Nitesh Bharosa	2018		10.1145/3209281.3209324	public relations;service provider;internet privacy;security token;information exchange;computer science;design science research;qualified person;confidentiality;corporate governance;authentication	HCI	-44.74111243330038	57.70803698354662	192455

But in real life, there is no such pre-existing trust relationship among users. Users only forward data or service requests to familiar nodes and ignores the requests or data from unfamiliar users. One of the main problems of mobile crowd sensing is to detect the community structure and achieve trust interaction between users. In the existing community detecting methods of mobile crowd sensing, the weights and direction of the edges were often not considered. This paper introduces a community detection algorithm oriented on directed and weighted network. Reasonable division of the network can be realized by calculating the node activity, relationship strength, relationship density and community coupling degree. Experimental results show that our method can effectively detect and identify the communities in social relationship network, and have a better performance in contrast to the existing algorithm.	algorithm;real life;sensor;weighted network	Jian An;Xiaolin Gui;Xin He;Shiwei Tian;Ruobiao Wu;Yu Sun	2015	2015 IEEE 12th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2015 IEEE 12th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2015 IEEE 15th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops (UIC-ATC-ScalCom)	10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP.2015.230	simulation;internet privacy;computer security	Mobile	-38.30439960269631	58.18314442883578	193641

Based on emerging technologies, a variety of services have been provided for users. The mash-up service means a way to generate a new service by mixing more than two of existing services. Since service developers exploit existing services to make a new service, the efficiency of the development has improved and the period of development decreased as well as the new service fulfill the various requirements. So far, simple mash-up services have been developed, but it is difficult for developers to generate complex mash-up service. In this paper, we proposed framework design for efficient mash-up service development. The proposed framework is designed to satisfy complex and various service requirements. We designed a service scenario called as Campus Safety Management Mash-up Service (CSMMS) to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed framework.	cloud computing;mash-1;mobile computing;requirement	Taeyoung Kim;Hyeonwoo Kim;Dongwoo Kwon;Kisu Ok;Isaac Im;Eunggi Lee;Huigwang Je;Nematullo Rakhmatov;Donghyeok An;Hongtaek Ju	2016	2016 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427131	embedded system;mobile qos;service catalog;service delivery framework;operating system;service design;data as a service;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-39.082646243286916	52.10578575988434	193656

The goal is to develop a platform which enables a user to create, discover and consume mobile services anywhere and at any time on the mobile device. uRun is an application scenario of the project in the field of mobile health and fitness. The uRun framework provides a mobile assistance system particularly for runners, which combines Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 technologies and personalized and situation-aware recommendation mechanisms. The ability to create individual and mobile health and fitness services as well as a personalized and situation-aware assistance system based on a semantic knowledge base are considered to provide an edge over existing consumer-centric health care systems. In this article, we describe the recommendation mechanism and the incorporation of semantic knowledge for the uService platform and the uRun framework.	knowledge base;mhealth;mobile device;personalization;recommender system;web 2.0	Andreas Emrich;Alexandra Chapko;Marc Gräßle;Dirk Werth;Stephan Flake;Jürgen Tacken;Carsten Rust	2011			web service;mobile search;simulation;mobile web;mobile technology;multimedia;mobile computing;world wide web	Web+IR	-38.84987358831917	51.45828060388397	193858

The enabling technologies of this evolution are Industrial Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems and Plug-and-Produce, among others. This paper discusses the idea of a control application following the philosophy of Industrie 4.0 components, and taking advantage of recent research on reliable control schemas. The aim is a control application that is deployable on different platforms, including cloud based, and that is aware of its environment, i.e. computing power, memory, network, etc. This control application will be able to adapt flexibly to given resource and connectivity conditions by shaping its control value matrix, reacting in runtime to changes in the environment.	cyber-physical system;industry 4.0;intelligent network;internet of things;noise shaping;requirement	Santiago Soler Perez Olaya;Martin Wollschlaeger	2017	2017 22nd IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2017.8247772	computer engineering;real-time computing;engineering;industrial internet;digital factory;cloud computing;schema (psychology)	Robotics	-44.61396127492785	46.95561330819108	193979

Together with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), the IoT technologies envision unleashing efficient and more sustainable transportation systems. A connected car is already considered as an IoT resource whose capabilities can be exposed through an IoT platform, but few testbeds provide full-stack, cloud-based environment for connected car services experimentation. This paper formulates several research and engineering challenges for developing such testbed. Our proposed testbed exploits the IoT and microservices to provide advanced functionalities such as (i) the integration of heterogeneous sensors and vehicular communication technologies in a complete end-to-end stack and (ii) an Edge Server for vehicular data annotation, local processing with actuation. The testbed exposes the vehicular resources securely through a Cloud based framework and open APIs. They are supported by The Web of Things (WoT) based interoperable descriptions of vehicular devices and interactions among relevant actors. Finally, the Cloud system deploys the connected car services using microservices philosophy. In addition to that, we present a functional IoT architecture of the testbed, describe its operational phases, novel aspects, prototyping and experimentation details.	android auto;cloud computing;connected car;data validation;end-to-end encryption;extensibility;interaction;internet of things;interoperability;microservices;on-board data handling;prototype;sensor;testbed;web of things;web service;world wide web	Soumya Kanti Datta;Mohammad Irfan Khan;Lara Codeca;Benoît Denis;Jerome Haerri;Christian Bonnet	2018	"""2018 IEEE 19th International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WoWMoM.2018.8449768	computer network;microservices;interoperability;cloud computing;intelligent transportation system;testbed;exploit;web of things;server;computer science	Embedded	-41.74110015474028	47.164450008620705	193993
8769f2a5027d948c9b2201ff0affb1fca1fd5747	towards automated drone surveillance in railways: state-of-the-art and future directions		The usage of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) – widely known as ‘drones’ – is being increasingly investigated in a variety of surveillance scenarios. Being an emerging technology, several challenges still need to be tackled in order to make drones suitable in real applications with strict performance, dependability and privacy requirements. In particular, the monitoring of transit infrastructures represents one critical domain in which drones could be of huge help to reduce costs and possibly increase the granularity of surveillance. Furthermore, drones pave the way to the implementation of smart-sensing functionalities expanding current capabilities in railway monitoring, to support automation, safety of operations, prognostics and even forensic analyses. In this paper we provide a survey of current drone technology and their possible applications to automated railway surveillance, taking into account technical issues and environmental constraints. A current experimentation with drone intelligent video will be addressed, highlighting some preliminary results and future perspectives.

Home-based healthcare is such an example of leveraging pervasive sensors and analyzing sensor data (often in real-time) to guide therapy or intervene. In this paper, we address the challenges in regulatory compliance when designing and deploying healthcare applications on a heterogeneous cloud environment. We propose CareNet framework, consisting of a set of abstraction and APIs, to allow the specification of compliance requirements. This work is a collaboration among computer scientists, medical researchers, healthcare IT and healthcare providers, and its goal is to reduce the gap between the availability of software defined infrastructure and meeting regulatory compliance in healthcare applications.	computer scientist;pervasive psql;pervasive informatics;real-time locating system;requirement;sensor;software-defined infrastructure	Peilong Li;Chen Xu;Yan Luo;Yu Cao;Jomol Mathew;Yunsheng Ma	2017		10.1145/3040992.3041007	application programming interface;computer science;knowledge management;operating system;data mining;computer security;software-defined data center	Mobile	-45.016037647512654	48.17504966279761	194103

Whether they are mobile devices, internal or external systems or cloud-based systems data is generated, stored, processed and distributed in many different systems. This leads to various information security and privacy risks. To address these issues, especially from the viewpoint of data management and data governance we propose a conceptual analysis model. Thereby, our model takes into account the dimension of data storage location together with their respective risks and costs while considering the strategic value and sensitivity of data assets. For demonstrating our approach we developed a visual analytics web application which is based on parallel sets visualizations. By being able to interactively explore the analysis dimensions users are supported in developing enhanced situational awareness for making decisions in the context of secure and economical data storage.	big data;cloud computing;computer data storage;data governance;data storage tag;information security;interactivity;mobile device;privacy;variable (computer science);visual analytics;web application	Sabri Hassan;Günther Pernul	2014		10.1145/2684200.2684333	analytics;big data;data quality;computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	DB	-42.52490527739672	59.97711597472408	194155

Motivated by this success, community-awareness also has become a hot topic in the mobile world. Despite considerable efforts, however, mobile solutions still cannot compete with their Internet counterparts. A key feature of community-aware applications is profile matching. To a large extent, the missing popularity of mobile approaches can be explained with the problems traditional one-to-one keyword matching causes in a purely decentralized environment: Expressive keywords are unlikely to match because of a lack in user density, and a superficial keyword classification misses the application needs. Hence, we face the challenge to compare characteristic topics in purely mobile applications. To address this challenge, this paper presents a fundamentally new matching scheme based on a combination of topology analysis and distance labeling. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme has indeed the potential to facilitate the comparison of highly specialized keywords in mobile environments.	experiment;file sharing;instant messaging;internet;mobile app;one-to-one (data model);the superficial	Michael Kuhn;Roger Wattenhofer	2006			radio access network;mobile identification number;mobile search;mobile web;public land mobile network;gsm services;mobile database;computer science;mobile technology;distributed computing;mobile deep linking;internet privacy;mobile station;mobile computing;world wide web;mobile communications over ip;mobile ip;mobile payment	Web+IR	-39.60313298288156	52.903594241159524	194395
335a14ea0ff11e27a0eb30c134f94128f465e7a3	a quantitative approach to non-intrusive computing	ubiquitous computing;pervasive computing	One important characteristic of pervasive computing, which is how to make it non-intrusive so that users can focus on their tasks, has received little formal attention. Nowadays, many computing entities, including smart devices and software applications, are involved in our daily lives, and users need to deal with them as well as with other people. People are easy to reach with multiple devices. We believe that there should be a systematic way to help users avoid intrusive interactions. This paper analyzes the intrusion problem for generic interactions and presents a model for posing and answering two questions: will an interaction intrude on its receiver if delivered, and given that the interaction is deliverable, how can it be delivered effectively and not too overtly? The essential factors in the model are quantified for comparison and computation. We also show how a non-intrusivecomputing system can be implemented based on the model.		Hao Chen;James P.

One common feature of those environments is the use of access control mechanisms based on the user identity. However, most of those federations have realized that user identity is not enough to offer a more grained access control and value added services. Therefore, additional information, such as user attributes, need to be taken into account. This paper presents how one of those real and widely spread identity federations, eduroam, has been extended in order to make use of user attributes and to adopt authorization decisions during the access control process. This authorization framework has been integrated by means of the NASSAML infrastructure, which defines a network access control service based on SAML and the AAA architecture.	aaa (video game industry);access control service;access network;authorization;control system;federated identity;network access control;security assertion markup language;software deployment	Manuel Sáchez Cuenca;Gabriel López Millán;Óscar Cánovas Reverte;Antonio F.

These were previously only available in separate specialized devices with limited functionality or non-mobile equipment. In addition, mobile platform providers have taken a more open approach, enabling community-members to develop applications for their platforms and to deliver them as readily consumable services to the public. Both trends combined have led to a significant increase in the number of innovative mobile applications. More recently, leveraging mobile users' geolocation for provision of services has become the focus of a number of organizations active in the field. In this paper we propose a solution that addresses some challenges when creating location based social networks and offering relevant services to participants in these networks. We have applied this solution in a use case with an Australian based transportation service provider.	consumability;geolocation;mobile app;mobile device;social network	Tobias Lange;Marek Kowalkiewicz;Thomas Springer;Tobias Raub	2009		10.1145/1629890.1629910	use case;user-centered design;mobile search;mobile qos;computer science;knowledge management;location-based service;mobile device;prototype;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;social network	Mobile	-39.28606118841948	52.0172111808893	195705

The framework also enables multimedia contents to be implemented as compound documents. It also enables documents or multimedia to define their own itineraries among nodes and to transmit other content as first-class objects to their destinations. The dynamic deployment of network protocols to exchange content can be achieved by means of GUI-based manipulation of compound documents, because the protocols can be treated as documents or multimedia contents. Therefore, the approach allows the developer to easily and rapidly configure network processing in the same way as if he/she had edited the documents.

Providing seamless connection and collaboration between low and high capacity nodes, i.e. interoperability, remains a challenge. This paper presents an approach for interoperability among nodes of a smart lighting system via a gateway node considering nodes of two platforms: low capacity wireless light sensors and actuators on the one hand and high capacity Smart-M3 nodes on the other hand. The gateway node is able to communicate over heterogeneous networks using different communication protocols, transferring light model information between the smart space nodes.	as-interface;communications protocol;heterogeneous computing;interaction;pixel;prototype;resource description framework;seamless3d;semantic interoperability;sensor;service implementation bean;smart lighting;smart-m3	Sachin Bhardwaj;Tanir Ozcelebi;Johan J.

Application of smart solutions will enable human living environments to use technology, information and data to improve infrastructures and services in the behalf of human beings. The welfare of elderly people living alone, at their homes, or, in rest houses, can significantly be improved with the introduction of these smart solutions. Wireless indoor tracking of elderly people is an important feature together with the DLMS/COSEM protocol. Above all using low power devices to assist and monitoring them. The paper highlights implementation in the real world, proposing a method that can be suited in a large range of cases thanks to the scene analysis. An indoor scalable infrastructure allows the tracking method to be implemented incrementally with different performances, where optimal accuracy comes from an adaptable threshold.

A principal proves that he has authorization for a particular action by demonstrating the existence of an acyclic chain of bindings from a specified principal to himself where the sequence of labels in the chain matches a template. This template is in an easily-computed subset of regular path expressions. Our restrictions to acyclic paths and to a subset of path expressions enable us to permit controlled delegation, relax the requirement of global agreement on role names, and provide an intuitive abstraction.

Various ‘intelligent’ appliances such as cellular phones, air-conditioners, home security devices, home theatres, etc. are set to realize the concept of a smart home. They have given rise to a Personal Area Network in home environment, where all these appliances can be interconnected and monitored using a single controller. Busy families and individuals with physical limitation represent an attractive market for home automation and networking. A wireless home network that does not incur additional costs of wiring would be desirable. Bluetooth technology, which has emerged in late 1990s, is an ideal solution for this purpose. This paper describes an application of Bluetooth technology in home automation and networking environment. It proposes a network, which contains a remote, mobile host controller and several client modules (home appliances). The client modules communicate with the host controller through Bluetooth devices. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

To be effective, services composition should choose among the discovered services the most suitable ones and this a non-trivial task given the (typically) very large number of available services. In this work we propose a framework for assessing the reputation of a set of services as a measure for the suitability of such services in coping with a given task. We take as a starting point an approach proposed for team recommendation that aims at maximize the overall team reputation, based on the feedback that each team member receives from other members. It is important to point out that several important differences among the approaches exist - which we highlight in the paper - that do not allow for a mere adaptation from the team recommendation setting.	centralized computing;computation;feedback;internet of things;mobile phone;peer-to-peer;service composability principle;sybil attack;transitive closure;web of things	Lorenzo Bossi;Stefano Braghin;Alberto Trombetta	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing	10.1109/SCC.2014.95	public relations;web of things;business;internet privacy;world wide web	Robotics	-40.53443930305385	57.381119943150146	197006

Currently, Diagnostics and collision prevention telematics services are more important than the personal information telematics services. So In this paper, we propose a very flexible and efficient system for automotive diagnostic and the update of the vehicle's software using a telematics device between the remote download DM server and the local ECUs within the vehicle. This system will enable the user to inquire and configurate the vehicle status in real-time using a personal computer or PDA via wireless network.

Based on the seamless integration of computing with the physical world via sensors and actuators, this revolution will accrue many benefits. Potentially, its impact could be similar to that of the current Internet. We envision data and services that will be available any place, any time, to all people, not just technically sophisticated organizations and individuals. Major systems such as those in transportation, manufacturing, infrastructure protection, process control, and electricity distribution networks will become more efficient and capable. People will be safer and experience an improved standard of living. New applications not even imagined today will become a reality. Although ingredients of this vision have existed for several years and the concept of pervasive computing does not differ radically from the work we describe, we believe developers must focus on the physical, real-time, and embedded aspects of pervasive computing. We refer to this domain as physical computing systems. For pervasive computing to achieve its promise, developers must create not only high-level system software and application solutions, but also low-level embedded systems solutions. To better understand physical computing’s advantages, we consider three application areas: assisted living, emergency response systems for natural or man-made disasters, and protecting critical infrastructures at the national level.	as-interface;confluence;critical infrastructure protection;embedded system;emergency response systems;high- and low-level;internet;pervasive informatics;physical computing;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;seamless3d;sensor;ubiquitous computing	John A.

One problem in enabling portable applications is metadata about building infrastructures. The challenge is that there are multiple ways to annotate sensor data and actuation points, which makes it difficult to have a proper level of abstraction. Another problem is the amount of insufficient or missing metadata. This paper presents an analysis of the leading software platforms for sensor infrastructures with respect to how metadata is handled. Furthermore, the paper also presents an analysis of the leading metadata formats with respect to how they support building applications. Based on the analysis, we conclude that there is a need for a structured way to manage metadata in buildings. Therefore we present our vision of a process view on discovery, maintenance and validation of metadata in buildings.	database schema;green building xml;high-level programming language;industry foundation classes;intelligent control;requirement;sensor;ubiquitous computing	Emil Holmegaard;Aslak Johansen;Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)	10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457145	maintenance engineering;metadata modeling;computer science;units of measurement;data mining;database;informatics;metadata;world wide web;actuator	Robotics	-40.847182340636984	46.83007464472872	197284

Several solutions have been used to overcome the different requirements for IoT applications based on already existing technologies e.g.: cellular networks, RFID, etc., whilst giving rise to a technology called dedicated IoT networks (SigFox, LoRa, Weightless Ingenu, etc.). Also, IoT usage area has been increased from smart grid networks to smart cities, healthcare or smart wear usage and even to IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) applications. Nowadays the usage capabilities can hardly be localized with boundaries always newer and newer ideas are coming. This paper gives some hint why new technologies are evolved, what are their limitations with also giving an insight of the most prevalent security vulnerabilities for IoT networks and the analysis for the above-mentioned technologies respect to them.	internet of things;radio-frequency identification;requirement;sfiaplus;smart city;usability;vulnerability (computing);weightless (wireless communications);while	Eszter Kail;Anna Bánáti;Erdodi Laszlo;Miklós Kozlovszky	2018	2018 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)	10.1109/SACI.2018.8440945	computer security;control engineering;industrial internet;smart grid;emerging technologies;internet of things;usability;computer science;cellular network;weightless	Embedded	-44.30391897586044	51.84428168858547	197706

Our Assistive Care Loop Framework (ACLF) is an in-house healthcare application capable of monitoring the health conditions of aged/patients over a dedicated period of time by deploying the BAWSN as the monitoring component. However, the wireless medium used in the BAWSN for communications is prone to vulnerabilities that could open a door to attackers tampering with or compromising the user's data privacy. Hence, it is imperative to maintain the privacy and integrity of the data to gain the confidence and hence, the acceptance of the users of the healthcare applications. Furthermore, in time-critical applications, the vital health conditions must be monitored at regular intervals within their specified critical time. Therefore, the security model proposed for the BAWSN must not incur undue overheads when meeting the critical time requirements of the application. In this paper, we propose and implement a secure adaptive triple-key scheme (aTKS) for the BAWSN to achieve the privacy and integrity of the monitored data with minimal overheads. We then present the performance results of our scheme for the BAWSN, using real-time test-bed implementations and simulations.	confidentiality;imperative programming;information privacy;real-time clock;requirement;simulation;software deployment;testbed;vulnerability (computing);window of opportunity	Venki Balasubramanian;Doan B.

Based on increasing connectivity and seamless integration of advanced functionality into vehicles, a new challenge is the development of holistic and standardized privacy approaches. So far, privacy has often been considered as a singular task, neglecting the impact of a holistic viewpoint on automotive data. In this paper we provide an identity-based data model, a way to define a structured and flexible view to the acquired vehicular data, i.e., identifying information. We develop the data model as a graph, provide a formal notation and demonstrate its application with an example. The proposed scheme of the model is of multiple uses and the formal notation shows to serve additional privacy features to our model, e.g., privacy risk assessment.	data model;holism;privacy;risk assessment;seamless3d	Naim Asaj;Björn Wiedersheim;Albert Held;Michael Weber	2012	2012 International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2012 International Confernece on Social Computing	10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.87	data modeling;privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;graph theory;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-45.89356191066797	59.83550690956363	197873

However, large-scale task management and location privacy are important factors for participants in spatial crowdsourcing. In this paper, we propose the use of an R-tree spatial cloaking-based task-assignment method for large-scale spatial crowdsourcing. We use an estimated R-tree based on the requested crowdsourcing tasks to reduce the crowdsourcing server-side inserting cost and enable the scalability. By using Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR)-based spatial anonymous data without exact position data, this method preserves the location privacy of participants in a simple way. In our experiment, we showed that our proposed method is faster than the current method, and is very efficient when the scale is increased.	computer data storage;computer multitasking;crowdsourcing;minimum bounding rectangle;programming paradigm;r-tree;real-time data;real-time locating system;scalability;server (computing);server-side;smart device	Yan Li;Byeong Seok Shin	2017	Symmetry	10.3390/sym9120311	scalability;combinatorics;theoretical computer science;task management;minimum bounding rectangle;mathematics;cloaking;r-tree;crowdsourcing	HCI	-38.47822427835121	60.026018817350945	197881

All these scenarios involve the transmission of location information over an IP network, and all raise significant issues about that information's privacy, security, and control. The IETF's Geographic Location/Privacy working group (Geopriv WG) has created a set of standards for sending location information coupled with privacy rules over the Internet. The standards call for the creation of location objects (LOs), which contain a location along with a limited set of rules that can point to an external set of more complex rules, if necessary. In development over the past few years, Geopriv is approaching an initial completion stage and appears likely to be implemented in several key technologies	internet;location-based service;privacy	John B.

d672da92fbf283a15bc74bce0d31a9df74027f57	quantitative evaluation of qos prediction in iot		Internet of Things (IoT) applications, are typically built from services provided by heterogeneous devices, which are potentially resource constrained and/or mobile. These services and applications are widespread and a key research question is how to predict user side quality of service (QoS), to ensure optimal selection and composition of services. Invoking all available IoT services for evaluation is impractical due to the exponential growth in these services. To assess the current state of the art related to this research question we conduct a quantitative evaluation of QoS prediction approaches, particularly those that use matrix factorisation (MF) for collaborative QoS prediction. These approaches derive from the collaborative filtering model used in recommender systems, which avoids the problems of many other QoS prediction approaches of requiring additional invoking of available IoT components on behalf of the user. We conduct comprehensive experiments based on a real-world large-scale QoS dataset as well as a transformation of this dataset to more closely estimate IoT services, to show the prediction accuracy of these approaches. We also give a demonstration of how they can be used in a small scale example.	collaborative filtering;experiment;internet of things;monoid factorisation;quality of service;recommender system;time complexity	Gary White;Andrei Palade;Christian Cabrera;Siobhán Clarke	2017	2017 47th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN-W)	10.1109/DSN-W.2017.26	recommender system;mobile qos;collaborative filtering;quality of service;computer science;data mining;distributed computing;internet of things	Robotics	-40.578870254390644	57.49328970679659	198312

Running at the application enabler sub-layer of a WBC service provider (WBC-SP)’s node the advertisement data is formatted by using the abstract syntax notation (ASN.1) and organized into segments to reduce the access time, and thus minimizing the mobile terminal’s (MT) energy consumption on this service. The intelligent application is implemented within three tiers of the WBC service layer: a service discovery and maintenance tier acting as a client-server distributed system for data collection and organization; an intelligent application tier holding all business logic and common application programming interfaces (APIs); and a multi-agent system (MAS) tier maintaining the advertisement, discovery and association (ADA) agents’ lifecycle, and supplying directory facilitator services and message transport services.

Its innovative idea is that buyers can become resellers and earn a provision for redistributing purchased files. With the """"Mobile Music Messenger"""", a J2ME application for modern mobile phones, users can find other users with similar musical taste to sell them own songs or to find new pleasing music for themselves. The distributed recommendation algorithm uses the peer-to-peer system JXTA while avoiding a central database. Users may pre-listen recommended songs and contact each other. These functions are embedded in a music chat system, whose future enhancements will be covered as well. The application can be extended to function for all mobile music providers. The mobile users of all partaking mobile music stores will become mobile affiliate community"""	algorithm;embedded system;jxta;mobile app;mobile phone;peer-to-peer;virtual goods	Jürgen Nützel;Mario Kubek	2006	2006 Second International Conference on Automated Production of Cross Media Content for Multi-Channel Distribution (AXMEDIS'06)	10.1109/AXMEDIS.2006.7	mobile search;mobile web;mobile database;computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	Mobile	-36.97337677084742	53.498824543396424	198807

In this review article, we summarize the latest developments of big sensor data systems (a term to conceptualize the application of the big data model towards networked sensor systems) in various representative studies for urban environments, including for air pollution monitoring, assistive living, disaster management systems, and intelligent transportation. An important focus is the inclusion of how value is extracted from the big data system. We also discuss some recent techniques for big data acquisition, cleaning, aggregation, modeling, and interpretation in large scale sensor-based systems. We conclude the paper with a discussion on future perspectives and challenges of sensor-based data systems in the big data era.

The HNS architecture includes an HNS gateway and three home network subsystems, i.e., home appliance, security and messaging subsystems. The main objective of the integrated system is to remotely monitor and control the devices in the HNS via laptop computer or a GSM mobile terminal. In addition to responding to remote queries, the managed devices (e.g., home appliances or burglar alarm system) can actively send alerting messages to a mobile terminal when an abnormal state occurs. Through the HNS gateway, the monitoring and control information is diffused to the Internet/GSM network. An implementation of the HNS system is described in this paper as an illustration of the feasibility of the proposed architecture. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

fdd709a6f33f7cfc46c7827ab69e786ba4a392e5	recent advances delivered by mobile cloud computing and internet of things for big data applications: a survey		The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that is growing rapidly in the field of telecommunications and especially in the modern field of wireless telecommunications. The main goal of the interaction and cooperation between things and objects sent through the wireless networks is to fulfill the objective set to them as a combined entity. In addition, based on the technology of wireless networks, both the technologies of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) and IoT develop rapidly. In this paper, we combine the two aforementioned technologies (i.e., MCC and IoT) with the technology of the Big Data in order to examine the common features and tο discover which of the MCC and IoT benefits improve the use of the Big Data applications. Finally, we present the contribution of MCC and IoT individually to the technology of Big Data.

In this study, a JIT ubiquitous output system is established based on the application of a handheld intelligent device. The system can be regarded as a location aware service (LAS). The JIT ubiquitous output system starts from the detection of the user’s location and speed using the global positioning system (GPS) on the hand-held intelligent device. The detection results and the document to be printed are sent to the server with a reasoning module that searches for the nearby service locations to determine the output location, so that the document can be printed out just before the user reaches the output location, i.e. just in time. To this end, the fuzzy Dijkstra’s algorithm is proposed.

A practical trust management system for the WebCom architecture is described. KeyNote-based authorization credentials are used to determine whether a WebCom server is authorised to schedule, and whether a WebCom client is authorised to execute, mobile application components. Secure WebCom provides a meta-language for bringing together the components of a distributed application in such a way that the components need not concern themselves with security issues.	authorization;component-based software engineering;computer architecture;credential;distributed computing;identifier;keynote;mobile app;scheduling (computing);server (computing);trust management (information system)	Simon N.

This application has found to improve substantially the efficiency, and at the same time eliminates the potential for human error and security breaches in the performance of electronic contract management and processing tasks.	anytime algorithm;contract management;digital watermarking;electronic signature;human error;portable document format;secure environment;wd anywhere access;world wide web	Thomas Kwok;Thao Nguyen	2007			electronic signature;computer science;document management system;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	OS	-48.06102933928715	59.51917130864583	199548
d5485965c9827e41cc0814a1a105473712ffa122	carenet: building regulation-compliant home-based healthcare services with software-defined infrastructure		Healthcare network and computing infrastructure is rapidly changing from closed environments to open environments that incorporate new devices and new application scenarios. Home-based healthcare is such an example of leveraging pervasive sensors and analyzing sensor data (often in real-time) to guide therapy or intervene. In this paper, we address the challenges in regulatory compliance when designing and deploying healthcare applications on a heterogeneous cloud environment. We propose the CareNet framework, consisting of a set of APIs and secure data transmission mechanisms, to facilitate the specification of home-based healthcare services running on the software-defined infrastructure (SDI). This work is a collaboration among computer scientists, medical researchers, healthcare IT and healthcare providers, and its goal is to reduce the gap between the availability of SDI and meeting regulatory compliance in healthcare applications. Our prototype demonstrates the feasibility of the framework and serves as testbed for novel experimental studies of emerging healthcare applications.	computer scientist;pervasive psql;pervasive informatics;prototype;real-time locating system;sensor;software-defined infrastructure;testbed	Peilong Li;Chen Xu;Yan Luo;Yu Cao;Jomol Mathew;Yunsheng Ma	2017	2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)		knowledge management;systems engineering;access control;engineering;health care;cloud computing;data transmission;software-defined data center;information technology;testbed;computer security	Mobile	-45.007454999879464	48.198224644356834	199589

Textile has the ability to easily change the experience of an environment. This quality combined with the dynamics of ubiquitous computing and context awareness creates an interesting design space to investigate. The examples we show, a tablecloth and a drapery, are designed for use on festive and social events. For the first prototype we have chosen a design suitable for weddings as this is a well-known event for most people. The underlying technology is Smart-Its, small context-aware computers with ad-hoc networking capabilities. The result is dynamic textiles where the pattern changes according to the immediate surrounding.

On top of that, the Web of Things (WoT) presents a new World Wide Web (WWW) with vast contents from thing resources. To date, these resources are being exploited only in business applications where data mining processes are run. This paper addresses a different use of these resources in which, end users are the resources' principal consumer. We propose a Browsing as a Service for the IoT that allows building representations of connected things on the Web or homepages for things. Browsing these homepages let end users to interact directly with the things, such as view things' data or carry out actuations. Our evaluation shows that the proposed homepages for things can be served well by constrained devices with computation resources as low as 16kB of memory and up to 18-MHz system clock. Using our cloud system, we present a demonstration that show how homepages for things can be designed and deployed by manufacturers and developers.	browsing;cloud computing;computation;data mining;handy board;internet of things;www;web application;web of things;world wide web	Nam Ky Giang;Minkeun Ha;Daeyoung Kim	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing	10.1109/SCC.2015.26	web of things;engineering;database;internet privacy;world wide web	Robotics	-40.73257643999179	50.94898025043827	199828

Moreover, the development has spread to many aspects in all walks of life and got powerful promotion from advanced information and communication technologies. Its pervasive moves, however, leave great concerns behind, which can cause roadblocks in the path of its prosperity. Three of them, identified as heterogeneity, user privacy, and context-awareness, have called for much attention and investigation in both research and industry community world-wide. In response to the call, we propose an elastic and open design platform named OpenLS Privacy-aware Middleware (OPM) for location-based applications as a unified solution to these issues.	context awareness;location-based service;middleware;open design;pervasive informatics;privacy	Tran Khanh Dang;Chan Nam Ngo;Trong Nhan Phan;Nguyen Nhat Minh Ngo	2012		10.1145/2184751.2184824	embedded system;computer science;operating system;location-based service;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	HCI	-40.78158373869338	52.50215929428727	199960
