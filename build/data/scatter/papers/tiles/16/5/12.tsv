The success of such deployments very much depends on the design and implementation of essential, secure mechanisms for authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) that not only ensure the robustness of such facilities against intrusions and unauthorized use but also ease experimentation and system administration in such complex environments. C-BAS is an initiative in this direction that uses a secure and flexible certificate-based AAA architecture for SDN experimental facilities. Advanced certificate-based authentication and authorization makes C-BAS inherently resilient against attacks specific to traditional AAA mechanisms, increases flexibility and autonomy in experimental facility system administration, and facilitates federation. This article introduces the implementation details of C-BAS, explains its features through use cases, and evaluates its computational performance.	aaa (video game industry);authentication;authorization;broadcast auxiliary service;computation;experiment;software-defined networking;system administrator	Umar Toseef;Kostas Pentikousis	2015	2015 IEEE Fourth Symposium on Network Cloud Computing and Applications (NCCA)	10.1109/NCCA.2015.16	lead;computer science;operating system;authorization certificate;authentication;authorization;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-46.237367801644474	66.90481051714231	62459

They achieve fast signing and verification, and sign the message at most 1 time. OTSSs are used to replace asymmetric signatures that incur highercosts in cases where performance is critical. For example, OTSSs are employed in chip cards where low computation complexity is required. The secret key and public key of an OTSS are used only once; this creates a problem when we use a certificate-based public key system with the OTSS since the public key certification will cause the certification authority CA to offer public key evidence to the signer every time the OTSS is used. It appears that this evidence is unnecessary and impractical. In this paper, we discuss the certificate problems faced in the OTSS public key system. In our proposed scheme based on the self-certified public key system, it is recess any to contact the CA only 1 time and only 1 certificate needs to be obtained from the CA. The communication costs of the signer and CA are greatly reduced as comparing to that in case of the tree-authentication-based scheme proposed by Merkle [6].	ampersand;authentication;certificate authority;computation;digital signature;hash function;key (cryptography);one-way function;public key certificate;public-key cryptography;smart card	Dai-Rui Lin;Chih-I Wang;D.

a80f5a4956cf4a893a71d65c390abf64a398a808	ephemerality is the new black: a novel perspective on location data management and location privacy in lbs		Location information is essential to location-based services (LBS), but also has the potential to reveal sensitive information about the users of LBS to malicious agents. Therefore, location privacy is an important issue to address for both users and providers of LBS. In this paper, we investigate how location privacy can be realized in the context of a location-based service. Based on a review of architectures for LBS and key issues related to location privacy, we discuss several measures to integrate location privacy into LBS. In order to address privacy threats associated with the storage of location information, we propose an approach based on privacy-by-design principles and introduce a conceptual model to facilitate the implementation of those principles. In addition, we investigate the role of location data management in the context of privacy preservation, and propose the concept of temporal and spatial ephemerality to improve location privacy in the context of a location-based service.	location-based service	Mehrnaz Ataei;Christian Kray	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-47289-8_18	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-44.1174020661098	60.87482988354916	62677

We give a method for the delegation of these credentials, which allows the delegator to reveal a subset of his/her credentials to a delegatee, who in turn can control revelation of this subset to a verifier. Our method also supports blinded showing of credentials to a specified verifier in order to hide the credentials from the delegatee, when desired. Privacy is preserved in all cases under a strong attack model that includes collusion between an attacker (Malice) and the Certification Authority that issued the credentials.

The library is small enough to port to a Java-enabled cellular phone.  In this paper, we present a new electronic voting system using the ModInt library, in which voters have their ballots encrypted  with the public key of a trusted agent and cast them to an untrusted server, which tallies them without decrypting the ballot  and updates a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) consisting of log n ciphertexts. The privacy of voters is therefore assured  assuming that the security of the public-key crypto system is maintained, and the trusted party keeps their private key secure.  This feature reduces the costs of management of the counting server, which is now free from the risks of being compromised.  	library (computing);mobile phone	Hiroaki Kikuchi;Junji Nakazato	2004		10.1007/1-4020-8143-X_12	embedded system;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system	ECom	-44.6871787221156	70.98443287505357	62886

However, the anonymity and location privacy are critical problems in seamless roaming environments. In this paper, we propose an anonymous home binding update scheme (AHBU) for mobile IPv6 networks to achieve both anonymity and location privacy for mobile nodes. In addition, we implement a mutual authentication mechanism and construct a shared secret key between the mobile node and the foreign gateway. Unlike existing anonymity and location privacy schemes, AHBU works efficiently in scalable, real-time, and highly mobile environments. Besides, it achieves reasonable degree of anonymity and high level of mobile node's location privacy. Compared to the mix-based scheme, our scheme has less computation overhead because it requires only two public key encryption operations.	computation;degree of anonymity;encryption;high-level programming language;job control (unix);key (cryptography);mobile ip;mutual authentication;overhead (computing);public-key cryptography;real-time clock;real-time computing;routing;scalability;seamless3d;shared secret	Sanaa Taha;Xuemin Shen	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134034	mobile search;logic gate;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.02425961748025	72.9809762669494	62932

9192e5e81dbb8b34557591ab5ad1fc49310fb402	on the privacy provisions of bloom filters in lightweight bitcoin clients	personalization;security;privacy	Lightweight Bitcoin clients are gaining increasing adoption among Bitcoin users, owing to their reduced resource and bandwidth consumption. These clients support a simplified payment verification (SPV) mode as they are only required to download and verify a part of the block chain---thus supporting the usage of Bitcoin on constrained devices, such as smartphones. SPV clients rely on Bloom filters to receive transactions that are relevant to their local wallet. These filters embed all the Bitcoin addresses used by the SPV clients, and are outsourced to more powerful Bitcoin nodes which then only forward to those clients transactions relevant to their outsourced Bloom filters.  In this paper, we explore the privacy of existing SPV clients. We show analytically and empirically that the reliance on Bloom filters within existing SPV clients leaks considerable information about the addresses of Bitcoin users. Our results show that an SPV client who uses a modest number of Bitcoin addresses (e.g., < 20) risks revealing almost all of his addresses. We also show that this information leakage is further exacerbated when users restart their SPV clients and/or when the adversary has access to more than one Bloom filter pertaining to the same SPV client. Motivated by these findings, we propose an efficient countermeasure to enhance the privacy of users which rely on SPV clients; our proposal can be directly integrated within existing SPV client implementations.	adversary (cryptography);bitcoin;bloom filter;download;information leakage;privacy;smartphone;spectral leakage	Arthur Gervais;Srdjan Capkun;Ghassan O.

This paper first improves the RSA algorithm in the cloud environment by increasing the length of the RSA key to an extent that it can quickly generate big primes. Then, we merge AES and RSA algorithms on the basis of the improved RSA algorithm. This is called a hybrid encryption algorithm which is suitable for security of the lightweight data in cloud storage environment in order to further enhance the confidentiality of data in the cloud. The experimental result shows that the hybrid encryption algorithm has advantages of fast encryption and decryption, more secure, and it is also able to settle the security problems of users' lightweight data in a certain extent.	algorithm;cloud computing;cloud storage;confidentiality;cryptography;encryption;hybrid cryptosystem;rsa (cryptosystem)	Chengliang Liang;Ning Ye;Reza Malekian;Ruchuan Wang	2016	2016 2nd International Symposium on Agent, Multi-Agent Systems and Robotics (ISAMSR)	10.1109/ISAMSR.2016.7810021	multiple encryption;encryption software;40-bit encryption;plaintext-aware encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;distributed computing;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;deterministic encryption;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption	Security	-40.803003347825786	68.42967580518929	63057

MFS is structured around the twin abstractions of lightweight sessions and snapshots, along with a highly configurable capability-based security architecture. Sessions simplify and clarify collaborative semantics. Snapshots allow atomic access to arbitrary collections of files, and allow sharing to be defined in a simple and expressive fashion. MFS’s security architecture is a layered system that allows diverse usage scenarios. Pure capability-based access allows clients to access data without needing expensive public key or authentication servers, or complicated administration. However, MFS’s capabilities can also be watermarked, allowing a range of services to be added on a per-mount basis, up to and including traditional user authentication based on passwords or public keys. Basing the system around the use of immutable snapshots enables the underlying system to use several performance optimizations aggressively. Performance results from our MFS prototype show that, far from adding overhead, the use of snapshots allows the system to perform comparably to NFS in the local-area case and significantly outperform existing systems in wide-area environments.	access control;authentication;capability-based security;computer security;digital watermarking;immutable object;layered security;layered system;moose file system;overhead (computing);password;prototype;public-key cryptography;snapshot (computer storage);snapshot isolation;watermark (data file)	Vasile Gaburici;Peter J.

In current systems, users have to reveal their exact, often sensitive locations to issue a GNN query. This calls for private GNN queries. However, existing methods for private GNN queries either are computationally too expensive for mobile phones or cannot resist sophisticated attacks. Our approach can efficiently and effectively process an important variant of private GNN queries: queries that minimize the maximum distance for any user in the group. To achieve high efficiency we develop a distributed multi-party private protocol to compute the maximum function. Our method exploits geometric constraints to prune POIs and avoids unnecessary data disclosure. In contrast to current state of the art multi-party private protocols, our proposed protocol does not rely on cryptography and has a fast runtime. Importantly, a user does not have to provide a location directly, even in imprecise form.	aggregate data;computation;cryptography;mobile phone;point of interest;privacy	A. K. M.

f0d946d26e0ef08ade48947155209a1baf95f7dc	\delta -doca: achieving privacy in data streams		Numerous real world applications continuously publish data streams to benefit people in their daily activities. However, these applications may collect and release sensitive information about individuals and lead to serious risks of privacy breach. Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a mathematical model to release sensitive information of users while hindering the process of distinguishing individuals’ records on databases. Although DP has been widely used for protecting the privacy of individual users’ data, it was not designed, in essence, to provide its guarantees for data streams, since these data are potentially unbounded sequences and continuously generated at rapid rates. Consequently, the noise required to mask the effect of sequences of objects in data streams tend to be higher. In this paper, we design a new technique, named (delta )-DOCA, to publish data streams under differential privacy. Our approach provides a strategy to determine the sensitivity value of DP and reduces the necessary noise. Our experiments show that the application of (delta )-DOCA to anonymize data streams not only reduced significantly the necessary noise to apply differential privacy, but also allowed for the output data to preserve the original data distribution.

d544c2377d3a4de43af7aac17796d107fbc871ef	secure encryption scheme with key exchange for two server architecture		In Distributed environment authentication and keyexchange mechanisms plays a major role. Generally in authentication a client and server agree upon a cryptographic key which is mutually exchanged. Earlier passwords were stored in a single server where if an intruder gains access of that server by some malicious attacks then all the passwords stored in the database are to be compromised and therefore the e-commerce application security is endangered. In-order to improve the efficiency and performance of the authentication mechanisms we involve multiple servers to store the passwords and participate in key-exchange and authentication process so as to ensure that even a single server is compromised the whole system’s security is not in threat and also generating a nonce values randomly for every session corresponds to a two level security mechanism where the scope of an attacker to pretend as the legitimate user and login into the system is completely restricted. In this model the passwords are stored in their equivalent hash values and they are spitted into multiple servers. Making it even more difficult for the attacker to determine the password even by reverse engineering he cannot intercept the actual password form segments of hash value. Hence, we can present this model as safe and secure password based authentication scheme using key exchange mechanism.

We have designed and implemented a comprehensive single sign-on (SSO) authentication architecture that confederates WLAN service providers through trusted identity providers. Users select the appropriate SSO authentication scheme from the authentication capabilities announced by the WLAN service provider, and can block the exposure of their privacy information while roaming. In addition, we have developed a compound layer 2 and Web authentication scheme that ensures cryptographically protected access while preserving pre-existing public WLAN payment models. Our experimental results, obtained from our prototype system, show the total authentication delay are well within 2 seconds. This is dominated primarily by our use of industry-standard XML-based protocols, yet are still small enough for practical use.	authentication;client-side;identity provider;prototype;radius;seamless3d;single sign-on;wireless zero configuration;xml	Yasuhiko Matsunaga;Ana Sanz Merino;Takashi Suzuki;Randy H.

d9612784ebf2e95845d39adb4536e09aa8096011	key-aggregate searchable encryption under multi-owner setting for group data sharing in the cloud		In recent years, the with keyword search has been widely used in cloud data sharing system to protect privacy and confidentiality when the ciphertext is retrieving. However, selectively sharing encrypted data and related searching abilities among different users via the existing searchable technology certainly will generate a large number of searching trapdoors making the system inflexible and impractical. In this paper, we propose the concept of multi-owner key-aggregate searchable encryption scheme and its implementation, in which a user can only submit a trapdoor for querying the documents shared by multiple owners who only need to distribute an aggregate key for sharing massive data. Thus, the scheme supports effective data sharing for both multiple owners and users by reducing unnecessary trapdoors which are hard for generating by mobile devices during the querying step. Finally we conduct security analysis and performance evaluation which can show that our system is practical...	aggregate data;cloud computing;encryption	Tong Li;Zheli Liu;Chunfu Jia;Zhangjie Fu;Jin Li	2018	IJWGS	10.1504/IJWGS.2018.10008981	encryption;data mining;client-side encryption;filesystem-level encryption;cloud computing;ciphertext;computer science;cloud storage;mobile device;data sharing	Crypto	-40.829610351375194	67.07059119547297	63331

The demand for such applications, as the market grows, exceeds the capacity of individual businesses to provide fast and reliable services, making outsourcing technologies a key player in alleviating issues of scale. Consider a stock broker that needs to provide a real-time stock trading monitoring service to clients. Since the cost of multicasting this information to a large audience might become prohibitive, the broker could outsource the stock feed to third-party providers, who are in turn responsible for forwarding the appropriate sub-feed to clients. Evidently, in critical applications the integrity of the thirdparty should not be taken for granted. In this work we study a variety of authentication algorithms for selection and aggregation queries over sliding windows. Our algorithms enable the end-users to prove that the results provided by the third-party are correct, i.e., equal to the results that would have been computed by the original provider. Our solutions are based on Merkle hash trees over a forest of space partitioning data structures, and try to leverage key features, like update, query, signing, and authentication costs. We present detailed theoretical analysis for our solutions and empirically evaluate the proposed techniques.	algorithm;authentication;data structure;distributed hash table;dyadic transformation;e-commerce;merkle tree;microsoft windows;multicast;outsourcing;real-time transcription;space partitioning;time complexity	Feifei Li;Ke Yi;Marios Hadjieleftheriou;George Kollios	2007			sliding window protocol;data structure;computer science;data mining;database;programming language;world wide web;computer security	DB	-41.12227453722002	66.72145802112907	63793

Deploying such ubiquitous displays can be cumbersome since they need to be correctly configured and authorized to access both the Internet and the necessary services, despite the fact that they have minimal input capabilities and may be in inaccessible locations. Our goal is to enable easy and secure configuration of ubiquitous displays such as digital signage and advertisements, which are managed by cloud services and show HTML5 content. In our solution, the display shows a QR code which, when scanned by the user with a camera phone, allows automatic configuration of the wireless network along with the content to be shown. This is accomplished by a long-term trust relation configured between the cloud service and the wireless access network. We build on existing technologies and standard protocols, including RADIUS and EAP, without requiring new software to be installed on the phone or changes to the network infrastructure.	access network;authorization;camera phone;cloud computing;digital signage;display device;extensible authentication protocol;html5;internet;printing;qr code;radius	Mohit Sethi;Elena Oat;Mario Di Francesco;Tuomas Aura	2014		10.1145/2632048.2632049	embedded system;cloud computing;extensible authentication protocol;computer science;information security;operating system;internet privacy;configuration;computer security;bootstrapping;computer network	HCI	-48.236683838697225	65.41133683101022	63979
83c41afe57d1a8d8fbd5c89788ca9d742fde771c	a novel one-time password mutual authentication scheme on sharing renewed finite random sub-passwords	one time password;sub passwords;mutual authentication;random permutation functions	This paper proposes a novel one-time password (OTP) mutual authentication scheme based on challenge/response mechanisms. In the scheme, random sub-passwords and corresponding hashes are shared between a user and a server, respectively. By performing modular algebraic operations on two or more randomly chosen sub-passwords, relatively independent OTPs can be produced in the scheme. The used sub-passwords are renewed according to random permutation functions. With tens of random sub-passwords, we can get enough OTPs that can meet the practical needs. The stores and calculations can be implemented with a microcomputer in the user@?s terminal. At the same time, the scheme can provide sufficient security in ordinary applications.	mutual authentication;one-time password	Longyan Gong;Jingxin Pan;Beibei Liu;Shengmei Zhao	2013	J. Comput. Syst.

Yet, some recent studies show that misbehaving peers download farmore than they upload and free riders even upload nothing at all. In order to guarantee the upload fairness among peers, this paper proposes a quota-based encrypted block trading protocol (Quota-Encryption for short). The basic idea is for peers to prepay a ‘‘quota’’ of encrypted blocks to each other and then to alternately reveal decryption keys. Simulation results show that it guarantees better upload fairness among peers, making the free-riding behavior impossible in BitTorrent. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

cfaaf102429a71772ba0539d17a7def4f7d77799	masker: masking for privacy-preserving aggregation in the smart grid ecosystem		The introduction of information and communication technologies to the traditional energy grid offers advantages like efficiency, increased reliability, resilience and better control of demand-response, while on the other hand poses customersu0027 privacy at risk. Aggregation of electricity consumption readings in intermediate nodes is needed for efficient network utilisation; however, by using information collected by a smart meter, an attacker can deduce whether a house is empty from its residents, which devices are being used, residentsu0027 habits and so on. Here, we propose a privacy-preserving aggregation protocol that obfuscates individual consumption readings, while at the same time allows their aggregation without loss of accuracy. The same protocol is easily extensible to support privacy-preserving customer billing as well. Our solution is lightweight and presents additive homomorphic properties based on standard and easy to implement cryptographic operations, while it does not require an always available trusted third party for its operation. Finally, we show that knowledge of the obfuscated values does not affect customer privacy, since they cannot reveal enough information for an attacker to infer real consumption values.

Therefore, searchable encryption(SE) technology becomes a fundamental solution to search over encrypted data in outsourcing service. However, the genuine safety of SE schemes should concentrate not only on keyword privacy but also on user privacy as information tracking may leak user identity. For example, in the personal health record system, the malicious CSP may match sensitive disease information(cancer or AIDS) with certain patient. In addition, practical SE scheme should not be confined to single-user setting because of its limitations. While SE schemes applied to multi-user setting may result in additional secret key and ciphertext updating burden due to frequent user revocation. Along this direction, we define a revocable and anonymous SE scheme in multiple-user setting, which is scalable and efficient in user revocation and anonymity. Security analysis shows that our scheme is Anonymous-Revocable-ID-CPA secure under Decision Bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption and is able to effectively resist decryption key exposure threat.

The signature attests not to the identity of the individual who endorsed a message, but instead to a claim regarding the attributes he/she holds. ABS has been well investigated since its introduction but little has been done on the revocation in ABS. In this paper, we divide ABS revocation as fine-grained attribute-revocation and coarse-grained user-revocation. The latter is the focus of this paper, and we present a concrete design-to address the issue of coarse-grained user-revocation in ABS without the need of any other third parties.	antivirus software;broadcast encryption;electronic signature;polynomial-time approximation scheme	Yanling Lian;Li Xu;Xinyi Huang	2013	2013 5th International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems	10.1109/INCoS.2013.106	digital signature;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Robotics	-41.12855195318697	73.13109332749823	64596

Despite DaS’s convenience, there exist many considerable problems which concern end users about data loss and malicious deletion. In order to avoid these cases, users can rely on data auditing, which means verifying the existence of data stored in cloud without any malicious changes. Data owner can perform data auditing by itself or hire a third-party auditor. Until now, there are two challenges of data auditing as the computation cost in case of self auditing and data privacy preservation in case of hiding an auditor. In this paper, we propose a solution for auditing by a third-party auditor to verify data integrity with efficient computation and data privacy preservation. Our solution is built upon cryptographic hash function and Chinese Theorem Remainder with the advantage in efficient computation in all three sides including data owner, cloud server, and auditor. In addition, the privacy preservation can be guaranteed by proving the third-party auditor learns nothing about user’s data during auditing process.

In a nutshell, the idea is to formalize a policy as a set of logical rules and to let the requester construct a formal proof showing that she has permissions to access the desired resource according to the provider's policy. This policy may depend on logical formulas that are assumed by other principals in the system. The validity of these formulas is witnessed by digital signatures.  The usage of digital signatures, however, has a serious drawback, i.e., sensitive data are leaked to the verifier, which severely limits the applicability of PCA. In this paper, we introduce the notion of privacy-aware proof-carrying authorization, an extension of PCA based on a powerful combination of digital signatures and zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of such signatures. The former are used to witness the validity of logical formulas, the latter to selectively hide sensitive data. Our framework supports a variety of privacy properties, such as data secrecy and user anonymity. We conducted an experimental evaluation to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.	access control;antivirus software;authorization;digital signature;formal proof;privacy;zero-knowledge proof	Matteo Maffei;Kim Pecina	2011		10.1145/2166956.2166963	computer science;data mining;database;computer security	Security	-41.558709414534675	69.42619582360452	64867
038e40597c84279ae031d4649b0b0e10fb399254	editorial about proofs 2015		The goal of the International Workshop on Security Proofs for Embedded Systems (PROOFS) is to promote methodologies that increase the confidence level in the security of embedded systems. Formal methods for verification and safety are used in several related fields, such as software; however, the security of embedded systems, including cryptographic hardware and software, is often challenged by many attacks, particularly at the implementation level. Strategies to secure embedded systems are known, but they need to be implemented with care. The main objective of the PROOFS workshop is to bridge the gap between both topics and thus pave the way to verifiable security by design for embedded systems. The workshop is an opportunity for researchers of different fields to exchange on their work and also to present some innovative use cases and/or proofs of concept. The fourth edition of the PROOFS workshop was held on Thursday September 17, 2015, at Saint-Malo, in France. As for all previous editions, PROOFS workshop is scheduled the day after Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES), the flagship IACR conference on embedded systems security. The agenda of PROOFS 2015 has been aligned with the fourth workshop on secure hardware and security evaluation (TRUDEVICE), which has been held in parallel. Interestingly, Saint-Malo was a particularly interesting and relevant location to host a security workshop. It is well protected city and was notorious for privateering (the “cité corsaire”) in the past.

a161d4818858afe590c02ffe2a635f4151547045	using symbolic techniques and algebraic petri nets to model check security protocols for ad hoc networks		Petri nets have proved their effectiveness in modeling and formal verification of a large number of applications: control systems, communication protocols, application workflows, hardware design, etc. In the present days, one important focus of computer science is on security and secure communications. The use of Petri nets for verifying security properties is not a mature field due to a lack of convenient modeling and verification capabilities. So far, in the Petri Net field there is only the CPN tool that is mature enough for modeling using the colored Petri nets formalism. Nevertheless verification cannot be performed on large systems as CPN tool verification is based on an exhaustive way of computing the semantics of a model. In this paper we present the use of AlPiNA, another candidate for this task. AlPiNA is a symbolic model checker that uses the formalism of algebraic Petri nets. We have used it successfully for modeling ad hoc networks and for verifying security protocols designed for this type of networks. As a case study and benchmark we have chosen the ARAN secure routing protocol. We managed to find all the attacks that were already reported for this protocol. To our knowledge this work is also the first successful attempt to use Petri nets for model checking the security properties of ad hoc networks protocols.	adversary (cryptography);algebraic petri net;benchmark (computing);broadcasting (networking);coloured petri net;computer science;control system;correctness (computer science);cryptographic protocol;formal system;formal verification;fundamenta informaticae;hoc (programming language);international standard serial number;linear algebra;model checking;network congestion;routing;secure communication;semantics (computer science);state space;tracing (software);user experience;verification and validation;web page	Mihai-Lica Pura;Didier Buchs	2014			model checking;theoretical computer science;formal verification;communications protocol;petri net;cryptographic protocol;workflow;routing protocol;distributed computing;computer science;wireless ad hoc network	Logic	-34.968788386836934	72.04990856359956	65222

However, security-related issues must be satisfactorily solved before they come into full commercial use. We propose a secure approach for mobile agent migration control based on passport and visa (P/V). P/V as up-to-date digital credentials not only serve the agent-host authentication purpose, but also can be used by hosts to trace the agent route and by communities to control the migration of mobile agents. The binding scheme further provides a way to protect these digital credentials and eliminate the misuse of them on illegal agents. We discuss the design issues in detail and evaluate the implementation of the proposed system.

Ethernet speeds have been improving rapidly and network throughput is no longer considered a bottleneck when compared to Fibre-channel based storage area networks. However, when security of the data traffic is taken into consideration, existing protocols like IPSec prove to be a major hindrance to the overall throughput. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of iSCSI when deployed over standard security protocols and suggest lazy crypto approaches to alleviate the processing needs at the server. The testbed consists of a cluster of Linux machines directly connected to the server through a Gigabit Ethernet network. Micro and application benchmarks like BTIO and dbench were used to analyze the performance and scalability of the different approaches. Our proposed lazy approaches improved through-put by as much as 46% for microbenchmarks and 30% for application benchmarks in comparison to the IPSec based approaches.	fibre channel;gigabit;ipsec;iscsi;lazy evaluation;linux;scalability;server (computing);storage area network;testbed;throughput	Shiva Chaitanya;Kevin R.

We argue that the protocol can be efficiently applied to the exchange of secrets in many cases, such as when the secret is a digital signature. This includes Rabin, low-public-exponent RSA, and El Gamal signatures. In these cases, the protocol requires an interactive three-pass initial phase, after which each bit (or block of bits) of the signature can be released noninteractively (i.e., by sending one message). The necessary computations can be done in a couple of minutes on an up-to-date PC. The protocol is statistical zero-knowledge, and therefore releases a negligible amount of side information in the Shannon sense to the receiver. The sender is unable to cheat, if he cannot factor a large composite number before the protocol is completed.	antivirus software;computation;digital signature;personal computer;provable security;shannon (unit);zero-knowledge proof	Ivan Damgård	1995	Journal of Cryptology	10.1007/BF00191356	ring signature;digital signature;computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;blind signature;computer security	Crypto	-40.5508930048296	74.24320188979755	65552

a3e928162dc61ecbf6bd2fc84f1a14afa2163e71	implementation of improved s-3pake protocol based on verifier		Entering the era of big data, the data is faced with security risks in the storage, processing, transmission and other processes, and the authentication is unprecedented important to ensure data security. Password-based authentication has been widely used owing to the simplicity and high efficiency. However, in the big data scenario, attackers can obtain identity information using data mining technology, greatly improve the probability of password cracking. Based on the security analysis of S-3PAKE, the improved version is proposed in this paper. The new scheme can resist masquerading attack launched by challenger and responser by introducing verifier into the authentication process, and the other security problems, such as offline guessing attack, compromise of server, also can be solved.	authentication;big data;data mining;data security;dictionary attack;hash function;man-in-the-middle attack;one-way function;online and offline;password cracking;scsi initiator and target;server (computing);time complexity	Sujin Cai;Xin Lyu	2017	2017 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computed, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)	10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397553	computer network;computer science;security analysis;data security;password cracking;big data;password;compromise;authentication;server	Security	-43.23708910412702	67.94044300678227	66276

To support seamless roaming in emerging WMSNs, in this paper, we propose a localized and distributed authentication and billing architecture that aims at enabling efficient and privacy-preserving mutual authentication between mobile users (MUs) and WISPs. User anonymity and identity privacy can be protected, even in the presence of collusion between WISPs and a roaming broker (RB), which is considered to be the strongest user privacy protection. An efficient billing architecture is introduced and performed in the same stage of roaming, where U-tokens are defined and can be purchased by MUs from an RB as authentication credentials for the MUs to access the wireless network. The WISPs, thus, can cash the collected U-tokens in the RB for payment. We show that the proposed authentication and billing architecture can support localized inter-WISP authentication through the divisible blind signature scheme and a local witness strategy. A detailed analysis on a number of performance metrics, such as computation time and power consumption, is given to validate the performance of the proposed architectures.	blind signature;computation;credential;digital signature;electronic billing;mobile payment;mutual authentication;privacy;seamless3d;time complexity;wisp	Haojin Zhu;Xiaodong Lin;Minghui Shi;Pin-Han Ho;Xuemin Shen	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.2007983	telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;authentication;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-47.333671091036244	72.47096244527904	66973

We propose a methodology that allows signing of small groups of RDF statements. Groups of statements signed with this methodology can be safely inserted into any existing triple store without the loss of provenance information since only standard RDF semantics and constructs are used.

However, the traditional public key crypto system and broadcast encryption system can't solve both of the problems at the same time. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) offers both of the desired abilities. In this paper, we present a simple and effective scheme of Cipher text-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE), where access structures are single AND gates on positive and negative attributes and the size of access structure is fixed. Our scheme can be proven chosen plaintext attack (CPA) secure under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In addition, we provide an implementation of our scheme and give performance measurements.	access control;access structure;attribute-based encryption;bilinear filtering;broadcast encryption;cipher;ciphertext;cryptosystem;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman problem;one-to-many (data model);periodic boundary conditions;plaintext;public-key cryptography	Minda Yu;Qiuliang Xu	2012	2012 Eighth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security	10.1109/CIS.2012.122	multiple encryption;games;watermarking attack;disk encryption theory;40-bit encryption;plaintext-aware encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;cryptography;access control;ciphertext indistinguishability;plaintext;optimal asymmetric encryption padding;symmetric-key algorithm;link encryption;distributed computing;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;deterministic encryption;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption	Crypto	-41.463063399771364	70.8231295819934	67104

Unfortunately, these chains have to be evaluated every time a right is used, and if the right is used repeatedly, this can result in significant performance overhead. However, if the chains are replaced with reduction certificates, this overhead can be cut down. In this paper we discuss performance in SPKI and how it can be improved with certificate chain reduction. We elaborate on certificate chains, reduction certificates, and their performance implications, the choice of issuers of reduction, and take a look at the problems of reducing chains with online validity checks.	access control;authorization;certificate authority;markov chain;overhead (computing);public key certificate;root certificate;simple public-key infrastructure	Yki Kortesniemi	2002			computer science;database;distributed computing;computer network	Security	-42.56052865959968	70.91088421741364	67251

We point out fundamental trade-offs between important variables in the mobile advertisement ecosystem. In order to increase relevance, ad campaigns tend to become more targeted and personalized by using context information extracted from user's interactions and smartphone's sensors. This raises privacy concerns that are hard to overcome due to the limited resources (energy and bandwidth) available on the phones. We point out that in the absence of a trusted third party, it is impossible to maximize these three variables - ad relevance, privacy, and efficiency - in a single system. This leads to the natural question: can we formalize a common framework for personalized ad delivery that can be instantiated to any desired trade-off point? We propose such a flexible ad-delivery framework where personalization is done jointly by the server and the phone. We show that the underlying optimization problem is NP-hard and present an efficient algorithm with a tight approximation guarantee.  Since tuning personalization rules requires implicit user feedback (clicks), we ask how can we, in an efficient and privacy-preserving way, gather statistics over a dynamic population of mobile users? This is needed for end-to-end privacy of an ad system. We propose the first differentially-private distributed protocol that works even in the presence of a dynamic and malicious set of users.  We evaluate our methods with a large click log of location-aware searches in Microsoft Bing for mobile. Our experiments show that our framework can simultaneously achieve reasonable levels of privacy, efficiency, and ad relevance and can efficiently support a high churn rate of users during the gathering statistics that are required for personalization.	algorithm;approximation;ecosystem;end-to-end principle;experiment;interaction;location awareness;malware;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;personalization;privacy;relevance;sensor;server (computing);smartphone;trusted third party	Michaela Hardt;Suman Nath	2012		10.1145/2382196.2382266	optimization problem;computer science;network security;data mining;communication complexity;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-38.76637963707496	61.66870932570763	67303
d3e69b0e58fd76b9d074b01f2118eaa16aee5308	maintaining database anonymity in the presence of queries		With the advent of cloud computing there is an increased interest in outsourcing an organization’s data to a remote provider in order to reduce the costs associated with self-hosting. If that database contains information about individuals (such as medical information), it is increasingly important to also protect the privacy of the individuals contained in the database. Existing work in this area has focused on preventing the hosting provider from ascertaining individually identifiable sensitive data from the database, through database encryption or manipulating the data to provide privacy guarantees based on privacy models such as k-anonymity. Little work has been done to ensure that information contained in queries on the data, in conjunction with the data, does not result in a privacy violation. In this work we present a hash based method which provably allows the privacy constraint of an unencrypted database to be extended to the queries performed on the database. In addition, we identify a privacy limitation of such an approach, describe how it could be exploited using a known-query attack, and propose a counter-measure based on oblivious storage.	cloud computing;database encryption;information privacy;lookup table;outsourcing;privacy;self-hosting;server (computing)	Ryan Riley;Chris Clifton;Qutaibah M.

However, recommending suitable crowdsourcing tasks to mobile workers requires sensitive information such as location and activity, which raises serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we formulate the task recommendation process as an optimization problem which balances privacy, utility, and efficiency. We show that this optimization problem is NP-hard, and present a greedy solution which approximates the optimal solution within a factor of 1 - 1/e. We also design an efficient aggregation protocol to compute statistics of mobile workers required in the optimization problem while providing strong privacy guarantee. Both numerical evaluations and performance analysis are carried out to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to consider privacy issues in task recommendation for mobile crowdsourcing.	approximation algorithm;crowdsourcing;experiment;greedy algorithm;information sensitivity;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;numerical analysis;optimization problem;privacy;profiling (computer programming);selection algorithm	Yuanxiong Guo;Yuanxiong Guo;Yuguang Fang	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036871	mobile search;crowdsourcing software development;computer science;cryptography;operating system;data mining;internet privacy;mobile computing;privacy;world wide web;crowdsourcing;computer network	DB	-38.51510589633158	61.87588313118151	67894
5075cfc118e8de74924faed161abe65a8587b42d	data protection in the cloud - the mimosecco approach		Cloud Computing is a technology with vast impact on IT systems. Costs can be significantly reduced through on-demand purchase of CPU time, memory and storage, offering high flexibility. The main reason to avoid cloud technology still is security. This leads to a lack of trust in cloud services. Most cloud providers secure their systems only against external adversaries by using firewalls and secure connections. Internal adversaries, however, remain a big threat in this scenario. Especially when using mobile devices as clients, usable security with a low performance impact remains a challenge. In this paper, we present concepts for using software as a service with mobile devices while guaranteeing a high level of data protection. MimoSecco uses an innovative encryption scheme and hard-to-clone secure hardware to guarantee data protection. Top secret data is encrypted directly, processible confidential data is encrypted and fragmented by the database proxy and transferred to different servers. Context-based access control makes the misuse of mobile devices for unauthorized data access difficult. These set of measures raises the privacy level of cloud computing significantly.	altran praxis;authentication;authorization;backup;central processing unit;cloud computing;computer science;context;confidentiality;context-based access control;control system;data access;data redundancy;encryption;entity–relationship model;firewall (computing);high-level programming language;human–computer interaction (security);information privacy;information sensitivity;mandatory access control;mobile computing;mobile device;nethack;outsourcing;personal and ubiquitous computing;proxy server;role-based access control;software as a service	Jonas Lehner;Andreas Oberweis;Gunther Schiefer	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-12718-7_11	cloud computing security;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-47.05953375803486	61.35715963376484	67914

(2007), to support operation in a distributed environment with multiple attribute authorities. Unlike other efforts in creating a multi-authority attribute-based encryption schemes our extensions allow for each authority to be designated a subset of attributes and work independently in creating user keys (i.e. a user need only contact a single authority for their secret key). Additionally, we show that the presented extensions have a minimal impact on performance compared to standard CPABE and that both the performance of CP-ABE and our extensions can be improved by computing parts of the user and authority keys in parallel. We also discuss the use of CPABE in protecting data confidentiality in public cloud environments.	algorithm;attribute-based encryption;cp system;central processing unit;ciphertext;cloud computing;computable function;confidentiality;distributed computing;document;encrypt;information needs;key (cryptography);key generation;keygen;polynomial;prototype;randomness;recursion (computer science);tree (data structure)	Daniel Servos;Sabah Mohammed;Jinan Fiaidhi;Tai-Hoon Kim	2013	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2013.054354	40-bit encryption;cloud computing;computer science;cryptography;access control;distributed computing;data security;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;computer security;attribute-based encryption	Security	-41.10069024621329	68.91647476681185	68389
dffc1d57d3d212b8a9d42ceae35014658845f055	secure data-exchange protocol in a cloud-based collaborative health care environment		Cloud-based big data frameworks help collaborative healthcare service providers to efficiently store and manage large-scale health data. In such frameworks each cloud data source is autonomous and exchanges data with another cloud using pair-wise communication for user queries by creating an on-the-fly data-exchange session. The frameworks provide a platform for sharing or exchanging health data residing in multiple clouds for the purpose of data analysis, decision making, and improving patients’ treatment. As healthcare data are extremely sensitive, security is vital when sharing such data in a collaborative framework. Since clouds may exchange sensitive patient health data over an insecure channel, the sensitive data might be accessed or intercepted by malicious users or intruders. In this circumstance, a central third-party security mechanism (e.g., Public Key Infrastructure) can not protect confidential data. Concerning pair-wise, on-the-fly data exchange, this paper presents a two-phase security protocol that uses pairing-based cryptography. Each cloud computes a secret session key dynamically by computing a pairing in an elliptic curve. Validating the presented protocol, a formal verification proves that the proposed protocol is robust and safe against the masquerade, man-in-the-middle, and replay attacks.	autonomous robot;big data;cloud computing;communications protocol;confidentiality;cryptographic protocol;elliptic curve cryptography;formal verification;key (cryptography);malware;man-in-the-middle attack;pairing-based cryptography;procedural generation;public key infrastructure;replay attack;session key;two-phase commit protocol	Mehedi Masud;M.

At present, such storage systems provide no strong evidence that multiple copies of the data are actually stored. Storage servers can collude to make it look like they are storing many copies of the data, whereas in reality they only store a single copy. We address this shortcoming through multiple-replica provable data possession (MR-PDP): A provably-secure scheme that allows a client that stores t replicas of a file in a storage system to verify through a challenge-response protocol that (1) each unique replica can be produced at the time of the challenge and that (2) the storage system uses t times the storage required to store a single replica. MR-PDP extends previous work on data possession proofs for a single copy of a file in a client/server storage system (Ateniese et al., 2007). Using MR-PDP to store t replicas is computationally much more efficient than using a single-replica PDP scheme to store t separate, unrelated files (e.g., by encrypting each file separately prior to storing it). Another advantage of MR-PDP is that it can generate further replicas on demand, at little expense, when some of the existing replicas fail.	challenge–response authentication;client–server model;computer data storage;durability (database systems);encryption;provable security;replication (computing);server (computing)	Reza Curtmola;Osama Khan;Randal C.

With the popularity of multimedia services, the trust issues in content distribution becomes urgent, including the authorized access, privacy protection, trusted payment, piracy surveillance, and so forth. This chapter introduces the trust issues in multimedia content distribution (e.g., authorization, authentication, privacy, payment, ownership, illegal distribution, forgery, etc.), reviews the latest research progress of the solutions, and presents some open issues and promising research topics. It is expected to provide valuable information to researchers or engineers in this field.

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. an important topic (Kelton, et al., 2008). And, many discussions of trust in this environment focus on issues like security or technical reliability. Specially, in security engineering, a trusted system is a system that is relied upon to a specified extent to enforce a specified security policy (Taipale, 2005). As such, a trusted system is one whose failure may break a specified security policy. It is often defined from four aspects, i.e., classified information, trusted computing, policy analysis and information theory. In classified information, trusted systems are used for the processing, storage and retrieval of sensitive or classified information. In trusted computing, trust is used by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG, 2009) mainly in the sense of authorization that defines whether a user is authorized to do something. In policy analysis, trusted systems in the context of national or homeland security, law enforcement, or social control policy are systems in which some conditional prediction about the behavior of people or objects within the system has been determined prior to authorizing access to system resources. In information theory, a trusted system is based on the definition of ‘Trust is that which is essential to a communication channel but cannot be transferred from a source to a destination using that channel’ (Gerck, 1998). This chapter will focus on the trust in security engineering. Multimedia content distribution (e.g., digital TV, mobile TV, IPTV, online music, etc.) is a kind of digital information system (Lian & Zhang, 2009), which becomes more and more popular with the rapid development of network technology and multimedia technology. Thus, the trust in multimedia content distribution is urgent, especially the security aspects. Generally, a multimedia distribution system, composed of the sender (and device), receiver (and device), transmission channel, storage device, etc., distributes the multimedia content from the sender(s) to receiver(s) through various communication manners. Multimedia content’s properties, such as large volumes, worthy commerce value, real time interaction, etc., make multimedia distribution systems different from traditional information systems. Till now, some means to confirm the trust in multimedia distribution have been proposed (Lian, 2009). However, few works has been done to show the progress of trust issues and solutions in this field. This chapter aims to review the latest research results in trust issues and solutions for multimedia distribution, and provide valuable information to researchers or engineers. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. A number of trust issues in multimedia content distribution are discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, solutions to ensure trust are introduced in detail. Furthermore, we propose some open issues and hot topics in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in the last section.	authentication;authorization;channel (communications);computer security;digital data;digital distribution;iptv;information systems;information system;information theory;mobile television;online music store;privacy;security engineering;trusted computing;trusted operating system;trusted system;trustworthy computing	Shiguo Lian	2010	IJDTIS	10.4018/jdtis.2010070103	computer science;multimedia;sociology	Security	-47.08290826730606	68.07322953247441	68937

These attacks can be successfully prevented by \tagging"""" types of each eld of a message. Complex type confusions occur instead when tags can be confused with data and when elds or sub-segments of elds may be confused with concatenations of elds of other types. Capturing these kinds of confusions is not easy in a process calculus setting, where it is generally assumed that messages are correctly interpreted. In this paper, we model in the process calculus LYSA only the misinterpretation due to the confusion of a concatenation of elds with a single eld, by extending the notation of one-to-one variable binding to many-to-one binding. We further present a formal way of detecting these possible misinterpretations, based on a Control Flow Analysis for this version of the calculus.

d2bd6ed77a9e9e80838fc4e893c5ccb0c13dc57e	adaptive succinct garbled ram or: how to delegate your database		We show how to garble a large persistent database and then garble, one by one, a sequence of adaptively and adversarially chosen RAM programs that query and modify the database in arbitrary ways. The garbled database and programs reveal only the outputs of the programs when run in sequence on the database. Still, the runtime, space requirements and description size of the garbled programs are proportional only to those of the plaintext programs and the security parameter. We assume indistinguishability obfuscation for circuits and somewhat-regular collision-resistant hash functions. In contrast, all previous garbling schemes with persistent data were shown secure only in the static setting where all the programs are known in advance. As an immediate application, we give the first scheme for efficiently outsourcing a large database and computations on the database to an untrusted server, then delegating computations on this database, where these computations may update the database. Our scheme extends the non-adaptive RAM garbling scheme of Canetti and Holmgren [ITCS 2016]. We also define and use a new primitive of independent interest, called adaptive accumulators. The primitive extends the positional accumulators of Koppula et al. [STOC 2015] and somewhere statistical binding hashing of Hubáăï¾¿ek and Wichs [ITCS 2015] to an adaptive setting.

fb0995134f20264d0ad3ea7670b3bccc004d1dc6	an information-theoretic privacy criterion for query forgery in information retrieval		In previous work, we presented a novel information-theoretic privacy criterion for query forgery in the domain of information retrieval. Our criterion measured privacy risk as a divergence between the user’s and the population’s query distribution, and contemplated the entropy of the user’s distribution as a particular case. In this work, we make a twofold contribution. First, we thoroughly interpret and justify the privacy metric proposed in our previous work, elaborating on the intimate connection between the celebrated method of entropy maximization and the use of entropies and divergences as measures of privacy. Secondly, we attempt to bridge the gap between the privacy and the informationtheoretic communities by substantially adapting some technicalities of our original work to reach a wider audience, not intimately familiar with information theory and the method of types.	adversary model;cobham's thesis;convex optimization;data flow diagram;dummy variable (statistics);electrical engineering;entropy (information theory);entropy maximization;information retrieval;information theory;information-theoretic security;kullback–leibler divergence;mathematical optimization;natural language processing;norm (social);overhead (computing);privacy;protein information resource;requirement;user profile	David Rebollo-Monedero;Javier Parra-Arnau;Jordi Forné	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27189-2_16	data mining;mathematics;internet privacy;world wide web	ML	-40.10155125407929	62.50529816970746	69356

Hence, the cost of security operations can be very high. Recent security proposals for large-scale file systems have been focussing on the use of hybrid symmetric and asymmetric key cryptographic techniques, in order to strive for a balance between security and performance. However, key management issues, such as distribution, renewal and revocation of keys, have not been explicitly addressed. In this paper, we first show that key management can be very challenging and costly in large-scale systems, and can have significant impact on the scalability of the systems. We then propose a file system security architecture which makes use of lightweight key management techniques. Our approach not only addresses essential key management concerns, it also improves existing proposals with stronger security and better usability.

Such a migration needs to address a new set of P2P specific security problems. We go over some of the known issues found in common P2P networks.

5e10ac4b6b8192443a3222d49010b97e8899182f	nondeterministic multi-domain noninterference via policy reduction		The literature on information flow security in asynchronous non-deterministic systems with respect to transitive policies has been concentrated largely on the case of policies with two security domains, High and Low, because of a presumption that more general policies can be reduced to this two-domain case. The details of the reduction are rarely given, however. One exception is a proposal by Ryan [FOSAD 2000] based on a partitioning of domains into those above and those not above a given domain in the information flow order. The paper argues that there are other possible reductions, and considers the properties and relationships of several candidate reductions to the two-domain case, when the definition of security in the two-domain case is either Nondeducibility on Inputs or Generalized Noninterference. While Ryan’s proposal works well in the case of Generalized Noninterference, it is shown to have an undesirable property in the case of Nondeducibility on Inputs, and a better candidate reduction is identified for this case.	communications security;composability;computer security;cryptography;information flow (information theory);interference (communication);loop unrolling;non-interference (security);reduction (complexity);springer (tank)	Oliver Woizekowski;Ron van der Meyden	2016	CoRR		nondeterministic algorithm;distributed computing;computer science	Security	-34.334344269745934	72.26047119519434	69999

Collaboration enables domains to effectively share resources; however, it introduces several security and privacy challenges. In this article, we use the current web service standards such as SOAP and UDDI to enable secure interoperability in a service-oriented mediator-free environment. We propose a multihop SOAP messaging protocol that enables domains to discover secure access paths to access roles in different domains. Then we propose a path authentication mechanism based on the encapsulation of SOAP messages and the SOAP-DISG standard. Furthermore, we provide a service discovery protocol that enables domains to discover service descriptions stored in private UDDI registries.	authentication;encapsulation (networking);interoperability;privacy;soap;service discovery;service-oriented device architecture;web services discovery;web service	Mohamed Shehab;Kamal Bhattacharya;Arif Ghafoor	2007	ACM Trans.

0ab72495fa310a56905a6d06a0cb08a0e17977f9	self-protecting electronic medical records using attribute-based encryption	article	We provide a design and implementation of self-protecting electronic medical records (EMRs) using attribute-based encryption. Our system allows healthcare organizations to export EMRs to storage locations outside of their trust boundary, including mobile devices, Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), and cloud systems such as Google Health. In contrast to some previous approaches to this problem, our solution is designed to maintain EMR availability even when providers are offline, i.e., where network connectivity is not available (for example, during a natural disaster). To balance the needs of emergency care and patient privacy, our system is designed to provide for fine-grained encryption and is able to protect individual items within an EMR, where each encrypted item may have its own access control policy. To validate our architecture, we implemented a prototype system using a new dual-policy attribute-based encryption library that we developed. Our implementation, which includes an iPhone app for storing and managing EMRs offline, allows for flexible and automatic policy generation. An evaluation of our design shows that our ABE library performs well, has acceptable storage requirements, and is practical and usable on modern smartphones.	access control;attribute-based encryption;ciphertext;excalibur: morgana's revenge;library (computing);medical privacy;mobile device;online and offline;prototype;requirement;smartphone;trust boundary;usability	Joseph A.

Recently, Wen 17 presented the user authentication and user anonymity scheme based on the quadratic residues and claimed that his scheme is secure. However, we analyzed Wenu0027s scheme and identified that Wenu0027s scheme is vulnerable to password disclosure attack and does not provide efficiency in password change phase. As a result, in this paper, we propose an enhanced scheme for the integrated EPRIS with the aim to eliminate the weaknesses of Wenu0027s scheme. By comparing the performance with other related schemes, our scheme not only resists several hard security attacks but also retains lower computational and communication costs.	authentication;quadratic residue	Chun-Ta Li;Chi-Yao Weng;Cheng-Chi Lee;Chun-Cheng Wang	2015		10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.008	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-45.16416090111775	73.54715358967321	70229

However, since longitudinal health data contain personal information, improper release and usage of such data may violate privacy of patients. In this paper, we study the challenges of publishing longitudinal health data and propose a privacy notion, called (K,C)P-privacy together with a hybrid anonymization algorithm. This work is the first attempt to anonymize multidimensional longitudinal data to prevent both identity disclosure and attribute disclosure.

A frequently proposed solution to protect location privacy suggests that the LBS users need to exchange their pseudonyms over time in protected regions called mix-zones. However, how to deploy mix-zones remains an open question and has not been well addressed in previous works. Inspired by the notion that """"where you drive more is where you more likely need to change pseudonyms"""", we then treat the problem of optimal multiple mix-zones as a transportation problem. We then characterize the properties and constraints of the optimization problem, and build a mixed-integer programming model with the objective of minimizing the amount of time the users' privacy level is lower than the privacy requirement. The placement optimization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to strategically select the mix-zone locations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions through extensive simulations on real-world data traces."""	greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);inferential programming;integer programming;location-based service;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;privacy;programming model;pseudonymity;simulation;software deployment;statistical model;tracing (software);transportation theory (mathematics)	Zhikai Xu;Hongli Zhang;Xiang-Zhan Yu	2016	2016 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA	10.1109/TrustCom.2016.0136	privacy software;engineering;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-38.638683599409624	61.10824850305165	70292

Convertible undeniable signatures provide the flexibility that a signer can convert an undeniable signature into publicly verifiable one. A proxy signature scheme allows an entity to delegate his/her signing capability to another entity in such a way that the latter can sign messages on behalf of the former when the former is not available. Proxy signatures have found numerous practical applications in ubiquitous computing, distributed systems, mobile agent applications, etc. In this paper, we propose the first convertible undeniable proxy signature scheme with rigorously proven security. The properties of Unforgeability, Invisibility and Soundness in the context of convertible undeniable proxy signatures are also clearly defined. The security of our construction is formally proven in the random oracle models, based on some natural complexity assumptions.	signature	Wei Wu;Yi Mu;Willy Susilo;Xinyi Huang	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77535-5_2	computer security model;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;ubiquitous computing	Crypto	-41.953542709529565	74.12793369110128	70375

This paper presents a new flexible membership encryption scheme which is provably secure and significantly more efficient than the previous scheme. Further we apply our proposed membership encryption to construct a round optimal 1-outof-n priced oblivious transfer (POT) protocol which, unlike the existing 1-out-of-n POT schemes, is proven secure under the universally composable (UC) security model and thus preserves security when it is executed with multiple protocol instances that run concurrently in an adversarily controlled way. Moreover, using our membership encryption, the POT protocol exhibits constant communication complexity on the buyer’s side and O(n) communication cost on the vendor’s side, which is so far the best known in the literature.	communication complexity;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;encryption;oblivious transfer;provable security;uc browser;universal composability	Pratish Datta;Ratna Dutta;Sourav Mukhopadhyay	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08344-5_7	multiple encryption;40-bit encryption;computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption	Crypto	-40.04372552423356	74.26698037865998	70599

In order to receive more consistent rewards over time, some participants organize mining pools and split the rewards from the pool in proportion to each participantu0027s contribution. However, several attacks threaten the ability to participate in pools. The block withholding (BWH) attack makes the pool reward system unfair by letting malicious participants receive unearned wages while only pretending to contribute work. When two pools launch BWH attacks against each other, they encounter the mineru0027s dilemma: in a Nash equilibrium, the revenue of both pools is diminished. In another attack called selfish mining, an attacker can unfairly earn extra rewards by deliberately generating forks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack called a fork after withholding (FAW) attack. FAW is not just another attack. The reward for an FAW attacker is always equal to or greater than that for a BWH attacker, and it is usable up to four times more often per pool than in BWH attack. When considering multiple pools --- the current state of the Bitcoin network -- the extra reward for an FAW attack is about 56% more than that for a BWH attack. Furthermore, when two pools execute FAW attacks on each other, the mineru0027s dilemma may not hold: under certain circumstances, the larger pool can consistently win. More importantly, an FAW attack, while using intentional forks, does not suffer from practicality issues, unlike selfish mining. We also discuss partial countermeasures against the FAW attack, but finding a cheap and efficient countermeasure remains an open problem. As a result, we expect to see FAW attacks among mining pools.	bitcoin;cryptography;malware;nash equilibrium	Yujin Kwon;Dohyun Kim;Yunmok Son;Eugene Y.

LBS provide privileges to mobile users based on their proximity to a facility. In order to gain benefits, users may lie or falsely claim their location. Hence, it is essential to verify the legitimacy of users. In this paper, we propose our novel solution for generating location proof for mobile users and verification of the location claim by application services. Our protocol exploits unique Wi-Fi signal characteristics and employs an information theoretically secure fuzzy vault scheme. We provide a detailed theoretical and experimental evaluation of our protocol. Our solution is faster by an order of magnitude, and the performance of our scheme is independent of the location tag size and distance between the mobile user and location proof provider compared to the state-of-the-art.	cryptography;emergence;experiment;location-based service	Chitra Javali;Girish Revadigar;Kasper Bonne Rasmussen;Wen Hu;Sanjay Jha	2016	2016 IEEE 41st Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2016.126	communications protocol;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;location-based service;world wide web;computer security;wireless;server;computer network	Mobile	-46.94810258516619	72.24781440007214	70688

Safety applications broadcast their safety information periodically, but the delivery of the broadcast messages in IEEE 802.11p is unreliable. As the control channel has to share the Sync Interval (SI) with the service channels, access to the control channel by the safety messages is delayed during the Service CHannel Interval(SCHI). All safety messages generated during SCHI are rush to access as soon as the Control CHannel Interval (CCHI) starts. It causes the flash crowd problem for the safety applications. Safety messages, which are generated periodically and their periods overlap with SCHI, always face the latter problem; it causes unfairness among the safety messages. In this paper, a Distributed Periodic Access Scheme (DPAS) is proposed to solve the problem. DPAS uses a hashing function to distribute the access time of the safety messages into CCHI instead of SI. The simulation results show that DPAS drastically reduces the collision of the safety messages in a crowded environment and that choosing a hashing function is very important to reduce the collision in a crowded environment.	access time;address space;algorithm;collision (computer science);design rule for camera file system;hash function;mac address;overlap–add method;performance;simulation;slashdot effect;the sync	Kwang-Jin Song;Chan-Hang Lee;Min-Su Woo;Sung-Gi Min	2011	2011 Third International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1109/CMC.2011.67	hash function;telecommunications;computer science;broadcast control channel;computer security;algorithm;computer network	Mobile	-48.0940471129748	73.99048137390176	70695

3708d03cffeda66add1032e7b58e9b8b0083b541	a lattice-based unordered aggregate signature scheme based on the intersection method		An aggregate signature turns multi-message multi-authentication into multi-message single-authentication, reducing the required storage space, transmission cost, and number of verification calculations, and is suitable for fast message authentication in the big data era, particularly in wireless sensor networks and secure email systems. Many aggregate signature schemes have been proposed, including lattice-based ones, which have good resistance to quantum machine attacks. However, the existing lattice-based aggregate signature schemes, which either have strict requirements on the signing order or encounter security risks, are not suitable for the unordered polymerization environment. In this paper, we accordingly propose a lattice-based unordered aggregate signature scheme. The proposed scheme makes use of the intersection method and solves the unordered aggregate problem of lattice signatures with different public keys. Therefore, it avoids both the signing order limitation and the risk of single signature forgery. Furthermore, the scheme follows the improved security model; hence, it is robust against collusion attacks. In addition, the scheme’s security depends on the small integer solution problem, which enables the scheme to resist quantum algorithm attacks.	aggregate data;aggregate function;big data;digital signature;email encryption;lattice model (finance);message authentication;quantum algorithm;quantum machine;requirement;type signature	Xiuhua Lu;Wei Yin;Qiaoyan Wen;Zhengping Jin;Wenmin Li	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847411	computer security model;wireless sensor network;quantum algorithm;distributed computing;lattice (order);probabilistic logic;public-key cryptography;computer science;quantum machine;message authentication code	Security	-39.474329617255584	70.6346579504323	70876

From a security point of view, biometric authentication offers the possibility to establish physical presence and unequivocal identification. However from a privacy point of view, the use of biometric authentication also introduces new problems and user concerns. Namely, when used for privacy-sensitive applications, biometric data are a highly valuable asset. When such data are available to unauthorized persons, these data can potentially be used for impersonation purposes, defeating the security aspects that are supposed to be associated with biometric authentication. In this paper, we will systematically unveil critical sections based on the two generic biometric flow models for enrolment and authentication respectively. Based on these critical sections for biometric data in authentication systems, we will point out measures to protect biometric systems. It will be shown that especially techniques using non–reversible representations are needed to disallow malicious use of template information and we will discuss a variant of the Linnartz-Tuyls model for securing biometric templates in detail.	authentication;authorization;code;critical section;cryptographic hash function;cryptography;data compression;distortion;error detection and correction;internet privacy;memory protection;message authentication;quantization (signal processing);rejection sampling;template method pattern	Claus Vielhauer;Ton Kalker	2004		10.1117/12.528261	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-47.82858979872689	68.13367884825924	70922

People are used to storing personal data in cloud server. E-Health system (EHS) privacy should be protected, because it is national security for citizen privacy. Personal Health Record (PHR) is the core of EHS that should be protected. Thus, how to efficiently store, access and share these data is critical. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a new public key encryption based on users’ attributes. In this paper, we present a new method to realize a secure fine-grained access control to PHRs, which is based on emerging ABE primitives. In more details, PHR owners divide the PHR data in terms of the privacy levels. A key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) is utilized to provide a fine-grained access control storage system for outsourced sensitive data. It can also provide efficient user revocation by using the timestamp in the private key. Security analysis shows that our construction achieves the data confidentiality. That is, any unauthorized user is not allowed to access the data outsourced in the cloud. © 2016 TSI ® Press	access control;attribute-based encryption;authorization;cloud computing;computer data storage;confidentiality;european home systems protocol;outsourcing;personally identifiable information;pixel;programming paradigm;public-key cryptography;server (computing);time-slot interchange;virtual private server	Hongyang Yan;Jin Li;Xuan Li;Gansen Zhao;Sun-Young Lee;Jian Shen	2016	Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing	10.1080/10798587.2015.1132586	40-bit encryption;cloud computing;client-side encryption;computer science;information security;database;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;computer security;attribute-based encryption	Security	-42.3788265208426	66.54709541224952	71114

But many schemes of that kind are under different attacks. Recently, Kumari et al. pointed that Chen et al.'s scheme and Li et al.'s scheme with the smart card were not secure. They proposed two improved schemes. Unfortunately, we find that the two schemes are not secure. The first scheme of Kumari et al. is under the de-synchronization attack and lacks strong forward security. The second has the weaknesses including no user anonymity and password leaking. Also, it cannot withstand the user-impersonation attack. We present a new scheme also based on the smart card overcoming common disadvantages and give a formal proof. We also use the tool ProVerif to verify the security of our scheme. Compared with some recent schemes, our scheme performs well, and it is fit for network applications.

33dac770c97fd913f370699b535dfe44536e2a51	security of the enhanced tcg privacy-ca solution	platform attestation;tpm;privacy ca solution;pcas	The privacy-CA solution (PCAS) designed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) was specified in TCG Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Specification Version 1.2 in 2003 and allows a TPM to obtain from a certification authority (CA) certificates on short term keys. The PCAS protocol is a lighter alternative to the Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) scheme for anonymous platform authentication. The first rigorous analysis of PCAS was recently performed by Chen and Warinschi who focus on an unforgeability property (a TPM cannot obtain a certificate without the CA knowing its identity). The analysis in that paper holds only when no TPM is corrupt as, otherwise, an attack can be easily mounted. The authors also propose a stronger protocol (which we refer to as the enhanced PCAS or ePCAS) intended to withstand attacks of corrupt TPMs, but the protocol had never been formally analyzed. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. We formalize three security properties desired from the ePCAS protocol. Unforgeability refines the earlier model for the case where TPMs may be corrupted. Deniability is the property that a CA cannot prove to a third party that he engaged in a run of the protocol with a certain TPM. Finally, anonymity is the property that third parties cannot tell the identity of TPMs based on the certificates that the TPM uses. The second contribution are proofs that the ePCAS protocol does indeed satisfy the security requirements that we formalize in this paper.	authentication;certificate authority;direct anonymous attestation;entity–relationship model;portable collision avoidance system;requirement;trusted computing;trusted platform module	Liqun Chen;Ming-Feng Lee;Bogdan Warinschi	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-30065-3_8	portable collision avoidance system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-42.90385584932198	74.30703003737443	71180

54a43de5c43c398e321b72d18901b48bde0754a5	review of different privacy preserving techniques in ppdp		Big data is a term used for a very large data sets that have many difficulties in storing and processing the data. Analysis this much amount of data will lead to information loss. The main goal of this paper is to share data in a way that privacy is preserved while information loss is kept at least. Data that include Government agencies, University details and Medical history etc., are very necessary for an organization to do analysis and predict trends and patterns, but it may prevent the data owner from sharing the data because of privacy regulations [1]. By doing an analysis of several algorithms of Anonymization such as k-anonymity, l-diversity and tcloseness, one can achieve privacy at minimum loss. Admitting these techniques has some limitations. We need to maintain trade-off between privacy and information loss. We introduce a novel approach called Differential Privacy.	algorithm;big data;data anonymization;differential privacy	Jalpesh Vasa;Panthini Modi	2018	CoRR	10.14445/22315381/IJETT-V59P242	data mining;differential privacy;privacy law;big data;medical history;business;government;data set	ML	-41.280889111847316	63.313018362355685	71486

While keeping track of and making available location information about """"public"""" things-such as printers and restaurants is both acceptable and desirable, the same does not necessarily apply to people. We consider unrestricted access to a person's location data to be an unacceptable invasion of privacy; to us privacy means that personal information remains known only to that person unless he or she explicitly hands it out to someone else. we also want an architecture that Is scalable to a global scale, Implying that it must cope with a great multiplicity of heterogeneous administrative domains. Consequently, authenticity of persons, systems services, and location information Itself become an issue. In a system that covers only one friendly administrative domain, security may be accomplished by something as simple as a centralized location database with access controls, unfortunately this simple approach will not scale to a system that must span multiple administrative domains. An Interesting alternative Is to be more """"user centrlc"""": private Information (including location) about any given user is kept only by that user's trusted """"user agent,"""" and each user's dealings with other users and with foreign system services are moderated by some means of evaluating how """"trust-worthy"""" the user deems them to be. There are two familiar problems In system security: ensuring the accuracy of information and identities and establishing secret communications. Our requirements stress new aspects of these problems. Authenticating the location information supplied to a user agent is difficult because today's sensor systems typically only detect things such as active badges that can be removed from the mobile objects they represent. Unless society forces the use of nonremov-able """"tags"""" (which we consider undesirable) this problem implies that applications must be prepared to deal with the attendant uncertainties of the location information they use. Because of the potential size and het-erogeneity of the system, it Is not always possible to keep an explicit list of principals known or deemed trustworthy. There must be some mechanism for establishing the trustworthiness or accountability Of heretofore unencoun-tered principals-be they persons, devices, or programs. Establishing secret communications has traditionally focused on safeguarding the contents of a message. We must also safeguard the contents of the envelope of a message, since that may contain addressing information from which location can be determined.

There are many computations and surveys which involve confidential data from many parties or organizations. As the concerned data is property of the organization or the party, preservation and security of this data is of prime importance for such type of computations. Although the computation requires data from all the parties, but none of the associated parties would want to reveal their data to the other parties. We have proposed a new protocol to perform computation on encrypted data. The data is encrypted in a manner that it does not affect the result of the computation. It uses modifier tokens which are distributed among virtual parties, and finally used in the computation. The computation function uses the acquired data and modifier tokens to compute right result from the encrypted data. Thus without revealing the data, right result can be computed and privacy of the parties is maintained. We have given a probabilistic security analysis and have also shown how we can achieve zero hacking security with proper configuration.	confidentiality;encryption;modifier key;privacy;secure multi-party computation	Rohit Pathak;Satyadhar Joshi	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02617-1_42	protocol;computer science;information security;secure two-party computation;distributed computing;secure multi-party computation;internet privacy;security analysis;privacy;computer security	Security	-41.299458091619854	72.1223472376826	71807
de2a4caf45ec57493e551358768ddc3cea13dadf	keyword search meets membership testing: adaptive security from sxdh		Searchable encryption (SE) allows users to securely store sensitive data in encrypted form on cloud and at the same time perform keyword search over the encrypted documents. In this work, we focus on variants of SE schemes that along with keyword search, also support membership testing. The problem can be formulated in two flavors depending on whether the search policy is encoded in the ciphertext or in the trapdoor. The ciphertext-policy variant is called Broadcast Encryption with Keyword Search (BEKS) and allows only privileged users to perform keyword search on an encrypted file. Available dedicated constructions could achieve selective security under parameterized assumption. The key-policy variant, called Key-Aggregate Searchable Encryption (KASE), restricts the keyword search within a particular set of documents. Naive application of existing SE schemes in this scenario leads to inefficient protocols with either variable length trapdoor or exponential blowup of storage requirement in terms of the document set size. This therefore calls for an efficient solution that allows such subset based restricted search with constant trapdoor size.

Security is one of the key issues should be considered before WMNs get widespread use. Authentication and key establishment (AKE) schemes enable two entities to share common communication keys in an authentic way. In a WMN, a Mesh Client (MC) and the accessing Mesh Router (MR) need to need to authenticate each other before the secure connection could be set up between them. Due to mobility of MCs, a WMN needs to have efficient authentication and key establishment scheme to provide adequate security while meeting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, especially during clients handoff. Mesh routers (MRs) also need to authenticate each other before set up the wireless connection. In this paper, we propose a authentication and key establishment scheme for WMN based on the identity-based cryptography (IBC), which enables efficient key agreement and mutual authentication between network entities in a WMN. Through this distributed authentication key establishment scheme, network entities can authenticate each other and establish pairwise communication keys with substantially reduced communication overhead and authentication delay.	cryptographic protocol;entity;id-based cryptography;information-based complexity;internet access;key exchange;mesh networking;mutual authentication;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;quality of service;requirement;seamless3d;software deployment;wireless mesh network	Bing He;Dharma P.

It is not rare to find computer labs or company offices composed of personal computers that boot more than one operating system. By being able to choose among available OSs, a company's or organization's information technology manager has the freedom to select the right OS for the company's needs, and the decision can be based on technical or financial criteria. This freedom of choice, however, comes with a cost. The administrative complexity of heterogeneous networks is much higher compared to single OS networks, and if the network is large enough so that protocols such as LDAP Zeilenga, 2006 or Kerberos Kohl & Neuman, 1993 need to be adopted, then the administration burden may become unbearable. Even though some tools exist that make user management of heterogeneous networks more feasible Tournier, 2006; Chu & Symas Corp., 2005, it is not uncommon to use more than one back end for storing user credentials due to OS incompatibilities. In such configurations, the hardest problem to address is credential and account expiration synchronization among the different back ends. This paper demonstrates a platform that tries to mitigate the problem of synchronization by adding an additional, modular, easy to expand layer which is responsible for synchronizing any number of underlying back ends in a secure fashion.	management system	Georgios Mamalakis;Chariton Karamitas	2012	Information Security Journal: A Global Perspective	10.1080/19393555.2012.694981	heterogeneous network;computer science;network security;application security;distributed computing;information technology;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-47.19178099998959	64.72813295345219	72240

A POV scheme enables a user or a service provider to produce a precise proof of either the occurrence of the violation of properties or the innocence of the service provider. POV schemes are solutions for obtaining mutual nonrepudiation between users and the service provider in the cloud. Existing solutions for obtaining mutual nonrepudiation only support epoch-based POV. The drawback of an epoch-based POV scheme is that violation of properties can only be detected at the end of an epoch. We propose a real-time POV scheme in which the auditing can be performed at the time of each file operation. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first scheme that can perform real-time POV for cloud storage. In addition, each client device only needs to store a partial hash tree of files in an account. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Service providers of cloud storage can use the proposed scheme to provide a mutual nonrepudiation guarantee in their service-level agreements.	cloud computing;cloud storage;computational trust;computer file;merkle tree;mutual exclusion;non-repudiation;overhead (computing);pov-ray;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scheme;service-level agreement	Gwan-Hwan Hwang;Wei-Sian Huang;Jenn-Zjone Peng	2014	2014 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science	10.1109/CloudCom.2014.18	cloud computing security;communications protocol;digital signature;non-repudiation;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;database;internet privacy;computer security;server	Embedded	-42.54548829444813	69.0808487155891	72642

These applications deal with lot of personal information, e.g., identity and location. Therefore, we need to pay a deeper attention to privacy and anonymity. However, the knowledge of the data source is desired to evaluate the trustworthiness of the sensing data. Anonymity and trust become two conflicting objectives in mobile sensing. In this paper, we propose ARTSense, a framework to solve the problem of “trust without identity” in mobile sensing. Our solution consists of a privacy-preserving provenance model, a data trust assessment scheme and an anonymous reputation management protocol. In contrast to other recent solutions, our scheme does not require a trusted third party and both positive and negative reputation updates can be enforced. In the trust assessment, we consider contextual factors that dynamically affects the trustworthiness of the sensing data as well as the mutual support and conflict among data from difference sources. Security analysis shows that ARTSense achieves our desired anonymity and security goals. Our prototype implementation on Android demonstrates that ARTSense incurs minimal computation overhead on mobile devices, and simulation results justify that ARTSense captures the trust of information and reputation of participants accurately.	android;blind signature;computation;malware;mobile device;outsourcing;overhead (computing);personally identifiable information;privacy;programming paradigm;prototype;reputation management;reputation system;requirement;server (computing);simulation;switch;trust (emotion);trusted third party	Xinlei Wang;Wei Cheng;Prasant Mohapatra;Tarek F.

To ensure the trustworthiness of a public key server, transparent log systems such as CONIKS employ a tamper-evident data structure on the server and a gossiping protocol among clients in order to detect compromised servers. However, due to lack of incentive and vulnerability to malicious clients, a gossiping protocol is hard to implement in practice. Meanwhile, alternative solutions such as EthIKS are not scalable. This paper presents Trusternity, an auditing scheme relying on Ethereum blockchain that is easy to implement, scalable and inexpensive to operate.	bitcoin	Hoang-Long Nguyen;Claudia-Lavinia Ignat;Olivier Perrin	2018		10.1145/3184558.3186938	key management;public-key cryptography;scalability;data structure;audit;incentive;distributed computing;server;vulnerability;business	DB	-44.49794600548603	68.45730862401801	72978

Moreover, the security of blockchain data directly affects the security of various applications of blockchain. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive classification and summary of the security of blockchain data. First, we present classification of blockchain data attacks. Subsequently, we present the attacks and defenses of blockchain data in terms of privacy, availability, integrity and controllability. Data privacy attacks present data leakage or data obtained by attackers through analysis. Data availability attacks present abnormal or incorrect access to blockchain data. Data integrity attacks present blockchain data being tampered. Data controllability attacks present blockchain data accidentally manipulated by smart contract vulnerability.

We make contribution to the satellite multicast security protocols in two major points. These are protocol architecture design and cryptographic methods aspects. Our protocol is specifically designed for multicast systems having very large number of members and highly dynamic member join leave characteristic. Our protocol minimizes the rekeying workload of satellite layers and shows high performance for many criteria using three independent key distribution layers. In addition, our protocol uses a different cryptographic method for each layer and achieves major cryptographic goals together that are not provided in implementations of some other protocols.

However, the properties of tags in itself which is the core of RFID have a dysfunction like an invasion of privacy for user. An existing cryptanalytic protection scheme of the information leakage has a difficult problem to apply to RFID tags for privacy protection. We applied Ohkubo scheme to the protection of the tag's information efficiently in the RFID system environment using low-cost tags. But, this method has all information of tags to identify tag's ID and then performs the process of identification in sequence in the Back-end server. These processes have lots of computations so that it has problems about scalability. In this paper, we are based on Ohkubo scheme to solve problems, and then analyze the parallelism with the Hellman’s tradeoff method and divide it into nodes in parallel. As a result, we can reduce the computing complexity. So, we show the results to be enhanced the scalability.	computation;cryptanalysis;environment variable;information leakage;parallel computing;privacy;radio-frequency identification;scalability;server (computing);spectral leakage	Seong-Pyo Hong;Moon-Su Jung;Il-Yong Chung	2009	2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC	10.1109/NCM.2009.25	radio-frequency identification;decision support system;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-43.226409853550656	65.8087264828481	73770

The paper gives an introduction to certificates as authentication mediums and their security storages. An appropriate cryptographic background is also stated. A scenario for using certificates and their security storages is presented. The scenario was practically implemented. The main goal is a detailed description of an authentication process held in a web environment. Certificates with matching private keys and hardware cryptographic devices are involved in the authentication process. The description is mainly aimed at certificates, hardware cryptographic devices and their usage in significant parts of a secured connection establishment.	authentication	Radek Dolezel;Jens Myrup Pedersen	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23154-4_57	data authentication algorithm;cryptographic primitive;computer science;hash-based message authentication code;internet privacy;world wide web;controlled cryptographic item;computer security	Crypto	-47.08964965781903	70.00810461560539	74000
4f67de612b2cd5ae4222a5e0dec0923201f9d799	efficient quantum-resistant trust infrastructure based on himmo		Secure Internet communications face conflicting demands: while advances in (quantum) computers require stronger, quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, the Internet of Things demands better-performing protocols. Finally, communication links usually depend on a single root-of-trust, e.g., a certification authority which forms a single point-offailure that is too big of a risk for future systems. This paper addresses these problems by proposing a hybrid infrastructure that combines the quantum-resistant HIMMO key pre-distribution scheme based on multiple Trusted Third Parties with public-key cryptography. During operation, any pair of devices can use private HIMMO key material and public keys to establish a secure and authenticated link, where their public keys are certified beforehand by multiple TTPs, acting as roots of trust. Our solution is resilient to the capture of individual roots of trust without affecting performance, while public-key cryptography provides features such as forward-secrecy. Combining HIMMO identities with public keys enables secure certification of public keys and distribution of HIMMO key material from multiple TTPs, without requiring an out-of-band channel. The infrastructure can be tuned to fit Internet of Things use-cases benefiting from an efficient, non-interactive and authenticated key exchange, or to fit use-cases where the use of multiple TTPs provides privacy safe-guards when lawful interception is required. Our TLS proof-of-concept shows the feasibility of our proposal by integrating the above security features with minimal changes in the TLS protocol.

As liability of CA is a source of cost barrier for widespread use of PKI services, we concentrate on cost-efficient solutions. At the same time we formulate requirements that fill the security gaps of the traditional PKI. We present exemplary technical solutions that witness feasibility of these requirements.	public key infrastructure	Lukasz Krzywiecki;Przemyslaw Kubiak;Miroslaw Kutylowski;Michal Tabor;Daniel Wachnik	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30359-3_26	knowledge management;certificate authority;witness;certificate;public key certificate;computer science;schnorr signature;public key infrastructure;liability;authentication	Crypto	-45.56929035086268	67.74128025799779	74217
7fa012ef05faa7e3eddc6a3f556975ecf56013af	regrsa: using registers as buffers to resist memory disclosure attacks		Memory disclosure attacks, such as cold-boot attacks and DMA attacks, allow attackers to access all memory contents, therefore introduce great threats to plaintext sensitive data in memory. Register-based and cache-based schemes have been used to implement RSA securely, at the expense of decreased performance. In this paper, we propose another concept named register buffer, which makes use of all available registers as secure data buffer, no matter scalar registers or vector registers. The plaintext sensitive data only appear in register buffer. Based on this concept, we finish a security implementation of 2048-bit RSA called RegRSA, to defeat against memory disclosure attacks. The 1024-bit Montgomery multiplication in RegRSA runs entirely in register buffer, by performing computations using scalar instructions and registers, maintaining intermediate variables in vector registers. Due to the size limitation of register buffer, several variables out of Montgomery multiplications are spilled into memory. RegRSA encrypts these variables with AES before saving in memory. Furthermore, RegRSA employs a windowing method and the CRT speed-up to accelerate RSA, and minimizes the data exchange between registers and memory to reduce the workload of AES encryption/decryption. The evaluation on Intel Haswell i7-4770R shows that, the performance of RegRSA achieves a factor of 0.74 compared to the regular RSA implementation in OpenSSL and is much greater than PRIME, the existing register-based scheme for 2048-bit RSA. Moreover, RegRSA allows multiple instances to run on a multi-core CPU simultaneously, which makes it more practical for the real-world applications.	processor register	Yuan Zhao;Jingqiang Lin;Wuqiong Pan;Cong Xue;Fangyu Zheng;Ziqiang Ma	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-33630-5_20	parallel computing;computer security;computer science;memory address register;memory buffer register;data buffer;advanced encryption standard;memory type range register;register renaming;processor register;plaintext	NLP	-36.42120362813899	66.63912378143395	74265
4b6782bf7a58b0c123d6b7e812dda3ad9802c3d8	secure and private information retrieval (sapir) in cloud storage systems		An information theoretic approach to security and privacy for cloud data storage systems is introduced in this paper. The approach called Secure and Private Information Retrieval (SAPIR) is a random combination of all contents that are stored across the network by using Random Linear Fountain codes. SAPIR achieves asymptotic perfect secrecy. To retrieve a content, a group of servers collaborate with each other to form a Repair Group. Further, an information theoretic Private Information Retrieval scheme based on random queries is proposed that ensures that a user privately downloads its desired content without the servers knowing the requested content index. The proposed scheme is adaptive and can provide privacy against a significant number of colluding servers.		Mohsen Karimzadeh Kiskani;Hamid R.

475d1268b8328c2a2fb3b711b35c7676bcb275a2	sok: a consensus taxonomy in the blockchain era		Consensus (a.k.a. Byzantine agreement) is arguably one of the most fundamental problems in distributed systems, playing also an important role in the area of cryptographic protocols as the enabler of a secure broadcast functionality. While the problem has a long and rich history and has been analyzed from many different perspectives, recently, with the advent of blockchain protocols like Bitcoin, it has experienced renewed interest from a much wider community of researchers and has seen its application expand to various novel settings. One of the main issues in consensus research is the many different variants of the problem that exist as well as the various ways the problem behaves when different setup, computational assumptions and network models are considered. In this work we perform a systematization of knowledge in the landscape of consensus research starting with the original formulation in the early 1980s up to the present blockchain-based new class of consensus protocols. Our work is a roadmap for studying the consensus problem under its many guises, classifying the way it operates in many settings and highlighting the exciting new applications that have emerged in the blockchain era.	bitcoin;byzantine fault tolerance;computational hardness assumption;consensus (computer science);cryptographic protocol;distributed computing	Juan A.

In particular, it describes the implementation of the library in J2ME. It is worth noticing, that RTML credentials are XML-like documents and thus the capability of porting these features on mobile devices makes the overall framework very interoperable with other RT frameworks (as for GRID systems). As policy language, we use actually a variant of RTML, whose policies are added with weights and are able to express quantitative experience-based notions of trust. It allow also to encode certain reputation and recommendation models. The obtained results show how the implementation on mobile devices is feasible and the running time acceptable for several applications.	mobile device;trust management (managerial science)	Davide Fais;Maurizio Colombo;Aliaksandr Lazouski	2009	Electr.

2762640f8fc4834edd2c69144f31b051f7b588b5	privacy-preserving task allocation for edge computing enhanced mobile crowdsensing		In traditional mobile crowdsensing (MCS) applications, the crowdsensing server (CS-server) need mobile users’ precise locations for optimal task allocation, which raises privacy concerns. This work proposes a framework P2TA to optimize task acceptance rate while protecting users’ privacy. Specifically, edge nodes are introduced as an anonymous server and a task allocation agent to prevent CS-server from directly obtaining user data and dispersing privacy risks. On this basis, a genetic algorithm that performed on edge nodes is designed to choose an initial obfuscation strategy. Furthermore, a privacy game model is used to optimize user/adversary objectives against each other to obtain a final obfuscation strategy which can be immune to posterior inference. Finally, edge nodes take user acceptance rate and task allocation rate into account comprehensively, focusing on maximizing the expected accepted task number under the constraint of differential privacy and distortion privacy. The effectiveness and superiority of P2TA to the exiting MCS task allocation schemes are validated via extensive simulations on the synthetic data, as well as the measured data collected by ourselves.

cb0848bfa6271f8d46fb047e7233bf958133d5c5	consolidating security notions in hardware masking		In this paper, we revisit the security conditions of masked hardware implementations. We describe a new, succinct, information-theoretic condition called d-glitch immunity which solely ensures security in the presence of glitches. We show that this single condition includes, but is not limited to, previous security notions such as those used in higher-order threshold implementations and in abstractions using ideal gates. On the other hand, it excludes unnecessary notions such as uniformity. We also treat the notion of (strong) non-interference from an information-theoretic point-of-view in order to unify the different security concepts and pave the way to the verification of composability in the presence of glitches. We conclude the paper by demonstrating how the condition can be used as an efficient and highly generic flaw detection mechanism for a variety of functions and schemes based on different operations and working in different fields.	application security;circuit complexity;composability;definition;flaw hypothesis methodology;françois lionet;glitch;information theory;interference (communication);national fund for scientific research;non-interference (security);oscar	Lauren De Meyer;Begül Bilgin;Oscar Reparaz	2018	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		discrete mathematics;computer science;classifier (linguistics);odds	Security	-34.46627670063399	72.52823296583635	74500

On-line, doing so requires the exchange of some certified information about the participants. The easy solution is to disclose one’s identity and reveal all of one’s certificates to establish such a trust relationship. However, it is clear that such an approach is unsatisfactory from a privacy point of view. In fact, often revealing any information that uniquely corresponds to a given individual is a bad idea from the privacy point of view.#R##N##R##N#In this survey paper we describe a framework where for each transaction there is a precise specification of what pieces of certified data is revealed to each participant. We show how to specify transactions in this framework, give examples of transactions that use it, and describe the cryptographic building blocks that this framework is built upon. We conclude with bibliographic notes on the state-of-the-art in this area.

746e55b5b93a9da5aedaf0ff42721d7ff041f18f	practical secure and privacy-preserving scheme for value-added applications in vanets	information security;vehicular ad hoc networks;conditional privacy	Advances in mobile networking and information processing technologies have triggered vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) for traffic safety and value-added applications. Most efforts have been made to address the security concerns while little work has been done to investigate security and privacy for value-added applications in VANETs. To fill this gap, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving scheme for value-added applications in VANETs; specifically, a vehicular secure and privacy-preserving location-based service (LBS). For each LBS transaction, the scheme provides authentication, integrity and non-repudiation for both the service provider and the vehicle. A vehicle can obtain the service in an anonymous way and hence vehicle privacy is well protected. However, if a vehicle maliciously uses the service, a tracing procedure can be invoked to find the malicious vehicle, thereby efficiently preventing vehicles from abusing the anonymity provided by the system. These features are achieved by efficiently exploiting the available infrastructure of VANETs and without requiring cooperation from other vehicles, which might be reluctant to cooperate or otherwise unavailable. Although public-key cryptosystems are employed as building blocks, no complicated certificate management is required by our system.

The approach is based on the explicit annotations of data and network nodes. Data are tagged with information about the allowed movements, network nodes are tagged with information about the nodes that can send data and spawn processes to them. The annotations are used to confine movements of data and processes. The approach is illustrated by applying it to three paradigmatic calculi for global computing, namely cKlaim (a calculus at the basis of Klaim), Dπ (a distributed version of the π-calculus) and Mobile Ambients Calculus. For all of these formalisms, it is shown that their semantics guarantees that computations proceed only while respecting confinement constraints. Namely, it is proven that, after successful static type checking, data can reside at and cross only authorised nodes. “Local” formulations of this property where only relevant sub-nets type check are also presented. Finally, the theory is tested by using it to model secure behaviours of a UNIX-like multiuser system.	ambient calculus;authorization;computation;multi-user;process (computing);spawn (computing);type system;unix;unix-like	Rocco De Nicola;Daniele Gorla;Rosario Pugliese	2006	Sci.

Based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), this article will propose a new three-party password based authenticated key exchange scheme. The proposed method not only reduces computation cost for remote users and a trusted server but also is more efficient than previously proposed schemes. It is very suitable for hardware-limited users such as mobile units or smart cards.	authenticated key exchange;authentication;computation;elliptic curve cryptography;password;server (computing);session key;smart card	Hui-Feng Huang;Yi-Jia Chang;Kuo-Ching Liu	2009	2009 10th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks	10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.59	zero-knowledge password proof;password policy;encrypted key exchange;s/key;computer science;internet privacy;key derivation function;one-time password;key stretching;key distribution;password;computer security;computer network;password strength	Security	-44.173560276716856	73.32434350498582	74771

Methods of publishing and widely utilizing set-valued data while protecting personal information have been extensively studied in the field of privacy-preserving data publishing. Until now, basic models such as k-anonymity or km-anonymity could not cope with attribute inference by an adversary with background knowledge of the records. On the other hand, the ρ-uncertainty model makes it possible to prevent attribute inference with a confidence value above a certain level in set-valued data. However, even in that case, there is the problem that items to be protected have to be designated in advance. In this research, we propose a new model that can provide more suitable privacy protection for each individual by protecting different items designated for each record distinctively and build a heuristic algorithm to achieve this guarantee using partial suppression. In addition, considering the problem that the computational complexity of the algorithm increases combinatorially with increasing data size, we introduce the concept of probabilistic relaxation of privacy guarantee. Finally, we show the experimental results of evaluating the performance of the algorithms using real-world datasets.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;data anonymization;heuristic (computer science);linear programming relaxation;personalization;personally identifiable information;privacy;probabilistic automaton;zero suppression	Takuma Nakagawa;Hiromi Arai;Hiroshi Nakagawa	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)	10.1109/ICDMW.2017.142	artificial intelligence;machine learning;data publishing;data mining;information privacy;heuristic (computer science);adversary;computer science;data modeling;probabilistic logic;inference;computational complexity theory	DB	-40.361471675403166	63.623324582689044	74852
5a27236347c779281162de8fba2776170749d201	towards automated transactions based on the offline handwritten signatures		Automating business transactions over the Internet relies on digital signatures, a replacement of conventional handwritten signatures in paper-based processes. Although they guarantee data integrity and authenticity, digital signatures are not as convenient to users as the manuscript ones. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to produce digital signatures using off-line hand-written signatures. This methodology facilitate the automation of business processes, where users continually employ their handwritten signatures for authentication. Users are isolated from the details related to the generation of digital signatures, yet benefit from enhanced security. First, signature templates from a user are captured and employed to lock his private key in a fuzzy vault. Then, when the user signs a document by hand, his handwritten signature image is employed to unlock his private key. The unlocked key produces a digital signature that is attached to the digitized document. The verification of the digital signature by a recipient implies authenticity of the manuscript signature and integrity of the signed document. Experimental results on the Brazilian off-line signature database (that includes various forgeries) confirms the viability of the proposed approach. Private keys of 1024-bits were unlocked by signature images with Average Error Rate of about 7.8%.	atm turbo;authentication;business process;data integrity;digital signature;electronic signature;embedded system;farmville;feature extraction;feature selection;internet;online and offline;public-key cryptography;unlockable game;user profile	George S.

Private Neighbor Selection is constructed on the basis of the notion of differential privacy to privately choose neighbors. Recommendation-Aware Sensitivity is introduced to enhance the performance of recommendations. Theoretical and experimental analysis are provided to show the proposed algorithm can preserve differential privacy while retaining the accuracy of recommendations.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;differential privacy;recommender system	Tianqing Zhu;Gang Li;Yongli Ren;Wanlei Zhou;Ping Xiong	2013	2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2013)	10.1145/2492517.2492519	privacy software;information privacy;computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;differential privacy;recommender system	DB	-38.81852293708088	64.90295622434864	75144

After examining the existing “Yoking Proof” protocols of RFID, this paper proposes a protocol called “Select-Response” Grouping Proof. Instead of waiting the computation result from the tags as previous protocols, the new protocol uses a new mechanism that the reader actively selects the demanded tags to fulfill the verification. With this fundamental change, our protocol neutralizes the threats of denial of service attack, which is suffered by the “Yoking Proof” protocols, and provide collision-free and missing tag identification properties, which would offer great help in the practical applications.	computation;denial-of-service attack;pure function;radio-frequency identification;the outsider	Xuefei Leng;Yuanhung Lien;Keith Mayes;Konstantinos Markantonakis;Jung-Hui Chiu	2009	2009 First Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems	10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.94	radio-frequency identification;computer science;information security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-44.52169662389343	72.39191573790767	75197
9f03ec5ca562b8ed16f8d4b3a2d0ed8fdb2c3b3e	updatable searchable symmetric encryption with fine-grained delete functionality		With the wide spread of Cloud service, users are outsourcing their data to the third party servers. When we delegate our data to the cloud servers, there is such a potential risk that the data stored in the servers is stolen. If the data are stored in the encrypted form, the damage caused by data theft is low because the data will not leak to other parties. However, a new problem arises, that is, users are not able to operate encrypted data, which loses the merit of cloud computing. To solve such a problem, searchable symmetric encryption(SSE) is proposed. SSE is a cryptographic protocol that can execute keyword search over encrypted documents without decrypting them. Secure Indexes is one of realizations of SSE that provides constant time keyword search per document with the help of pseudo-random function and Bloom filters. However, Secure Indexes dose not support addition and deletion of documents. Tekin and Sahin proposed an improved Secure Indexes scheme that supports addition and deletion by employing Bloom filter and counting Bloom filter. The drawback of their scheme is that these operations are implemented in user side, which is not desired in the cloud computing since the aim of cloud computing is to delegate as many operations as possible. This paper proposes new SSE scheme. The proposed scheme also employ counting Bloom filter, but provide more fine-grained operations compared to the scheme by Tekin and Sahin in the sense that the proposed scheme provides not only search documents but add and delete the elements of document. Moreover, these operations are executed in the server side. The performance of the proposed SSE is comparable to the existing scheme which provides constant time for search, add and delete per document. We also implemented this SSE scheme, and verified that the scheme performed well not only theoretically but also in practice.

18765a23b544b599fbebcacfe5479ec5c45082cd	privacy preserving similarity evaluation of time series data		Abstract: Privacy preserving issues of time series databases in financial, medical and transportation applications have become more and more important recently. A key problem in time series databases is to compute the similarity between two different time series. Although, some work has been done in the past few years on security problems for time series data, there is very limited work on computing securely the similarity between two time series. We consider exactly this problem in a two party setting. In particular, we want to compute the similarity between two time series, one stored in one party and the other in the other, without revealing the actual time series to the other party. The two parties should learn only the value of the similarity, according to a specific similarity function, and nothing more about the time series of the other party. At the same time, we want to do that as efficiently as possible. Therefore, we propose protocols for computing the similarity (or distance) for time series using two popular and well know functions: Dynamic Time Warping and Discrete Frechet Distance. Since both of these functions require dynamic programming to be computed, our protocols not only protect the original time series data, but also try to prevent the parties involved in the computation to infer intermediate results, including the matrix of the dynamic programming algorithm and the path of the optimal solution. The protocols combine partial homomorphic encryption and random offsets to minimize the leakage of intermediate information and at the same time provide efficient computation. The protocols are scalable and easy to implement. We also provide an experimental evaluation where we assess the efficiency and practicality of our schemes.

This study develops, defines, and applies a statistical technique for the compromise of confidential information in a statistical database. Attribute Correlational Modeling (ACM) recognizes that the information contained in a statistical database represents real world statistical phenomena. As such, ACM utilizes the correlational behavior existing among the database attributes in order to compromise confidential information. The technique is applied to the 1980 U.S. Census Database and is found to be effective as a compromise tool. The contribution of the study is additional knowledge of the degree of security of confidential statistical databases. Knowledge of additional threats to security may lead to the eventual ability to identify high privacy risk databases, and possibly to reduce that degree of risk.	aggregate data;confidentiality;statistical database	Michael A.

This is especially important for the use of biometric data in identity management systems, because of risks of use as unique identifiers and identification. This chapter explains the Best Practices which were developed in the Turbine project. These Best Practices recommend inter alia the creation of multiple trusted revocable protected biometric identities, which are irreversible and unlinkable.	best practice;biometrics;privacy	Els Kindt	2013		10.1007/978-1-4471-5230-9_14	data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-46.233450543141274	62.15056617046035	75623

Severalstudies have shown how easily strangers can extract personaldata about users from the network. Other studies haveshown that an extremely small percentage of OSN userschange their permissive default privacy settings. Complementary systems have been proposed to provide privacy for OSN users but many of them seem to be costly in terms ofsimplicity or management overhead. Furthermore, severalof these approaches seem to violate the social aspect of online social networks by reducing the problem to manual access management with cryptography. Under this setting, instead of freely sharing one’s data with its friends, a user will share data only with those friends possessing allowed cryptographic keys. While these systems will indeed provide additional privacy for user data, they will not address a more fundamental problem that exists within OSNs: the inability of the network to easily and automatically distinguish relationship quality between a user and its friends. This distinction may be critical in providing a simple, automatic privacy mechanism for OSNs. We propose a unique approach utilizing interactions between friends as the currency for data access. This model operates within the bounds of social networks while incurring minimum additional management overhead for the user. As a first step, we consider interaction intensity as a proxy for relationship quality for the purpose of making privacy decisions. Although we present our ideas from the privacy perspective we also discuss how our approach can be used to support the development of more secure social network based applications.	cryptography;interaction;overhead (computing);privacy;social network	Lerone Banks;Shyhtsun Felix Wu	2009	2009 International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/CSE.2009.429	data access;privacy software;information privacy;computer science;cryptography;data mining;database;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network;social network	DB	-44.028757391246444	61.320220838079294	76036
7e61f5691517214d38c89807dc2177b9743007a7	silentwhispers: enforcing security and privacy in decentralized credit networks		Credit networks model transitive trust (or credit) between users in a distributed environment and have recently seen a rapid increase of popularity due to their flexible design and robustness against intrusion. They serve today as a backbone of real-world IOweYou transaction settlement networks such as Ripple and Stellar, which are deployed by various banks worldwide, as well as several other systems, such as spamresistant communication protocols and Sybil-tolerant social networks. Current solutions, however, raise serious privacy concerns, as the network topology as well as the credit value of the links are made public for apparent transparency purposes and any changes are logged. In payment scenarios, for instance, this means that all transactions have to be public and everybody knows who paid what to whom. In this work, we question the necessity of a privacy-invasive transaction ledger. In particular, we present SilentWhispers, the first distributed, privacy-preserving credit network that does not require any ledger to protect the integrity of transactions. Yet, SilentWhispers guarantees integrity and privacy of link values and transactions even in the presence of distrustful users and malicious neighbors, whose misbehavior in changing link values is detected and such users can be held accountable. We formalize these properties as ideal functionalities in the universal composability framework and present a secure realization based on a novel combination of secret-sharing-based multiparty computation and digital signature chains. SilentWhispers can handle network churn, and it is efficient as demonstrated with a prototype implementation evaluated using payments data extracted from the currently deployed Ripple payment system.	computation;digital signature;internet backbone;malware;network topology;privacy;prototype;ripple;secret sharing;social network;stellar (payment network);universal composability	Giulio Malavolta;Pedro Moreno-Sanchez;Aniket Kate;Matteo Maffei	2016	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		information privacy;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-46.06111954924996	63.66192165800971	76104

ad2ee0a6f4a19d44cadbfb2df4712fccc284c9c6	clever arbiters versus malicious adversaries - on the gap between known-input security and chosen-input security		When moving from known-input security to chosen-input security, some generic attacks sometimes become possible and must be discarded by a specific set of rules in the threat model. Similarly, common practices consist of fixing security systems, once an exploit is discovered, by adding a specific rule to thwart it. To study feasibility, we investigate a new security notion: security against undetectable attacks. I.e., attacks which cannot be ruled out by any specific rule based on the observable behavior of the adversary. In this model, chosen-input attacks must specify inputs which are indistinguishable from the ones in known-input attacks. Otherwise, they could be ruled out, in theory. Although non-falsifiable, this notion provides interesting results: for any primitives based on symmetric encryption, message authentication code (MAC), or pseudorandom function (PRF), known-input security is equivalent to this restricted chosen-input security in Minicrypt. Otherwise, any separation implies the construction of a public-key cryptosystem (PKC): for a known-input-secure primitive, any undetectable chosen-input attack transforms the primitive into a PKC. In this paper, we develop the notion of security based on open rules. We show the above results. We revisit the notion of related-key security of block ciphers to illustrate these results. Interestingly, when the relation among the keys is specified as a black box, no chosen-relation security is feasible. By translating this result to non-black box relations, either no known-input security is feasible, or we can recognize any obfuscated relation by a fixed set of rules, or we can build a PKC. Any of these three results is quite interesting in itself.	adversary (cryptography);arbiter (electronics);black box;block cipher;cryptosystem;discrete logarithm;encryption;message authentication code;observable;pkc (conference);primitive recursive function;pseudorandom function family;pseudorandomness;public-key cryptography;related-key attack;symmetric-key algorithm;threat model	Serge Vaudenay	2016		10.1007/978-3-662-49301-4_31	provable security;mathematics;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	Crypto	-37.38047599547406	73.74902942471941	76284

Furthermore, some drawbacks, such as the users who choose the same passwords will have the same identities and unavailability for evicting a user from the system, will also be eliminated.

2aecdd190066a57db8fea1e1143dc5fc288050e0	quantifying the utility-privacy tradeoff in the internet of things		The Internet of Things (IoT) promises many advantages in the control and monitoring of physical systems from both efficacy and efficiency perspectives. However, in the wrong hands, the data might pose a privacy threat. In this article, we consider the tradeoff between the operational value of data collected in the IoT and the privacy of consumers. We present a general framework for quantifying this tradeoff in the IoT, and focus on a smart grid application for a proof of concept. In particular, we analyze the tradeoff between smart grid operations and how often data are collected by considering a realistic direct-load control example using thermostatically controlled loads, and we give simulation results to show how its performance degrades as the sampling frequency decreases. Additionally, we introduce a new privacy metric, which we call inferential privacy. This privacy metric assumes a strong adversary model and provides an upper bound on the adversary’s ability to infer a private parameter, independent of the algorithm he uses. Combining these two results allows us to directly consider the tradeoff between better operational performance and consumer privacy.	adversary (cryptography);adversary model;algorithm;article 8 of the european convention on human rights;consumer privacy;cyber-physical system;inferential programming;inferential theory of learning;information theory;internet of things;load management;norm (social);observable;personally identifiable information;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Roy Dong;Lillian J.

5301c115df7679179a541f0d5e3288c812278e36	secure transmission of multimedia contents over low-power mobile devices		Abstract Secure transmission of multimedia contents is computationally challenging due to the sheer volume of data involved, and achieving this by fully encrypting multimedia contents is not a viable solution for mobile devices, as they run on limited battery power and employ relatively slower processors compared to their desktop counterparts. Also, in some particular application scenarios, the value, secrecy, and/or privacy of the information is time dependent and short lived. This paper presents a highly scalable approach for securing multimedia streams on mobile devices by encrypting intelligently only selected portions of the bit stream. More importantly, the proposed solution works mainly on compressed bit stream and does not require any media decoding. It encrypts on the average less than 3% of a packet load and provides robust security equivalent to that of a fully encrypted bit stream. This solution has been implemented on desktop, laptop, netbook and Nokia N series platforms. The proposed scheme is approximately 15 times faster (on average) and processes 8 to 12 times more information for a given battery life when compared to a state of the art full encryption based solutions.	low-power broadcasting;mobile device;secure transmission	Fadi Almasalha;Farid Naït-Abdesselam;Goce Trajcevski;Ashfaq A.

Such data are collected by different researchers and organizations and are usually also shared via different channels. These data usually have huge volume because there are millions of social network users throughout the world. In this context, ownership protection of such data sets with huge volume becomes relevant. Digital watermarking is a more demanding solution than any other technique for ensuring rights protection and integrity of the original data sets. The objective of this paper is to devise a reversible watermarking technique for the social network data to prove ownership rights and also provide a mechanism for data recovery. Robustness of the proposed technique is evaluated through attack analysis using experimental study. In this paper, Z notation-based formal specification is also provided to show the working of the proposed reversible watermarking technique for social network data sets for enabling data trust in Cyber, Physical, and Social Computing (CPSCom).	data recovery;digital watermarking;experiment;formal specification;mined;social computing;social network;watermarking attack;z notation	Saman Iftikhar;M.

The web document could contain the sensitive information and it should be sent to users who have an authority accessing the sensitive information. In a well-known method, called XML Pool Encryption, the sensitive information is separated from the document, and then, it is encrypted. Therefore, reconstruction of a document is required when the document is shown to a user. For the reconstruction, it is very important that we identify the location of decrypted information effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a labeling scheme to support the fast reconstruction of document, based on the use of encryption techniques. The proposed labeling scheme supports the inference of structure information in any portion of the document. In the experimental results, our labeling scheme shows an efficiency in searching for the location of decrypted information.

We propose two provably-secure and practical schemes: KeyDer-GKM and ReEnc-GKM. The rekey process in these schemes has an O(log N) rekey message and O(log N) computation and storage cost for a member, where N is the number of group members. Moreover, our schemes have the following distinct features. (1) Each member is given only one private key and O(log N) public information. The private key remains unchanged during the membership period. For the public information, a member can hold them locally and update accordingly from each rekey message, or get them from a public bulletin if needed. (2) The size of published information is O(N) no matter how many rekey processes occur. The computation cost for a member, who has missed some rekey messages, to compute the up-to-date group key is always O(log N) no matter how many rekey messages have been missed.#R##N##R##N#Our KeyDer-GKM scheme is very efficient since it can be implemented by using hash and XOR functions only. Our ReEnc-GKM scheme allows a member to reduce the cost of computing the up-to-date group key to one decryption by outsourcing log N operations. Both of our schemes are shown immune to the collusion attacks. For KeyDer-GKM, a set of collusive members cannot recover an unauthorized group key. For ReEnc-GKM, a set of collusive members cannot distinguish an unauthorized group key from a random string.	group key;key management;semiconductor industry;state (computer science);stateful firewall	Yi-Ruei Chen;Wen-Guey Tzeng	2017	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2016.08.001	distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-41.728849226442044	72.53971219168976	76885

Database-as-a-service model offers considerable benefits to organizations with data management needs by allowing them to outsource  their data management infrastructures. Yet, the model introduces many significant challenges, in particular that of data privacy  and security. Ensuring the integrity of the database, which is hosted by a service provider, is a critical and challenging  problem in this context. We propose an encrypted database integrity assurance scheme, which allows the owner of the data to  ensure the integrity of the database hosted at the service provider site, in addition to the security of the stored data against  malicious attacks.  	cloud database	Hakan Hacigümüs;Balakrishna R.

In spite of the case that private information is not stored in those tags, one can identify entities, analyze their preferences, and track them by collecting data related with the tags and aggregating it. Especially, it might be more serious at the point of that data collection may be done not only by enterprises and government, but also by individuals.

96432894dce05e10e7201e48ba60018f8f0df65a	systematic literature review on the anonymization of high dimensional streaming datasets for health data sharing		Abstract   One of the biggest challenges to health data sharingis regulations that prohibit the transmission and distribution of Personal Health Information (PHI) even among collaborating organizations. This impedes research and reduces the utility of these datasets. Anonymization can address this issue by hidingPHI while maintaining the analytical utility of the data. Much research has focused on data that is static, independent and complete. Unfortunately, this is not typical of health data. Instead of static, independent tables, health data is in relational databases with multiple high-dimensional tables that are transactional and constantly changing. Data recipients usually receive multiple versions of the database over time. This study reviews literature on anonymization methodologies for large and fast changing high-dimensional datasets, especially health data. Relevant papers are analyzed, categorized and compared in terms of scope, and contributions. Finally, we used the extracted details from our analysis to outline possible research direction for developing a realistic anonymization framework for health data sharing.	data anonymization	Benjamin Eze;Liam Peyton	2015		10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.353	computer science;data science;data mining;database	ML	-40.07240507625124	63.76248217537343	77527

This research work proposes that one trust component is not enough when deciding on whether or not to trust a specific node in a wireless sensor network. This paper discusses and analyses the results from the communication trust component (binary) and the data trust component (continuous) and proves that either component by itself, can mislead the network and eventually cause a total breakdown of the network. As a result of this, new algorithms are needed to combine more than one trust component to infer the overall trust. The proposed algorithm is simple and generic as it allows trust components to be added and deleted easily. Simulation results demonstrate that a node is highly trustworthy provided that both trust components simultaneously confirm its trustworthiness and conversely, a node is highly untrustworthy if its untrustworthiness is asserted by both components.	algorithm;bayesian network;computational model;data point;point of view (computer hardware company);simulation;smoothing;trust (emotion);trustworthy computing	Mohammad Momani;Subhash Challa;Rami Al-Hmouz	2010	JNW	10.4304/jnw.5.7.815-822	fusion;bayesian probability;computer science;sensor;data mining;internet privacy;trustworthy computing;computer security;statistics;computer network;data	Mobile	-36.97768113556924	63.7462998119384	77597

The biometrics, the password and the storage device are the elements of the three-factor authentication. In 2013, Yeh et al. proposed a three-factor user authentication scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography. However, we find that it has weaknesses including useless user identity, ambiguous process, no session key and no mutual authentication. Also, it cannot resist the user forgery attack and the server spoofing attack. Moreover, Khan et al. propose a fingerprint-based remote authentication scheme with mobile devices. Unfortunately it cannot withstand the user impersonation attack and the De-synchronization attack. Furthermore, the useru0027s identity cannot be anonymous, either. To overcome the disadvantages, we propose a new three-factor remote authentication scheme and give a formal proof with strong forward security. It could provide the useru0027s privacy and is secure. Compared to some recent three-factor authentication schemes, our scheme is secure and practical.	authentication;biometrics;client–server model;ecc memory;formal proof;fuzzy extractor;mobile device;multi-factor authentication;provable security;randomness extractor;server (computing);telecommunications network	Fan Wu;Lili Xu;Saru Kumari;Xiong Li	2015	Computers & Electrical Engineering	10.1016/j.compeleceng.2015.02.015	data authentication algorithm;formal proof;challenge–response authentication;computer science;authentication protocol;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;biometrics	Security	-45.371011061254336	73.9811980444689	77665

In particular, side-channel attacks consist in performing a statistical analysis of the web traffic to gain sensitive information about a client. In this paper, we investigate how side-channel leaks can be used on search engines such as Google or Bing to retrieve the client’s search query. In contrast to previous works, due to payload randomization and compression, it is not always possible to uniquely map a search query to a web traffic signature and hence stochastic algorithms must be used. They yield, for the French language, an exact recovery of search word in more than 30% of the cases. Finally, we present some methods to mitigate such side-channel leaks.	algorithm;algorithmic composition;https;information sensitivity;side-channel attack;web application;web search engine;web traffic	Alexander Schaub;Emmanuel Schneider;Alexandros Hollender;Vinicius Calasans;Laurent Jolie;Robin Touillon;Annelie Heuser;Sylvain Guilley;Olivier Rioul	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-17127-2_8	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;world wide web	Web+IR	-39.58828553948569	68.48098808695305	77683

When the data owner wants to re-select a new cloud service provider, the data needs to be transmitted from Cloud A to Cloud B. How to ensure that data has been safely transferred to Cloud B and Cloud A honestly implementing data deletion has become a hot topic for many scholars. To solve these problems, Liang et al. proposed a provable data transfer protocol based on provable data possession and deletion for secure cloud storage. However, we find a security flaw in their scheme. In this paper, we first review their scheme and then present our attack in detail. Finally, we propose an improved scheme which can resist the attack well.

We assume that members are concerned about their reputation in the sense that they do not want their votes to be disclosed and their potentially malicious actions to become public. Our protocol neither requires a central authority, strong cryptography, nor a randomization mechanism, using a simple secret sharing scheme and verification procedures to accurately determine the result of each poll. Our scalable protocol expands on the binary polling protocol by Guerraoui, Huguenin, Kermarrec and Monod and enables deterministic n-ary voting without significantly increasing the complexity of the protocol while preserving optimal voter privacy, allowing nodes to abstain from a poll--assuming honest nodes--and tabulating exact poll results. Misbehaving nodes are exposed with a non-zero probability and the probability of dishonest members violating voter privacy is balanced by their impact on the accuracy of the result. Limiting the number of dishonest nodes (B) such that they do not constitute a majority in any two consecutive groups of nodes and using a privacy parameter k, the impact of colluding malicious nodes is bounded by (2nk-k+1)B for any one element of the global tally and significantly less for all successive elements. Further, our algorithm improves on prior algorithms and ensures that voter privacy is optimally protected and that in the worst case, a node's vote is only compromised with probability (Bi/nk+1)k+1.	best, worst and average case;centralized computing;consciousness;crash (computing);distributed algorithm;fault tolerance;malware;peer-to-peer;privacy;scalability;secret sharing;social network;strong cryptography	Burkhard Englert;Reza Gheissari	2013	2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2013.109	computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-39.31872081280291	72.3985649243855	77971

However, current delegation mechanisms used in emerging Grids have problems to allow for flexible and secure delegation. This paper presents a framework to realize restricted delegation using a specific attribute certificate with trust value in grid environments. The framework employs attribute certificates to convey rights separately from identity certificates used for authentication, and enables chained delegations by using attribute certificate chains. In the framework the verifier can enforce securely authorization with delegation by checking the trust values of AC chains, and judge if a delegation is a trusted delegation by evaluating the reputation value of the delegation chain. The paper discusses the way of computing trust and reputation for delegation, and describes some details of delegation, including the creation of delegation credential and the chained delegation protocol.	authentication;authorization certificate;credential;markov chain;principle of least privilege	Wenbao Jiang;Chen Li;Shuang Hao;Yiqi Dai	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-31979-5_25	computer science;authentication;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-36.16478875941641	61.098151416383416	78231

Using a dataset of over 7700 accounts, we assess the extent to which passwords that users choose to replace expired ones pose an obstacle to the attacker's continued access. We develop a framework by which an attacker can search for a user's new password from an old one, and design an efficient algorithm to build an approximately optimal search strategy. We then use this strategy to measure the difficulty of breaking newly chosen passwords from old ones. We believe our study calls into question the merit of continuing the practice of password expiration.	algorithm;password;transponder (aeronautics)	Yinqian Zhang;Fabian Monrose;Michael K.

However, evidences show that due to the concerns of personal privacy, users’ reluctance to disclose their personal information has become a major barrier for the development of personalized recommendation. In this paper, we propose to generate a group of fake preference profiles, so as to cover up the user sensitive subjects, and thus protect user personal privacy in personalized recommendation. First, we present a client-based framework for user privacy protection, which requires not only no change to existing recommendation algorithms, but also no compromise to the recommendation accuracy. Second, based on the framework, we introduce a privacy protection model, which formulates the two requirements that ideal fake preference profiles should satisfy: (1) the similarity of feature distribution, which measures the effectiveness of fake preference profiles to hide a genuine user preference profile; and (2) the exposure degree of sensitive subjects, which measures the effectiveness of fake preference profiles to cover up the sensitive subjects. Finally, based on a subject repository of product classification, we present an implementation algorithm to well meet the privacy protection model. Both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.	algorithm;information overload;internet;personalization;personally identifiable information;privacy;requirement;time complexity	Zongda Wu;Guiling Li;Qi Liu;Guandong Xu;Enhong Chen	2018	IEEE Transactions on Services Computing	10.1109/TSC.2016.2575825	the internet;privacy by design;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;privacy software;compromise;product classification;personally identifiable information;information privacy	Security	-40.855291745861685	63.42942878675026	78437

cae0f4e63d94bc6d8cfe223bc4b818802a9a4c4f	information security and cryptology		Threshold cryptography aims at enhancing the availability and security of decryption and signature schemes by splitting private keys into several (say n) shares (typically, each of size comparable to the original secret key). In these schemes, a quorum of at least (d ≤ n) servers needs to act upon a message to produce the result (decrypted value or signature), while corrupting less than d servers maintains the scheme’s security. For about two decades, extensive study was dedicated to this subject, which created a number of notable results. So far, most practical threshold signatures, where servers act non-interactively, were analyzed in the limited static corruption model (where the adversary chooses which servers will be corrupted at the system’s initialization stage). Existing threshold encryption schemes that withstand the strongest combination of adaptive malicious corruptions (allowing the adversary to corrupt servers at any time based on its complete view), and chosenciphertext attacks (CCA) all require interaction (in the non-idealized model) and attempts to remedy this problem resulted only in relaxed schemes. The same is true for threshold signatures secure under chosenmessage attacks (CMA). It was open (for about 10 years) whether there are non-interactive threshold schemes providing the highest security (namely, CCA-secure encryption and CMA-secure signature) with scalable shares (i.e., as short as the original key) and adaptive security. This paper first surveys our ICALP 2011 work which answers this question affirmatively by presenting such efficient decryption and signature schemes within a unified algebraic framework. The paper then describes how to design on top of the surveyed system the first “forward-secure non-interactive threshold cryptosystem with adaptive security.”	adversary (cryptography);antivirus software;cma-es;cryptography;digital signature;encryption;icalp;information security;interactivity;key (cryptography);malware;scalability;secure voice;threshold cryptosystem	Chuan-Kun Wu;Moti Yung;Dongdai Lin	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-34704-7		Crypto	-39.33365668534782	74.37258666514577	78764

However, with the development of data analysis techniques, the privacy violation such as leakage of sensitive data and personal identification exposure are also increasing. Differential privacy is the technique to satisfy the requirement that any additional information should not be disclosed except information from the database itself. It is well known for protecting the privacy from arbitrary attack. However, recent research argues that there is a several ways to infer sensitive information from data although the differential privacy is applied. One of this inference method is to use the correlation between the data. In this paper, we investigate the new privacy threats using attribute correlation which are not covered by traditional studies and propose a privacy preserving technique that configures the differential privacy's noise parameter to solve this new threat. In the experiment, we show the weaknesses of traditional differential privacy method and validate that the proposed noise parameter configuration method provide a sufficient privacy protection and maintain an accuracy of data utility.	differential privacy;inference attack;information sensitivity;spectral leakage	Taebo Jung;Kangsoo Jung;Sehwa Park;Seog Park	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)	10.1109/BIGCOMP.2017.7881736	privacy software;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-39.7072213294632	63.30151854040571	79128

Based on an examination of 36 million file sizes from five different data sets, this paper provides a quantification of the obtainable improvements. For the evaluated data sets the file reduction, i.e the fraction of files that can be skipped without hash calculations, ranged from 0.009 to 0.525. The byte reduction, i.e. the fraction of bytes that can be skipped, ranged from 0.514 to 0.992. Simulation results showed that these reductions in many cases could decrease the time necessary for hash scanning by 50% or more.	byte;hash function;simulation	Johan Garcia	2012			computer science;theoretical computer science;database;hash list;world wide web	Security	-38.680714796263295	67.24360251408659	79172

We provide various characterizations of controlled release, based on a typed behavioural equivalence relative to a security level @s, which captures the idea of external observers of level @s. First, we define our security property through a universal quantification over all the possible active attackers, i.e., malicious processes which interact with the system possibly leaking secret information. Then we characterize the controlled release property in terms of an unwinding condition, which deals with so-called passive attackers trying to infer confidential information just by observing the behaviour of the system. Furthermore, we express controlled information release in terms of partial equivalence relations (per models, for short) in the style of a stream of similar studies for imperative and multi-threaded languages. We show that the controlled release property is compositional with respect to most operators of the language leading to efficient proof techniques for the verification and the construction of (compositional) secure systems.	π-calculus	Silvia Crafa;Sabina Rossi	2007	Inf.

9e4dd3d1329849be298f81f9812d7df952fd9105	an improved dynamic id based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environment		Mutual authentication has been widely used to verify the legal user and server over a common communication channel. To ensure secure connection between user and server, a large number of remote mutual authentication schemes for multi-server have been proposed by researchers. However, there is a common feature that the identity of user is static in the login phase, which may leak some information of user. Therefore, a good deal of smart card based anonymous multi-server remote user authentication scheme have been proposed to overcome this problem. Recently, Banerjee et al. pointed out that Li et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to user impersonates attack and stolen smart card attack. Later, they proposed an improved protocol to fix this problem. However, we found that Banerjee et al.’s scheme is still vulnerable to user impersonation attack and off-line password guessing attack. Finally, we proposed an enhanced scheme to eliminate the security vulnerability.	authentication;server (computing)	Qimin Sun;Jongho Moon;Younsung Choi;Dongho Won	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39077-2_15	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-45.25507186318129	73.38822221073194	80550

There is a need for assurance that these records are securely protected from attacks. For a system as complex as an EHR system, the number of possible attacks is potentially very large. In this paper, a threat modeling methodology, known as attack tree, is employed to analyze attacks affecting EHR systems. The analysis is based on a proposed generic client-server model of EHR systems. The developed attack tree is discussed along with some system properties that enable quantitative and qualitative analysis. A list of suggested countermeasures are also highlighted.	attack tree;client–server model;complex systems;countermeasure (computer);electronic health records;generic drugs;patients;server (computing);threat model;benefit	Ahmad Almulhem	2011	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-011-9770-6	medicine;computer science;internet privacy;threat model;world wide web;computer security	Security	-44.700202125865665	62.62740788573676	80611

Such applications are required to maintain the patients' privacy and to comply with the privacy laws and regulations. In the United States, patients' privacy is protected with federal regulations, more specifically the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and its amendments. To guarantee compliance with HIPAA, the software application must have a decision engine which should be consulted before any operation is carried on the patients' information to determine the operation validity and compliance. This decision engine will use HIPAA privacy rules in the decision making process, which triggers the need to formally express HIPAA privacy rules in the form of formal privacy policies. In this work, we evaluate the potential languages that can be used to formally express the extracted HIPAA privacy policies. Also, we expose any required extensions to the specification language features to support the decision engine logic.	decision support system;health insurance portability and accountability act;privacy law;privacy policy;specification language;web service	Tariq Alshugran;Julius Dichter;Miad Faezipour	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)	10.1109/EIT.2015.7293356	protected health information;web service;privacy software;privacy policy;xml;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;access control;data mining;database;privacy;computer security	SE	-43.863966388448844	61.878340962751835	80664

This paper describes a method to realize an anonymity-conscious P2P data sharing network. The proposed network allows users to extract data possessed by other users who have similar profiles, thereby providing them with a collaborative filtering-based data recommendation. In the proposed P2P network protocol, bogus user profiles are distributed intentionally throughout the network to protect users' anonymity without harming the overall effectiveness of the data exchange. We conduct a series of simulations to prove that our proposed method protects the profile's privacy and performs efficient data exchange.	peer-to-peer	Makoto Iguchi;Shigeki Goto	2009	Web Intelligence and Agent Systems	10.3233/WIA-2009-0163	anonymity;computer science;peer-to-peer;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security	ECom	-43.26868397472124	62.683213123930855	80729

A promising solution to this problem is to distribute the signing function among multiple parties. However, a threshold signature scheme typically assumes that the shared signing function can only be activated by a quorum number of parties, which is inappropriate in settings where a user employs some public servers for a threshold protection of her private signing function (therefore the name “server-assisted threshold signatures”). In this paper we present two efficient and provably secure schemes for server-assisted threshold signatures, where the signing function is activated by a user (but in certain enhanced way). The first one (we call TPAKE-HTSig) is tailored for the setting where a user has a networked device that is powerful enough to efficiently compute modular exponentiations. The second one (we call LW-TSig) is tailored for the setting where a user has a smart card without a cryptographic co-processor. Modular construction of the schemes ensures that any module can be substituted without weakening security of the resultant scheme, as long as the substitutive one satisfies certain security requirement. In addition to the two schemes, we also present a taxonomy of systems protecting private	antivirus software;authentication;coprocessor;cryptography;digital signature;e-commerce;electronic signature;gene ontology;generic security service algorithm for secret key transaction;limewire;provable security;rsa (cryptosystem);resultant;server (computing);smart card;taxonomy (general);type signature	Shouhuai Xu;Ravi S.

This lack of liveness information prevents the storage system from discarding blocks deleted by the file system, often resulting in poor utilization, security problems, inefficient caching, and migration overheads. In this paper, we define a generic """"purge"""" operation that can be used by a file system to pass liveness information to the block layer with minimal changes in the layer interfaces, allowing the storage system to discard deleted data. We present three approaches for implementing such a purge operation: direct call, zero blocks, and flagged writes, each of which differs in their architectural complexity and potential performance overhead. We evaluate the feasibility of these techniques through a reference implementation of a dynamically resizable copy on write (COW) data store in User Mode Linux (UML). Performance results obtained from this reference implementation show that all these techniques can achieve significant storage savings with a reasonable execution time overhead. At the same time, our results indicate that while the direct call approach has the best performance, the zero block approach provides the best compromise in terms of performance overhead and its semantic and architectural simplicity. Overall, our results demonstrate that passing liveness information across the file system-block layer interface with minimal changes is not only feasible but practical."""	computer data storage;copy-on-write;data store;liveness;operating system;overhead (computing);reference implementation;run time (program lifecycle phase);unified modeling language;user-mode linux	David Boutcher;Abhishek Chandra	2008	Operating Systems Review	10.1145/1400097.1400107	unified modeling language;embedded system;real-time computing;thrashing;cpu cache;computer science;operating system;semantics;computer security;linux kernel;information system;liveness	OS	-34.61863541060389	61.66969846383383	80964
a0592c1e1996183f0a4ba4eb7773a8a9637e527f	efficient index-based search protocols for encrypted databases		It is astonishing to see more and more services built on user-oriented data, providing numerous tools to improve ones daily life. Nowadays, data collected from numerous sources is being used to monitor daily activities, i.e., monitoring patients. These innovations allow for more cost-efficient and scalable solutions. Nevertheless, these types of services can pose a threat to the privacy of individuals due to the possibility of leaking highly privacy-sensitive data. Therefore, it is essential to design such systems in a privacy-preserving manner. Inspired by a real-life project in the health-care domain, we propose to secure the data using encryption, while enabling the involved parties to run queries directly on this encrypted data. A vital component of such a system is searching for specific data entries within a large dataset. In this work, we present two cryptographic protocols that complete such a query by creating an encrypted vector in a simulation secure way. These vectors consist of a 1 for intended database entry, whereas other items would be represented as a 0. By creating index tables before the execution of the queries, it has become possible to execute a search query with high performance. As we show in our analyses, it takes less than one second to find the matching encrypted data-entry within a database with 100K records. Our proposal is generic, can be applied to several application domains, and practically compared to similar works.	analysis of algorithms;application domain;cloud storage;complexity;cost efficiency;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;database;download;encryption;pivot table;privacy;real life;scalability;simulation;table (database);upload;wearable computer;whole earth 'lectronic link	Majid Nateghizad;Zekeriya Erkin;Reginald L.

When users store files in the cloud, however, there are critical concerns with data leakage and integrity issues. In this paper, we propose a new approach that integrates erasure coding with data encryption and data splitting to secure file-sharing for cloud storage. The basic idea of the proposed approach is that a file is not completely stored in the cloud, and only authorized devices or clients have their own unique key, which is derived from erasure coding, to fulfill the file exactly. By investigating three typical erasure codes, we analyze the efficiency and trade-offs of different file splitting strategies. The results show that it is promising to share files securely for cloud storage with erasure coding.	authorization;cloud computing;cloud storage;encryption;erasure code;file sharing;spectral leakage;unique key	Chun-Hsin Wu;Pai-Hsing Wang	2014	2014 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)	10.1109/CITS.2014.6878968	computer science;ssh file transfer protocol;filesystem-level encryption;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	DB	-42.01949306686856	67.71405860578567	81146

To mitigate the potential privacy threats associated with location-based queries, existing work has proposed the use of private information retrieval (PIR) protocols when querying the database. Nevertheless, PIR protocols are very expensive and may lead to significant costs for highly mobile clients. In this paper, we propose a novel method that allows wireless users to collaborate in a peer-to-peer (P2P) manner, in order to share their cached channel availability information that is obtained from previous queries. Our experimental results with a real-life dataset show that our methods reduce the number of PIR queries by 50% to 60%, while incurring low computational and communication costs.	centralized computing;computation;gps navigation device;geographic coordinate system;peer-to-peer;personally identifiable information;private information retrieval;real life	Erald Troja;Spiridon Bakiras	2014	I.

Fair exchange assumes that it is possible to verify the correctness of the digital items to be exchanged. However, when an item is indescribable, i.e., it cannot be formally specified, its verification becomes difficult, if not impossible. This hinders a practical deployment of fair exchange. We propose a methodology for the verification of indescribable digital items. The methodology allows a participant in a fair exchange protocol to personally verify the indescribable item without giving him any practical advantage over the other participant, and therefore without violating the fairness imposed by the protocol.	brute-force attack;complexity;correctness (computer science);cryptography;digital image;downgrade;e-commerce;fairness measure;key distribution;sampling (signal processing);server (computing);software deployment;thumbnail;trusted third party	Andrea Bottoni;Gianluca Dini;Tage Stabell-Kulø	2007	Electronic Commerce Research	10.1007/s10660-007-9003-8	e-commerce;public relations;computer science;information security;database;world wide web;computer security	Security	-43.76111101046847	71.60586637524653	81333

In this paper, we introduce an authentication scheme for outsourced multi-dimensional databases. With the proposed scheme, users can verify that their query answers from a publisher are complete (i.e., no qualifying tuples are omitted) and authentic (i.e., all the result values are legitimate). In addition, our scheme guarantees minimality (i.e., no nonanswer points are returned in the plain). Our scheme supports window, range, kNN and RNN queries on multi-dimensional databases. We have implemented the proposed scheme, and our experimental results on kNN queries show that our approach is a practical scheme with low overhead.	authentication;database;experiment;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;outsourcing;overhead (computing);random neural network	Weiwei Cheng;Kian-Lee Tan	2009	Journal of Computer Security	10.3233/JCS-2009-0315	complete;computer science;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security;query language	DB	-41.10025879120105	68.1457644256449	81876

In such a mechanism, a user may grant a privilege to another user and he may optionally permit the grantee to also grant the privilege. The potential for useless grant information in a timestamp based mechanism (such as SQL's) is characterized and an algorithm for removing such grants is given. Even though the algorithm is sufficient for many situations, the problem is shown to be  NP  -complete. These results are then extended for mechanisms that limit privileges to specified intervals of time.	authorization	Bob P. Weems	1990	Inf.

Dung et al. apply the Ring-LWE-based somewhat public key homomorphic encryption scheme to secure MMC [TMMP2016], whose packing method is an extension of Yasuda et al.’s methods [SCN2015 and ACISP2015] for secure inner product. In this study, we propose a new packing method for secure MMC from Ring-LWE-based secure inner product and show that ours is efficient and flexible.	learning with errors;matrix multiplication	Lihua Wang;Yoshinori Aono;Le Trieu Phong	2017		10.1007/978-3-030-02641-7_5	theoretical computer science;information sensitivity;computation;public-key cryptography;matrix multiplication;information leakage;homomorphic encryption;cloud computing;matrix (mathematics);computer science	Crypto	-39.95969701402351	70.66243114577082	82215
f33ae6672e894fea3c3b03cadc5f902b6c7d0a09	provable ownership of files in deduplication cloud storage	deduplication;spot checking;cloud storage;provable ownership	With the rapid adoption of cloud storage services, a great deal of data is being stored at remote servers, so a new technology, client-side deduplication, which stores only a single copy of repeating data, is proposed to identify the client’s deduplication and save the bandwidth of uploading copies of existing files to the server. It was recently found, however, that this promising technology is vulnerable to a new kind of attack in which by learning just a small piece of information about the file, namely its hash value, an attacker is able to obtain the entire file from the server. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a cryptographically secure and efficient scheme for a client to prove to the server his ownership on the basis of actual possession of the entire original file instead of only partial information about it. Our scheme utilizes the technique of spot checking in which the client only needs to access small portions of the original file, dynamic coefficients and randomly chosen indices of the original files. Our extensive security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can generate provable ownership of the file and maintain high detection probability of client misbehavior. Both performance analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is much more efficient than the existing schemes, especially in reducing the burden of the client.

The core component of ACStream is a query rewriting mechanism that, by exploiting a set of secure operators proposed by us in [2], rewrites a user query in such a way that it does not violate the specified access control policies during its execution.

Due to their significance in building a secure multicast channel, a number of group key establishment protocols have been suggested over the years for a variety of settings. Among the many protocols is Harn and Lin's group key transfer protocol based on Shamir's secret sharing. This group key transfer protocol was designed to work in the setting where a trusted key generation center shares a long-term secret with each of its registered users. As for security, Harn and Lin claim that their protocol prevents the long-term secret of each user from being disclosed to other users. But, we found this claim is not true. Unlike the claim, Harn and Lin's protocol cannot protect users' long-term secrets against a malicious user. We here report this security problem with the protocol and show how to address it.	cryptanalysis;group key;secret sharing	Junghyun Nam;Moonseong Kim;Juryon Paik;Woongryul Jeon;Byunghee Lee;Dongho Won	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27142-7_36	shared secret;computer science;key-agreement protocol;homomorphic secret sharing;secure multi-party computation;internet privacy;group domain of interpretation;proactive secret sharing;secret sharing;pre-shared key;world wide web;key distribution;computer security;verifiable secret sharing	Crypto	-42.22741288587493	74.45444044008467	82818

b253a324ad4119cdee1769f3a4f41d213ef8d9c8	secure anonymous broadcast		In anonymous broadcast, one or more parties want to anonymously send messages to all parties. This problem is increasingly important as a black-box in many privacy-preserving applications such as anonymous communication, distributed auctions, and multi-party computation. In this paper, we design decentralized protocols for anonymous broadcast that require each party to send (and compute) a polylogarithmic number of bits (and operations) per anonymous bit delivered with O(log n) rounds of communication. Our protocol is provably secure against traffic analysis, does not require any trusted party, and is completely load-balanced. The protocol tolerates up to n/6 statically-scheduled Byzantine parties that are controlled by a computationally unbounded adversary. Our main strategy for achieving scalability is to perform local communications (and computations) among a logarithmic number of parties. We provide simulation results to show that our protocol improves significantly over previous work. We finally show that using a common cryptographic tool in our protocol one can achieve practical results for anonymous broadcast.	adversary (cryptography);black box;computation;cryptography;load balancing (computing);polylogarithmic function;provable security;scalability;simulation;traffic analysis	Mahnush Movahedi;Jared Saia;Mahdi Zamani	2014	CoRR		universal composability;atomic broadcast;computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-39.521027933150094	73.65655397006283	83060

Their main purpose is to prevent security leakages in common biometric systems and to preserve the user's privacy. However, when cryptographic functions are used in the algorithms, randomness of biometric features is strictly required from the security point of view. This randomness is hard to achieve in many feature extraction algorithms, especially for those using the local information of biometric modality. In this paper we discuss privacy protection based on a fuzzy extractor. We show that the security of the algorithm is strongly reduced when statistical properties of biometric features as well as the details of the algorithm are known. An attack exploiting feature correlation is demonstrated.	algorithm;binary image;biometrics;computer security;correlation attack;cryptography;facial recognition system;feature extraction;feature vector;fuzzy extractor;information security;iris recognition;privacy;randomness extractor;three-dimensional face recognition	Xuebing Zhou;Stephen D.

In this paper we consider efficiency of the POR scheme, when the data stored in cloud is encrypted under fully homomorphic encryption schemes. We presented a POR scheme with new, efficient homomorphic authenticator, which enables constant-size responses and requests fairly little storage and computational power for the clients. The soundness of our scheme is guaranteed by a game-based security proof, under the security model of Juels and Kaliski’s.	cloud computing;cloud storage;computation;download;file server;homomorphic encryption;provable security;requirement;retrievability;scalability;server (computing);zero-knowledge proof	Yan Guang;Yuefei Zhu;Chunxiang Gu;Yonghui Zheng;Jin-long Fei	2013	JNW	10.4304/jnw.8.2.339-344	homomorphic encryption;computer science;theoretical computer science;homomorphic secret sharing;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-41.542078854378104	68.98423061425996	83596

In OB, plaintextspace is divided into p disjoint buckets, numbered from 1 to p, based on the order of the ranges that they cover. OB is quite useful in that a range query can be performed over encrypted data without the need to descrypt by attaching a bucket number to each ciphertext. Unfortunately, no research has been carried out on the security of OB in a cryptographic sense. This paper defines an encryption scheme with OB (EOB) and suggests a new security model for EOB, IND-OCPA-P, which assumes an adversary has reasonable power. Previous constructions proposed for efficient range queries were not secure in this model. Finally, an OB construction, in which the EOB implementation is secure on the IND-OCPA-P model, is proposed. In the proposed OB, p- 1 points are selected on the uniform distribution in the plaintext-space and the plaintext-space is divided based on the selected points. A bucket number is assigned to each divided range in ascending range order. With regard to the efficiency of a range query, the proposed OB guarantees reasonably good efficiency on range queries by showing that the distribution of a bucket size is not skewed.	adversary (cryptography);ciphertext indistinguishability;cryptography;encryption;experiment;eye of the beholder;high- and low-level;ordered pair;outside broadcasting;plaintext;polynomial;range query (data structures);range query (database);symmetric-key algorithm	Younho Lee	2014	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2014.2313863	multiple encryption;h.235;disk encryption theory;40-bit encryption;plaintext-aware encryption;disk encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;cryptography;information security;theoretical computer science;link encryption;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;disk encryption hardware;deterministic encryption;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption	DB	-40.88626471310217	70.93711564245116	83605

However, releasing user data could also seriously threaten user privacy. It is possible to directly collect sensitive information from released user data without user permissions. Furthermore, third party users can also infer sensitive information contained in released data in a latent manner by utilizing data mining techniques. In this paper, we formally define these two types of threats as inherent data privacy and latent data privacy and construct a data-sanitization strategy that can optimize the tradeoff between data utility and customized two types of privacy. The key novel idea lies that the developed strategy can combat against powerful third party users with broad knowledge about users and launching optimal inference attacks. We show that our strategy does not reduce the benefit brought by user data much, while sensitive information can still be protected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that preserves both inherent data privacy and latent data privacy.	code injection;data mining;ibm notes;information privacy;information sensitivity;mobile device;sanitization (classified information);threat (computer)	Zaobo He;Zhipeng Cai;Yunchuan Sun;Yingshu Li;Xiuzhen Cheng	2016	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-016-0972-2	privacy software;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security;differential privacy	Security	-42.154953955640906	62.191586540932754	83634

Smart home applications have benefited from interactions and data transmissions among different devices over the integrated network with or without human interventions. However, like other technologies, smart home likely introduces new security vulnerabilities due to its dynamic and open nature of connectivity with heterogeneous features. Among such vulnerabilities, is the breach of confidentiality which needs to be addressed urgently as data exchanged between smart home devices can contain crucial information related to user's privacy and safety. However, some of the challenges in providing smart home system with confidentiality service are the flexibility of key management and efficiency of computation and communication. These challenges should be addressed carefully as many small and resource-constrained devices are usually involved in smart home systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a lightweight encryption scheme for smart homes. This scheme will provide users and smart objects with confidentiality service without incurring much overhead cost associated with computation and communication. Our proposed scheme also supports flexible public key management through adopting identity-based encryption, which does not require complex certificate handling. We provide a formal security analysis of our scheme and a performance simulation study. The simulation shows that our scheme provides favorable level of efficiency in terms of overhead cost associated with computation and communication.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;confidentiality;home automation;id-based cryptography;id-based encryption;interaction;internet of things;java;key (cryptography);key management;large eddy simulation;overhead (computing);performance prediction;public-key cryptography;smart tv;smart objects;state (computer science);symmetric-key algorithm;vulnerability (computing)	Sanaah Al Salami;Joonsang Baek;Khaled Salah;Ernesto Damiani	2016	2016 11th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES)	10.1109/ARES.2016.40	engineering;internet privacy;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Security	-43.8584327552289	66.00101110140628	84110

Most current studies assume that the certificate has the same level of risk and less consideration different users have different security requirements, and even the same users has different security requirements in different scenarios. So we propose a new and flexible PKI authentication scheme based on certificate path trust index (CPTI). Analysis and experimental results show that users can give a trade off between security and efficiency, and the scheme has a higher efficiency and no bottleneck when authenticating with the higher level CAs.	authentication;public key infrastructure	Zhiwei Gao;Yingxin Hu;Kai Lu	2015	J.

173bc8c98f2e9c6753f33aae5e65b5d80ad55076	practical accountability of secret processes		The US federal court system is exploring ways to improve the accountability of electronic surveillance, an opaque process often involving cases sealed from public view and tech companies subject to gag orders against informing surveilled users. One judge has proposed publicly releasing some metadata about each case on a paper cover sheet as a way to balance the competing goals of (1) secrecy, so the target of an investigation does not discover and sabotage it, and (2) accountability, to assure the public that surveillance powers are not misused or abused. Inspired by the courts’ accountability challenge, we illustrate how accountability and secrecy are simultaneously achievable when modern cryptography is brought to bear. Our system improves configurability while preserving secrecy, offering new tradeoffs potentially more palatable to the risk-averse court system. Judges, law enforcement, and companies publish commitments to surveillance actions, argue in zero-knowledge that their behavior is consistent, and compute aggregate surveillance statistics by multi-party computation (MPC). We demonstrate that these primitives perform efficiently at the scale of the federal judiciary. To do so, we implement a hierarchical form of MPC that mirrors the hierarchy of the court system. We also develop statements in succinct zero-knowledge (SNARKs) whose specificity can be tuned to calibrate the amount of information released. All told, our proposal not only offers the court system a flexible range of options for enhancing accountability in the face of necessary secrecy, but also yields a general framework for accountability in a broader class of secret information processes.	aggregate data;ccir system a;computation;cryptography;risk aversion;sensitivity and specificity;zero-knowledge proof	Jonathan Frankle;Sunoo Park;Daniel Shaar;Shafi Goldwasser;Daniel J.

f3ab395f181e7893bdf7f2857dcb591955e58310	on geo location services for telecom operators		This paper presents location based service for telecom providers. Most of the location-based services in the mobile networks are introduced and deployed by Internet companies. It leaves for telecom just the role of the data channel. Telecom providers should use their competitive advantages and offer own solutions. In this paper, we discuss the sharing location information via geo messages. Geo messages let mobile users share location information as signatures to the standard messages (e.g., email, SMS). Rather than let some service constantly monitor (poll) the user’s location (as the most standalone services do) or share location info within any social circle (social network check-in, etc.) The Geo Messages approach lets users share location data on the peer to peer basis. Users can share own location info with any existing messaging systems. And messaging (e.g., SMS) is the traditional service for telecom.

The generalization is performed with attention to preserving the richness of TISS, including the ability to handle multi-link trust decisions, stereotyping by dividing participants into user defined classes, and personalization through the use of privacy policies. GTM’s generality is validated by demonstrating its applicability in diverse problem domains namely: service provision, packet routing and content management.	content management system;generative topographic map;network packet;personalization;privacy policy;problem domain;routing;spaces;trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Dalal Ahmed Al-Arayed;João Pedro Sousa	2010	2010 IEEE Second International Conference on Social Computing	10.1109/SocialCom.2010.183	privacy policy;information privacy;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	SE	-43.68216262001185	61.34777399036226	85034
af1cb3215147acc81ae734981dc93ddb594fbdf6	primal: cloud-based privacy-preserving malware detection		The ongoing threat of malware has raised significant security and privacy concerns. Motivated by these issues, the cloud-based detection system is of increasing interest to detect large-scale malware as it releases the burden of client and improves the detection efficiency. However, most existing cloud-based detection systems overlook the data privacy protection during the malware detection. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based anti-malware system named PriMal, which protects the data privacy of both the cloud server and the client, while still achieves usable detection performance. In the PriMal, a newly designed private malware signature set intersection (PMSSI) protocol is involved to enable both the cloud server and client to achieve malware confirmation without revealing the data privacy in semi-honest model. Moreover, we propose the relevant signature engine to reduce the detection range and overhead.

Once password files are stolen, attackers can quickly crack large numbers of passwords. In this paper, we propose Phoney, a system which employs a threshold cryptosystem to encrypt the password hashes in the password file and honeywords to confuse attackers. With the help of Phoney, attackers cannot get any password information easily even they steal the password files. All the password hashes are encrypted by our threshold cryptosystem. Even they are able to compromise the cryptosystem, attackers cannot identify the real password easily because of the false passwords (honeywords) deliberately added for each account to confuse the adversaries. In addition, attempts of submitting a honeyword will cause alarms to be set off. Experiments show that the time and storage cost of Phoney are acceptable, but the cracking search space is increased significantly.

However, since one or more sectors, with some probability, may become a bad sector after some time, this scheme fails to prove the integrity of all other sectors that are still good. In this paper, we suggest a scheme which calculates three hash values for each sector, in a three dimensional manner, such that the integrity proof of a sector depends only on the sectors in any one of the three dimensions, in stead of all sectors in the hard disk. Our analysis shows that this new scheme can greatly reduce the effect of bad sector formation in proving the integrity of the disk sectors.	disk sector;hard disk drive;hash function	Zoe Lin Jiang;Lucas Chi Kwong Hui;K.

b65cf79800a16d540f60346b156b28899bd9f150	client-side encryption for privacy-sensitive applications on the cloud		There are important concerns when trusting sensitive information to the cloud. Health and financial records, for instance, suffer strict legal restrictions to data escrow. Organizations holding such information need to assure end-users and authorities that a third party will never access restricted data. Client-side encryption is a common solution in literature. Most works fail, however, to reason the impact of security solutions on performance and usability. Homomorphic and order preserving encryption systems can mitigate such negative impacts, as they allow the computation of regular searches over encrypted records on the cloud, while preserving information confidentiality and the privacy if end-users. c © 2016 The Authors.

Privacy concerns arise whenever sensitive data is outsourced to the cloud. This paper introduces a cloud database storage architecture that prevents the local administrator as well as the cloud administrator to learn about the outsourced database content. Moreover, machine readable rights expressions are used in order to limit users of the database to a need-to-know basis. These limitations are not changeable by administrators after the database related application is launched, since a new role of rights editors is defined once an application is launced. Furthermore, trusted computing is applied to bind cryptographic key information to trusted states. By limiting the necessary trust in both corporate as well as external administrators and service providers, we counteract the often criticized privacy and confidentiality risks of corporate cloud computing.	cloud computing;cloud database;confidentiality;cryptography;data security;database storage structures;encryption;hardware virtualization;human-readable medium;information needs;information sensitivity;key (cryptography);need to know;outsourcing;privacy;requirement;rights expression language;technical standard;trust (emotion);trusted computing;trusted operating system;unified expression language;xml	Ulrich Greveler;Benjamin Justus;Dennis Löhr	2011	2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2011.88	cloud computing security;software architecture;xml;cloud computing;information privacy;computer science;cryptography;access control;database;data security;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;encryption;outsourcing	DB	-47.96274706539832	60.47994255161339	85643

270b713e8a045cd724f51ab1707ffefe1a23af15	privacy-enhancing first-price auctions using rational cryptography		We consider enhancing a sealed-bid single-item auction with privacy concerns, our assumption being that bidders primarily care about monetary payoff and secondarily worry about exposing information about their type to other players and learning information about other players’ types. To treat privacy explicitly within the game theoretic context, we put forward a novel hybrid utility model that considers both fiscal and privacy components in the players’ payoffs. We show how to use rational cryptography to approximately implement a given ex interim individually strictly rational equilibrium of such an auction (or any game with a winner) without a trusted mediator through a cryptographic protocol that uses only point-to-point authenticated channels between the players. By “ex interim individually strictly rational” we mean that, given its type and before making its move, each player has a strictly positive expected utility, i.e., it becomes the winner of the auction with positive probability. By “approximately implement” we mean that, under cryptographic assumptions, running the protocol is a computational Nash equilibrium with a payoff profile negligibly close to the original equilibrium. In addition the protocol has the stronger property that no collusion, of any size, can obtain more by deviating in the implementation than by deviating in the ideal mediated setting which the mechanism was designed in. Also, despite the non-symmetric payoffs profile, the protocol always correctly terminates.	authentication;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;expected utility hypothesis;game theory;nash equilibrium;point-to-point protocol;privacy concerns regarding google	Peter Bro Miltersen;Jesper Buus Nielsen;Nikos Triandopoulos	2008	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		common value auction;collusion;cryptography;expected utility hypothesis;economics;cryptographic protocol;nash equilibrium;interim;stochastic game;welfare economics	Crypto	-40.042561969906494	72.55266752168546	85806

In this journal, Feng et al. (2005) [A new multi-secret image sharing scheme using Lagrange's interpolation. The Journal of Systems and Software, 76 (3), 327-339] recently considered the situation in which there are many secrets to be shared among a set of participants, in such a way that each qualified subset of participant can reconstruct a different secret. They proposed a polynomial-based construction using as a main tool a particular sequence of participants, called a sharing-circle, and having the feature that the smaller the length of the sharing-circle, the smaller the size of the shares distributed to participants. They proposed a simple recursive algorithm to find a minimal length sharing-circle. Since their algorithm is exponential-time, they left the task of finding a better one as an open problem. In this paper we first answer their question, showing that a polynomial-time algorithm computing a minimal-length sharing-circle is unlikely to exist. Indeed, we prove that the problem of finding a sharing-circle having minimal length is NP-hard. Afterwards, we propose a construction which is simpler than the one of Feng et al. and that does not require the participants to perform polynomial interpolation in order to reconstruct the secrets. Moreover, our scheme distributes shares having a smaller size.

We have previously demonstrated a CES Extraction Policy for fragment grouping to allow the document signer to designate which subsets of the original document are valid subdocuments. Extending this ability, we introduce a new Hierarchical Grouping Extraction Policy that is more powerful, and for which the encoding is dramatically smaller, than the existing Grouping Extraction Policy. This new Extraction Policy maps naturally onto the hierarchically structured documents commonly found in digital libraries. After giving a motivating example involving digital libraries we then conjecture as to how to enrich their functionality through the use of CESs. We also show how to implement the new extraction policy using XML signatures with a custom transform along with an improved design for the XML signature structure in order to achieve CES functionality.	digital library;formal verification;information extraction;library (computing);map;type signature;xml signature;xslt/muenchian grouping	Laurence Bull;David McG.

f4d18995b0b3d76992bccfc761bb0be272cc987c	certificate validation through public ledgers and blockchains		Public key infrastructures (PKIs) are of crucial importance for the life of online services relying on certificate-based authentication, like e-commerce, e-government, online banking, as well as e-mail, social networking, cloud services and many others. One of the main points of failure (POFs) of modern PKIs concerns reliability and security of certificate revocation lists (CRLs), that must be available and authentic any time a certificate is used. Classically, the CRL for a set of certificates is maintained by the same (and sole) certification authority (CA) that issued the certificates, and this introduces a single POF in the system. We address this issue by proposing a solution in which multiple CAs share a public, decentralized and robust ledger where CRLs are collected. For this purpose, we consider the model of public ledgers based on blockchains, introduced for the use in cryptocurrencies, that is becoming a widespread solution for many online applications with stringent security and reliability requirements.	authentication;bitcoin;certificate authority;cloud computing;cryptocurrency;e-commerce;e-government;e-services;email;online banking;open-source software;public key infrastructure;real-time transcription;reliability engineering;requirement	Marco Baldi;Franco Chiaraluce;Emanuele Frontoni;Giuseppe Gottardi;Daniele Sciarroni;Luca Spalazzi	2017			accounting;certificate;ledger;business	Metrics	-47.06712078496985	64.05906794222598	85980

It uses a simple watermark to protect the pointer: during dereferencing the pointer variable, a watermark is also written/updated and before referencing the pointer variable, it verifies consistency of the watermark. If the pointer's watermark does not exist or was damaged, our scheme regards this as an intrusion and stops the execution. The proposed scheme has the following strong points. First, unlike other randomization methods, our scheme has no possibility of malfunction caused by the execution of arbitrary instructions. Second, we conducted various experiments on prototype implementation, which showed that our scheme is as secure as the previous randomization schemes. Third, experimental results showed that the performance degradation is not high. Forth, unlike other randomization schemes, our scheme can support attack profiling.	buffer overflow	Yongsu Park;Yookun Cho	2004		10.1007/11558958_124	randomization;parallel computing;real-time computing;pointer;buffer overflow;digital watermarking;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;parallel algorithm;programming language;forth;computer security;algorithm	Security	-34.84364816460662	64.43345409636049	86066
9b5e04c5e7d90ed7fd48b69dd82b5804e53967c6	an anonymous and accountable authentication scheme for wi-fi hotspot access with the bitcoin blockchain		Anonymous authentication can protect users' privacy and security when they access public Wi-Fi hotspots. However, most of the existing privacy-enhanced authentication schemes either do not consider users' accountability or they are inherently dependent on trusted third parties, and therefore are undeployable in practical settings. In this paper, we design and implement an access authentication scheme to simultaneously and efficiently provide anonymity and accountability without relying on any trusted third party. Our scheme is inspired by the recent progress of Bitcoin techniques such as Colored Coins and CoinShuffle protocol. We utilize the unmodified Bitcoin blockchain as the powerful platform to manage and determine ownership of access credentials in a peer-to-peer fashion and introduce a completely decentralized Bitcoin mixing protocol that allows users to anonymously exchange their access credentials offline. The verification path of access credentials is designed to support blacklisting and punishing misbehaving anonymous users. Our proposed scheme is compatible with the current Bitcoin system, and its effectiveness and feasibility in Wi-Fi hotspot access scenario are also demonstrated by security analysis and performance evaluation.	authentication;bitcoin;colored coins;credential;hotspot (wi-fi);java hotspot virtual machine;mobile device;online and offline;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;performance evaluation;requirement;trusted third party	Yukun Niu;Lingbo Wei;Chi Zhang;Jianqing Liu;Yuguang Fang	2017	2017 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330337	accountability;computer network;anonymity;blacklisting;computer science;trusted third party;hotspot (wi-fi);blockchain;security analysis;authentication	Security	-46.1192209921384	70.63897336416717	86077

464c1bcbebea396a9f23b70411383fe43477bbb8	oblivistore: high performance oblivious distributed cloud data store		It is well established that access patterns to encrypted data can leak a considerable amount of sensitive information [13]. Oblivious RAM (or ORAM for short) [5–11, 14, 18–20, 26, 28], originally proposed by Goldreich and Ostrovsky [8], is a cryptographic construction that allows a client to access encrypted data residing on an untrusted storage server, while completely hiding the access patterns to storage. Particularly, the sequence of physical addresses accessed is independent of the actual data that the user is accessing. To achieve this, existing ORAM constructions [5–11,14,18–20, 26,28] continuously re-encrypt and and reshuffle data blocks on the storage server, to cryptographically conceal the logical access pattern. Aside from storage outsourcing applications, ORAM (in combination with trusted hardware in the cloud) has also been proposed to protect user privacy in a broad range of online services such as behavioral advertising, location and map services, web search, and so on [4, 15]. While the idea of relying on trusted hardware and oblivious RAM to enable access privacy in cloud services is promising, for such an approach to become practical, a key challenge is the practical efficiency of ORAM. ORAM was initially proposed and studied mostly as a theoretic concept. However, several recent works demonstrated the potential of making ORAM practical in real-world scenarios [15, 25, 28, 29].	cloud computing;cryptography;data store;e-services;encryption;file server;hardware restriction;information sensitivity;oblivious ram;outsourcing;physical address;random-access memory;server (computing);theory;web search engine	Emil Stefanov;Elaine Shi	2013			cloud computing;computer science;internet privacy;database;distributed data store;distributed computing	Security	-41.14966608311678	66.28003224083363	86468

Attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been identified as a useful security mechanism for supporting data protection in untrusted environments. ABE enables fine-grained access control over encrypted data and allows individual data owners to define their own data access policy. However, important practical features such as efficient user revocation, key escrow avoidance, and key refreshing are not straightforward to incorporate into existing ABE schemes. In this paper we propose a generic practical deployment framework that can be applied to any ABE scheme in order to build-in these features.	access control;attribute-based encryption;ciphertext;cloud storage;data access;information privacy;key (cryptography);key escrow;scalability;software deployment	Zhiqian Xu;Keith M.

Biometric data always refers to an identified or at least identifiable person. And even when stored electronically in a form of a template it is still personal data, as it is not impossible to identify an individual. In terms of data protection rules applicability to online marketing practices a common misconception and the position usually held by the industry is that the processed data is anonymized due to the fact that IP-address is removed and supplemented by a unique identifier to differentiate between different users. Data Protection Authorities in Europe claim that the data collected and processed in the course of behavioural advertising definitely represents personal data as its core purpose is to differentiate between users.	biometrics;database;digital footprint;identifier;information privacy;online advertising;personally identifiable information;unique key	Natasa Pirc Musar;Jelena Burnik	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12595-9_2	engineering;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-45.426708046886624	60.96754114269467	86696

In this paper, we ask: Can we build a global exchange where everyone can contribute computation and data to train the next generation of machine learning applications? We present an early, but running prototype of DATABRIGHT, a system that turns the creation of training examples and the sharing of computation into an investment mechanism. Unlike most crowdsourcing platforms, where the contributor gets paid when they submit their data, DATABRIGHT pays dividends whenever a contributor’s data or hardware is used by someone to train a machine learning model. The contributor becomes a shareholder in the dataset they created. To enable the measurement of usage, a computation platform that contributors can trust is also necessary. DATABRIGHT thus merges both a data market and a trusted computation market. We illustrate that trusted computation can enable the creation of an AI market, where each data point has an exact value that should be paid to its creator. DATABRIGHT allows data creators to retain ownership of their contribution and attaches to it a measurable value. The value of the data is given by its utility in subsequent distributed computation done on the DATABRIGHT computation market. The computation market allocates tasks and subsequent payments to pooled hardware. This leads to the creation of a decentralized AI cloud. Our experiments show that trusted hardware such as Intel SGX can be added to the usual ML pipeline with no additional costs. We use this setting to orchestrate distributed computation that enables the creation of a computation market.

In the conventional Commitment schemes, both committed string m and valid opening key are required to enable the sender to prove the commitment. However there could be many instances where the transmission involves noise or minor errors arising purely because of the factors over which neither the sender nor the receiver have any control. The fuzzy commitment scheme presented in this paper is to accept the opening key that is close to the original one in suitable distance metric, but not necessarily identical. The concept itself is illustrated with the help of simple situation.	commitment scheme;image noise	Alawi A. Al-saggaf;H. S.

91dd492fa25eb02203c42911301f0df79c985ef1	differential privacy in the wild: a tutorial on current practices & open challenges	differential privacy	Differential privacy has emerged as an important standard for privacy preserving computation over databases containing sensitive information about individuals. Research on differential privacy spanning a number of research areas, including theory, security, database, networks, machine learning, and statistics, over the last decade has resulted in a variety of privacy preserving algorithms for a number of analysis tasks. Despite maturing research efforts, the adoption of differential privacy by practitioners in industry, academia, or government agencies has so far been rare. Hence, in this tutorial, we will first describe the foundations of differentially private algorithm design that cover the state of the art in private computation on tabular data. In the second half of the tutorial we will highlight real world applications on complex data types, and identify research challenges in applying differential privacy to real world applications.	differential privacy	Ashwin Machanavajjhala;Xi He;Michael Hay	2017		10.1145/3035918.3054779	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;differential privacy	HCI	-41.05680888649457	62.19057416432897	87009

First, we show that simple tricks suffice in order to achieve high download rates, even in the absence of seeders. We also illustrate how peers in a swarm react to various sophisticated attacks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that sharing communities—communities originally intended to offer downloads of good quality and to promote cooperation among peers—provide many incentives to cheat.	bittorrent;download;swarm	Thomas Locher;Patrick Moor;Stefan Schmid;Roger Wattenhofer	2006			internet privacy	Networks	-43.02682411560116	71.33589474223436	87043
a4bde7baba9ffbaf1ba1a3e156dc1eaaffb66eb7	mobile transaction over nfc and gsm		Dynamic relationships between Near Field Communication (NFC) ecosystem players in a monetary transaction make them partners in a way that they sometimes require to share access permission to applications that are running in the service environment. One of the technologies that can be used to ensure secure NFC transactions is cloud computing. This offers a wider range of advantages than the use of only a Secure Element (SE) in an NFC enabled mobile phone. In this paper, we propose a protocol for NFC mobile payments over NFC using Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) authentication. In our protocol, the SE in the mobile device is used for customer authentication whereas the customer’s banking credentials are stored in a cloud under the control of the Mobile Network Operator (MNO). The proposed protocol eliminates the requirement for a shared secret between the Point of Sale (PoS) and the MNO before execution of the protocol, a mandatory requirement in the earlier version of this protocol. This elimination makes the protocol more practicable and user friendly. A detailed analysis of the protocol discusses multiple attack scenarios.

By moving data to locationtransparent centralized facilities or providers, cloud storage services offer significant economic advantages to consumers and enterprises. However, concerns have been raised regarding the duplication, dissemination, and deletion of data stored on the cloud. In addition, data leakage would be another major concern whether accidental or due to a malicious hacker attack. Thus, the formation of trust in technology is particularly essential for users to cope with the uncertainty of information privacy because users relinquish their ultimate control over the fate of their data. Trust in technology involves two major trusting mechanisms, namely cognitive trust and emotional trust. Cognitive trust, which is also known as trusting belief, refers to the users’ rational expectations that the technology under scrutiny will have the necessary attributes to rely on. Three features of cognitive trust have been considered as essential elements for cloud storage applications namely, openness, consent, and access. Meanwhile, emotional trust refers to users’ feeling of security and comfort to rely on the technology in use. It contains three different components, namely competence, relatedness, and autonomy. A model is proposed to depict the relationship between technology trust, perceived information privacy and security concerns. This research extends trust research on information privacy and information security concerns and enrich existing literature on the formation of trust. The results of this research could provide specific technology traits that vendors can adopt in to build up users’ trust in the technology.	autonomy;centralized computing;cloud storage;data compression;error-tolerant design;information privacy;information security;malware;openness;spectral leakage;trust (emotion)	Kuo-Chung Chang;Yoke May Seow	2016			public relations;cloud computing security;information privacy;internet privacy;computer security;computational trust	Security	-46.50242016254695	61.01036811790088	87433

d2b14d4734e82f3bcb81fb0d13cfc52e2d35475a	cloud-based privacy-preserving parking navigation through vehicular communications		Finding a vacant parking space in a congested area, such as shopping mall, airport, etc., is always time-consuming and frustrating for drivers. Real-time parking information can avoid vehicles being cruising on the roads. However, when the drivers are acquiring parking information, their privacy is inevitable to be disclosed. In this paper, to minimize drivers’ hassle and preserve drivers’ privacy, we propose CPARN, a Cloud-based Privacy-preserving pARking Navigation system through vehicular communications, in which a cloud server guides drivers to vacant parking spaces close to their desired destinations without exposing the privacy of drivers, including drivers’ identities, references and routes. Specifically, CPARN allows drivers to query vacant parking spaces in an anonymous manner to a cloud server that maintains the parking information, and retrieve the protected navigation responses from the roadside units when the vehicles are passing through. CPARN has the advantage that it is unnecessary for a vehicle to keep connected with the queried roadside unit to ensure the retrievability of the navigation result, such that the navigation retrieving probability can be significantly improved. Performance evaluation through extensive simulations demonstrates the efficiency and practicality of CPARN.	arbitrary-precision arithmetic;assignment zero;c++;centralized computing;cloud computing;computation;crowdsensing;electronic signature;elliptic curve primality;eurocrypt;hypertext transfer protocol;information sensitivity;information system;lu decomposition;lecture notes in computer science;local interconnect network;mathematical optimization;performance evaluation;play store;portable document format;privacy;real-time clock;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;retrievability;server (computing);simulation;springer (tank);ubiquitous computing;upload;virtual private server	Jianbing Ni;Kuan Zhang;Xiaodong Lin;Yong Yu;Xuemin Shen	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-59608-2_5	parking guidance and information;computer security;retrievability;navigation system;vehicular communication systems;cloud computing;business	Security	-39.55373035818682	61.08075092432246	87825

For example, in on-line transactions, a k-out-of-n oblivious transfer scheme allows a buyer to privately choose k out of n digital goods from a merchant without learning information about other n−k goods. In this paper, we propose several efficient two-round k-out-of-n oblivious transfer schemes, in which the receiver R sends O(k) messages to the sender S ,a ndS sends O(n) messages back to R. The schemes provide unconditional security for either sender or receiver. The computational security for the other side is based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) or Chosen-Target Computational Diffie-Hellman (CT-CDH) problems. Our schemes have the nice prop- erty of universal parameters, that is, each pair of R and S need not hold any secret before performing the protocol. The system parameters can be used by all senders and receivers without any trapdoor specification. In some cases, our OT k n schemes are the most efficient ones in terms of the communication cost, either in rounds or the num- ber of messages. Moreover, one of our schemes is extended to an adaptive oblivious transfer scheme. In that scheme, S sends O(n) messages to R in one round in the commitment phase. For each query of R ,o nlyO(1) messages are exchanged and O(1) operations are performed. The preliminary version of this paper was published at PKC '05 (Chu and Tzeng 2005).

We discuss the connection between ownership and the notion of desynchronization resistance and give the first formal definition of the latter.

Simultaneously, constructing an integrated EPR information system of all the patients is beneficial because it can provide medical institutions and the academia with most of the patients’ information in details for them to make correct decisions and clinical decisions, to maintain and analyze patients’ health. Also beneficial to doctors and scholars, the EPR system can give them record linkage for researches, payment audits, or other services bound to be developed and integrated into medicine.

Recently Zhang et al. proposed an efficient ID-based public auditing protocol called IPAD for the outsourced data by combing Waters signature and public auditing for the outsourced data. They claimed IPAD is the first ID-based auditing protocol for data integrity in the standard security model. But in this paper we show their proposal is not secure. Especially, the adversaries can easily generate tags for any file, which obviously break the unforgeability property of the cloud storage auditing protocol.	cloud storage;computer data storage;data integrity;geodetic datum;server (computing);virtual private server;ipad	Xu An Wang;Xiaoshuang Luo;Jindan Zhang;Xiaoyuan Yang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59463-7_61	computer security model;internet privacy;cloud computing;cloud computing security;computer science;computer security;data integrity;audit;computer data storage	Security	-42.66183097279332	67.56417603505881	88592

However, since security information is usually considered sensitive, parties are hesitant to share all their information through public channels. Instead, they only exchange this information with parties with whom they already established trust relationships. We propose the use of two complementary techniques to allow parties to share information without the need to immediately reveal private information. We consider a cryptographic approach to hide the details of an indicator of compromise so that it can be shared with other parties. These other parties are still able to detect intrusions with these cryptographic indicators. Additionally, we apply another cryptographic construction to let parties report back their number of sightings to a central party. This central party can aggregate the messages from the various parties to learn the total number of sightings for each indicator, without learning the number of sightings from each individual party.  An evaluation of our open-source proof-of-concept implementations shows that both techniques incur only little overhead, making the techniques prime candidates for practice.	aggregate data;cryptography;indicator of compromise;open-source software;overhead (computing);personally identifiable information	Tim van de Kamp;Andreas Peter;Maarten H.

13bf474831ca58cea5d7cd3ca8cd0eb6f8001b4a	predicate encryption with partial public keys	semantic security;public key encryption;security proof;public key;random oracle;access control	Predicate encryption is a new powerful cryptographic primitive which allows for fine-grained access control for encrypted data: the owner of the secret key can release partial keys, called tokens, that can decrypt only a specific subset of ciphertexts. More specifically, in a predicate encryption scheme, ciphertexts and tokens have attributes and a token can decrypt a ciphertext if and only if a certain predicate of the two associated attributes holds. In this paper, ciphertext attributes are vectors x of fixed length over an alphabet Σ and token attributes, called patterns, are vectors y of the same length over the alphabet Σ = Σ ∪ { }. We consider the predicate Match(x, y) introduced by [BW06] which is true if and only if x = 〈x1, . . . , x 〉 and y = 〈y1, . . . , y 〉 agree in all positions i for which yi = . Various security notions are relevant for predicate encryption schemes. First of all, one wants the ciphertexts to hide its attributes (this property is called semantic security). In addition, it makes sense also to consider the property of token security, a security notion in which the token is required not to reveal any information on the associated pattern. It is easy to see that predicate privacy is impossible to achieve in a publickey setting. In [SSW09], the authors considered the notion of a predicate encryption scheme in the symmetric-key setting and gave the first construction with token security. In this paper, we consider the notion of a partial public key encryption (as suggested in [SSW09]) in which a partial public key allows a user to generate only a subset of the ciphertexts. We give a construction which is semantically secure and in which a token does not reveal any information on the associated pattern except for the locations of the ’s. The proofs of security of our construction are based on hardness assumptions in bilinear groups of prime order; this greatly improves the efficiency of the construction when compared to previous constructions ([SSW09]) which used groups of composite orders. Our security proofs do not use random oracles.	access control;ciphertext;cryptographic primitive;encryption;key (cryptography);public-key cryptography;security token;semantic security	Carlo Blundo;Vincenzo Iovino;Giuseppe Persiano	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17619-7_21	multiple encryption;h.235;40-bit encryption;security association;client-side encryption;computer science;key wrap;database;link encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;deterministic encryption;key space;key distribution;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption;keyfile;email encryption	Crypto	-40.87714279587958	73.2758840106868	89004

Several commercial social networking platforms that came to light recently suddenly became extremely popular at the international arena. Apart from obvious advantages in terms of fast community building, rapid exchange of information at the professional and private level, social network platforms raise several issues concerning the privacy and security of their users. The goal of this thesis is to identify privacy and security problems raised by the social networks and to come up with the design of radically new architectures for the social network platform. As current social network platforms are based on centralized architectures that inherently threat user privacy due to potential monitoring and interception of private user information, the goal is to design social network platforms based on a distributed architecture in order to assure user privacy. New mechanisms are investigated in order to solve some classical security and trust management problems akin to distributed systems by taking advantage of the information stored in the social network platforms. Such problems range from trust establishment in self-organizing systems to key management without infrastructure to cooperation enforcement in peer-to-peer systems. This thesis suggests a new approach to tackle these security and privacy problems with a special emphasis on the privacy of users with respect to the application provider in addition to defense against intruders or malicious users. In order to ensure users' privacy in the face of potential privacy violations by the provider, the suggested approach adopts a decentralized architecture relying on cooperation among a number of independent parties that are also the users of the online social network application. The second strong point of the suggested approach is to capitalize on the trust relationships that are part of social networks in real life in order to cope with the problem of building trusted and privacy-preserving mechanisms as part of the online application. The combination of these design principles is Safebook,	centralized computing;personally identifiable information;social network	Leucio Antonio Cutillo;Mark Manulis;Thorsten Strufe	2010		10.1007/978-1-4419-7142-5_23	privacy software;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-46.55142420642733	63.502283012811056	89380
2408a354b101736c15d3668605f68e52f84e3ed7	new multistage secret sharing scheme based on factorization problem.	lagrange interpolation;secret sharing;data privacy;secret sharing scheme	A (t, n) secret sharing scheme [1, 2] allows a secret to be shared among n users in such a way that only t or more users can reconstruct the secret, but any t − 1 or less users have absolutely no information about the secret. One common drawback of almost all known secret sharing schemes is that they are one-time schemes. That is, once any t or more users reconstruct the secret by pooling their shares, both the secret and all shares become known to everyone within the group and everyone else. Thus, each share kept by each user can be used to reconstruct only one secret. However, if many different secrets have to be shared among the group of users, a straightforward method is to apply the secret sharing scheme repeatedly. In this case, each user has to keep many secret shares, which is very inefficient. In 1994, He and Dawson proposed a multistage (t, n) secret sharing (MSS) scheme [3] based on a one-way function to solve this problem. For k secrets to be shared among n users, only one secret share has to be kept by each user. The share is the same size as any single secret. These k secrets can be reconstructed one by one in a predetermined order, and revelation of the secrets at earlier stages will not compromise the security of	multistage amplifier;one-way function;shamir's secret sharing	Narn-Yih Lee;Tzonelih Hwang	2001	J.

cca3c445fd3274652ddedc8a235f19ef76ba52c9	providing efficient sso to cloud service access in aaa-based identity federations	abfab moonshot;sso;erp;federation;identity	The inclusion of cloud services within existing identity federations has gained interest in the last years, as a way to simplify the access to them, reducing the user management costs, and increasing the utilization of the cloud resources. Whereas several federation technologies have been developed along the years for the Web world (e.g. SAML, Oauth, OpenID), non-web application services have been largely forgotten. The ABFAB IETFWGwas created to define an architecture and a set of technologies for providing identity federation to non-Web application services, such as the cloud. ABFAB provides a way to use the existing EAP/AAA infrastructure to perform federated access control to any kind of application service, thanks to the definition of a new GSS-API mechanism called GSS-EAP. However, the ABFAB architecture does not define an efficient way of providing SSO. This paper defines a way to include such an SSO support into ABFAB, by introducing the required extensions to make use of the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP), the IETF standard for providing fast re-authentication in EAP. Moreover, to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed extensions, we have implemented a proof-of-concept based on Moonshot, the open-source implementation of ABFAB, and OpenStack as an example of cloud service. Finally, using this prototype we have completed a performance analysis that compares our proposal with the standard ABFAB operation. This analysis confirms the substantial reduction in terms of computational time and network traffic that can be achieved using ERP for providing efficient SSO to cloud service access in ABFAB-based identity	aaa (video game industry);access control;application programming interface;authentication protocol;cloud computing;erp;federated identity;network packet;oauth;open-source software;openid;prototype;saml 2.0;time complexity;web application;world wide web	Alejandro Pérez-Méndez;Rafael Marín López;Gabriel López Millán	2016	Future Generation Comp.

False positive is one inherent drawback of Bloom filter. We formulate the false positive rates for one regular large Bloom filter, and then derive the false positive rate for the two smaller ones. With examples, we show how the new scheme cuts down the false positive rate and the size of Bloom filter to a balanced point that fulfills the user requirements and increases the efficiency of the structure.	bloom filter;encryption;requirement;search engine indexing;user requirements document	Chi Sing Chum;Xiaowen Zhang	2017		10.1145/3029806.3029839	theoretical computer science;bloom filter;mathematics;distributed computing;internet privacy	Vision	-40.02455384264509	67.8938812730356	89568
bbbf0647c9a2c0808754c81774a845abdf81a00c	a key-insulated proxy re-encryption scheme for data sharing in a cloud environment.		Proxy re-encryption (PRE) enables a semi-trusted proxy to delegate the decryption right by re-encrypting the ciphertext under the delegator’s public key to an encryption under the public key of delegatee. Fueled by the translation ability, PRE is regarded as a promising candidate to secure data sharing in a cloud environment. However, the security of the PRE will be totally destroyed in case the secret key of the delegator or the delegatee has been exposed. Despite the key exposure seems inevitable, the PRE scheme with resistance against secret key leakage has never been presented before. To deal with this intractable problem, we propose a key-insulated proxy reencryption (KIPRE) scheme by incorporating the mechanisms of PRE and key-insulated cryptosystem. In the proposed scheme, the lifetime of the secret key associated with the user, i.e., the delegator or the delegatee, has been divided into several periods. In each time period, the user can interact with his/her physically-secure but computation-limited helper to update his/her temporary secret key. On the contrary, the public keys of the users remained unchanged during the whole lifetime of the system. We then apply our KIPRE scheme to construct a practical solution to the problem of sharing sensitive information in public clouds with resilience to the key exposure. The performance evaluation and the security analysis demonstrate that our scheme is efficient and practical.	ciphertext;cloud computing;computation;computational complexity theory;cryptosystem;encryption;information sensitivity;key (cryptography);performance evaluation;proxy re-encryption;public-key cryptography;semiconductor industry;spectral leakage;surround sound	Yilei Wang;Dongjie Yan;Fagen Li;Hu Xiong	2017	I.

5c24c5b61c389d83d002c155358abafa1bc0629b	a secure and robust temporal credential-based three-factor user authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks	wireless sensor networks;authentication;fuzzy extractor;biometrics;password;smart cards;user anonymity;unlinkability;security	User authentication is one of the most important security services required for the resource-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In user authentication, for critical applications of WSNs, a legitimate user is allowed to query and collect the real-time data at any time from a sensor node of the network as and when he/she demands for it. In order to get the real-time information from the nodes, the user needs to be first authenticated by the nodes as well as the gateway node (GWN) of WSN so that illegal access to nodes do not happen in the network. Recently, Jiang et al. proposed an efficient two-factor user authentication scheme with unlinkability property in WSNs Jiang (2014). In this paper, we analyze Jiang et al.’s scheme. Unfortunately, we point out that Jiang et al.’s scheme has still several drawbacks such as (1) it fails to protect privileged insider attack, (2) inefficient registration phase for the sensor nodes, (3) it fails to provide proper authentication in login and authentication phase, (4) it fails to update properly the new changed password of a user in the password update phase, (5) it lacks of supporting dynamic sensor node addition after initial deployment of nodes in the network, and (6) it lacks the formal security verification. In order to withstand these pitfalls found in Jiang et al.’s scheme, we aim to propose a three-factor user authentication scheme for WSNs. Our scheme preserves the original merits of Jiang et al.’s scheme. Our scheme is efficient as compared to Jiang et al.’s scheme and other schemes. Furthermore, our scheme provides better security features and higher security level than other schemes. In addition, we simulate our scheme for the formal security analysis using the widely-accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that our scheme is also secure.	authentication;credential	Ashok Kumar Das	2016	Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications	10.1007/s12083-014-0324-9	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-47.002157844950986	74.33254973887954	89670

However, most existing efficient and reliable ciphertext search schemes are based on keywords or shallow semantic parsing, which are not smart enough to meet with users’ search intention. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a content-aware search scheme, which can make semantic search more smart. First, we introduce conceptual graphs (CGs) as a knowledge representation tool. Then, we present our two schemes (PRSCG and PRSCG-TF) based on CGs according to different scenarios. In order to conduct numerical calculation, we transfer original CGs into their linear form with some modification and map them to numerical vectors. Second, we employ the technology of multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data as the basis against two threat models and raise PRSCG and PRSCG-TF to resolve the problem of privacy-preserving smart semantic search based on CGs. Finally, we choose a real-world data set: CNN data set to test our scheme. We also analyze the privacy and efficiency of proposed schemes in detail. The experiment results show that our proposed schemes are efficient.	ciphertext;cloud computing;conceptual graph;encryption;knowledge representation and reasoning;natural language processing;numerical analysis;parsing;privacy;semantic search;threat model	Zhangjie Fu;Fengxiao Huang;Kui Ren;Jian Weng;Xinyu Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2017.2692728	computer science;knowledge representation and reasoning;ciphertext;parsing;cloud computing;encryption;semantic search;data mining;data modeling;server	Security	-40.16941113751949	67.01761460635652	89959

Without the protection of a proper auditing mechanism, cloud users would have to run high risks of having their legal rights and interests spoiled without their knowledge. Therefore, many data integrity, assurance, and correctness schemes have been proposed for data auditing. Most of these schemes work by randomly sampling and aggregating signatures from bilinear maps (for more efficiency) to check whether the cloud storage service is honest and whether the data stored in the cloud is correct. Although aggregating signatures can reduce the auditor’s computing overhead and time, unfortunately, none of these schemes have offered any workable solution to giving detailed information on where the errors are when the cloud data as a whole fails the auditing. To fix this problem, we shall propose a new public auditing scheme with a mechanism integrated into it especially to locate the problematic data blocks when they exist. With efficiency, the proposed scheme is capable not only of giving an accurate pass/fail report but also providing detailed information on the locations of the errors detected.	antivirus software;bilinear filtering;block (data storage);cloud computing;cloud storage;computation;correctness (computer science);data integrity;electronic signature;fail-safe;failure;overhead (computing);randomness;sampling (signal processing);the times	Min-Shiang Hwang;Cheng-Chi Lee;Tsuei-Hung Sun	2014	Automated Software Engineering	10.1007/s10515-014-0142-6	confidentiality;computer science;information security;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-42.67997573197301	67.96608640691493	89995

I t can conclude that some principal possessing the relevant key has transformed the message containing v. In some circumstances, this must be a regular participant of the protocol, not the penetrator. An inference of this kind is an authentication test . We introduce two main kinds of authentication test. An outgoing test is one in which the new value v is transmitted in encrypted form, and only a regular participant can extract it from that form. An incoming test is one in which v is received back in encrypted form, and only a regular participant can put it in that form. We combine these two tests with a supplementary idea, the unsolicited test, and a related method for checking that certain values remain secret . Together, they determine what authentication properties a r achieved by a wide range of cryptographic protocols. In this paper we introduce authentication tests and illustrate their power, giving new and straightforward proof s of security goals for several protocols. We also illustrate how to use the authentication tests as a heuristic for finding attacks against incorrect protocols. Finally, we suggest a protocol design process. We express these ideas in the strand space formalism [21], and prove them correct elsewhere [8].	authentication;communications protocol;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;encryption;heuristic;semantics (computer science);strand (programming language)	Joshua D.

Encryption techniques must be adopted to protect sensitive data from the service providers. A bucket-based storage technique addresses the scenarios with limit trust in database servers. However, when the buckets are constructed improperly, intruders could have a chance to guess the sensitive value distribution based on the bucket occurrences. In this paper, we propose a simple and adaptive method, named split and merge (SAM), to construct a set of buckets with balanced occurrences. The buckets with more occurrences are splitted in two parts and the neighbor bucket pairs with smaller occurrences are merged together. Some experiments are conducted to validate this method.	database server;electronic business;encryption;experiment;server (computing)	Yi Tang;Liankuan Zhang	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on e-Technology, e-Commerce and e-Service	10.1109/EEE.2005.27	computer science;database;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-42.81690212387998	69.87260025660623	91118

The proposed obfuscation allows database management systems at cloud servers to perform fundamental query operations while cloud users’ information is protected against leaks to malicious administrators. We studied the performance of the proposed obfuscation to find that the inflation of obfuscated tables at cloud servers and the increase in the network traffic load will be the major overhead. We developed algorithms that mitigate the inflation of obfuscated tables (using ‘α’ parameter) and the increase in the network traffic load (using the query constructor). The former achieved a linear relation between the obfuscated table size and the degree of obfuscation (how hard for malicious administrators to understand the meaning of users’ information). The latter achieved that the network traffic load nearly converged to that of no obfuscation for busy systems. We conclude that the proposed attributeshuffling obfuscation will be feasible and efficient for busy and large database systems, while it adapts to database systems with diverse configurations.

One important aspect of secured online transactions is privacy protection. This paper addresses privacy issues in composite web service transactions by providing an intelligent semi-automated privacy-aware approach to efficiently building an appropriate composite web service that (1) satisfies service functional requirements with (near) minimum number of services and information leakage, and (2) complies, as much as possible, with a customer's privacy preferences and trust (in service providers when available). Furthermore, we describe details of the proposed approach and illustrates its use that exploits generic knowledge about types and sensitivity levels of information, together with specific knowledge about customer privacy preferences and trusts on certain providers.	consumer privacy;e-commerce;functional requirement;information leakage;semiconductor industry;spectral leakage;web service	Rattikorn Hewett;Phongphun Kijsanayothin	2009	2009 International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, (ICITST)	10.1109/ICITST.2009.5402545	web service;privacy software;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;ws-policy;database;business;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-43.98737552584678	61.28044827977712	91307
4cc022d4edaacbda1c5e6577d71b9b8a51bae664	notions of deniable message authentication	deniability;authentication;otr;zero knowledge;privacy	Deniable message authentication has drawn significant attention since it was first formalized by Dwork, Naor, and Sahai (STOC 1998). Since then, multiple notions of deniability have been introduced that vary in the considered adversary model and the required level of deniability. Most of the previous works concentrate on fairly strong notions of deniability, allowing the prover to even dispute that an interaction took place. In practice, however, weaker forms of deniability may suffice, such as being able to deny that a certain message has been transmitted at a certain point in time. Our work here thus introduces alternative notions of deniable message authentication, including for example content deniability (where one can deny the actual message) and context deniability (where one can claim that the allegedly transmitted message is taken out of context). We then analyze existing approaches, carving out the deniability properties these protocols achieve. In particular, we investigate the off-the-record messaging protocol (OTR) of Borisov, Goldberg, and Brewer (WPES 2004), which lists deniability of authentication as one of its explicit goals, but escapes the strong notions of deniability in the literature.	adversary model;cynthia dwork;message authentication code;symposium on theory of computing;libotr	Marc Fischlin;Sogol Mazaheri	2015		10.1145/2808138.2808143	computer science;deniable encryption;authentication;distributed computing;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;zero-knowledge proof	Crypto	-38.02225150314224	73.52327375962834	91447

If this binding is achieved by means of digital signature techniques, this means agents have to carry the owner’s private key to the host where they sign documents. This exposes the key to attacks because it is copied outside a protected environment. In this paper, we present a mechanism, called proxy certificates, that avoids the need for the agent to have access to the user’s private key for digitally signing documents, but still binds the owner to the contents of those documents. In order to support our claims, we apply the mechanism to SET/A, an agent-based payment system we proposed in previous work. We also analyze the emerging technology of attribute certificates and argue that it is appropriate to implement proxy certificates.	agent-based model;attribute-value system;digital signature;e-commerce;mobile agent;proxy server;public key certificate;public-key cryptography;requirement;secure environment;server (computing)	Artur Romão;Miguel Mira da Silva	2001		10.1007/3-540-45370-9_13	e-commerce;electronic funds transfer;attack;digital signature;computer science;operating system;mobile agent;database;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;emerging technologies;world wide web;computer security	Security	-45.349663484977924	70.27209631034947	91684

To obscure the actual statistical values and improve the levels of privacy, we propose using scaled bin values instead of raw data. We find that while there is a natural trade off between privacy and accuracy, we can maintain reasonable correlation accuracy across different levels of privacy and different adversarial backgrounds for time series data with varying distributions.	aggregate data;experiment;privacy;product binning;time series	Mehmet Sayal;Lisa Singh	2011	2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Social Computing	10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.99	computer science;data science;time series;data mining;distributed database;statistics	DB	-39.28222523335054	64.09841202198399	92019

The protocols provide non-repudiation of origin and non-repudiation of receipt security services to protect communicating parties from each other's false denials that the e-mail message has been sent and received. The protocols also provide strong fairness to ensure that the recipient receives the e-mail if and only if the sender receives the receipt. Services of an off-time and transparent third party are invoked in the protocols only in exceptional circumstances, i.e.. when the communicating parties fail to complete the e-mail for receipt exchange due to a network failure or a party's misbehaviour. Protocol RSA-CEMDI also offers confidentiality protection for the e-mail message and the corresponding receipt from the third party, achieved at the cost of some additional computations. The protocols are based on a cryptographic primitive called Verifiable and Recoverable Encryption of a Signature (VRES). The novel design of the VRES allows efficiency improvements in comparison with the related certified e-mail delivery protocols based on similar primitives.	email;encryption;rsa (cryptosystem);schedule (computer science);signature	Aleksandra Nenadic;Ning Zhang;Qi Shi	2005	Journal of Computer Security		internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-42.526419776299875	72.74477018348476	92080

Most of the existing cryptographic solutions to privacy-preserving data mining assume semi-honest participants. In theory, these solutions can be extended to the malicious model using standard techniques like commitment schemes and zero-knowledge proofs. However, these techniques are often expensive, especially when the data sizes are large. In this paper, we investigate alternative ways to convert solutions in the semi-honest model to the malicious model. We take two classical solutions as examples, one of which can be extended to the malicious model with only slight modifications while another requires a careful redesign of the protocol. In both cases, our solutions for the malicious model are much more efficient than the zero-knowledge proofs based solutions.	data mining	Divyesh Shah;Sheng Zhong	2007	Inf.

Location cloaking has been proposed to blur users' accurate locations with cloaked regions. Although various cloaking algorithms have been studied, none of the prior work has explored the impact of cloaking on the bandwidth usage of requested services. In this paper, we develop an innovative result-aware location cloaking approach, called 2PASS. Based on the notion of Voronoi cells, 2PASS minimizes the number of objects to request, and hence, the bandwidth while meeting the same privacy requirement. The core component of 2PASS is a lightweight WAG-tree index, based on which efficient and secure client and server procedures are designed. Through threat analysis and experimental results, we argue that 2PASS is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of various metrics, such as query response time and bandwidth consumption. We also enclose a case study of 2PASS in a real-life application.	approximation algorithm;c date and time functions;cell (microprocessor);client-side;client–server model;data access;definition;dummy variable (statistics);gaussian blur;geographic coordinate system;location-based service;nondeterministic algorithm;privacy;real life;response time (technology);selection algorithm;server (computing);type of service;usability;user experience;voronoi diagram	Haibo Hu;Jianliang Xu	2010	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2010.26	computational geometry;computer science;operating system;location-based service;internet privacy;mobile computing;privacy;world wide web;computer security;bandwidth;server;computer network	Security	-39.753714725604155	60.477857598327425	92289
122430e2b418be1d22bb99cb2bbe813e886ce2cd	evaluating the utility of differential privacy: a use case study of a behavioral science dataset		Healthcare datasets may contain information that participants and data collectors have a vested interest in keeping private. Additionally, social scientists who collect large amounts of medical data value the privacy of their survey participants. As they follow participants through longitudinal studies, they develop unique profiles of these individuals. A growing challenge for these researchers is to maintain the privacy of their study participants, while sharing their data to facilitate research. This chapter evaluates the utility of a differentially private dataset. There has been extensive work, and heightened public and governmental focus on the privacy of medical datasets. However, additional efforts are needed to help researchers and practitioners better understand the fundamental notion of privacy with regards to more recent techniques, like differential privacy. The results of the study align with the theory of differential privacy, showing that dimensionality is a challenge, and that when the number of records in the database is sufficiently larger than the number of cells covered by a database query, the number of statistical tests with results close to those performed on original data, increases.	differential privacy	Raquel Hill	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-23633-9_4	computer science;data science;data mining;internet privacy	NLP	-40.8540444577704	62.361810800331675	92415

The database consists of two parts that are collected using different pressure-sensitive tablets (one with and the other without an LCD display). A total of 100 people contributed to each part, resulting in a database of more than 3,000 genuine signatures and 2,000 skilled forgeries. The genuine signatures in the database are real signatures of the contributors. In collecting skilled forgeries, forgers were shown the signing process on the monitor and were given a chance to practice. Furthermore, for a subset of the forgeries (highly skilled forgeries), this animation was mapped onto the LCD screen of the tablet so that the forgers could trace over the mapped signature. Forgers in this group were also informed of how close they were to the reference signature, so that they could improve their forgery quality. We describe the signature acquisition process and several verification protocols for this database. We also report the performance of a state-of-the-art signature verification system using the associated protocols. The results show that the highly skilled forgery set is significantly more difficult compared to the skilled forgery set, providing researchers with challenging forgeries.

Although it is generally accepted that open sharing of cyber data and warnings between the independent (but mutually vulnerable) endpoints promotes broader situational awareness, such openness introduces new privacy challenges. In this paper, we present a high-level model for security information sharing between autonomous operators on the Internet that enables meaningful collaboration while addressing the enduring privacy and infrastructure needs of those individual collaborators. Our concept for a collaborative and decentralised IT-EWS is based on a novel combination of existing techniques, including peer-to-peer networking and Traceable Anonymous Certificates. We concentrate on the security and confidentiality of the data exchange platform rather than of the data itself, a separate area of research.

The approach is based on a measure of the secret information that an attacker can extract from a system from a given number of side-channel measurements. We provide an algorithm to compute this measure, and we use it to analyze the resistance of hardware implementations of cryptographic algorithms with respect to timing attacks. In particular, we show that message-blinding – the common countermeasure against timing attacks – reduces the rate at which information about the secret is leaked, but that the complete information is still eventually revealed. Finally, we compare information measures corresponding to unknown-message, known-message, and chosen-message attackers and show that they form a strict hierarchy.	algorithm;blinding (cryptography);cryptography;side-channel attack;spectral leakage	Michael Backes;Boris Köpf	2008	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-540-88313-5_33	timing attack;computer science;theoretical computer science;side channel attack;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-34.36553029004568	73.98685371520125	93591
442b6e79e8e86391318f64e4825390546ae18cb2	advanced searchable encryption: keyword search for matrix-type storage		The recent development of IoT technologies and cloud storages, many types of information including private information have been gradually outsourced. For such a situation, new convenient functionalities such as arithmetic and keyword search on ciphertexts are required to allow users to retrieve information without leaking any information. Especially, searchable encryptions have been paid much attention to realize a keyword search on an encrypted domain. In addition, an architecture of searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) is a suitable and efficient solution for data outsourcing. In this paper, we focus on an SSE scheme which employs a secure index for searching a keyword with optimal search time. In the conventional studies, it has been widely considered that the scheme searches whether a queried keyword is contained in encrypted documents. On the other hand, we additionally take into account the location of a queried keyword in documents by targeting a matrix-type data format. It enables a manager to search personal information listed per line or column in CSV-like format data.

e154fa99e9d883b148e27077b292ff10c2124790	collaborative trajectory privacy preserving scheme in location-based services		Location-based services (LBSs) have been gaining considerable popularity and are becoming the fastest growing activity-related services that people use in their daily life. While users benefit from LBSs, the collection and analysis of participators’ location data and trajectory information may jeopardize their privacy. Existing proposals focus mostly on snapshot queries. However, privacy preservation in continuous LBSs is more challenging than in snapshot queries because adversaries could use the spatial and temporal correlations on the user trajectory to infer the user’s private information. In this paper, we propose the collaborative trajectory privacy preserving (CTPP) scheme for continuous queries, in which trajectory privacy is guaranteed by caching-aware collaboration between users, without the need for any fully trusted entities. The main idea of our scheme is to obfuscate the actual trajectory of a user by issuing fake queries to confuse the LBS adversary. We first present a multi-hop caching-aware cloaking algorithm to collect valuable information from multi-hop peers based on collaborative caching. Then, we describe a collaborative privacy preserving querying algorithm that issues a fake query to confuse the location service provider (LSP). Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme in terms of processing time and communication cost.	location-based service	Tao Peng;Qing Liu;Dacheng Meng;Guojun Wang	2017	Inf.

This richer formalism allows for a more precise modeling of a system’s vulnerabilities, by representing interactions between possible attacks and corresponding defensive measures. In this paper we compare the computational complexity of both formalisms. We identify semantics for which extending attack trees with defense nodes does not increase the computational complexity. This implies that, for these semantics, every query that can be solved efficiently on attack trees can also be solved efficiently on attack–defense trees. Furthermore, every algorithm for attack trees can directly be used to process attack–defense trees.	algorithm;attack tree;computation;computational complexity theory;de morgan's laws;formal grammar;interaction;morgan;semantics (computer science);vulnerability (computing)	Barbara Kordy;Marc Pouly;Patrick Schweitzer	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25261-7_8	computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;computer security	Logic	-33.76178730793389	71.15391669632778	94065

Quite a few reputation-based trust functions have been proposed in the literature for many different application domains. However, one cannot always obtain all information required by the trust evaluation process. For example, access control restrictions or high collect costs might limit the ability gather all required records. Thus, one key question is how to analytically quantify the quality of scores computed using incomplete information. In this paper, we start a first effort to answer the above question by studying the following problem: given the existence of certain missing information, what are the worst and best trust scores (i.e., the bounds of trust) a target entity can be assigned? We formulate this problem based on a general model of reputation systems, and examine the monotonicity property of representative trust functions in the literature. We show that most existing trust functions are monotonic in terms of direct missing information about the target of a trust evaluation.	reputation system	Xi Gong;Ting Yu;Adam J.

Classical results in the unconditionally secure MPC indicate that in the presence of an active adversary, every function can be computed if and only if the number of corrupted participants, ta, is smaller than n/3. Relaxing the requirement of perfect secrecy and utilizing broadcast channels, one can improve this bound to ta < n/2. All existing MPC protocols assume that uncorrupted participants are truly honest, i.e., they are not even curious in learning other participant secret inputs. Based on this assumption, some MPC protocols are designed in such a way that after elimination of all misbehaving participants, the remaining ones learn all information in the system. This is not consistent with maintaining privacy of the participant inputs. Furthermore, an improvement of the classical results given by Fitzi, Hirt, and Maurer indicates that in addition to ta actively corrupted participants, the adversary may simultaneously corrupt some participants passively. This is in contrast to the assumption that participants who are not corrupted by an active adversary are truly honest. This paper examines the privacy of MPC protocols, and introduces the notion of an omnipresent adversary, which cannot be eliminated from the protocol. The omnipresent adversary can be either a passive, an active or a mixed one. We assume that up to a minority of participants who are not corrupted by an active adversary can be corrupted passively, with the restriction that at any time, the number of corrupted participants does not exceed a predetermined threshold. We will also show that the existence of a t-resilient protocol for a group of n participants, implies the existence of a t’-private protocol for a group of n′ participants. That is, the elimination of misbehaving participants from a t-resilient protocol leads to the decomposition of the protocol. Our adversary model stipulates that a MPC protocol never operates with a set of truly honest participants (which is a more realistic scenario). Therefore, privacy of all participants who properly follow the protocol will be maintained. We present a novel disqualification protocol to avoid a loss of privacy of participants who properly follow the protocol.	adversary (cryptography);adversary model;broadcast domain;cryptographic protocol;information-theoretic security;privacy;secure multi-party computation;ueli maurer (cryptographer)	Hossein Ghodosi;Josef Pieprzyk	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-00468-1_11	digital library;computer science;distributed computing;secure multi-party computation;internet privacy;proactive secret sharing;computer security;adversary model	Crypto	-39.22943864648856	73.23953163882467	94204

One of them is using reputations and the other uses a micropayment system. In reputation-based approach, each node has a reputation associated with it, which is used as a currency or feedback collection for file exchange operations. There have been several attempts over the years to develop a strong and efficient reputation system that provides credibility, fairness, and accountability. One such attempt was the Free Haven Project that provides a strong foundation for cloud-based anonymous data storage systems. The work proposed in this paper is motivated by the Free Haven Project aimed at developing a reputation system that facilitates dynamic operations such as adding servers, removing servers and changing role of authorities. The proposed system also provides algorithm for scoring and maintaining reputations of the servers in order to achieve credibility, accountability and fairness.	algorithm;cloud computing;computer data storage;data haven;data storage tag;fairness measure;feedback;free haven project;micropayment;reputation system	Harsh N.

Traditionally, these properties have proven to be difficult to satisfy at the same time and only one previous scheme i.e. Lamport hashes also called S/KEY one time password system has claimed to achieve that. Lamport hashes however have a limitation that they are computationally intensive for the client and the number of times a client may login before the system should be re-initialized is small. We address these limitations to come up with a new scheme called the N/R one time password system. The basic idea is have the server aid the client computation by inserting 'breakpoints' in the hash chains. Client computational requirements are dramatically reduced without any increase in the server computational requirements and the number of times a client may login before the system has to be reinitialized is also increased significantly. The system is particularly suited for mobile and constrained devices having limited computational power.	breakpoint;client-side;computation;cryptographic hash function;hash chain;login;markov chain;mobile device;one-time password;password (video gaming);requirement;s/key;server (computing)	Vipul Goyal;Ajith Abraham;Sugata Sanyal;Sang-Yong Han	2005	International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing (ITCC'05) - Volume II	10.1109/ITCC.2005.275	zero-knowledge password proof;s/key;computer science;salt;distributed computing;one-time password;world wide web;computer security;password strength	Mobile	-45.21862192070529	72.34136026943041	94239

The computational load imposed by encryption makes such approaches not suitable for scenarios with lightweight clients. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a novel model for enforcing privacy requirements on the outsourced information which departs from encryption. The basic idea of our approach is to store a small portion of the data (just enough to break sensitive associations) on the client, which is trusted being under the data owner control, while storing the remaining information in clear form at the external (honest-but-curious) server. We model the problem and provide a solution for it aiming at minimizing the data stored at the client. We also illustrate the execution of queries on the fragmented information.	computation;confidentiality;encryption;fragmentation (computing);information sensitivity;information theory;requirement;server (computing)	Valentina Ciriani;Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati;Sara Foresti;Sushil Jajodia;Stefano Paraboschi;Pierangela Samarati	2009			40-bit encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-41.483818633572334	66.1008718898877	94260

We answer this question in the affirmative; the ElGamal signature scheme has such a channel. Thus, contrary to popular belief, the design of the DSA does not maximise the covert utility of its signatures, but minimises them. Our construction also shows that many discrete log based systems are insecure: they operate in more than one group at a time, and key material may leak through those groups in which discrete log is easy. However, the DSA is not vulnerable in this way.	antivirus software;covert channel;digital signature;discrete logarithm;newton	Ross J.

In spite of the advantages of biometrics as an identity verification technology, some concerns have been raised due to the high sensitivity of biometric data: any information leakage poses a severe privacy threat. To solve those issues only protected templates should be stored or exchanged for recognition purposes. In order to improve the performance and achieve more secure and privacy-preserving systems, we propose a general framework for multi-biometric template protection based on homomorphic probabilistic encryption, where only encrypted data is handled. Three fusion levels are thoroughly analysed, showing that all requirements described in the ISO/IEC 24745 standard on biometric data protection are met with no accuracy degradation. Furthermore, even if all the process is carried out in the encrypted domain, no encryptions are necessary during verification, thereby allowing an efficient verification which can be deployed for real-time applications. Finally, experiments are carried out on a reproducible research framework. The results obtained show high accuracy rates, reaching EERs as low as 0.12%, and requiring protected templates comprising 200KB.	biometrics;elegant degradation;experiment;homomorphic encryption;iso/iec 42010;identity verification service;information leakage;information privacy;probabilistic encryption;real-time clock;requirement;spectral leakage	Marta Gomez-Barrero;Emanuele Maiorana;Javier Galbally;Patrizio Campisi;Julian Fiérrez	2017	Pattern Recognition	10.1016/j.patcog.2017.01.024	machine learning;real-time computing;artificial intelligence;data mining;signal processing;encryption;information leakage;biometrics;spite;homomorphic encryption;probabilistic encryption;data protection act 1998;computer science	Security	-48.267545988182626	68.51341701461735	94759
18726c1cbf5fb4bb751fb7f74a0bc1f94130b954	an explicit model of belief change for cryptographic protocol verification		Cryptographic protocols are structured sequences of messages that are used for exchanging information in a hostile environment. Many protocols have epistemic goals: a successful run of the protocol is intended to cause a participant to hold certain beliefs. As such, epistemic logics have been employed for the verification of cryptographic protocols. Although this approach to verification is explicitly concerned with changing beliefs, formal belief change operators have not been incorporated in previous work. In this preliminary paper, we introduce a new approach to protocol verification by combining a monotonic logic with a non-monotonic belief change operator. In this context, a protocol participant is able to retract beliefs in response to new information and a protocol participant is able to postulate the most plausible event explaining new information. Hence, protocol participants may draw conclusions from received messages in the same manner conclusions are drawn in formalizations of commonsense reasoning. We illustrate that this kind of reasoning is particularly important when protocol participants have incorrect beliefs.	commonsense reasoning;cryptographic protocol;information	Aaron Hunter;James P.

A user can input his/her identity and password to require services from the remote server. There are various attacks through an insecure network to obtain a user’s information. Therefore, many schemes are proposed to guarantee secure communication. However, a lot of schemes are not secure. Recently, Tan proposed an improved password authentication using a smart card for multi-server environments. In this paper, we show the weakness of Tan’s scheme, and his scheme cannot resist a password guessing attack.	authentication;cryptanalysis;os-tan;password cracking;secure communication;server (computing);smart card	Tung-Huang Feng;Chung-Huei Ling;Min-Shiang Hwang	2014	I.

Since the third party can be seldom trusted or can be compromised, it is important to provide copyright protection for outsourced database. In this paper a novel scheme of copyright protection for outsourced database based on digital watermarking is proposed. In the presented system, watermark is embedded into the database under the control of both the secret key and the chaotic random numbers. No original database is needed during watermark detection, and the copyright is judged by the match rate of watermark.

By training massive data collected from the real world, data classification helps learners discover hidden data patterns. In addition to data training, given a trained model from collected data, a user can classify whether a new incoming data belongs to an existing class, or, multiple distributed entities may collaborate to test the similarity of their trained results. However, due to data locality and privacy concerns, it is infeasible for large-scale distributed systems to share each individual's datasets with each other for data similarity check. On the one hand, the trained model is an entity's private asset and may leak private information, which should be well protected from all other non-collaborative entities. On the other hand, the new incoming data may contain sensitive information which cannot be disclosed directly for classification. To address the above privacy issues, we propose a privacy-preserving data classification and similarity evaluation scheme for distributed systems. With our scheme, neither new arriving data nor trained models are directly revealed during the classification and similarity evaluation procedures. The proposed scheme can be applied to many fields using data classification and evaluation. Based on extensive real-world experiments, we have also evaluated the privacy preservation, feasibility, and efficiency of the proposed scheme.	big data;centrality;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;correctness (computer science);data mining;distributed computing;entity;experiment;information sensitivity;locality of reference;personally identifiable information;polynomial;privacy	Qi Jia;Linke Guo;Zhanpeng Jin;Yuguang Fang	2016	2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	10.1109/ICDCS.2016.94	data modeling;support vector machine;communications protocol;data quality;information privacy;computer science;data science;data warehouse;data mining;database;distributed database	DB	-40.15559411261688	64.52459612317362	95429

Based on reductions to nonadaptive group testing, our methods are able to take advantage of minimal amounts of privacy leakage, such as contained in a single bit that indicates if two people in a medical database have any common genetic mutations, or if two people have any common friends in an online social network. We analyze our Mastermind attack algorithms using theoretical characterizations that provide sublinear bounds on the number of queries needed to clone the database, as well as experimental tests on genomic information, collaborative filtering data, and online social networks. By taking advantage of the generally sparse nature of these real-world databases and modulating a parameter that controls query sparsity, we demonstrate that relatively few nonadaptive queries are needed to recover a large majority of each database.	collaborative filtering;database;hirschberg's algorithm;ibm notes;mastermind;no-cloning theorem;privacy;randomized algorithm;randomness;social network;sparse matrix;spectral leakage;string (computer science)	Arthur U.

Any attempt to enumerate all messages that can be deduced by the intruder and the possible actions in all protocol steps results in an enormous branching of the model’s state space. In current work, we introduce a new intruder model that can be exploited for state space reduction, optionally in combination with known techniques, such as partial order and symmetry reduction. The proposed intruder modeling approach called Message Inspection (MI) is based on enhancing the intruder’s knowledge with metadata for the exchanged messages. In a preliminary simulation run, the intruder tags the analyzed messages with protocol-specific values for a set of predefined parameters. This metadata is used to identify possible attack actions, for which it is a priori known that they cannot cause a security violation. The MI algorithm selects attack actions that can be discarded, from an open-ended base of primitive attack actions. Thus, model checking focuses only on attack actions that may disclose a security violation. The most interesting consequence is a non negligible state-space pruning, but at the same time our approach also allows customizing the behavior of the intruder model, in order e.g. to make it appropriate for model checking problems that involve liveness. We provide experimental results obtained with the SPIN model checker, for the Needham Schroeder security protocol.	algorithm;cryptographic protocol;dolev–yao model;enumerated type;experiment;fairness measure;integrated development environment;liveness;model checking;needham–schroeder protocol;nonlinear gameplay;promela;spin model checker;simulation;state space;tokenization (data security);yao graph	Stylianos Basagiannis;Panagiotis Katsaros;Andrew Pombortsis	2010	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2009.08.003	model checking;verification;computer science;state space;cryptographic protocol;database;distributed computing;computer security	Logic	-43.8590341229914	73.91796391057362	95825

Next, neither the delaying function nor the trusted third party is necessary in the proposed protocol, which guarantees the protocol more robust and efficient.

6e77d6a7ddd63904d3a23f5190a7eb7ff3afc538	a generic construction of secure-channel free searchable encryption with multiple keywords		In public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS), a secure channel must be required in order to send trapdoors to the server, whereas in secure-channel free PEKS (SCF-PEKS), no such secure channel is required. As an extension of SCF-PEKS, Wang et al. (NSS 2016) proposed SCF-PEKS with multiple keywords (SCF-MPEKS). In this paper, we further extend the Wang et al. result by proposing the generic construction of SCF-MPEKS from hidden vector encryption (HVE), tag-based encryption, and a one-time signature. Our generic construction provides adaptive security, where the test queries are allowed in the security model, and does not require random oracles. On the other hand, the Wang et al. scheme did not consider adaptive security, and the scheme is secure in the random oracle model. We give an instantiation of our generic construction by employing the Park-Lee-Susilo-Lee HVE scheme (Information Sciences 2013). This is the first adaptive secure SCF-MPEKS scheme in the standard model.	encryption;secure channel	Keita Emura	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-64701-2_1	computer security;computer security model;random oracle;computer science;encryption;public-key cryptography;secure channel;information science	Crypto	-42.054684337622916	74.11523241649734	95853
acf9966011cb607cf18feeea3e9bd56b964bace1	bvs: a lightweight forward and backward secure scheme for pmu communications in smart grid	期刊论文	In smart grid, phaser measurement units (PMUs) can upload readings to utility centers via supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) or energy management system (EMS) to enable intelligent controlling and scheduling. It is critical to maintain the secrecy of readings so as to protect customers’ privacy, together with integrity and source authentication for the reliability and stability of power scheduling. In particular, appealing security scheme needs to perform well in PMUs that usually have computational resource constraints, thus designed security protocols have to remain lightweight in terms of computation and storage. In this paper, we propose a family of schemes to solve this problem. They are public key based scheme (PKS), password based scheme (PWS) and billed value-based scheme (BVS). BVS can achieve forward and backward security and only relies on hash functions. Security analysis justifies that the proposed schemes, especially BVS, can attain the security goals with low computation and storage cost.		Wei Ren;Jun Song;Min Lei;Yi Ren	2011	Int. J.

ae148ba8c5796a014d66a8089ea4934712b14f67	secure improved cloud-based rfid authentication protocol		Although Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems promise a fruitful future, security and privacy concerns have affected the adoption of the RFID technology. Several studies have been proposed to tackle the RFID security and privacy concerns under the assumption that the server is secure. In this paper, we assume that the server resides in the cloud that might be insecure, thus the tag’s data might be prone to privacy invasion and attacks. Xie et al. proposed a new scheme called “cloud-based RFID authentication”, which aimed to address the security and privacy concerns of RFID tag’s data in the cloud. In this paper, we showed that the Xie et al. protocol is vulnerable to reader impersonation attacks, location tracking and tag’s data privacy invasion. Hence, we proposed a new protocol that guarantees that the tag’s data in the cloud are anonymous, and cannot be compromised. Furthermore, the proposed protocol achieves mutual authentication between all the entities participating in a communication session, such as a cloud server, a reader and a tag. Finally, we analysed the proposed protocol informally, and formally using a privacy model and CasperFDR. The results indicate that the proposed protocol achieves data secrecy and authentication for RFID tags.	authentication protocol;cloud computing;communications protocol;computer data storage;entity;information privacy;man-in-the-middle attack;mutual authentication;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;server (computing);session (computer science);virtual private server;x image extension	Sarah Abughazalah;Konstantinos Markantonakis;Keith Mayes	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-17016-9_10	data authentication algorithm;otway–rees protocol;authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;protected extensible authentication protocol;ssliop;challenge-handshake authentication protocol	Security	-46.49450689894374	73.94422351632281	96034
5c9197667161ec2620c3f13fad01e9a28d320aa5	an efficient robust secret sharing scheme with optimal cheater resiliency		In this paper, we consider the problem of (t, δ) robust secret sharing secure against rushing adversary. We design a simple t-out-ofn secret sharing scheme, which can reconstruct the secret in presence of t cheating participants except with probability at most δ, provided t < n/2. The later condition on cheater resilience is optimal for the case of public reconstruction of the secret, on which we focus in this work. Our construction improves the share size of Cevallos et al. (EUROCRYPT2012) robust secret sharing scheme by applying the “authentication tag compression” technique devised by Carpentieri in 1995. Our improvement is by a constant factor that does not contradict the asymptotic near-optimality of the former scheme. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme has the smallest share size, among other efficient rushing (t, δ) robust secret sharing schemes with optimal cheater resilience.	adversary (cryptography);authentication;cyber resilience;shamir's secret sharing	Partha Sarathi Roy;Avishek Adhikari;Richen Xu;Kirill Morozov;Kouichi Sakurai	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-12060-7_4	proactive secret sharing	Crypto	-39.019921980134995	73.42763835197471	96085

Unfortunately, existing distributed proof protocols offer only limited support for protecting the confidentiality of sensitive facts, which limits their utility in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a distributed proof construction protocol in which the release of a fact's truth value can be made contingent upon facts managed by other principals in the system. We formally prove that our protocol can safely prove conjunctions of facts without leaking the truth values of individual facts, even in the face of colluding adversaries and fact release policies with cyclical dependencies. This facilitates the definition of context-sensitive release policies that enable the conditional use of sensitive facts in distributed proofs.	authorization;confidentiality;conjunctive query;context-sensitive grammar;context-sensitive help;contingency (philosophy);ubiquitous computing	Adam J.

More and more companies are offering integrated health and activity monitoring solutions for fitness trackers. Recently insurances are offering their customers better conditions for health and condition monitoring. However, the extensive sensitive information collected by tracking products and accessibility by third party service providers poses vital security and privacy challenges on the employed solutions. In this paper, we present our security analysis of a representative sample of current fitness tracking products on the market. In particular, we focus on malicious user setting that aims at injecting false data into the cloud-based services leading to erroneous data analytics. We show that none of these products can provide data integrity, authenticity and confidentiality.	accessibility;activity tracker;authorization;cloud computing;confidentiality;data integrity;digital signature;end-to-end encryption;fastest;fitness function;https;information sensitivity;malware;privacy;security hacker;server (computing);smart device;smartphone;spectral leakage;tracking system;type signature	Hossein Fereidooni;Tommaso Frassetto;Markus Miettinen;Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi;Mauro Conti	2017	2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)		wearable technology;service provider;engineering;cloud computing;security analysis;internet privacy;confidentiality;information sensitivity;data integrity;fitness trackers;computer security	Security	-45.50084688896216	62.096855941195685	96239

However, the current standards mandate primitives that will be insecure in the presence of quantum computers. In this paper, we study how to eliminate these insecure primitives. We replace RSA-based digital signatures with a hash-based scheme. We show that this scheme can be implemented using reasonable amounts of space on the TPM.

A traitor should not be able to deny his responsibility of a copyright violation caused by him in such protocols. This feature is identified as non-repudiation in the literature. An efficient approach taken is through secure embedding of watermarks in an encrypted domain by using dither modulation and homomorphic encryption. To support non-repudiation along with collusion resistance, one needs an asymmetric collusion resistant fingerprinting code that is compatible with the watermarking technique. The design of such codes has not yet studied thoroughly with an exception of a recent work by Charpentier et. al. in [4].  In this paper, we propose an asymmetric binary fingerprinting code based on Boneh-Shaw code. When applied to the secure embedding of watermarks, we show that our code outperforms the code introduced by [4]: (i) we achieve constant communication round, (ii) we do not require any oblivious transfer protocol and (iii) we do not require any public Write Once Read Many (WORM) directory.	code;digital watermarking;directory (computing);dither;e-commerce;fingerprint (computing);homomorphic encryption;modulation;non-repudiation;oblivious transfer;watermark (data file)	Serdar Pehlivanoglu	2013		10.1145/2482513.2482525	non-repudiation;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-44.032350022884714	71.56691642689043	96329

Without privacy, voters can be forced to vote in specific ways, and the forcing party can check their compliance. But offering privacy does not suffice: if a voter can reduce her privacy, an attacker can force her to do so. In this paper, we distinguish various ways that a voter can communicate with the intruder to reduce her privacy and classify them according to their ability to reduce the privacy of a voter. We develop a framework combining knowledge reasoning and trace equivalences to formally model voting protocols and define voter-controlled privacy. Our framework is quantitative, in the sense that it defines a measure for the privacy of a voter. Therefore, the framework can precisely measure the level of privacy for a voter for each of the identified privacy-reduction classes. The quantification allows our framework to capture receipts that reduce, but not nullify, the privacy of the voter.	privacy	Hugo L. Jonker;Sjouke Mauw;Jun Pang	2009	J.

We introduce two new efficient protocols for securely outsourcing pairing computations to an untrusted helper. The first generic scheme is proven computationally secure (and can be proven statistically secure at the expense of worse performance). It allows various communication-efficiency trade-offs. The second specific scheme – for optimal Ate pairing on a Barreto-Naehrig curve – is unconditionally secure, and do not rely on any hardness assumptions. Both protocols are more efficient than the actual computation of the pairing by the restricted device and in particular they are more efficient than all previous proposals.	algorithm;computation;cryptography;outsourcing	Aurore Guillevic;Damien Vergnaud	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-16763-3_12	computer science;secure two-party computation;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;public-key cryptography;computer security	Crypto	-39.995774374594895	70.93387661235508	96554
6b8a783dbb036ca9b83f1357ecfc96cadee47c36	a privacy preserving framework for big data in e-government environments		Big data is widely considered as the next big trend in e-Government environments but at the same time one of the most emerging and critical issues due to the challenges it imposes. The large amount of data being retained by governmental Service Providers that can be (potentially) exploited during Data Mining and analytics processes, include personal data and personally identifi- able information, raising privacy concerns, mostly regarding data minimization and purpose limitation. This paper addresses the consideration of Central Government to aggregate information without revealing personal identifiers of individuals and proposes a privacy preserving methodology that can be easily incorporated into already deployed electronic services and e-Government frameworks through the adoption of scalable and adaptable salted hashing techniques.	big data;e-government	Prokopios Drogkaris;Aristomenis Gritzalis	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22906-5_16	data mining;internet privacy;computer security	ML	-42.78183507656569	61.393810887248605	96596

It is intended to produce secure communications, even if every message can be read by, or originate with, every principal. This paper gives a definitional HOL formalization of a belief logic based on the full Gong, Needham, and Yahalom [2] logic for analyzing whether protocols achieve desired communication conditions. This gives the belief logic a sound formal basis.

A new generation of networked devices has appeared, which take advantage of the enhanced technology and improved performance of connection media and protocols. Among these, it is worth mentioning Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and latest generation Cellular Phones, which provide a whole variety of improved computation features. In this new scenario, the design and implementation of effective security features has become key. In this paper, we present a research project conducted cooperatively by a University Department - namely the Dipartimento di Informatica ed Applicazioni “Renato M. Capocelli” of the University of Salerno - and a company - namely “FutureHouse s.r.l”. The objective of the project was the design and the implementation of a portable smart card reader, named iToken, that communicates with the host computer by means of a wireless channel. Preliminary experimental results provide evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed solution.	card reader;computation;host (network);internet;mobile device;mobile phone;personal digital assistant;smart card	Giuseppe Cattaneo;Luigi Catuogno;Fabio Petagna;G.

The framework of splitting the public key in the PKI is presented in this paper. Aimed to enhance the security level from both the perspectives of certificate issuing and certificate revocation, the framework splits the public key into multiple parts, and generates a certificate for each part. The framework is designed to be flexible to allow various levels of security depending on the requirements, while minimising changes to the existing e-commerce system and PKI. The key-split system maintains CA independence and allows for either smaller certificates or the size of key to be increased.	access control;authentication;certificate authority;confidentiality;e-commerce;entity;non-repudiation;public key certificate;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;requirement	Salvatore Cristiano;Fei Liu	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on e-Technology, e-Commerce and e-Service	10.1109/EEE.2005.96	web of trust;certificate policy;implicit certificate;key exchange;self-signed certificate;certificate signing request;public key infrastructure;x.509;revocation list;certificate server;authorization certificate;public key certificate;business;internet privacy;root certificate;online certificate status protocol;world wide web;key distribution;computer security;certificate authority;certification practice statement	Mobile	-44.77673512801045	69.82362401186934	97044

The most attractive solution to this problem is the digital signature which is analogous to the handwritten signature. The signature is formed by taking the hash of the message and encrypting the message with the creatorpsilas private key. It guarantees the source and integrity of the message. Then a suitable digital signature algorithm will be picked out as a result of comparing and analyzing three main digital signature algorithms in this paper. Finally, a scheme of digital signature in electronic government will be proposed in order to settle some specific problems such as spilling out secret, forging or denial and so on. Besides, a brief analysis regarding security will be given for this scheme.	algorithm;authentication;digital signature;e-government;encryption;public-key cryptography	Zhu Na;Xiao Guo Xi	2008	2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering	10.1109/CSSE.2008.929	electronic signature;digital signature;computer science;information security;digital signature algorithm;internet privacy;group signature;blind signature;schnorr signature;world wide web;computer security	Security	-43.09062806102758	73.20184210936924	97213

It appears important to define authorization provenance to (1) analyze policy bases, (2) defend against a class of attacks, and (3) audit authorizations. In this paper, we study a notion of authorization provenance, based on a recently proposed logic in the literature. By examining a collection of properties, we show this definition captures the intuitions of authorization provenance. We also present an application of our notion of authorization provenance: specifying and enforcing a new type of security requirements.	attack (computing);authorization;requirement	Jinwei Hu;Khaled M.

7860db7667cdb0e8110bea3d8db3234b4978da63	royale: a framework for universally composable card games with financial rewards and penalties enforcement		While many tailor made card game protocols are known, the vast majority of those suffer from three main issues: lack of mechanisms for distributing financial rewards and punishing cheaters, lack of composability guarantees and little flexibility, focusing on the specific game of poker. Even though folklore holds that poker protocols can be used to play any card game, this conjecture remains unproven and, in fact, does not hold for a number of protocols (including recent results). We both tackle the problem of constructing protocols for general card games and initiate a treatment of such protocols in the Universal Composability (UC) framework, introducing an ideal functionality that captures general card games constructed from a set of core card operations. Based on this formalism, we introduce Royale, the first universally composable protocol for securely playing general card games with financial rewards/penalties enforcement. We remark that Royale also yields the first universally composable poker protocol. Interestingly, such an instantiation of a poker game based on Royale performs better than most previous works without composability guarantees, which we highlight through a detailed concrete complexity analysis and benchmarks obtained from a prototype implementation.	analysis of algorithms;prototype;semantics (computer science);uc browser;universal composability;universal instantiation	Bernardo Machado David;Rafael Dowsley;Mario Larangeira	2018	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Crypto	-38.76372083197942	71.89829595790752	97225

Only t signers can examine and sign an over-large message on behalf of the whole group, by dividing the whole message into a few readable sub-message blocks; then, each signer needs only to examine and sign the designated sub-message block rather than the whole message. Consequently, the load on the signer should be substantially reduced to improve the performance. Moreover, the proposed scheme is based on the elliptic curve cryptosystem, because of its highly efficient performance and comprehensiveness of security, supporting the practical use of the scheme.	ampersand;authenticated encryption;authentication;cryptosystem;elliptic curve cryptography;human-readable medium;linkage (software)	Tzer-Shyong Chen;Kuo-Hsuan Huang;Yu-Fang Chung	2004		10.1109/EEE.2004.1287295	plaintext-aware encryption;elliptic curve digital signature algorithm;threshold cryptosystem;signcryption;mathematics;distributed computing;elliptic curve cryptography;internet privacy;deterministic encryption;computer security;encryption	Crypto	-42.8593242062674	73.04080775829937	97226

However, seamless and secure handover is one of the most challenging issues. Taking as reference our previous work, this paper presents a privacy-preserving fast handover authentication scheme based on pseudonym for IEEE 802.16m network. Since Mobile Station (MS) only provides a pseudonym in the initial authentication phase and changes its pseudonym in each handover authentication phase, this can protect the MS's identity privacy and allow MS to be untraceable. Moreover, each pseudonym is corresponding to a credential ticket generated by the previous service Base Station (BS) using a multi-BS group key, thus MS and the target BS can easily accomplish mutual authentication. In addition, our theoretical analysis and simulation indicate that our scheme outperforms previously reported schemes in terms of computation and communication overhead.	authentication	Anmin Fu;Yuqing Zhang;Zhenchao Zhu;Qi Jing;Jingyu Feng	2012	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2012.06.008	wimax;computer science;handover;authentication protocol;authentication;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;computer network	Vision	-47.79265248030852	73.42928242147208	97572

Since health data contain sensitive information of patients, there have been much research that present privacy preserving mechanisms. However, existing studies either require a patient to perform various steps to secure the data or restrict the patient to exerting control over the data. In this paper, we propose patient-controlled attribute-based encryption, which enables a patient (a data owner) to control access to the health data and reduces the operational burden for the patient, simultaneously. With our method, the patient has powerful control capability of his/her own health data in that he/she has the final say on the access with time limitation. In addition, our scheme provides emergency medical services which allow the emergency staffs to access the health data without the patient’s permission only in the case of emergencies. We prove that our scheme is secure under cryptographic assumptions and analyze its efficiency from the patient’s perspective.	attribute-based encryption;cryptography;electronic health records;emergencies [disease/finding];emergency medical service;information sensitivity;patients	Jieun Eom;Dong Hoon Lee;Kwangsu Lee	2016	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-016-0621-3	masking;medicine;cloud computing;information privacy;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-43.64864163250746	63.87857622814452	97923

c5a661906f54e1c01d54c1e7782c9efa1da32c50	an efficient data aggregation scheme for privacy-friendly dynamic pricing-based billing and demand-response management in smart grids		Smart grids take advantage of information and communication technologies to achieve energy efficiency, automation, and reliability. These systems allow two-way communications and power flow between the grid and consumers. However, these bidirectional communications introduce several security and privacy threats to consumers. One of the open challenges in this context is user privacy when smart meters (SMs) are used to capture fine-grained energy usage information. Although considerable research has been carried out in this direction, most of the existing solutions invariably introduce computational complexity and overhead, which makes them infeasible for resource constrained SMs. In this paper, we propose a privacy-friendly and efficient data aggregation scheme for dynamic pricing-based billing and demand-response management in smart grids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to address privacy in the context of billing under dynamic electricity pricing. Security and performance analyses show that the proposed scheme offers better privacy protection for electric meter reading aggregation and computational efficiency, as compared to existing schemes.	authentication;computation;computational complexity theory;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;data aggregation;data integrity;electronic billing;information privacy;overhead (computing);privacy;requirement;smart tv;smart meter;symmetric-key algorithm	Prosanta Gope;Biplab Sikdar	2018	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2018.2833863	distributed computing;grid;computer network;electricity meter;smart grid;computer science;data aggregator;dynamic pricing;demand response;electricity pricing;information and communications technology	Security	-44.894949298589374	66.5496102494858	98020

In 2010, Sood et al. and Song independently examined a smart card based authentication scheme proposed by Xu et al. They showed that in Xu et al.'s scheme an internal user of the system could turn hostile to impersonate other users of the system. Sood et al. and Song also proposed schemes in order to improve scheme proposed by Xu et al.'s. Recently, Chen et al. identified some security problems in the improvements proposed by Sood et al. and Song. To fix these problems Chen et al. presented another scheme, which they claimed to provide mutual authentication and withstand, lost smart card attack. Undoubtedly, in their scheme user can also verify the legitimacy of server but we find that the scheme fails to resist impersonation attacks and privileged insider attack. We also show that the scheme does not provide user anonymity and confidentiality to air messages. In addition, an attacker can guess a user's password from his lost/stolen smart card.	authorization;confidentiality;cryptanalysis;entity–relationship model;mutual authentication;password;server (computing);smart card	Saru Kumari;Fahad Bin Muhaya;Muhammad Khurram Khan;Rajiv Kumar	2013	2013 International Symposium on Biometrics and Security Technologies	10.1109/ISBAST.2013.43	challenge–response authentication;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-45.047847523294756	73.6318573040203	98198

These payments are called micropayments and they provide a trade-off between efficiency and security requirements to pay low-value items. It is usual to assume low value fraud to achieve efficiency in micropayment systems. In this paper the authors present an improved version of an efficient and secure micropayment scheme which fulfils the security properties that guarantee no financial risk for merchants and the privacy of the customers. In addition, the proposed system defines a fair exchange between the coin and the desired good or service. In this fair exchange, the anonymity and untraceability of the customers are assured. Moreover, customers can request a refund whether they are no more interested on the services offered by merchants. As a novelty, an improvement of the scheme avoids customers to fraudulently use a refund operation to gain a little amount of money (called coupon). Thus, a new resolution subprotocol allows the merchant to avoid the loss of any single coupon.

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. micropayments can easily be applied to the intangible selling of goods such as information (newspapers, product reviews, location-based services, etc.), virtual gifts or electronic data (music, videos, etc). All of these examples involve low-value transactions, so the operational cost has to be as low as possible in order to be profitable for merchants and customers. On one hand, security properties are a primary concern for the development of micropayment systems to avoid financial risks for merchants and also to ensure privacy for customers. On the other hand, efficiency and the cost for individual transactions are critical factors for the development of these systems. However, efficiency and security are usually opposed, so micropayments must provide a trade-off between these requirements: • Contribution. In Isern-Deyà et al. (2011) we proposed a novel, efficient and secure micropayment scheme to pay low value items assuring privacy for customers. In this paper we propose an improved version of the protocol. The system uses anonymous and untraceable coins which are used in a fair exchange between customers and merchants to pay the desired good or service. The system detects and avoids double-spending and overspending, protects from forgeability and moreover allows customers to request a secure refund for partially used or unused coins. Moreover, now the customers cannot use the refund subprotocol to fraudulently refund a single spent coupon. We have added a new resolution subprotocol that allows the merchant to deposit the received coupons even when the customers are trying to cheat, avoiding the loss of money, including very small amounts; • Organization. The work is organized as follows. First we briefly describe the features and security requirements of micropayments. Next section surveys the related work. Following section summarizes the cryptographic background used in our scheme. Then we define the micropayment protocol. In the following section we present a security overview of the protocol. Finally, the work includes the conclusions and future works. MICROPAYMENTS SCHEMES OVERVIEW In this section we list the involved parties and the common protocols in the micropayment model (Papaefstathiou et al., 2004; Poutanen et al., 1998; Schmidt et al., 1999). Moreover, we also enumerate and define the security requirements and functional features of an ideal micropayment system (Lipton et al., 1998; Papaefstathiou et al., 2004; Poutanen et al., 1998; Schmidt et al., 1999). Involved Parties and Common Protocols The typical involved parties in a micropayment scheme are: • Customer. The party who wants to buy a good or service; • Merchant. The party who wants to sell a good or service; • Broker or Bank. The party who issues coins and manages payment accounts. So, the common model consists of a customer who withdraws a coin from his broker account (withdrawal or issuing procedure) in order to purchase (payment, spend or transaction procedure) a good or electronic service (henceforth service) offered by a merchant. Finally, the merchant can request a deposit (refund procedure) in his broker account in exchange of a received coin from customer. Security Requirements An ideal micropayment system should accomplish a list of security requirements and functional features which are depicted below (Poutanen et al., 1998; Schmidt et al., 1999): 16 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/anonymous-fair-micropaymentscheme-protection/77632?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology.

For this reason a node will always have the same Interface ID (IID) whenever it connects to a new network. Because the node's IP address does not change, the node will be vulnerable to privacy related attacks. Currently this problem is addressed by the use of two mechanisms that do not use MAC addresses or other unique values for randomizing the IID during its generation: Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) (RFC 3972) and Privacy Extension (RFC 4941). The problem with the former approach is the computational cost involved in the IID generation and, more importantly, the verification process. The problem with the latter approach is the lack of necessary security mechanisms and that it provides the node with only partial protection against privacy related attacks. This document proposes the use of a new algorithm in the generation of the IID to reduce computational cost while, at the same time, securing the node against some types of attack, like IP spoofing. These attacks are prevented by the addition of a signature to messages sent over the network and by direct use of a public key in the IP address.	addressing scheme;algorithmic efficiency;auto-configuration;computation;cryptographically generated address;ip address spoofing;mac address;microsoft sql server analysis services (ssas);organizationally unique identifier;privacy;public-key cryptography;randomized algorithm;resource public key infrastructure;time complexity	Hosnieh Rafiee;Christoph Meinel	2013	2013 Eleventh Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust	10.1109/PST.2013.6596063	information privacy;computer science;network security;ipv6;unique local address;cryptographic protocol;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;dynamic host configuration protocol;computer security;private network;computer network;ipv6 address	Security	-47.35164646677785	71.23875914914282	98549

Unfortunately, it suffers from a security flaw when combined with smart cards. In particular, temporary access to a user’s card enables an adversary to impersonate that user for an indefinite period of time, even after the adversary’s access to the card is revoked. In this paper, we extend Shoup’s key exchange security model to the smart card setting and examine PKINIT in this model. Using this formalization, we show that PKINIT is indeed flawed, propose a fix, and provide a proof that this fix leads to a secure protocol.	active directory;adversary (cryptography);authentication;cryptographic nonce;flaw hypothesis methodology;kerberos;key exchange;microsoft windows;public-key cryptography;smart card	Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos;Andreas Pashalidis;Bart Preneel	2013	International Journal of Information Security	10.1007/s10207-013-0213-x	smart card;kerberos;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-44.711786596993214	74.14247007861009	98750

While similar purposes have already been sought in the literature, the approaches proposed so far have been evaluated in terms of recognition performance under the unrealistic assumption of ideal statistical distributions for the considered biometric data. Conversely, in this paper, we investigate the applicability of the proposed framework to practical scenarios while managing a trade-off between privacy and recognition performance. This goal has been achieved by introducing a class of transformation functions enforcing zero-leakage secrecy, by designing an adaptive strategy for embedding the secret key bits into the selected features, and by developing a system parameters optimization strategy with respect to security, recognition performance, and privacy. Experimental tests conducted on real fingerprint data prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	biometrics;coefficient;cryptosystem;embedded system;emoticon;fingerprint;information leakage;information-theoretic security;key (cryptography);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;privacy;quantization (signal processing);randomness;spectral leakage	Gabriel Emile Hine;Emanuele Maiorana;Patrizio Campisi	2017	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2017.2686005	secrecy;computer science;pattern recognition;fuzzy logic;artificial intelligence;feature extraction;cryptosystem;theoretical computer science;cryptography;data mining;embedding;information privacy;biometrics	Vision	-37.551493407970156	69.8952676278637	98775
b245a17464d551b62c9912fd0178113722e42a2a	a survey on attribute-based encryption schemes of access control in cloud environments		In Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) scheme, attributes play a very important role. Attributes have been exploited to generate a public key for encrypting data and have been used as an access policy to control users’ access. The access policy can be categorized as either key-policy or ciphertext-policy. The key-policy is the access structure on the user’s private key, and the ciphertext-policy is the access structure on the ciphertext. And the access structure can also be categorized as either monotonic or non-monotonic one. Using ABE schemes can have the advantages: (1) to reduce the communication overhead of the Internet, and (2) to provide a fine-grained access control. In this paper, we survey a basic attribute-based encryption scheme, two various access policy attributebased encryption schemes, and two various access structures, which are analyzed for cloud environments. Finally, we list the comparisons of these schemes by some criteria for cloud environments.	access control;access structure;attribute-based encryption;authorization;categorization;ciphertext;cloud computing;internet;key (cryptography);oddworld: new 'n' tasty!;overhead (computing);pixel;policy-based design;polynomial;proxy re-encryption;public-key cryptography	Cheng-Chi Lee;Pei-Shan Chung;Min-Shiang Hwang	2013	I.

Moreover, they collaborate in order to provide cross-organizational identity-based services, giving an added value to their traditional services. This poses new challenges regarding identity management between domains. An option to overcome them is to integrate an identity-federation platform with that type of services, but it is a very complex task. In this paper we propose to extend the capabilities of an open source application server in order to make it compatible with an identity-federation platform as a basis to support cross-organizational identity-based services, reducing dramatically the integration tax.	application server;channel (communications);federated identity;identity management;internet;open-source software;presence information;server (computing)	Antonio Manuel Fernandez Villamor;Juan Carlos Yelmo Garcia	2008	2008 12th Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops	10.1109/EDOCW.2008.50	e-commerce;the internet;computer science;organization;information security;authentication;database;services computing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;identity management;server	DB	-47.0183994629997	64.59171528223945	98996

Due to electronization of health information, medical access control attracts lots of attention in the research community. The existing medical access control approaches mainly focus on doctors' roles and behaviors, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and risk-based access control. However, various therapeutic regimens can also lead to unauthorized access. The current researches do not consider access control authorization in terms of therapeutic regimens. In this work, we present an access control model based on therapeutic regimen. Our model, TRAC, proposes an access strategy by analyzing feasibility of therapeutic regimens. Our experiments show the effectiveness of TRAC in terms of precision. Moreover, our model also contributes to choosing better therapeutic regimens for patients.	algorithm;authorization;computer access control;experiment;privacy;role-based access control;trac	Hongcan Gao;Yanfeng Wu;Sihan Xu;Chenkai Guo;Xiaolei Hou;Jing Xu	2018	2018 IEEE 42nd Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.10263	computer security;access control;systems engineering;health care;authorization;role-based access control;computer science;regimen;trac	Security	-44.27100221392297	63.65953651322142	99003

The practice of publishing social network data has brought privacy concerns to the front. Serious concerns on privacy protection in social networks have been raised in recent years. Realization of the promise of social networks data requires addressing these concerns. This paper considers the privacy disclosure in social network data publishing. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the various risks to privacy in publishing of social network data. We identify various attacks that can be used to reveal private information from social network data. This information is useful for developing practical countermeasures against the privacy attacks.	application domain;countermeasure (computer);full disclosure (computer security);personally identifiable information;privacy;social network	Mohd Izuan Hafez Ninggal;Jemal H.

These applications are reliable only after a successful authentication of communication entities. Hence, the third generation partnership project has recommended the handover schemes for different mobility scenarios with a new key management approach that increases the complexity of the overall system. To overcome the above problems, researchers have proposed various handover authentication protocols. But, most of the handover protocols can’t avoid the key escrow problem and suffers from key forward/backward secrecy. Also, these protocols are vulnerable to various malicious attacks and incur high computational overhead during the authentication process. Therefore, these protocols don’t suit for handover authentication in LTE/LTE-A networks. However, researchers have proposed the proxy signature based handover protocols but, these protocols fail to achieve an adequate solution for proxy revocation and necessary security demands. In order to mitigate the aforesaid problems, we propose a proxy signature based efficient and robust handover authentication and key agreement protocol with revocation in LTE/LTE-A network. To prove the correctness of the proposed protocol, the formal analysis is carried out by BAN logic and simulated using the AVISPA tool. Moreover, the security analysis illustrates that the proposed protocol fulfills all the security features and avoids the identified attacks. Finally, the performance analysis of the proposed protocol is shown with existing handover protocols. The analysis shows that the protocol has improved results in terms of transmission, storage, message and computation overhead.	compaq lte	Shubham Gupta;Balu L. Parne;Narendra S.

To explain the implications for scalability, we have implemented a trust model for smart contracts, described as agents in an open multi-agent system. Agent intentions are not necessarily known and autonomous agents have to be able to make decisions under risk. The ramifications of these general conditions for scalability are analysed for Ethereum and then generalised to other current and future platforms. Finally, mechanisms from the trust model are applied to a verifiable computation algorithm and implemented in the Ethereum blockchain. We show in experiments that the algorithm needs at most six semi-honest verifiers to detect false submission.	algorithm;arbiter (electronics);autonomous robot;computation;context of computational complexity;control system;dspace;entity;ethereum;formal verification;multi-agent system;nash equilibrium;rational agent;requirement;scalability;smart contract;solidity;solver;time complexity;utility	Dominik Harz;Magnus Boman	2018	CoRR		autonomous agent;computer science;computer security;verifiable secret sharing;smart contract;computation;scalability;blockchain;multi-agent system;limiting	AI	-39.158075079399964	71.40453404179807	100093

Cloud storage auditing, as one important security service, is used to check the integrity of the cloud data stored in cloud for users. However, the burden for users to generate authenticators is very huge before cloud data are outsourced to cloud in public cloud storage auditing. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a public cloud storage auditing scheme with lightweight authenticator generation. We design a new framework of public cloud storage auditing, in which an Authenticators Generation Center (AGC) is in charge of generating authenticators for users. In our proposed scheme, the AGC does not know the real cloud data of users because it only generates the authenticators for blinded cloud data. To reduce the computation burden at user side, the cloud can verify whether the authenticators generated by the AGC are correct or not. As a result, the users only consume very little computation for public authenticator generation and verification. The security analysis and the performance analysis show the proposed scheme is secure and efficient.	automatic gain control;cloud computing;cloud storage;computation;correctness (computer science);security service (telecommunication)	Wenting Shen;Jia Yu;Rong Hao;Xu An Wang	2015	2015 10th International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing (3PGCIC)	10.1109/3PGCIC.2015.47	cloud computing security;cloud computing;computer science;cloud testing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	HPC	-41.780828629203775	67.86732327730972	100230

To satisfy various requirements and integrate important features of existent standards, EPCglobal (2013/11) announced the new Gen2 standard called EPC Class 2 Generation 2 version 2. Even though inheriting the name Gen2, Generation 2 version 2 goes far beyond the features and functions of Generation 2 version 1. Generation 2 version 2 is a super set of several existent radio-frequency identification standards. It opens up great opportunities of novel radio-frequency identification applications that could not be implemented using conventional radio-frequency identification standards and products. In this article, we introduce the new standards and propose one new mutual authentication scheme which protects tags’ identifications. This scheme is the first radio-frequency identification authentication that could protect tags from unauthorized tracing and unauthorized identification using coming standard-based products. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme owns better performance than their counterparts in the multi-tag setting.	authentication;electronic product code	Hung-Yu Chien	2017	IJDSN	10.1177/1550147717697321	telecommunications;internet privacy;computer security	Crypto	-45.972851504753294	72.11798741647559	100239

An efficient key management is necessary for a long term implementation of PKI. As a part of key management, key pair of all the entities within the PKI system is updated regularly to minimize overuse of keys and to comply with the organization's policies. In a hierarchical PKI system, root Certificate Authority (CA) is the highest trust anchor and hence updating its key pair is a challenging task. It requires proper authentication of certificate issuing entities to its subordinates and storage of keys for future reference. This paper discusses the various mechanisms available for updating root CA key pairs and brings out pros and cons in each. Considering the shortcomings of these methods, a new method for key pair update has been proposed, which is less complex and easy to implement. In addition, some of the open-source tools available to implement these techniques and open challenges which need to be addressed to have been highlighted.	authentication;certificate authority;entity;key management;non-repudiation;open-source software;public key certificate;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;root certificate;scalability;trust anchor	V.

Our results imply almost tight lower bounds on the accuracy of such data analyses, both for specific natural functions (such as Hamming distance) and in general. Our bounds expose a sharp contrast between the two-party setting and the simpler client-server setting (where privacy guarantees are one-sided). In addition, those bounds demonstrate a dramatic gap between the accuracy that can be obtained by differentially private data analysis versus the accuracy obtainable when privacy is relaxed to a computational variant of differential privacy. The first proof technique we develop demonstrates a connection between differential privacy and deterministic extraction from Santha-Vazirani sources. A second connection we expose indicates that the ability to approximate a function by a low-error differentially private protocol is strongly related to the ability to approximate it by a low communication protocol.

However, there are few consideration and discussion on network expansibility in the existing quantum secret sharing schemes. We propose an expansible quantum secret sharing scheme with relatively simple and economical quantum resources and show how to split and reconstruct the quantum secret among an expansible user group in our scheme. Its trait, no requirement of any agent's assistant during the process of member expansion, can help to prevent potential menaces of insider cheating.

Conventional user authentication protocols are suited to solve the privacy and security problems for the single client/server architecture environment. However, the use of computer networks and information technology has grown spectacularly. More and more network architectures are used in multi-server environments. Recently, several authentication schemes for multi-server environments have been proposed. However, the performance of these schemes is not suitable for applications. To improve the performance, we propose a new ID-based mutual authentication protocols for multi-server environment without bilinear pairings. We also show that the proposed scheme is provable secure in the random oracle model.

5d636fa938ed14f0d5770438164b1767f4311966	a practical privacy-preserving recommender system	data privacy;recommender systems;homomorphic encryption	The main goal of a personalized recommender system is to provide useful recommendations on various items to the users. In order to generate recommendations, the service needs to access various types of user data such as previous product purchasing history, demographic and biographical information. However, users are sensitive to disclosure of personal information as it can be easily misused by malicious third parties. Consequently, there are unavoidable security concerns which will become known through attempted unauthorized access while providing the recommendation services. In order to protect against breaches of personal information, it is necessary to obfuscate the user information by means of an efficient encryption technique while simultaneously generating the recommendation by making true information inaccessible to the system. To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving recommender system using homomorphic encryption, by which the system can provide recommendations without knowing the actual ratings. Our approach is based on the ElGamal cryptosystem by which both addition and multiplication of plaintexts can be performed. The performance of the proposed scheme shows significantly high accuracy in-terms of computation and communication costs as well as outperforming other existing solutions.	authorization;computation;cryptosystem;homomorphic encryption;malware;personalization;personally identifiable information;plaintext;purchasing;recommender system	Shahriar Badsha;Xun Yi;Ibrahim Khalil	2016	Data Science and Engineering	10.1007/s41019-016-0020-2	homomorphic encryption;information privacy;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-41.11661886764804	64.51644288023682	101009

Although RDF can be used as a representation format for integrated data, enterprises have been slow to adopt this technology. One of the primary inhibitors to its widespread adoption in industry is the lack of fine grained access control enforcement mechanisms available for RDF. In this paper, we provide a summary of access control requirements based on our analysis of existing access control models and enforcement mechanisms. We subsequently: (i) propose a set of access control rules that can be used to provide support for these models over RDF data; (ii) detail a framework that enforces access control restrictions over RDF data; and (iii) evaluate our implementation of the framework over real-world enterprise data.	access control;benchmark (computing);credential;data (computing);data model;digital recording;information privacy;performance evaluation;prototype;requirement;resource description framework;sparql;scalability;self-documenting code;software deployment;world wide web	Sabrina Kirrane;Nuno Lopes;Alessandra Mileo;Stefan Decker	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-37996-3_6	computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	Web+IR	-42.11526330657622	60.7274780061436	101205

Yang et al. 2010 showed that several popular data mining algorithms can be reduced to three basic operations, secure implementation of which -- termed Secure Product of Summations (SPoS), Secure Ratios of Summations (SRoS), and Secure Comparison of Summations (SCoS) -- would lead to privacy-preserving data mining solutions. The authors showed that prior privacy-preserving data mining solutions are unsatisfactory in presence of participants' collusion and they gave new implementation of these operations that were designed to sustain the collusion. In this work, we show that unfortunately the protocols of Yang et al. leak a significant amount of private information and are not secure even if no collusion takes place. We then show how these operations can be securely and efficiently realized in the same and stronger security models, which leads to fully secure solutions for many data mining algorithms.	algorithm;computation;data mining;information privacy;memory leak;personally identifiable information;yang	Marina Blanton	2011	2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Social Computing	10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.12	data model;computer science;data mining;database;secure multi-party computation;world wide web;distributed database;computer security	Security	-39.831831021045545	64.64665859474391	101295

Previous research assumes that the environment is total, that is, it must always be ready to feed new inputs into programs. However, programs secure under this assumption can leak the presence of input. Such leaks can be magnified to whole-secret leaks in the concurrent setting. We propose a framework that generalizes previous research along two dimensions: first, the framework breaks away from the totality of the environment and, second, the framework features fine-grained security types for communication channels, where we distinguish between the security level of message presence and message content. We show that the generalized framework features appealing compositionality properties: parallel composition of secure program results in a secure thread pool. We also show that modeling environments as strategies leads to strong compositionality: various types of composition (with and without scoping) follow from our general compositionality result. Further, we propose a type system that supports enforcement of security via fine-grained security types.	approximation;nondeterministic algorithm;scope (computer science);thread pool;type system	Willard Rafnsson;Daniel Hedin;Andrei Sabelfeld	2012	2012 IEEE 25th Computer Security Foundations Symposium	10.1109/CSF.2012.15	nickel;labeling theory;information flow;computer science;information security;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;programming language;computational model;computer security;algorithm	Logic	-35.07296127189835	70.77504384595784	101352

This paper evaluates the authentication delay introduced by EAP-enabled WLAN Access Points (AP) when used from indoor and outdoor environments. Experiments were performed on a wireless testbed in which a user connects to an AP under static and mobile conditions. The parameters considered are authentication time, reauthentication time, packet loss during reauthentication and the time taken by 4-way handshake at various speeds of mobile node. The results show that the largest delay is introduced by the most secure authentication protocols called tunneled authentication protocols. It was also observed that the mobility of the mobile node increases the authentication delay and the time taken by the 4-way handshake.	handshaking;md5;ms-chap;network packet;protected extensible authentication protocol;quality of service;stationary process;testbed;transport layer security;uncompressed video;velocity (software development)	Suhail Ahmad;Ajaz Hussain Mir;Ghulam Rasool Beigh	2011	2011 Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Telecommunication Systems and Networks (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2011.6163654	computer science;authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;internet privacy;computer security;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;computer network	Mobile	-48.167293127477244	73.33991964311272	101478
979451936129b1d3db4046cbeddbe457c940038e	using online services in untrusted environments: a privacy preserving architecture		While online service providers are sometimes accused of forwarding identifying customer information as name and address to untrusted third parties, comparatively little attention is paid to the input data that customers provide explicitly to the service. If the input data is sensitive but the service provider is not completely trustworthy, this constitutes a serious privacy problem. From a privacy-defending point of view, the most desirable situation would be for the service not to require any kind of sensitive information at any time, while still yielding useful results for the customer. This paper presents a service architecture that allows for the use of a restricted number of services without requiring the transmission of unencrypted customer data to the service provider. The supported services include the execution of basic database and arithmetic operations that can be combined in numerous useful ways. The basic idea of this architecture is to transform sensitive data on the client side before transferring it to the service provider. The latter processes the transformed data without being able to draw any further conclusions from it. The pseudo-result obtained is returned to the customer who applies a special retransformation to obtain the actual result.	client-side;database;information sensitivity;online service provider;plaintext;point of view (computer hardware company);privacy	Claus Boyens;Oliver Günther	2003			architecture;service delivery framework;service provider;privacy software;encryption;information privacy;information sensitivity;computer security;service-oriented architecture;computer science	DB	-41.5022526315961	65.50653184014695	101547
b14ddf3d5b2cb5edda5cf9cff382f0354f535f39	trust management xi		The concept of partial commitment is discussed in the context of personal privacy management in data science. Uncommitted, promiscuous or partially committed user’s data may either have a negative impact on model or data quality, or it may impose higher privacy compliance cost on data service providers. Many Big Data (BD) and Machine Learning (ML) scenarios involve the collection and processing of large volumes of person-related data. Data is gathered about many individuals as well as about many parameters in individuals. ML and BD both spend considerable resources on model building, learning, and data handling. It is therefore important to any BD/ML system that the input data trained and processed is of high quality, represents the use case, and is legally processes in the system. Additional cost is imposed by data protection regulation with transparency, revocation and correction rights for data subjects. Data subjects may, for several reasons, only partially accept a privacy policy, and chose to opt out, request data deletion or revoke their consent for data processing. This article discusses the concept of partial commitment and its possible applications from both the data subject and the data controller perspective in Big Data and Machine Learning.	aggregate function;antivirus software;big data;bilinear filtering;bitcoin;blu-ray;data quality;data science;digital signature;display resolution;electron;encryption;eurocrypt;future internet;hideki imai;information privacy;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;internet of things;lecture notes in computer science;machine learning;map;merkle tree;p (complexity);pkc (conference);pp (complexity);privacy policy;prototype;springer (tank);transparency (graphic);trust management (managerial science);trusted third party;verification and validation	Jan-Philipp Steghöfer;Babak Esfandiari;Kai Rannenberg	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59171-1		ML	-42.92971954238789	64.23279329143949	101657

However, there are lots of pirated editions of digital products and they have become more available and easier to obtain. Hence, proving who the legal owner of digital content has become an important issue. In this study, the authors want to preserve customer ownership; they propose an intact arbitration mechanism to solve the fairness transaction between the customer and the shop. The arbiter can make correct judgements without the customer’s and the shop’s private keys in the arbitration phase. In order to achieve the above objectives, the security of this protocol is based on three cryptographic techniques: the subliminal channel, one-way hash function and RSA cryptosystem. Our scheme not only protects a customer’s legal ownership of digital content, but also achieves fair transaction, customer anonymity, owner tracing of E-cash and payment security.	arbiter (electronics);cryptographic hash function;cryptosystem;digital recording;ecash;fairness measure;internet;one-way function;online and offline;public-key cryptography;purchasing;rsa (cryptosystem);subliminal channel	Chin-Ling Chen;Jyun-Jie Liao	2012	IET Information Security	10.1049/iet-ifs.2010.0228	the internet;hash function;computer science;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-44.172469011313794	71.47385970351793	101685

This protocol allows recasting of votes, which permits a change of mind by voters either during the time window over which polling is open or during a shorter period over which recasting is permitted [20]. The security of votes depends on multiple servers such that each vote is divided into partitions and these partitions are distributed among the servers, all of which need to be brought together to reconstruct the votes. Such a protocol has potential applications in bargaining and electronic commerce.	cryptography;data security;e-commerce;encryption;fairness measure;key (cryptography)	Abhishek Parakh;Subhash C.

Optimistic Fair Exchange (OFE) is an efficient solution to this problem, in which a semi-trusted third party named arbitrator is called in to resolve a dispute if there is one during an exchange between Alice and Bob. Recently, several extensions of OFE, such as Ambiguous OFE (AOFE) and Perfect AOFE (PAOFE), have been proposed to protect the privacy of the exchanging parties. These variants prevent any outsider including the arbitrator from telling which parties are involved in the exchange of signatures before the exchange completes. However, in PAOFE, AOFE, and all the current work on OFE, the arbitrator can always learn the signer's signature at (or before) the end of a resolution, which is undesirable in some important applications, for example, signing a contract between two parties which do not wish others to find out even when there is a dispute that needs a resolution by the arbitrator. In this work, we introduce a new notion called PrivacyPreserving Optimistic Fair Exchange (P2OFE), in which other than Alice and Bob, no one else, including the arbitrator, can collect any evidence about an exchange between them even after the resolution of a dispute. We formally define P2OFE and propose a security model. We also propose a concrete and efficient construction of P2OFE, and prove its security based on the Strong Diffie-Helllman and Decision Linear assumptions in the standard model.	alice and bob;ambiguous grammar;antivirus software;digital signature;electronic signature;malware;oracle machine;privacy;semiconductor industry;synchronous optical networking;trusted third party	Qiong Huang;Duncan S.

Since cloud providers may not be trusted, a crucial problem is the verification of the integrity and correctness of such computation, possibly in a public way, i.e., the result of a computation can be verified by any third party, and requires no secret key -- akin to a digital signature on a message. We present new protocols for publicly verifiable secure outsourcing of Evaluation of High Degree Polynomials and Matrix Multiplication. Compared to previously proposed solutions, ours improve in efficiency and offer security in a stronger model.

Yet deployment of these techniques has been slowed by the complexity of algorithms and an incomplete understanding of the cost to accuracy implied by the adoption of differential privacy. In this demonstration we present DPComp, a publicly-accessible web-based system, designed to support a broad community of users, including data analysts, privacy researchers, and data owners. Users can use DPComp to assess the accuracy of state-of-the-art privacy algorithms and interactively explore algorithm output in order to understand, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the error introduced by the algorithms. In addition, users can contribute new algorithms and new (non-sensitive) datasets. DPComp automatically incorporates user contributions into an evolving benchmark based on a rigorous evaluation methodology articulated by Hay et al.

REST alone and in combination with XML is fast gaining momentum in a diverse set of web applications. REST is stateless, as is HTTP on which it is built. For many applications, this not enough, especially in the context of concurrent access and the increasing need for auditing and accountability. We present a lightweight mechanism which allows the application to control the integrity of the underlying resources in a simple, yet flexible manner. Based on an opportunistic locking approach, we show in this paper that XML does not only act as an extensible and direct accessible backend that ensures easy modifications due to the allocation of nodes, but also gives scalable possibilities to perform on-the-fly integrity verification based on the tree structure.	basex;checksum;computation;concurrency control;data access;data integrity;distributed computing;hash function;hypertext transfer protocol;locality-sensitive hashing;lock (computer science);overhead (computing);representational state transfer;scalability;server message block;software versioning;stateless protocol;tree structure;web application;xml;xml resource	Sebastian Graf;Lukas Lewandowski;Marcel Waldvogel	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16385-2_23	real-time computing;computer science;data mining;database;tree structure;programming language;world wide web	OS	-41.91837741801093	60.59761344479034	102533

1ba49248a7178b7a16a945fcb232effaf2411ef7	a query integrity assurance scheme for accessing outsourced spatial databases	outsourcing;spatial databases;query integrity;privacy	With the trend of cloud computing, outsourcing databases to third party service providers is becoming a common practice for data owners to decrease the cost of managing and maintaining databases in-house. In conjunction, due to the popularity of location-based-services (LBS), the need for spatial data (e.g., gazetteers, vector data) is increasing dramatically. Consequently, there is a noticeably new tendency of outsourcing spatial datasets by data collectors. Two main challenges with outsourcing datasets are to keep the data private (from the data provider) and to ensure the integrity of the query result (for the clients). Unfortunately, most of the techniques proposed for privacy and integrity do not extend to spatial data in a straightforward manner. Hence, recent studies proposed various techniques to support either privacy or integrity (but not both) on spatial datasets. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a technique that can ensure both privacy and integrity for outsourced spatial data. In particular, we first use a one-way spatial transformation method based on Hilbert curves, which encrypts the spatial data before outsourcing W.-S.

Next, by probabilistically replicating a portion of the data and encrypting it with a different encryption key, we devise a technique for the client to audit the trustworthiness of the query results. We show the applicability of our approach for both k-nearest-neighbor queries and spatial range queries, which are the building blocks of any LBS application. We also design solutions to guarantee the freshness of outsourced spatial databases. Finally, we evaluate the validity and performance of our algorithms with security analyses and extensive simulations.	cloud computing;computer science;email;encryption;holographic principle;ibm notes;information privacy;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;key (cryptography);ku band;location-based service;microsoft research;one-way function;outsourcing;privacy;query optimization;range query (data structures);replay attack;simulation;software engineering;spatial database;spatial query;trust (emotion)	Wei-Shinn Ku;Ling Hu;Cyrus Shahabi;Haixun Wang	2013	GeoInformatica	10.1007/s10707-012-0156-9	computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy;privacy;outsourcing	DB	-40.154319854030724	68.58906236398738	102720
272bf24c2c64a856aefc19624245a4698e634117	cryptonets: applying neural networks to encrypted data with high throughput and accuracy		Applying machine learning to a problem which involves medical, financial, or other types of sensitive data, not only requires accurate predictions but also careful attention to maintaining data privacy and security. Legal and ethical requirements may prevent the use of cloud-based machine learning solutions for such tasks. In this work, we will present a method to convert learned neural networks to CryptoNets, neural networks that can be applied to encrypted data. This allows a data owner to send their data in an encrypted form to a cloud service that hosts the network. The encryption ensures that the data remains confidential since the cloud does not have access to the keys needed to decrypt it. Nevertheless, we will show that the cloud service is capable of applying the neural network to the encrypted data to make encrypted predictions, and also return them in encrypted form. These encrypted predictions can be sent back to the owner of the secret key who can decrypt them. Therefore, the cloud service does not gain any information about the raw data nor about the prediction it made. We demonstrate CryptoNets on the MNIST optical character recognition tasks. CryptoNets achieve 99% accuracy and can make around 59000 predictions per hour on a single PC. Therefore, they allow high throughput, accurate, and private predictions. This is a joint work with Nathan Dowlin, Kim Laine, Kristin Lauter, Michael Naehrig, John Wernsing.	artificial neural network;cloud computing;confidentiality;encryption;information privacy;key (cryptography);mnist database;machine learning;optical character recognition;requirement;throughput	Ran Gilad-Bachrach;Nathan Dowlin;Kim Laine;Kristin E.

With the ever-increasing number of smart phones, there is a fertile market for personalised and localised advertising. A key benefit of using mobile phones is to take advantage of the significant amount of information on phones — such as locations of interest to the user — in order to provide personalised advertisements. Preservation of user privacy, however, is essential for successful deployment of such a system. In this chapter we provide an overview of existing advertising systems and privacy concerns on mobile phones, in addition to a system, MobiAd, which includes protocols for scalable local advertisement download and privacy-aware click report dissemination. In the final section of this chapter we describe some of the security mechanisms used in detecting click-through fraud, and techniques that can be used to ensure that the extra privacy protections of MobiAd are not abused to defraud advertisers.	botnet;click fraud;delay-tolerant networking;download;mobile phone;online advertising;privacy;relevance;scalability;sensor;smartphone;software deployment;systems architecture	Hamed Haddadi;Pan Hui;Tristan Henderson;Ian Brown	2011		10.1007/978-0-85729-352-7_6	privacy software;online advertising;information privacy;computer science;advertising;internet privacy;world wide web	Security	-45.89539957272972	60.917030001699274	102803

The exposure of sensitive data can potentially lead to breach of individual privacy. Therefore, many privacy preserving techniques have been proposed recently. In this paper we present a framework that uses a few novel noise addition techniques for protecting individual privacy while maintaining ahigh data quality. We add noise to all attributes, both numerical and categorical. We present a novel technique for clustering categorical values and use it for noise addition purpose. A security analysis is also presented for measuring the security level of a data set.

It aims to ensure a large-scale content distribution while supporting mobility and security natively. In this approach, named content represents the central element and it is independent from its delivering host. Security can no longer be tied to a particular location. It is built-in the content and it strongly depends on names. There are mainly two naming approaches: (1) hierarchical and human readable, (2) flat and self-certifying. Each one provides certain security services. The other services are ensured using additional mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the adaptation of the naming system in order to provide a robust security model built-in the name. The proposed solution combines the benefits of the two existing naming system and it is built on top of Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC). A formal security analysis is provided to confirm the safety of the new proposal.	authentication;data integrity;data-centric security;digital distribution;future internet;human-readable medium;icn gps;id-based cryptography;information-based complexity;internet research;public-key cryptography;relevance	Balkis Hamdane;Sihem Guemara El Fatmi;Ahmed Serhrouchni	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952919	communications protocol;mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;authentication;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-47.9342968243649	71.8777952414753	103075
196c172a474efe8c0f5e33852fcf73a51d5cac00	application of the fair secret exchange protocols in the distribution of electronic invoices		Exchange of digital goods may not be as easy to perform as it seems. We must consider the fact that one or both participants of the exchange may be dishonest and simply try to misbehave and disappear after gaining some kind of advantage over the other participant. Therefore, it is important to design exchange protocols in such a way that no one can cheat. Either all participants receive the electronic goods they expect or all participants receive nothing at all, provided that any of the participating parties abstained from, or aborted the exchange at any time before the end. Protocols which are designed in such a manner are called fair secret exchange protocols. Fairness of a protocol guarantees that no party can misbehave, and even if they manage to do so, they will be caught and prosecuted. In this paper, we suggest a protocol for fair distribution of invoices based on the aforementioned protocols, and we conduct an experiment that evaluates how the security and fairness of the process of sharing an electronic invoice between the issuer and the customer is increased. The proposed protocol’s fairness and performance evaluation results are also presented. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Rational players exchange their shares in finite repeat games. The mechanism of the scheme makes all the rational players have incentive to broadcast his or her share of the secret.

b77091d17991511fdc8db836cfede99e83e5c306	faster privacy-preserving location proximity schemes		In the last decade, location information became easily obtainable using off-the-shelf mobile devices. This gave a momentum to developing Location Based Services (LBSs) such as location proximity detection, which can be used to find friends or taxis nearby. LBSs can, however, be easily misused to track users, which draws attention to the need of protecting privacy of these users. In this work, we address this issue by designing, implementing, and evaluating multiple algorithms for Privacy-Preserving Location Proximity (PPLP) that are based on different secure computation protocols. Our PPLP protocols are well-suited for different scenarios: for saving bandwidth, energy/computational power, or for faster runtimes. Furthermore, our algorithms have runtimes of a few milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds and bandwidth of hundreds of bytes to one megabyte. In addition, the computationally most expensive parts of the PPLP computation can be precomputed in our protocols, such that the input-dependent online phase runs in just a few milliseconds.	algorithm;byte;location-based service;megabyte;mobile device;precomputation;runtime system;secure multi-party computation	Kimmo Järvinen;Ágnes Kiss;Thomas Schneider;Oleksandr Tkachenko;Zheng Yang	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-00434-7_1	computer security;computer science;location-based service;homomorphic encryption;mobile device;secure multi-party computation	Security	-39.43877449818795	61.18033011212625	103806
513a790b1ee2062f900cea7123ec3c20fc49e41e	mitigating password database breaches with intel sgx	intel sgx;password security	In order to prevent rainbow attacks against a stolen password database, most passwords are appended with a unique salt before hashing them as to make the password random and more secure. However, the decreasing cost of hardware has made it feasible to perform brute force attacks by guessing the passwords (even when extended with their salt).  Recently Intel has made processors with Intel SGX commercially available. This security technology enables developers to (1) completely isolate code and data running in an SGX enclave from untrusted code running at any privilege layer and (2) prevent data sealed to an enclave from being accessed on any other machine.  We propose to add a key to the password (and salt) before they are hashed. By calculating the hash within an enclave, the key never leaves the enclave. This provides much stronger protection; offline attacks are infeasible without knowledge of the key. Online attacks on the other hand are much easier to defend against.	brute-force search;central processing unit;key (cryptography);online and offline;password cracking;salt (cryptography)	Helena Brekalo;Raoul Strackx;Frank Piessens	2016		10.1145/3007788.3007789	zero-knowledge password proof;password policy;s/key;computer science;salt;internet privacy;one-time password;key stretching;world wide web;password;computer security;password strength;password cracking	Security	-44.54497484370156	68.7510625276856	103974

These techniques, however, have several drawbacks, including technical complexity, poor vendor support, and organizational problems. This paper presents SRA, a very simple and tested technique based on Secure RPC which, while certainly not as strong as RSA, is reasonably strong, fast, and trivial to implement immediately for both inter and intradomain communication.	authentication;kerberos;password;sequence read archive	David Safford;Douglas Lee Schales;David K.

In MPC we have a set of parties owning a set of private inputs. The parties want to compute a function of their inputs, but they do not trust each other, therefore they need a cryptographic protocol to perform the computation in a way that 1) the output is correct and 2) cheating parties will not be able to learn any information about the honest parties inputs. Even though this problem has been formulated and essentially solved almost 30 years ago, practical solutions that can be relevant for real-world applications have been discovered only in the last few years. We will present some of these advances, trying to explain to a non-specialized audience the significance of the several existing security notions.	cryptographic protocol;cryptography;secure multi-party computation	Claudio Orlandi	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947691	computer simulation;cryptographic primitive;logic gate;computer science;secure two-party computation;theoretical computer science;cryptographic protocol;distributed computing;computer security	Crypto	-38.16996828191125	73.81352836889131	104268

It is a crucial requirement to enable substructure similarity query for effective data retrieval. However, for protecting data privacy, sensitive data have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which impedes the traditional similarity query schemes from being supported in cloud. Most existing works on encrypted cloud data retrieval pay little attention to this problem. Additionally, considering the huge amounts of encrypted data graphs, the complicated similarity computation and privacy requirements, it is particularly challenging to solve this problem effectively. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the problem of privacy-assured substructure similarity query over encrypted graph-structured data in cloud computing. Our solution explores a secure framework and a series of secure algorithms to efficiently perform the substructure similarity query without privacy breaches. The proposed solution first builds a secure feature-graph index to represent the feature-related information about each encrypted data graph based on privacy homomorphism and obscuration methods and then calculates the similarity between the query graph and each data graph by the difference of feature frequency in a privacy-preserving manner. Thorough analysis is given to investigate effectiveness and privacy guarantees, and the experiments with real dataset further demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed solution.

Most of E-payment protocols guarantee fairness by using a Trusted Third Party (TTP) or semi-trusted third party. There are few protocols without a trusted third party. Based on concurrent signature, we propose two protocols suitable for digital products transaction, one for mobile payment and the other for the transaction which has higher security requirements by customers. The most prominent character of our schemes is that there is no traditional TTP, so the network congestion can be avoided. Furthermore, the protocols satisfy fairness and some other characteristics.	e-commerce;fairness measure;mobile payment;network congestion;requirement;semiconductor industry;trusted operating system;trusted third party	Wei Fan;Huaying Shu;Qiang Yan;Xin Liu	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-76312-5_28	e-commerce;payment service provider;business;computer security;commerce	Security	-44.2784724112992	71.88411047869252	104562

So, to provide the legitimacy among the users, various remote user authentication schemes have been designed. Recently, Chuang and Chang has proposed a scheme under multi-server architecture based on three security factors namely, smart card, password and biometric and claimed that, their scheme can resist several kind of attacks and can be successful to provide more security properties than that of existing schemes. In this paper, we have reviewed their schemes and proved that Chuang and Chang's scheme cannot resist server spoofing or user impersonate attack, password guessing attack and also fails to achieve forward key secrecy. To overcome their weaknesses and fulfill such important security requirements, we have proposed an improved remote user authentication scheme under multi-server environment.	authentication;biometrics;internet;password cracking;requirement;server (computing);smart card	Subhasish Banerjee;Manash Pratim Dutta;Chandan Tilak Bhunia	2015		10.1145/2799979.2799984	smart card;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;biometrics	Security	-45.52327429680613	73.67525558061268	105012

We argue that for critical and sensitive resources this is often times not desirable -- a lost or stolen mobile device can be tampered with to view or alter sensitive information. We need authorization policies that take into account time of access and location of the user in addition to the credentials of the user. Towards this end, we propose a new spatio-temporal role-based access control model. It improves upon existing models by providing features that are useful for mobile applications. Thus, an application using our model can specify different types of spatio-temporal constraints. We discuss how such an application using our spatio-temporal access control model can be verified using the UPPAAL model checker. We also demonstrate how to reduce the state-space explosion problem that is inherent in model checkers."""	anytime algorithm;authorization;credential;information sensitivity;mobile app;mobile device;model checking;role-based access control;state space;uppaal	Ramadan Abdunabi;Indrakshi Ray;Robert B.

We provide an analysis of Hohl’s reference states scheme and introduce our novel execution integrity scheme, which builds – in part – on Hohl’s scheme.

d1122ac71d2631a1d861c23749f80c6e46b73819	efficient and secure searchable encryption protocol for cloud-based internet of things		Abstract Internet of things (IoT) applications comprising thousands or millions of intelligent devices or things is fast becoming a norm in our inter-connected world, and the significant amount of data generated from IoT applications is often stored in the cloud. However, searching encrypted data (i.e. Searchable Encryption—SE) in the cloud remains an ongoing challenge. Existing SE protocols include searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) and public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS). Limitations of SSE include complex and expensive key management and distribution, while PEKS suffer from inefficiency and are vulnerable to insider keyword guessing attacks (KGA). Besides, most protocols are insecure against file-injection attacks carried out by a malicious server. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient and secure searchable encryption protocol using the trapdoor permutation function (TPF). The protocol is designed for cloud-based IoT (also referred to as Cloud of Things – CoT) deployment, such as Cloud of Battlefield Things and Cloud of Military Things. Compared with other existing SE protocols, our proposed SE protocol incurs lower computation cost at the expense of a slightly higher storage cost (which is less of an issue, considering the decreasing costs of storage). We also prove that our protocol achieves inside KGA resilience, forward privacy, and file-injection attack resilience.	cloud computing;communications protocol;cryptographic protocol;dictionary attack;email;encryption;information security;internet of things;key management;prototype;public-key cryptography;requirement;scalability;search algorithm;server (computing);software deployment;symmetric-key algorithm;trapdoor function;z/tpf	Libing Wu;Biwen Chen;Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo;Debiao He	2018	J.

Currently, first applications that essentially rely on ZK-POKs are being deployed in the real world. The most prominent example is Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA), which was adopted by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) and implemented as one of the functionalities of the cryptographic chip Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Implementing systems using ZK-PoK turns out to be challenging, since ZK-PoK are, loosely speaking, significantly more complex than standard crypto primitives, such as encryption and signature schemes. As a result, implementation cycles of ZK-PoK are time-consuming and error-prone, in particular for developers with minor or no cryptographic skills. To overcome these challenges, we have designed and implemented a compiler with corresponding languages that given a high-level ZK-PoK protocol specification automatically generates a sound implementation of this. The output is given in form of Σ-protocols, which are the most efficient protocols for ZK-PoK currently known. Our compiler translates ZK-PoK protocol specifications, written in a high-level protocol description language, into Java code or LTEX documentation of the protocol. The compiler is based on a unified theoretical framework that encompasses a large number of existing ZK-PoK techniques.Within this framework we present a new efficient ZK-PoK protocol for exponentiation homomorphisms in hidden order groups.

64d1e0bd908d7c47868872ad9ff0bbd70ba52c3f	trajectory prediction-based handover authentication mechanism for mobile relays in lte-a high-speed rail networks		The handover mechanism with the assist of mobile relay mounted in high-speed trains has been researched to support continuous communication services for Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) high-speed rail networks. According to the third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard, the handover process for Mobile Relay Nodes (MRNs) from a donor eNB (DeNB) to another is the same as that for the common User Equipment (UE), which requires several rounds of message exchange with a complex key management mechanism. In addition, it cannot achieve the mutual authentication in handover procedures. In this paper, we propose a handover authentication mechanism based on trajectory prediction for mobile relays. In our scheme, the mutual authentication and key agreement between a MRN and the target DeNB is accomplished with ideal efficiency. Compared with the current 3GPP standards and other related schemes, our scheme effectively reduces the handover delays and at the same time provides strong security protection. Security analysis by using the formal verification tool AVISPA and SPAN and performance evaluation results show the security and efficiency of our scheme.	authentication and key agreement (protocol);compaq lte;donor-acceptor scheme;formal verification;key management;mutual authentication;performance evaluation;relay	Jin Cao;Maode Ma;Hui Li;Yulong Fu;Ben Niu;Fenghua Li	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997254	lte advanced;computer network;key management;user equipment;handover;real-time computing;3rd generation partnership project 2;soft handover;computer science;relay;mutual authentication	Mobile	-47.920274521618225	73.40854887502535	105615

The management system should simultaneously follow three rules of security that are confidentiality, anonymity and fairness. We present in this paper a novel system named Secure Synchronized Reading (SSR) system as well as its corresponding security model according to the three rules. SSR can evoke a synchronized start for all competitors in a contest at the intended time by employing a Randomness-reused Identity-Based Encryption (RIBE) scheme. It can avoid huge differences among delivery delays of heterogeneous competitors and any false start by an adverse competitor. Consequently when an online contest begins, the SSR system performs quasi real-time with ignorable communication delays in the security model. As a complement, the analysis on the provable security of SSR is given finally, as well as a further analysis on the achievement of synchronization.	confidentiality;fairness measure;id-based encryption;provable security;randomness;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;window of opportunity	Wei Wang;Peng Xu;Hui Li;Laurence Tianruo Yang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883421	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	DB	-44.66778004307944	72.200322213035	105790
bc66e4539304cd78f7e8b3f79c19aac02835dfbf	practical constant-size ring signature		Bitcoin has gained its popularity for almost 10 years as a “secure and anonymous digital currency”. However, according to several recent researches, we know that it can only provide pseudonymity rather than real anonymity, and privacy has been one of the main concerns in the system similar to Bitcoin. Ring signature is a good method for those users who need better anonymity in cryptocurrency. It was first proposed by Rivest et al. based upon the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) assumption in 2006, which allows a user to sign a message anonymously on behalf of a group of users even without their coordination. The size of ring signature is one of the dominating parameters, and constant-size ring signature (where signature size is independent of the ring size) is much desirable. Otherwise, when the ring size is large, the resultant ring signature becomes unbearable for power limited devices or leads to heavy burden over the communication network. Though being extensively studied, currently there are only two approaches for constant-size ring signature. Achieving practical constant-size ring signature is a long-standing open problem since its introduction. In this work, we solve this open question. We present a new constant-size ring signature scheme based on bilinear pairing and accumulator, which is provably secure under the random oracle (RO) model. To the best of our knowledge, it stands for the most practical ring signature up to now.	accumulator (computing);anonymous internet banking;bilinear filtering;bitcoin;comparison sort;cryptocurrency;digital light processing;digital currency;digital signature;discrete logarithm;provable security;pseudonymity;random oracle;resultant;ring signature;telecommunications network	Meng-Jun Qin;Yunlei Zhao;Zhoujun Ma	2018	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/s11390-018-1838-z	computer science;ring signature;distributed computing;open problem;ring size;random oracle;cryptocurrency;pseudonymity;discrete logarithm;pairing	Crypto	-39.23039609465713	74.49245766846678	105839
2cb88d82a19cc428cc8d19858f1b07b06f98d97c	cardinality estimators do not preserve privacy		Cardinality estimators like HyperLogLog are sketching algorithms that estimate the number of distinct elements in a large multiset. Their use in privacysensitive contexts raises the question of whether they leak private information. In particular, can they provide any privacy guarantees while preserving their strong aggregation properties? We formulate an abstract notion of cardinality estimators, that captures this aggregation requirement: one can merge sketches without losing precision. We propose an attacker model and a corresponding privacy definition, strictly weaker than differential privacy: we assume that the attacker has no prior knowledge of the data. We then show that if a cardinality estimator satisfies this definition, then it cannot have a reasonable level of accuracy. We prove similar results for weaker versions of our definition, and analyze the privacy of existing algorithms, showing that their average privacy loss is significant, even for multisets with large cardinalities. We conclude that strong aggregation requirements are incompatible with any reasonable definition of privacy, and that cardinality estimators should be considered as sensitive as raw data. We also propose risk mitigation strategies for their real-world applications.		Damien Desfontaines;Andreas Lochbihler;David A.

An untrusted server storing the documents learns nothing more than the search result about the documents without revealing the keyword. Secure index search protocols in the literature only consider a search process between a single-user and a server. However, in real organizations such as government offices or enterprises with many departments, a group search occurs more often. In this paper, we study natural extension of previous results, i.e., secure index search between a server and group members, where a file may be shared by a group or a person with a server. The difficulty in designing such a group setting arises from dynamic group, where each member of the group may join to or leave from the group. To resolve this difficulty efficiently, we propose novel secure index search protocols without reencryption of the old encrypted documents when group keys are updated.	access control;computation;crown group;cryptography;encryption;information-theoretic security;mix network;multi-user;server (computing);shared secret;trusted third party	Hyun-A Park;Jin Wook Byun;Dong Hoon Lee	2005		10.1007/11537878_14	computer science;cryptography;database;privacy;world wide web;computer security;file sharing	Crypto	-42.418200023672696	70.4374640952583	106418

Then we present the voting scheme with multiple parties; this voting scheme satisfies all these security requirements. In this scheme, the voter gets a signed key from the registrar, where the registrar signs the key as blinded. The voter uses this signed key during the voting period. All other parties can verify this signature without knowing the identity of the voter, hence the scheme provides privacy of the voter. This voting scheme also satisfies voter verifiability and public verifiability. In addition, the scheme is receipt-free.	authentication;formal verification;information security;isabelle;performance evaluation;privacy;requirement;server (computing)	Md. Abdul Based;Stig Fr.

To this end, we will review the most important of the practical cryptographic mechanisms and discuss how they could be applied. In a second part, we will report on the readiness of the industry to indeed employ such technologies and on how governments address the current erosion of privacy.	cryptography;personally identifiable information;privacy	Jan Camenisch	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-11799-2_29	telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;data mining;internet privacy;computer security;algorithm;computer network	Security	-46.570401825364826	62.46091442081392	106729

Such techniques, however, usually incur heavy computational and communication cost on the participating parties and thus entities with limited resources may have to refrain from participating in the PPDM process. To address this issue, one promising solution is to outsource the tasks to the cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient solution to privacy-preserving outsourced distributed clustering (PPODC) for multiple users based on the k-means clustering algorithm. The main novelty of our solution lies in avoiding the secure division operations required in computing cluster centers through efficient transformation techniques. In addition, we discuss two strategies, namely offline computation and pipelined execution that aim to boost the performance of our protocol. We implement our protocol on a cluster of 16 nodes and demonstrate how our two strategies combined with parallelism can significantly improve the performance of our protocol through extensive experiments using a real dataset.	algorithm;association rule learning;cluster analysis;computation;computer cluster;confidentiality;dtime;data mining;encryption;entity;euclidean distance;experiment;k-means clustering;multi-user;online and offline;outsourcing;parallel computing;parallel programming model;privacy	Fang-Yu Rao;Bharath K.

Today such policies are still mainly specified manually by ordinary users, which is usually coarse-grained, tedious, and error-prone. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an automated access control policy specification tool, XACCESS, that helps non-expert users effectively specify who should have access to which part of their data. A series of key features distinguish XACCESS from prior work: 1) it adopts a role-based access control model (instead of the conventional rule-based paradigm) to capture the implicit privacy/interest preference of social site users; 2) it employs a novel hybrid mining method to extract a set of semantically interpretable, functional """"social roles"""", from both static network structures and dynamic historical activities; 3) based on the identified social roles, confidentiality setting of personal data, and (optional and possibly inconsistent) predefined user-permission assignments, it recommends a set of high-quality privacy settings; 4) it allows user feedback in every phase of the process to further improve the quality of the suggested privacy policies. A comprehensive experimental evaluation is conducted over real social network and user study data to validate the efficacy of XACCESS."""	cognitive dimensions of notations;confidentiality;logic programming;personally identifiable information;privacy policy;programming paradigm;role-based access control;social network;usability testing	Ting Wang;Mudhakar Srivatsa;Ling Liu	2012		10.1145/2295136.2295165	rule-based system;semantic interpretation;privacy policy;computer access control;computer science;access control;role;role-based access control;data mining;world wide web;computer security;social network	Security	-42.27449710417265	61.39442734943144	106884

In these scenarios, it is essential that the identity of the signer is kept secret from any third party, except the trusted authority. The identity in such a system is uniquely identified by the secret key (or the signing key) rather than the public key, since the public key may be repeatedly randomized. This paper formalizes this notion by investigating a new property of digital signatures, called key indistinguishability. In this notion, given a number of digital signatures generated from two known public keys, an adversary cannot determine whether the signing keys used to generate these public keys, and hence the signatures, are the same. This property ensures that the signatures do not leak any information of the signing keys. Observing that existing digital signatures without random oracles do not provide such a property, we fill the gap with the first key indistinguishable signature scheme which is existentially unforgeable under a chosen message attack without using random oracles. The proposed scheme is also efficient and practical for applications in pseudonym systems.	adversary (cryptography);antivirus software;digital credential;digital signature forgery;high- and low-level;information leakage;key (cryptography);key signing party;public-key cryptography;randomized algorithm;spectral leakage;type signature	Qianhong Wu;Bo Qin;Yi Mu;Willy Susilo	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-01440-6_9	random oracle;ring signature;digital signature;computer science;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;key;privacy;world wide web;key distribution;computer security	Crypto	-41.00802382003285	73.48129793242218	107309

A specific type of these attacks are toll-fraud attacks. The prevention of these attacks depends on understanding the attack patterns. These can be derived from communication records. However, these records contain privacy relevant information of the call participants. These records are also protected by a number of laws and regulations. To make an analysis privacy compliant, relevant laws and regulations need to be considered. We propose a method for changing communication records in such a way that the forensic analysis in VoIP attacks is possible and the privacy of the call participants is preserved. We define privacy requirements for communication records from laws, regulations and concerns of call participants. We also present patterns of communication records based upon real world examples. We further show a framework for privacy attack identification and privacy data minimisation for a structured analysis of communication records. Moreover, an analysis pattern for toll-fraud attacks states which relations in the communication records have to survive the data minimisation.	attack patterns;common criteria;communications security;denial-of-service attack;personally identifiable information;privacy engineering;requirement;structured analysis;systems design	Stefan Hofbauer;Kristian Beckers;Gerald Quirchmayr	2012	2012 Seventh International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	10.1109/ARES.2012.22	information sensitivity;privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-47.248740518502416	60.90157944941783	107351

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is the standard protocol for retrieving certificate revocation information in the PKI. To minimize the damages caused by OCSP responder’s private key exposure, a distributed OCSP composed of multiple responders is needed. This paper presents a new distributed OCSP with a single public key by using key-insulated signature scheme [6].

This paper proposes a privacy protection model to evaluate property risk of users, which takes into account both sensitivity of the property and requester’s level of assurance. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the property is evaluated by problem of expectation–maximization algorithm. Experiments show that the optimal size of samples for EM is relatively small, which indicates the high efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed privacy protection model cannot only assist users to do correct authorization, but also benefit the privacy reservation of users in online service.

The sharing of data between the organizations is found to be beneficial for business growth. However, privacy policies and threats prevent the data owners from sharing the data for mining. The current data sanitization approaches focus on hiding either frequent itemsets or utility itemsets separately. This paper proposes to study the problem of hiding the sensitive utility and frequent itemsets. To resolve this problem, two effective data sanitization algorithms MSMU and MCRSU are presented to hide the sensitive utility and frequent itemsets in the modified database. While hiding the sensitive itemsets, the algorithms sanitize the database with minimum impact on the non-sensitive itemsets. To accomplish this, MSMU is devised to identify the victim items with minimum support and maximum utility whereas MCRSU uses conflict ratio. Results from the computational experiments on the synthetic and real datasets indicate that MCRSU algorithm is more effective than MSMU in minimizing the non-sensitive itemsets affected as well as maintaining data quality in the sanitized database.	sanitization (classified information)	R.

694e6af882a1bff2aff1bca273484733faec91ea	correctness and fairness of tendermint-core blockchains		Tendermint-core blockchains (e.g. Cosmos) are considered today one of the most viable alternatives for the highly energy consuming proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their particularity is that they aim at offering strong consistency (no forks) in an open system combining two ingredients (i) a set of validators that generate blocks via a variant of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus protocol and (ii) a selection strategy that dynamically selects nodes to be validators for the next block via a proof-of-stake mechanism. However, the exact assumptions on the system model under which Tendermint underlying algorithms are correct and the exact properties Tendermint verifies have never been formally analyzed. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, while formalizing Tendermint algorithms we precisely characterize the system model and the exact problem solved by Tendermint. We prove that in eventual synchronous systems a modified version of Tendermint solves (i) under additional assumptions, a variant of one-shot consensus for the validation of one single block and (ii) a variant of the repeated consensus problem for multiple blocks. These results hold even if the set of validators is hit by Byzantine failures, provided that for each one-shot consensus instance less than one third of the validators is Byzantine. Our second contribution relates to the fairness of the rewarding mechanism. It is common knowledge that in permisionless blockchain systems the main threat is the tragedy of commons that may yield the system to collapse if the rewarding mechanism is not adequate. Ad minimum the rewarding mechanism must be fair, i.e. distributing the rewards in proportion to the merit of participants. We prove, for the first time in blockchain systems, that in repeated-consensus based blockchains there exists an (eventual) fair rewarding mechanism if and only if the system is (eventual) synchronous. We also show that the original Tendermint rewarding is not fair, however, a modification of the original protocol makes it eventually fair.

d6bcb43c3ada6eadae08eccd722e4a1057040af0	a framework for the secure storage of data generated in the iot		The Internet of Things can be seen has a growing number of things that inter-operate using an Internet-based infrastructure and that has evolved during the last years with little concern for the privacy of its users, especially regarding how the collected data is stored. Technological measures ensuring users privacy must be established. In this paper we will present a technological framework for the secure storage of data. Things can then interact with the framework’s API much in the same way they now interact with its current servers, after which, the framework will perform the required operations in order to secure the data before storing it. The methods adopted for the secure storage will maintain the sharing ability, conveniently allowing authorized access to other users, the initial user’s terms (e.g. data anonymity) and the ability to revoke assigned privileges at all times.

The non-full-fledged protocols typically suffer de-synchronization, impersonation and tracking attacks, and usually lack scalability. The full-fledged protocols, supporting cryptographic functions, are designed to overcome these weaknesses. This paper examines several elliptic-curve-cryptography (ECC)-based full-fledged protocols. We found that some still have security and privacy issues, and others generate excessive communication costs between the tag and the back-end server. Motivated by these observations, we construct two novel protocols, PI and PII. PI is designed for secure environments and is suitable for applications, including E-Passport and toll payment in vehicular ad-hoc networks. PII is for hostile environments and can be applied in pseudonymous payment and anti-counterfeiting services. After analysis, we conclude that PII can resist many attacks, outperform previous ECC-based proposals in communication efficiency, and provide mutual authentication function and scalability.	authentication;radio-frequency identification	Yalin Chen;Jue-Sam Chou	2015	Electronic Commerce Research	10.1007/s10660-014-9165-0	radio-frequency identification;scalability;computer science;elliptic curve cryptography;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-46.87515893072347	74.16756266297122	108088

In this paper we identify a vulnerability in Helios which allows an adversary to compromise the privacy of voters whom cast abstention votes. The vulnerability can be attributed to the absence of ballot independence and the use of homomorphic ElGamal encryption, in particular, these properties can be exploited by an adversary to construct a ballot related to an abstention vote cast by an honest voter and this ballot can be submitted by a corrupt voter to influence the election outcome, thereby introducing information that can be used to violate privacy. We demonstrate the attack by breaking privacy in a mock election using the current Helios implementation. It is unlikely that the vulnerability will be exploited in a real-world election and therefore our results are largely theoretical. Nonetheless, we cannot expect any computational proofs of ballot secrecy without fixing this vulnerability and, moreover, the attack methodology may be of interest – in particular, it could represent a viable threat to existing protocols in the literature – thus providing motivation to report these results.	adversary (cryptography);end-to-end encryption;formal verification;forward secrecy;helios;mock object;privacy;web application	Ben Smyth	2012	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		political science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-38.57064743370283	73.03102924971012	108156

Recently, Liu and Yan proposed a lightweight micropayment scheme to achieve the efficiency, the fairness, and the privacy. However, the bank in the Liu–Yan’s scheme maybe obtain the illegal benefits by controlling the selective result. In this paper, an enhanced fairness micropayment scheme is presented to resist the attack from the malicious bank.

Even though the general deduplication approach has been increasingly accepted, it comes with many security and privacy problems due to the outsourced data delivery models of cloud storage. To deal with specific security and privacy issues, secure deduplication techniques have been proposed for cloud data, leading to a diverse range of solutions and trade-offs. Hence, in this article, we discuss ongoing research on secure deduplication for cloud data in consideration of the attack scenarios exploited most widely in cloud storage. On the basis of classification of deduplication system, we explore security risks and attack scenarios from both inside and outside adversaries. We then describe state-of-the-art secure deduplication techniques for each approach that deal with different security issues under specific or combined threat models, which include both cryptographic and protocol solutions. We discuss and compare each scheme in terms of security and efficiency specific to different security goals. Finally, we identify and discuss unresolved issues and further research challenges for secure deduplication in cloud storage.	cloud computing;cloud storage;cryptography;data deduplication;privacy	Young-joo Shin;Dongyoung Koo;Junbeom Hur	2017	ACM Comput.

Ateniese et al. (ESORICS 2005) discuss five security properties for such signature schemes: unforgeability, immutability, privacy, transparency and accountability. These notions have been formalized in a recent work by Brzuska et al. (PKC 2009), discussing also the relationships among the security notions. In addition, they prove a modification of the scheme of Ateniese et al. to be secure according to these notions. Here we discuss that a sixth property of sanitizable signature schemes may be desirable: unlinkability. Basically, this property prevents that one can link sanitized message-signature pairs of the same document, thus allowing to deduce combined information about the original document. We show that this notion implies privacy, the inability to recover the original data of sanitized parts, but is not implied by any of the other five notions. We also discuss a scheme based on group signatures meeting all six security properties.	antivirus software;immutable object;pkc (conference);privacy;signature;transparency (graphic)	Christina Brzuska;Marc Fischlin;Anja Lehmann;Dominique Schröder	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13013-7_26	computer science;data mining;mathematics;internet privacy;group signature;computer security;algorithm	Security	-41.04514383707593	74.434896268846	108417

In this paper, we first propose a secure verifiable outsourcing algorithm of single modular exponentiation based on the one-malicious model of two untrusted servers. The outsourcer could detect any failure with probability 1 if one of the servers misbehaves. We also present the other verifiable outsourcing algorithm for multiple modular exponentiations based on the same model. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithms improve both checkability and efficiency for the outsourcer. Finally, we utilize the proposed algorithms as two subroutines to achieve outsource-secure polynomial evaluation and ciphertext-policy attributed-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme with verifiable outsourced encryption and decryption.	algorithm;ciphertext;cloud computing;computation;cryptography;encryption;formal verification;mobile device;modular exponentiation;outsourcing;polynomial;subroutine	Yanli Ren;Ning Ding;Xinpeng Zhang;Haining Lu;Dawu Gu	2016		10.1145/2897845.2897881	computer science;theoretical computer science;database;computer security;verifiable secret sharing	Security	-40.39663236265299	70.30370178198207	108627

Based on the inductive approach of security protocol analysis by Paulson in Isabelle/HOL, we show how the protocol can be modelled and important properties are proved. We prove that origin authentication works securely. In order to illustrate that the model is adequate, we show that previous domain name requests can be replayed - as in the classical DNS -by an attacker. These replays luckily can be uniquely identified in DNSsec due to the origin authentication mechanism that we establish to enhance security.	authentication;automated theorem proving;formal language;hol (proof assistant);isabelle;proof assistant;replay attack;tokenization (data security)	Florian Kammüller;Yoney Kirsal-Ever;Xiaochun Cheng	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.812	message authentication code;the internet;challenge–response authentication;computer science;theoretical computer science;authentication protocol;authentication;distributed computing;automated theorem proving;computer security;logic;nsupdate;replay attack	Security	-36.24685000375024	72.44209446517885	108628
08bc4f982238ea3b24c037d174975c251c69722c	toward fairness of cryptocurrency payments		Motivated by the great success and adoption of Bitcoin, a number of cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum are becoming increasingly popular. Although existing blockchain-based cryptocurrency schemes can ensure reasonable security for transactions, they do not consider any notion of fairness. Fair exchange allows two players to exchange digital “items,” such as digital signatures, over insecure networks fairly, so that either each player gets the other’s item, or neither player does. Given that blockchain participants typically do not trust each other, enabling fairness in existing cryptocurrencies is an essential but insufficiently explored problem. In this article, we explore the solution space for enabling the fair exchange of a cryptocurrency payment for a receipt. We identify the timeliness of an exchange as an important property especially when one of the parties involved in the exchange is resource-constrained. We introduce the notion of strong timeliness for a fair exchange protocol and propose two fair payment-for-receipt protocol instantiations that leverage functionality of the blockchain to achieve strong timeliness. We implement both and compare their security and efficiency.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;digital signature;dogecoin;ethereum;fairness measure;feasible region;litecoin;type signature	Jing Liu;Wenting Li;Ghassan O.

The typically distributed collection of CMRs across various clinical centres suggests the need to integrate the records in a centralized data repository. This is necessary to explore many data analytic algorithms which are not supported on distributed databases. As highly private patient records are being dealt with, it is important to consider how privacy will be preserved. This is especially important since the patient records are to be shared and used for reasons other than the primary reasons they were collected, i.e., for secondary use of healthcare data. In addition, the need for securing data transmission becomes necessary to ensure privacy and confidentiality. We advance the literature on privacy-enhancing data minining in the healthcare setting by (1) presenting strategies of using de-identification as well as cryptographic techniques to facilitate patient identity protection and securely transmit the records to a centralized data repository for secondary data analytics; (2) addressing key management issues related to the use of cryptography constructs; and (3) establishing the security requirements as well as carrying out vulnerability assessment with respect to the tranmission process, data repository, and direct attacks to the encrypted patient ID.	algorithm;centralized computing;confidentiality;data anonymization;data mining;de-identification;distributed database;encryption;hybrid cryptosystem;information repository;information sensitivity;ishikawa diagram;key management;one-way function;personally identifiable information;privacy;public-key cryptography;requirement;research data archiving;server (computing);transmitter	Hajara Abdulrahman;Norman Poh;Jack Burnett	2014	2014 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Healthcare and e-health (CICARE)	10.1109/CICARE.2014.7007847	privacy software;masking;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web	Security	-42.753537463332506	64.38498483660625	108919

But, though cloud is a viable present day option for elastic storage facilities, its security is still a grave concern. Hence, in order to improve the secure communication among group members, Zhu and Jiang have proposed a protocol and claimed that key distribution to the group users can be done without any secure communication channels. They have claimed that their scheme is resistant to collusion attack and all the other attacks, thereby ensuring forward and backward secrecies as well. Firstly, in this research work, after extensive analysis, we have identified several issues in the protocol proposed by Zhu and Jiang which make it vulnerable to various attacks. Secondly, we have proved that an attacker can use the man-in-the-middle attack and break the protocol thereby getting the secret keys shared between the group manager and the group user. Thirdly, we have given enough proof that the scheme is vulnerable to message modification attack too. Finally, we claim that the earlier proposed protocol is not secure and a new protocol with improved security is the need of the hour.	backward compatibility;cloud computing;cloud storage;formal proof;key distribution;man-in-the-middle attack;outsourcing;secure communication;upload	S.

Ensuring data security and privacy, therefore, is crucial for better and broader adoption of the cloud. This tutorial provides a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art in the context of data security and privacy for outsourced data. We aim to cover common security and privacy threats for outsourced data, and relevant novel schemes and techniques with their design choices regarding security, privacy, functionality, and performance.

This technique remains secure only in case of limited computational power of eavesdroppers. Thus, we propose a quantum extension of EAP-TLS which allows exchanging a cryptographic key and authenticating a remote client peer with absolute security, ensured by the laws of quantum laws.	authentication protocol;key (cryptography);key exchange;man-in-the-middle attack;public key infrastructure;quantum cryptography;quantum key distribution;quantum mechanics;secure communication;transport layer security	Aymen Ghilen;Mostafa Azizi;Ridha Bouallegue	2015	2015 IEEE/ACS 12th International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)	10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507125	wireless transport layer security;photonics;computer science;cryptography;authentication protocol;operating system;key management;authentication;distributed computing;wireless lan controller;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;pre-shared key;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-47.08639838530719	73.26947718107171	109157
03442854feead56978c5352765e1b88ebea9b250	self-enforcing private inference control	provable security;database;inference control;self enforcing;dos attack	Private inference control enables simultaneous enforcement of inference control and protection of users’ query privacy. Private inference control is a useful tool for database applications, especially when users are increasingly concerned about individual privacy nowadays. However, protection of query privacy on top of inference control is a double-edged sword: without letting the database server know the content of user queries, users can easily launch DoS attacks. To assuage DoS attacks in private inference control, we propose the concept of self-enforcing private inference control, whose intuition is to force users to only make inference-free queries by enforcing inference control themselves; otherwise, penalty will inflict upon the violating users. Towards instantiating the concept, we formalize a model on self-enforcing private inference control, and propose a concrete provably secure scheme, based on Woodruff and Staddon’s work. In our construction, “penalty” is instantiated to be a deprivation of users’ access privilege: so long as a user makes an inference-enabling query, his access privilege is forfeited and he is rejected to query the database any further. We also discuss several important issues that complement and enhance the basic scheme.	control system;dos;database server;denial-of-service attack;instance (computer science);mathematical model;provable security;server (computing)	Yanjiang Yang;Yingjiu Li;Jian Weng;Jianying Zhou;Feng Bao	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04642-1_21	computer science;provable security;data mining;internet privacy;computer security;denial-of-service attack	Security	-42.09331975960146	64.88803395251563	109250
0636d3831c1566012fae9727e6ee0b83c9b46d57	a new distributed brute-force password cracking technique		In earlier incarnations of computing, security was not yet a concern. Now, because of the distribution of knowledge, malicious individuals have cleverly learned to take advantage of the loopholes. White hat hackers must constantly stay one step ahead of their black hat counterparts. When all other avenues of password cracking fail, brute force is the only option. Since the advent of secure hashing algorithms, passwords continue to become increasingly more difficult to crack. In this paper, we have presented an algorithm to crack passwords with brute force technique using parallel distribution. It is implemented on an IBM super computer to implement parallel distribution. It is a fact that with a distributed approach, diffusing intense computations across multiple nodes, millions of computations can be processed in a fraction of time.	password cracking	Emanuel Tirado;Brendan Turpin;Cody Beltz;Phillip Roshon;Rylin Judge;Kanwal Gagneja	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94421-0_9	hacker;password;white hat;hash function;computation;password cracking;distributed computing;computer science	Crypto	-44.35277534531462	68.49952257689172	109438
d16de92f044fbb19106fc8878be41815a6cdd814	cloudless wide area friend-to-friend networking middleware for smartphones		Swirlwave is a middleware that enables peer-to-peer and distributed computing for Internet-connected devices that lack publicly reachable Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, that can be expected to disconnect from the network for periods of time, and that frequently change network locations. This is the typical case for smartphones. The middleware fits into the friend-to-friend subcategory of peer-to-peer systems, meaning that the overlay network is built on top of already existing trust relationships among its users. It is independent of clouds and application servers, it supports encryption for confidentiality and authentication, and it aims to be easily extensible for new applications. The solution described in this paper is implemented for smartphones running the Android operating system, but its principles are not limited to this.	android;application server;authentication;confidentiality;distributed computing;encryption;fits;friend-to-friend;middleware;operating system;overlay network;peer-to-peer;smartphone;tor messenger	Jo Inge Arnes;Randi Karlsen	2018		10.5220/0006830104210430	computer network;world wide web;computer science;middleware	Networks	-47.89402298679415	64.91788337078528	109527

To protect the user’s exact location, a new notion of privacy, named geo-indistinguishability, that adapts differential privacy has been proposed for LBSs, recently. However, the obfuscation mechanism satisfying this privacy notion only works well in the case of snapshot LBS, which would not apply to the case of continuous LBSs due to the quick loss of privacy caused by the correlation between locations in the trace. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism, namely AGENT, to protect the user’s location privacy in continuous LBSs. In AGENT, a R-tree is introduced to realize the reusable of generated sanitized locations, which achieves the notion of geo-indistinguishability with less consumption of privacy budget. Finally, empirical results over real-world dataset demonstrate that with the same utility, our mechanism consumes less privacy budget to obfuscate the same trace.	location-based service	XinDi Ma;Jianfeng Ma;Hui Li;Qi Jiang;Sheng Gao	2018	Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications	10.1007/s12083-017-0545-9	computer science;differential privacy;snapshot (computer storage);privacy software;distributed computing;internet privacy;location-based service	HPC	-39.50406098784897	61.764928912478055	109765

Authenticating people based on their biometric traits have been used before technology adopted biometrics as a mechanism to authenticate a person. However, various aspects that shape the landscape of biometric technology are often overlooked. Many research papers focus on the fact that biometric technology can be spoofed using various complex approaches Matsumoto et al., 2002. However, biometric technology has a number of role players that must be considered. Many examples exist of companies implementing biometric technology for authentication. Only to learn later those certain aspects preclude the successful implementation of biometric technology. This paper discusses a number of aspects that form part of the biometric landscape which should be contemplated whenever biometric technology is considered for a sustainable biometric solution. Due to the various formats that biometrics can be presented this paper also introduces a framework to standardise the terminology used for biometrics.	biometrics	Bobby L.

But up to now, the study of efficient and secure M+1/sup st/ price auction is still very weak. Aiming at this drawback, this paper presented a new solution for M+1/sup st/ price auction in the case of protecting bidders. Employing the method of binary search, this scheme resolves the winners and the winning price synchronously and rapidly. If necessary, all auctioneers can collaborate with each other to open the winners' bidding prices without leaking any privacy of losers. Comparison in terms of communication cost between our proposed scheme and others was given at the end of the paper. The result shows that our solution consumes less bandwidth in communication.

c0e65d9d7c87b281f63059547afb40f7539d4e04	privacy preserving encrypted phonetic search of speech data		This paper presents a strategy for enabling speech recognition to be performed in the cloud whilst preserving the privacy of users. The approach advocates a demarcation of responsibilities between the client and server-side components for performing the speech recognition task. On the client-side resides the acoustic model, which symbolically encodes the audio and encrypts the data before uploading to the server. The server-side then employs searchable encryption to enable the phonetic search of the speech content. Some preliminary results for speech encoding and searchable encryption are presented.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic model;client-side;cloud computing;demarcation point;design rationale;encryption;privacy;server (computing);server-side;speech coding;speech recognition;upload;while	Cornelius Glackin;Gérard Chollet;Nazim Dugan;Nigel Cannings;Julie A.

However, these applications can suffer from security issues or privacy violations when the underlying data-protection techniques are not properly designed. Hence, many secure RFID authentication protocols have been proposed. According to the resource usage of the tags, secure RFID protocols are classified into four types: full-fledged, simple, lightweight, and ultra-lightweight. In general, non-full-fledged protocols are vulnerable to desynchronization, impersonation, and tracking attacks, and they also lack scalability. If the tag resources allow more flexibility, full-fledged protocols seem to be an attractive solution. In this study, we examine full-fledged RFID authentication protocols and discuss their security issues. We then design a novel RFID authentication protocol based on elliptic curve cryptography, to avoid these issues. In addition, we present a detailed security analysis and a comparison with related studies; the results show that our scheme is more resistant to a variety of attacks and that it has the best scalability, while maintaining competitive levels of efficiency.	authentication protocol;computation;computer security;elliptic curve cryptography;internet privacy;inventory control;man-in-the-middle attack;mutual authentication;overhead (computing);radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;replay attack;scalability	Jue-Sam Chou	2013	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-013-1073-x	radio-frequency identification;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-46.82905731676747	74.0326793814211	110408
2479d75afbfa37adf29c78d6758f412d59b002d2	privacy-respecting reward generation and accumulation for participatory sensing applications		Participatory or crowd-sensing applications process sensory data contributed by users and transform them to simple visualizations (such as for example noise or pollution levels) that help create an accurate representation of the surrounding environment. Although contributed data is of great interest to individuals, the involvement of citizens and community groups, however, is still limited. Hence, incentivizing users to increase participation seems crucial for the success of participatory sensing. In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving rewarding scheme which allows campaign administrators to reward users for the data they contribute. Our system of anonymous tokens allow users to enjoy the benefits of participation while at the same time ensuring their anonymity. Moreover, rewards can be accumulated together thus further increasing the level of privacy offered by the system. Our proposal is coupled with a security analysis showing the privacy-preserving character of the system along with an efficiency analysis demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in realistic deployment settings.	crowdsourcing;double-spending;interactivity;overhead (computing);participatory sensing;privacy;proof assistant;software deployment;tree accumulation;usability;z1 (computer);z2 (computer)	Tassos Dimitriou	2017	Pervasive and Mobile Computing	10.1016/j.pmcj.2018.07.002	computer science;distributed computing;anonymity;management science;software deployment;security analysis;participatory sensing	HCI	-44.51842218233409	66.25415266955072	110489

The business drivers for exploring ways to monetize such data are one of the challenges identified in this paper for the protection of Privacy in the IoT. Beyond the protection of privacy, this paper highlights the need for new approaches, which grant a more active role to the users of the IoT and which address other potential issues such as the Digital Divide or safety risks. A key facet in ethical design is the transparency of the technology and services in how that technology handles data, as well as providing choice for the user. This paper presents a new approach for users' interaction with the IoT, which is based on the concept of Ethical Design implemented through a policy-based framework. In the proposed framework, users are provided with wider controls over personal data or the IoT services by selecting specific sets of policies, which can be tailored according to users' capabilities and to the contexts where they operate. The potential deployment of the framework in a typical IoT context is described with the identification of the main stakeholders and the processes that should be put in place."""	best practice;certification;clinical use template;community;complement system proteins;cryptography;customize;data management;data center;deploy;entity;interaction;internet of things;law enforcement;license;malware;personally identifiable information;policy;privacy;public key infrastructure;revision procedure;software business;solutions;source code;standards characteristics	Gianmarco Baldini;Maarten Botterman;Ricardo Neisse;Mariachiara Tallacchini	2018		10.1007/s11948-016-9754-5	text mining;medical research;engineering;knowledge management;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-45.688442663159364	61.351430769906536	110562

Our goal is to provide a systematic mechanism that guarantees an adequate and controllable level of privacy while substantially improving on the utility of public use data, compared to current practices by CMS, OSHPD and other agencies. The proposed algorithm synthesizes artificial records while preserving the statistical characteristics of the original data to the extent possible. The risk from ``database linking attack'' is quantified by either an l-diversified or an ϵ-differentially perturbed data generation process. Moreover its algorithmic performance is optimized using Locality-Sensitive Hashing and parallel computation techniques to yield a linear-time algorithm that is suitable for Big Data Health applications. We synthesize a public Medicare claim dataset using the proposed algorithm, and demonstrate multiple data mining applications and statistical analyses using the data. The synthetic dataset delivers results that are substantially identical to those obtained from the original dataset, without revealing the actual records.	algorithm;big data;computation;data mining;locality of reference;locality-sensitive hashing;parallel computing;privacy;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;time complexity	Yubin Park;Joydeep Ghosh;Mallikarjun Shankar	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics	10.1109/ICHI.2013.76	computer science;data science;data mining;database	DB	-39.32037208568317	64.08596205217242	111372

These computations could occur between mutually untrusted parties, or even between competitors. For example, customers might send to a remote database queries that contain private information; two competing financial organizations might jointly invest in a project that must satisfy both organizations' private and valuable constraints, and so on. Today, to conduct such computations, one entity must usually know the inputs from all the participants; however if nobody can be trusted enough to know all the inputs, privacy will become a primary concern.This problem is referred to as Secure Multi-party Computation Problem (SMC) in the literature. Research in the SMC area has been focusing on only a limited set of specific SMC problems, while privacy concerned cooperative computations call for SMC studies in a variety of computation domains. Before we can study the problems, we need to identify and define the specific SMC problems for those computation domains. We have developed a framework to facilitate this problem-discovery task. Based on our framework, we have identified and defined a number of new SMC problems for a spectrum of computation domains. Those problems include privacy-preserving database query, privacy-preserving scientific computations, privacy-preserving intrusion detection, privacy-preserving statistical analysis, privacy-preserving geometric computations, and privacy-preserving data mining.The goal of this paper is not only to present our results, but also to serve as a guideline so other people can identify useful SMC problems in their own computation domains.	computational problem;data mining;intrusion detection system;personally identifiable information;privacy;remote database access;secure multi-party computation	Wenliang Du;Mikhail J.

6f144aa40ccde378fe2d6befc5de2c9240960a54	set-valued data anonymization maintaining data utility and data property		Set-valued database publication has been attracting much attention due to its benefit for various applications like recommendation systems and marketing analysis. However, publishing original database directly is risky since an unauthorized party may violate individual privacy by associating and analyzing relations between individuals and set of items in the published database, which is known as identity linkage attack. Generally, an attack is performed based on attacker's background knowledge obtained by a prior investigation and such adversary knowledge should be taken into account in the data anonymization. Various data anonymization schemes have been proposed to prevent the identity linkage attack. However, in existing data anonymization schemes, either data utility or data property is reduced a lot after excessive database modification and consequently data recipients become to distrust the released database.  In this paper, we propose a new data anonymization scheme, called sibling suppression, which causes minimum data utility lost and maintains data properties like database size and the number of records. The scheme uses multiple sets of adversary knowledge and items in a category of adversary knowledge are replaced by other items in the category. Several experiments with real dataset show that our method can preserve data utility with minimum lost and maintain data property as the same as original database.	adversary (cryptography);authorization;data anonymization;distrust;experiment;linkage (software);recommender system;zero suppression	Dedi Gunawan;Masahiro Mambo	2018		10.1145/3164541.3164583	computer network;recommender system;published database;information retrieval;computer science;data property;adversary;market analysis;publishing;distrust;data anonymization	DB	-40.81257341092148	63.943610195062625	111450

The identified security areas comprise protecting hosts against malicious agents, protecting the agent's transmission and protecting agents against malicious hosts. The first two security issues and the protection of the code state of the agent can be solved by applying traditional security techniques. Even though there are some works that manage the data state protection, its implementation is almost unfeasible in terms of performance and complexity.  This paper describes a fast and easy to implement algorithm that a mobile agent can use to encrypt its data during its itinerary. The algorithm only makes use of a bitmap and XOR operations. The algorithm consist of applying XOR operations to the data to be ciphered and a random bitmap, while the map is repeatedly shifted to the right or to the left in order to compute a CRC field for validation against malicious tampering.  The method only uses basic bit operations so that its implementation is very easy to develop. Besides, since it does not use any computationally expensive cryptographic technique (i.e. digital signatures) it is very fast. In this way we manage to have a secure, simple, fast and feasible protection algorithm to protect data while mobile agents are roaming, where simplicity and performance are its better advantages.	information privacy;mobile agent	Jesús Arturo Pérez Díaz;Darío Álvarez Gutiérrez	2001	Electr.

To protect and secure outsourced database, as a part of dynamic web resource while maintaining site’s work, we propose a solution featuring following key ideas. Firstly, we suggest to encrypt database content granularly with order preserving and homomorphic encryptions in order to conduct operation inside unmodified DBMS. Secondly, proposed solution implies presence of trusted intermediate component, responsible for SQL query precessing and site hosting tasks. Our approach has been validated through the implementation of complete web resource infrastructure with encrypted database. While web resource, using currently most popular content management system WordPress, was functioning in normal mode, content of DMBS was secured. In this paper basic ideas of creating secure web resource will be discussed, as long as practical aspects.

However, participants risk their location privacy when reporting data with their actual sensing positions. To address this issue, we adopt e-differential-privacy in Sparse MCS to provide a theoretical guarantee for participants' location privacy regardless of an adversary's prior knowledge. Furthermore, to reduce the data quality loss caused by differential location obfuscation, we propose a privacypreserving framework with three components. First, we learn a data adjustment function to fit the original sensing data to the obfuscated location. Second, we apply a linear program to select an optimal location obfuscation function, which aims to minimize the uncertainty in data adjustment. We also propose a fast approximated variant. Third, we propose an uncertaintyaware inference algorithm to improve the inference accuracy of obfuscated data. Evaluations with real environment and traffic datasets show that our optimal method reduces the data quality loss by up to 42% compared to existing differential privacy methods.	adversary (cryptography);approximation algorithm;crowdsensing;data quality;differential privacy;linear programming;multi categories security;sparse;type inference	Leye Wang;Daqing Zhang;Dingqi Yang;Brian Y.

072899f1ac542a656d7fee7dae4d27a7cb091d83	formal analysis of daa-related apis in tpm 2.0		Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) is a signature scheme that provides a balance between user privacy and authentication in a rea- sonable way. Various DAA schemes are now supported by the latest TPM 2.0 specification. We propose a general symbolic model for DAA schemes and formalize DAA-related APIs in TPM 2.0 specification in applied pi calculus. We present new symbolic definitions of user-controlled trace- ability and non-frameability. Then we propose a novel property of DAA called forward anonymity. The application of our definitions is demon- strated by analyzing the implementation of an ECC-based DAA protocol using APIs proposed by the TPM 2.0 specification. Our analysis finds a weakness in an API which leads to attack against forward anonymity. We propose modifications to the API and verify our properties for the modified API.	trusted platform module	Li Xi;Dengguo Feng	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11698-3_32	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	SE	-35.91970146552636	72.38737613517125	111724
3c863d51766d344a0a7c01b1c23cae2ae41f0a0d	burning zerocoins for fun and for profit: a cryptographic denial-of-spending attack on the zerocoin protocol		Zerocoin (Miers et. al, IEEE S&P’13), designed as an extension to Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, was the first anonymous cryptocurrency proposal which supports large anonymity sets. We identify a cryptographic denial-of-spending attack on the original Zerocoin protocol and a second Zerocoin protocol (Groth and Kohlweiss, EUROCRYPT’15), which enables a network attacker to destroy money of honest users. The attack leads to real-world vulnerabilities in multiple cryptocurrencies, which rely on implementations of the original Zerocoin protocol. The existence of the attack does not contradict the formal security analyses of the two Zerocoin protocols but exposes the lack of an important missing property in the security model of Zerocoin. While the security definitions model that the attacker should not be able to create money out of thin air or steal money from honest users, it does not model that the attacker cannot destroy money of honest users. Fortunately, there are simple fixes for the security model and for both protocols.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;cryptography;zerocoin	Tim Ruffing;Sri Aravinda Krishnan Thyagarajan;Viktoria Ronge;Dominique Schröder	2018	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		computer security;cryptography;denial;business	Security	-43.292120985614446	71.22310267849397	111798

The goal of this work is to organize and conceptualize the existing knowledge in the area of security of biometrics and build a bridge between the formal model of cryptography and the practical view of the signal processing area.

If an intruder obtains the root privilege by taking advantage of system's security hole, he can abuse network reachability of any user of the system to break into other sites. Thus we present a new system design where the authority of users is protected from root by introducing a new user substitution mechanism. However, even if we introduce the new mechanism, on usual UNIX systems, the intruder can get the authority using many other methods for root. We implement the new user substitution mechanism and the mechanisms which prevent the intruder from using such methods in FreeBSD-4.2, and confirm that the system design is effective.	software propagation;unix	Kenji Masui;Masahiko Tomoishi;Naoki Yonezaki	2001		10.1007/3-540-45439-X_37	embedded system;computer science;operating system;authentication;database;distributed computing;computer security	Security	-47.455453421548796	69.42325658598166	112243

The last 10 years has seen considerable interest in digital watermarking, due in large part to concerns about illegal piracy of copyrighted content. In this paper, we consider the following questions: Is the interest warranted? What are the commercial applications of the technology? What scientific progress has been made in the last 10 years? What are the most exciting areas for research? And where might the next 10 years take us? In our opinion, the interest in watermarking is appropriate. However, we expect that copyright applications will be overshadowed by applications such as broadcast monitoring, authentication, and tracking content distributed within corporations. We further see a variety of applications emerging that add value to media, such as annotation and linking content to the Web. These latter applications may turn out to be the most compelling. Considerable progress has been made toward enabling these applications – perceptual modelling, security threats and countermeasures, and the development of a bag of tricks for efficient implementations. Further progress is needed in methods for handling geometric and temporal distortions. We expect other exciting developments to arise from research in informed watermarking. ∗Portions reprinted, with permission, from 2001 IEEE Fourth Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing, 225-230, c ©2001 IEEE [15]	authentication;digital watermarking;distortion;signal processing;world wide web	Ingemar J.

There are a number of cloud service providers (CSPs) available to provide storage services. But, the problems that need to be addressed in a cloud environment are the security and integrity of the data. Ultimately, it is the task of the CSPs to ensure that the data has not been modified and free from security risks. Also the data may be lost because of a server failure. In order to address these problems, a security scheme is proposed that integrates both erasure code and raptor code. The data integrity is ensured using the token values based on erasure and raptor codes. The same codes are used to recover the original data from the cloud server in case of a server failure, as these schemes help to distribute files across several servers.	cloud computing;data integrity;erasure code;raptor code;server (computing);virtual private server	M.

Individuals in a database have to be protected while preseving the usefullnes of the data. In this paper, we provide an overview over the results in the field of database privacy with focus on privacy notions. On the basis of these notions, we provide a framework that allows for the definition meaningful guarantees based on the distribution on privacy breaches and sesitive predicates. Interestingly, these notions do not fulfill the privacy axioms defined by Kifer et al. in [1,2].

545fdf6fc7af5f1cfa8e3b4dd09d593426218964	context hiding multi-key linearly homomorphic authenticators		Demanding computations are increasingly outsourced to cloud platforms. For such outsourced computations, the efficient verifiability of results is a crucial requirement. When sensitive data is involved, the verification of a computation should preserve the privacy of the input values: it should be context hiding. Context hiding verifiability is enabled by existing homomorphic authenticator schemes. However, until now, no context hiding homomorphic authenticator scheme supports multiple independent clients, e.g. multiple keys. Multi-key support is necessary for datasets involving input authenticated by different clients, e.g. multiple hospitals in e-health scenarios. In this paper, we propose the first perfectly context hiding, publicly verifiable multi-key homomorphic authenticator scheme supporting linear functions. Our scheme is provably unforgeable in the standard model, and succinct. Verification time depends only linearly on the number of clients, in an amortized sense.	adversary (cryptography);amortized analysis;asiacrypt;authentication;computation;discrete logarithm;electronic signature;formal verification;homomorphic encryption;lecture notes in computer science;linear function;mercurial;outsourcing;pkc (conference);precomputation;preprocessor;rsa (cryptosystem);requirement;scheme;springer (tank);symposium on theory of computing;verifiable computing;yao graph	Lucas Schabhüser;Denis Butin;Johannes Buchmann	2018	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Security	-40.243849115496	70.09419304455066	113579

The existing schemes are inefficient in practice due to their high bandwidth usage. This paper proposes an asymmetric fingerprinting scheme that is efficient from the bandwidth usage point of view. First, multicast an efficient transport technology for one-to-many communication is exploited, which can reduce the bandwidth usage significantly. Second, symmetric encryption instead of public-key encryption is performed on the multimedia content, which can also reduce the complexity and communication cost.

Cloud computing provides numerous advantages to organizations in terms of improved scalability, lower cost, and flexibility, to name a few. Despite these technical and economical advantages, many potential cloud consumers are still hesitant to adopt cloud computing due to security and privacy concerns. In particular, one of the main factors for the reluctance of organizations to adopt cloud computing is the lack of strong encryption scheme that can ensure the confidentiality of client's data while store in cloud service provider's (CSPs) data centers. With the existing encryption schemes adopted by the CSPs, there is always a possibility that the client's data can be compromised due to insider threats. In this paper, we propose a new scheme capable to secure client information from both insider and outsider threats. In particular, we develop an encryption scheme by combining both symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which provide strong data confidentiality preserving secret key encryption functionalities, including periodically renewable public key certificates through trusted third parties. Due to these functionalities, the data owner can utilize the best secret key encryption schemes while the trusted third party will hold and communicate the secret keys to CSPs on behalf of cloud service users (CSUs).	confidentiality;encryption;trusted third party	Syed S.

9338f1848691efd58f29344ee0dd6d67cbdf2f3d	mimosecco: a middleware for secure cloud storage		The biggest impediment for the adoption of cloud computing practices is the lack of trust in the confidentiality of one’s data in the cloud. The prevalent threat in the cloud computing model are so-called insider attacks. Full data encryption can only solve the problem in the trivial case of backups. Any sophisticated service provided on data requires insight into the structure of that data. One purpose of encryption is to prevent such insights. We introduce the MimoSecco project. In MimoSecco, we are investigating reasonable compromises. We employ two techniques, separation of duties and secure hardware. With separation of duties, we fragment a database and separate the fragments geographically. The goal is to make it infeasible to reconstruct the database from one fragment alone. The secure hardware tokens we employ are hard-to-copy devices which offer encryption, decryption and cryptographically signing of data. The keys used are stored in the tamper-proof hardware device and never leave it. We are in the process of developing a prototypical database adapter that behaves like a SQL database, but stores data securely.	cloud storage;middleware	Dirk Achenbach;Matthias Gabel;Matthias Huber	2011		10.1007/978-0-85729-799-0_20	middleware;middleware;computer network	OS	-41.825943282625474	65.70059691311364	113625

We will develop a formal model for the telegate-based distributive quantum computation. We show that a controlled-controlled-NOT (Toffoli) gate as an elementary gate of the universal quantum computation may be remotely implemented by exploring a high-level quantum system. These remote Toffoli gates cost at most two Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs, whereas four or six EPR pairs are required from the teleportation-based quantum computation or the remote CNOT gate, respectively. Thus, the previous Toffoli gate-based circuit synthesis may be used as an elementary subroutine of this distributed quantum computation.	computation;toffoli gate	Mingxing Luo;Hui-Ran Li	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-48671-0_42	toffoli gate;theoretical computer science;controlled not gate	EDA	-35.192876901182125	74.4138461404637	113956

In this work we present Snake, a fully end-to-end encrypted Online Social Network (OSN) aimed at providing privacy even when faced with a leakage (or forced disclosure) of encrypted data happening to the storage provider . In Snake, we shift the vast majority of the OSN working logic onto the client, preserving usability and scalability in group communications, requiring a simple stateless interface with the storage provider, while retaining acceptable timings on desktop and mobile platforms alike. We validate our proposal implementing Snake as a single-page HTML5 application, and performing performance tests with realistic network latencies and bandwidth figures to demonstrate that our proposal achieves sufficient performance levels to provide a usable, end-to-end encrypted OSN.	encryption;server (computing);stateless protocol	Alessandro Barenghi;Michele Beretta;Alessandro Di Federico;Gerardo Pelosi	2016	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2016.09.005	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-47.8910943715228	64.79874155396934	114348
f5eb6905b54a41df4818e226c6ed9ddb2b27f13d	data transfusion: pairing wearable devices and its implication on security for internet of things		When a wearable device such as a smartwatch is paired with a host device, e.g., a smartphone, it is inevitable that a certain amount of data stored in the host device will be copied to the wearable device for initialization and personalization purposes. This incident may frequently occur with the Internet of Things. However, it is not well known, particularly among users, what type of data and how much of it is actually being copied or retained as a result of device pairing. Thus, it is unclear whether users are properly managing smartphones and smartwatches based on their stored data. In this regard, we coined a new term called data transfusion to describe the phenomenon in which a user experiences data transfer while pairing but without having any knowledge regarding the data. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies that deal with how much sensitive data are transfused regardless of user consent, and how users perceive and behave toward such a phenomenon for smartwatches. As this is a significant issue with the Internet of Things, we tackle this problem in two ways. We first conduct an experimental study of data extraction from commodity devices such as in Android Wear, watchOS, and Tizen platforms, followed by a survey of 205 smartwatch users. The experimental study reveals that large amounts of sensitive data are being transfused without sufficient user notification. The survey demonstrates that users have lower risk perceptions for smartwatches than for smartphones in terms of security and privacy, but they tend to set the same passcode on both devices when needed. Based on the results, we perform risk assessment and discuss possible mitigation measures that involve volatile transfusion for securing the Internet of Things.	android wear;experience;experiment;internet of things;non-volatile memory;password;personalization;risk assessment;smartphone;smartwatch;tizen;wearable computer;wearable technology;watchos	Youngjoo Lee;WonSeok Yang;Taekyoung Kwon	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2859046	password;computer science;personalization;risk management;computer network;wearable technology;internet privacy;android wear;wearable computer;smartwatch;data extraction	Security	-45.83217852986671	61.811941387078384	114653

This is primarily driven by the inherent reliability and convenience of biometric systems over traditional authentication mechanisms (such as passwords or tokens) that can be easily shared, guessed, lost, or stolen. However, the practical implementation raises a number of concerns: Will the acquired traits be used only for the stated purpose? Can someone impersonate a user by acquiring information about a biometric trait? Can someone circumvent or bypass the system? A typical biometric recognition system operates by first storing the features extracted from a given trait (e.g., minutiae from fingerprint, iris code, etc.) as templates in the system’s database and then matching the template features with those extracted from the biometric information presented during subsequent authentication attempts. Like any generic, electronic authentication system, a biometric system is also vulnerable to various system attacks that either exploit the system’s nonsecure infrastructure (such as replay attack, denial of service attack, etc.) or administrative loopholes, also called insider attacks (see Figure 1). Additional vulnerabilities of a biometric system are related to the overt nature of the relevant information (e.g., your face is not a secret!) and limited liveness-detection capabilities of commonplace systems.2 It is not difficult to create a spoof biometric from a biometric image or even a stored template and gain illegitimate access. These systems are also vulnerable to intrinsic failures (also known as zero-effort attacks), leading to incorrect authentication. This is due to the limited individuality and intraclass variations in biometric features. Efforts are underway by the research community to reduce such intrinsic errors by designing salient-feature detectors and robust matchers. Another major vulnerability that stems from the explicit storage of biometric data relates to the loss of user privacy.3, 4 Possible entities that can take advantage of this private information include overzealous and fallible government agencies that can Figure 1.

This problem is closely related to the study of the biometric identification capacity of Willems et al. 2003 and O'Sullivan and Schmid 2002 and the common randomness generation of Ahlswede and Csiszár 1993. In our system two terminals observe biometric enrollment and identification sequences of a number of individuals. It is the goal of these terminals to form a common secret for the sequences that belong to the same individual by interchanging public (helper) messages for all individuals in such a way that the information leakage about the secrets from these helper messages is negligible. It is important to realize that biometric data are unique for individuals and cannot be replaced if compromised. Therefore the helper messages should contain as little as possible information about the biometric data. On the other hand, the second terminal has to establish the identity of the individual who presented his biometric sequence, based on the helper data produced by the first terminal. In this paper we determine the fundamental tradeoff between secret-key rate, identification rate and privacy-leakage rate in biometric identification systems.	access control;authentication;biometric device;biometrics;eddy willems;encryption;information leakage;key (cryptography);public-key cryptography;randomness;secret sharing;spectral leakage;strongly connected component	Tanya Ignatenko;Frans M.

Contrary to traditional online social networks, privacy protection in such networks depends heavily on users' context (time, location, activity, etc.) and their sensitivity to the shared data and context. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms do not adapt well to different data, context and user sensitivities. In this work, we follow a fresh approach for privacy preservation, called privacy-triggered communications; it allows users in such pervasive networks to dynamically regulate their communications based on their context and on the evolution of their privacy in that context. Our initial results show that this is a feasible strategy for privacy management in pervasive social networking scenarios.	mobile device;peer-to-peer;pervasive informatics;privacy;randomized algorithm;real life;requirement;social network	Murtuza Jadliwala;Julien Freudiger;Imad Aad;Jean-Pierre Hubaux;Valtteri Niemi	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks	10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986143	computer science;operating system;mobile device;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network;social network	Mobile	-38.99499863254372	61.45673398584446	114744

During the auditing process, a third party auditor will act on behalf of a cloud service user to validate the security requirements performed by a cloud service provider. Our concrete contribution consists of developing a PIR protocol which is proceeding directly on a log database of encrypted data and allowing to retrieve a sum or a product of multiple encrypted elements. Subsequently, we concretely apply our new form of PIR protocol to a cloud audit use case where searchable encryption is employed to allow additional confidentiality requirements to the privacy of the user. Exemplarily we are considering and evaluating an audit of client accesses to a controlled resource provided by a cloud service provider.	autonomous robot;cloud computing security;confidentiality;cryptography;homomorphic encryption;information technology security audit;personally identifiable information;privacy;private information retrieval;requirement;semiconductor industry;spectral leakage	Louis Tajan;Dirk Westhoff;Christian A.

As part of these protections, Helios produces a cryptographic audit trail that can be used to verify ballots were correctly counted. Cryptographic end-to-end (E2E) election verification schemes of this kind are a promising step toward developing trustworthy electronic voting systems.  In this paper we approach the discussion from the flip-side by exploring the practical potential for threats to be introduced by the presence of a cryptographic audit trail. We conducted a security analysis of the Helios implementation and discovered a range of vulnerabilities and implemented exploits that would: allow a malicious election official to produce arbitrary election results with accepting proofs of correctness; allow a malicious voter to cast a malformed ballot to prevent the tally from being computed; and, allow an attacker to surreptitiously cast a ballot on a voter's behalf. We also examine privacy issues including a random-number generation bias affecting the indistinguishably of encrypted ballots. We reported the issues and worked with the Helios designers to fix them.	correctness (computer science);cryptography;end-to-end encryption;formal verification;helios;privacy;random number generation	Nicholas Chang-Fong;Aleksander Essex	2016		10.1145/2991079.2991106	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-43.52758971424606	73.11130640611054	114897

These domains often involve data of human subjects that are contingent upon strict privacy regulations. Concerns over data privacy make it increasingly difficult to coordinate and conduct large-scale collaborative studies, which typically rely on cross-institution data sharing and joint analysis. Our work here focuses on safeguarding regularized logistic regression, a widely-used statistical model while at the same time has not been investigated from a data security and privacy perspective. We consider a common use scenario of multi-institution collaborative studies, such as in the form of research consortia or networks as widely seen in genetics, epidemiology, social sciences, etc. To make our privacy-enhancing solution practical, we demonstrate a non-conventional and computationally efficient method leveraging distributing computing and strong cryptography to provide comprehensive protection over individual-level and summary data. Extensive empirical evaluations on several studies validate the privacy guarantee, efficiency and scalability of our proposal. We also discuss the practical implications of our solution for large-scale studies and applications from various disciplines, including genetic and biomedical studies, smart grid, network analysis, etc.	algorithmic efficiency;biomedicine;computation (action);confidentiality;contingency (philosophy);data security;distributed computing;evaluation;inference;information sciences;information privacy;logistic regression;machine learning;matrix regularization;numerous;overhead (computing);regulation;scalability;science;social sciences;social network analysis;statistical model;strong cryptography	Wenfa Li;Hongzhe Liu;Peng Yang;Wei Xie	2016		10.1371/journal.pone.0156479	insurance;network analysis;bioinformatics;cryptography	Security	-41.45546981364517	62.7664467383861	114926

However, privacy issues remain a research challenge in the context of fog computing. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fine-grained and privacy-preserving query scheme for fog computing-enhanced location-based services, hereafter referred to as FGPQ. In particular, mobile users can obtain the fine-grained searching result satisfying not only the given spatial range but also the searching content. Detailed privacy analysis shows that our proposed scheme indeed achieves the privacy preservation for the LBS provider and mobile users. In addition, extensive performance analyses and experiments demonstrate that the FGPQ scheme can significantly reduce computational and communication overheads and ensure the low-latency, which outperforms existing state-of-the art schemes. Hence, our proposed scheme is more suitable for real-time LBS searching.	adversary model;biologic preservation;computation (action);dolev–yao model;experiment;extensibility;fog computing;gucy2c protein, human;internet of things;location awareness;location-based service;privacy;question (inquiry);real-time clock	Xue Yang;Fan Yin;Xiaohu Tang	2017		10.3390/s17071611	engineering;latency (engineering);electronic engineering;computer network;internet privacy;overhead (business);location-based service	Mobile	-43.00460747032009	65.28708361267695	115041
6e54ba36667f893ba8ec0d297bce71f670545afa	dynamic authentication protocol using self-powered timers for passive internet of things		Passive Internet of Things (IoT) like radio frequency identification (RFID) tags can be used to offer a wide range of services, such as object tracking or classification, marking ownership, noting boundaries, and indicating identities. While the communication link between a reader of the tag and the authentication server is generally assumed to be secure, the communication link between the reader and participating tags is mostly vulnerable to malicious acts. Many authentication protocols have been proposed in literature, however, they either are vulnerable to certain types of attacks or require prohibitively a large amount of computational resources to be implemented on a passive tag. In this paper, we present variants of a novel authentication protocol that can overcome the security flaws of previous protocols while being well suited to the computational capability of the tags. At the core of the proposed approach is our recently demonstrated self-powered timing devices that can be used for robust time-keeping and synchronization without the need for any external powering. The outputs of the timers are processed using a single hash function on the tag to produce tokens that continuously change with time, while being synchronized to tokens generated by the authentication server. The proposed protocol also incorporates margins of tolerance that make the authentication process robust to any deviations in the timer responses due to fabrication artifacts.	authentication protocol;authentication server;computation;computational resource;data security;encryption;hash function;internet of things;item unique identification;key (cryptography);on-board data handling;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;server (computing);statistical model;timer	Mohamed Hossam Afifi;Liang Zhou;Shantanu Chakrabartty;Jian Ren	2018	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2017.2757918	radio-frequency identification;internet protocol;computer science;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;computer network;internet layer;internet protocol suite;authentication server;authentication protocol;authentication	Security	-46.68858997899206	74.27692620029721	115072
36f988c78002f8382de3425bbe0d0f9a9b5e755e	forward-secure proxy signature and revocation scheme for a proxy signer with multiple original signers	proxy signature;forward security	On many occasions it is required for a single person to take up the responsibilities of many persons for some duration and work on their behalf so that the regular work goes on smoothly. For example in a bank, when majority of the employees need to attend an important meeting during working hours, to avoid disrupting any of the regular activities, one employee may need to play the role of many employees. An accountant may need to play the role of a cashier, asst. manager and cheque clearing officer. In such situations the employee working on behalf of other employees need to be delegated with signing power from the employees who perform the activities regularly. Also, this delegation must be only for some specified time period T and after the elapse of that time period the signing capability must be revoked. The concept of proxy signatures is used here. A proxy signature scheme allows one user to delegate his/her signing capability to another user called a proxy signer in such a way that the latter can sign messages on behalf of the former. After verification the verifier is convinced of the original signer’s agreement on the signed message. Forward-Secure signatures enable the signer to guarantee the security of messages signed in the past even if his secret key is exposed today. We have come up with a forward secure proxy signature and revocation scheme for a proxy signer who is delegated with signing power from multiple original signers. This scheme is based on the popular Bellare-Miner Forwardsecure scheme.	acm transactions on programming languages and systems;antivirus software;broadcast encryption;communications security;computation;digital signature;forward secrecy;information science;information security;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;integer factorization;key (cryptography);lecture notes in computer science;mihir bellare;proxy server;public-key cryptography;requirement;smart card;smoothing;springer (tank)	B.

This basic approach would be sufficient in handling server failure due to natural faults, because when one server fails, data from healthy servers can be used to restore the desired redundancy level. However, in a setting where servers are untrusted and can behave maliciously, data redundancy must be used in tandem with Remote Data Checking (RDC) to ensure that the redundancy level of the storage systems is maintained over time.  All previous RDC schemes for distributed systems impose a heavy burden on the data owner (client) during data maintenance: To repair data at a faulty server, the data owner needs to first download a large amount of data, re-generate the data to be stored at a new server, and then upload this data at a new healthy server. We propose RDC -- SR, a novel RDC scheme for replication-based distributed storage systems. RDC -- SR enables Server-side Repair (thus taking advantage of the premium connections available between a CSP's data centers) and places a minimal load on the data owner who only has to act as a repair coordinator. The main insight behind RDC -- SR is that the replicas are differentiated based on a controllable amount of masking, which offers RDC -- SR flexibility in handling different adversarial strengths. Also, replica generation must be time consuming in order to avoid certain colluding attacks from malicious servers. Our prototype for RDC -- SR built on Amazon AWS validates the practicality of this new approach.	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);amazon web services;clustered file system;data center;data redundancy;database;distributed computing;download;prototype;self-replication;server (computing);server-side;upload	Bo Chen;Reza Curtmola	2013		10.1145/2435349.2435402	real-time computing;engineering;database;computer security	OS	-43.419941245807166	68.58351209315853	115367
6c0056274dbbfe5c4285911bb199e60a342478e1	a flexible hierarchical access control mechanism enforcing extension policies	hierarchical;hash;rbac;mac;dac;access control;elliptic curve cryptosystems	Some specific information or resources only can be accessed by authorized users. Discretionary access control DAC, mandatory access control MAC, and role-based access control RBAC are three main classes of access control policies. MAC and RBAC are more secure than discretionary access control because a system instead of an object's owner determines the policy. MAC is appropriate for multilevel applications with high security requirements such as military ones, while RBAC provides security and business benefits. Most institutions, companies, and governments are multilevel, so relationships between roles or security levels tend to be hierarchical. In this work, an access control mechanism, providing explicit transitive exception and antisymmetric arrangement, is proposed to provide flexible and appropriate solutions to hierarchical relationships. For practicability, no access control policy is strictly constrained in the proposed mechanism such that security classes can be determined according to specific requirements. The proposed mechanism employs an elliptic curve cryptosystem and a two-layer hash approach to ensure security and computation efficiency.

e28817d4b86340023177901d693c681ecce2ac55	towards efficient verifiable conjunctive keyword search for large encrypted database		Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) enables a client to securely outsource large encrypted database to a server while supporting efficient keyword search. Most of the existing works are designed against the honest-but-curious server. That is, the server will be curious but execute the protocol in an honest manner. Recently, some researchers presented various verifiable SSE schemes that can resist to the malicious server, where the server may not honestly perform all the query operations. However, they either only considered single-keyword search or cannot handle very large database. To address this challenge, we propose a new verifiable conjunctive keyword search scheme by leveraging accumulator. Our proposed scheme can not only ensure verifiability of search result even if an empty set is returned but also support efficient conjunctive keyword search with sublinear overhead. Besides, the verification cost of our construction is independent of the size of search result. In addition, we introduce a sample check method for verifying the completeness of search result with a high probability, which can significantly reduce the computation cost on the client side. Security and efficiency evaluation demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only can achieve high security goals but also has a comparable performance.

We provide a general framework on leakage resilience in game theoretic setting and show that it is of each party's interest not to deviate from the protocol, i.e., their behavior is rational which assures them the highest incentive. We show that it is enough for a Public Key Encryption (PKE) scheme to be Computational Threat-Free Nash Equilibrium (CTFNE) for being leakage resilient. To be specific, CTFNE is not guaranteed if an internal state of a CCLA1 (Chosen Ciphertext with Leakage Attack)-secure Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) of PKE is updated using a poor randomness with low-entropy. This work thus allows us for arguing about the strategic behavior of players in protocols where leakage is allowed.	ciphertext;computation;cryptography;encryption;game theory;information leakage;key encapsulation;nash equilibrium;randomness;spectral leakage	Mohammad Shahriar Rahman;Keita Emura;Shinsaku Kiyomoto	2016	2016 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA	10.1109/TrustCom.2016.0303	engineering;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-38.88437467939105	73.09818939921121	115453

Our scheme is immune to advances of cryptography (which may suddenly ruin any system depending solely of cryptographic assumptions). It is resilient to collusion attacks, which are frequently the Achilles’ heel of schemes based on cryptography. It provides a high level of privacy protection of the users. On the downside, it requires memory modules as well as time consuming initialization of PUFs by the broadcaster. Security of the scheme is based on the assumption of randomness of PUF’s output and their unclonability.	broadcast encryption;cryptography;dimm;heel-ball index;high-level programming language;physical unclonable function;privacy;randomness	Lukasz Krzywiecki;Miroslaw Kutylowski	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21599-5_4	physical unclonable function;anonymity;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-42.85744991646096	73.66896797753009	115711
483c69bd466959adcde8b4490cf5aa04982772f0	improving the security of a public auditing scheme for multiple-replica dynamic data		Cloud auditing is a significant technique for determining the security of data owners’ data in cloud. However, multiple-replica places greater demands on cloud auditing, where not only the integrity of each data replica but also the number of replicas should be checked. Moreover, it is also significant to support dynamical updating for multiple-replica data. Therefore, how to achieve secure and effective multiple-replica dynamic data auditing is a cutting-edge issue for cloud auditing. Recently, an efficient multi-replica dynamic data auditing scheme (IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics u0026 Security, DOI: 10.1109/TIFS.2014.2384391) was presented to address this issue. Unfortunately, there is a security defect in this protocol, as we demonstrate in this paper. Specifically, a dishonest cloud storage provider can store an aggregation of all data copies instead of each replica itself without being detected by an auditor. Accordingly, we suggest a solution to resolve the problem while preserving all the properties of the original protocol.

Girling's strategy for one-time keywords for authentication forwarding is combined with a proxy login mechanism to obtain a reliable method for network authentication that does not depend on the transmission of passwords. The authentication mechanism is used as the basis for a scheme for network-wide access control lists allowing a user to grant access rights to any other user in a network. These proposals are described in the context of the Digital Network Architecture (DNA), but are in fact applicable to any packet switched network.	authentication;discretionary access control	Paul A.

0b8ce848a4a51d0aca4ef2b73fd4e68076645b71	collusion-free protocols	location analysis;cooperative games;core solutions	"""Consider the clever cheating that occurred during an FCC spectrum auction in 1995 (see Cramton and J. Schwartz '02 for a history). Auction rules forbade companies from openly colluding to divide the spectrum cheaply; nonetheless, the major players circumvented the rules by using the least significant digits of their public messages to coordinate their overall bidding strategies. In other words, these parties used the auction protocol itself to cheat.  Standard notions of security for cryptographic protocols do not prevent this type of cheating. In this talk, we propose the idea of collusion-free protocols. Such protocols do not create any new opportunities---such as using the protocol messages and headers themselves---for malicious participants to coordinate their cheating during the execution of the protocol. We discuss both positive and negative results regarding this notion by showing that it is possible to construct such protocols but special communication assumptions are provably necessary. The conceptual barrier to achieving this novel security property is captured in the following paradox: it is widely acknowledged that players must use randomness to pick their messages in any secure protocol, but the presence of randomized messages also enables perfect steganography and thus perfect collusion.  We give an overview of two conceptually different approaches to overcome this paradox. The first method is based on the concept of verifiable determinism. This is a way to organize communication so that a player's next message is unpredictable, but once the message has been sent, everyone can verify that it was the one-and-only such message that an honest player could have sent. As a result, steganography becomes impossible. The second method takes an opposite approach: players generate arbitrary messages but send them to each other via a mediator who """"re-randomizes""""' the messages to eliminate steganographic channels. The goal is to design protocols where collusion-freeness is guaranteed as long as the mediator is honest, while standard security guarantees hold if the mediator is dishonest. This new approach enables us to use a less exotic communication channel to construct protocols that achieve a strong collusion-free property.  This talk is based on 4 papers with the following set of coauthors: Matt Lepinski and Silvio Micali, Joel Alwen and Ivan Visconti, and Alwen, Jonathan Katz, Yehuda Lindell, Giuseppe Persiano, and Visconti."""	channel (communications);communications protocol;cryptographic protocol;formal verification;matchware mediator;randomized algorithm;randomness;significant figures;steganography;technological determinism	Abhi Shelat	2010		10.1145/1807406.1807497	computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	Theory	-38.42551344500421	73.73325815208015	116458

It also proposes SK-L2AM (Symmetric Key-Based Local-Lighted Authentication Mechanism) based on simple key which reduces code calculation and authentication delay costs. Moreover, fast handoff technique was also adopted to reduce handoff delay time in PMIPv6 and X-FPMIPv6 (eXtension of Fast Handoff for PMIPv6) was used to support global mobility. In addition, AX-FPMIPv6 (Authentication eXtension of Fast Handoff for PMIPv6) is proposed which integrated SK-L2AM and X-FPMIPv6 by applying Piggybacks method to reduce the overhead of authentication and signaling. The AX-FPMIPv6 technique suggested in this paper shows that this technique is better than the existing schemes in authentication and handoff delay according to the performance analysis.	authentication;mobile ip;proxy mobile ipv6	Illkyun Im;Young-Hwa Cho;Jae-Young Choi;Jongpil Jeong	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31128-4_40	hash function;computer science;internet privacy;programming language;computer security;algorithm;computer network	Mobile	-48.100626962358	73.28226532677897	116660

The storage system must be secured against passive and active types of attacks for efficient protection of the stored data. The aim is achieving satisfactory level of security of the storage system and at the same time maintaining the desired level of reliability, which arises when there are node failures. In our work we apply this concept in a Twin-code framework, in presence of an intruder who can observe and modify the stored data on the networks nodes. We are making a new code construction, which is simultaneously secure against passive and active attacks and at the same time satisfies particular bound for reliability. Moreover, for this construction we are proving the level of security under the above mentioned constraints.	adversary (cryptography);clustered file system;code;computer data storage;hash function;storage area network	Ninoslav Marina;Natasha Paunkoska;Aneta Velkoska	2016	2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)	10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765381	computer science;information security;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	OS	-43.03808533456751	68.6799013168672	116763

In Nojoumian et al.’s scheme (called SSS), the number of shares allocated to each party depends on the player’s reputation and the way he interacts with other parties. In other words, weights of the players are periodically adjusted such that cooperative participants receive more shares compared to non-cooperative parties. As our contribution, we propose an ideal social secret sharing (Ideal-SSS) in which the size of each player’s share is equal to the size of the secret. This property will be achieved using hierarchical threshold secret sharing. We show that the proposed scheme is secure in a passive adversary model. Compared to SSS, our proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of the share size, communication complexity and computational complexity of the “sharing” protocol. However, the “social tuning” and “reconstruction” protocols of SSS are computationally more efficient than those of the proposed scheme. Depending on the number of execution of social tuning protocol, this might be a reasonable compromise because the reconstruction protocol is executed only once throughout the secret’s lifetime.

But this service is not very used because merchants and consumers do not trust in contracting by electronic means. For time we already have technical solutions that should allow to give trust to the actors implied in this new scenario. But the lack of international standards and of an appropriate juridical mark, suppose a serious restraint to the contracting by electronic means. Well then, in recent years we can observe some legislative initiatives in the European Union to give full juridical effect to electronic contracting. With these two elements already in course, we believe that a last step will be necessary: to assess the adaptation of the technical solutions regarding the enacted legislation. In this paper, juridical and technical analysis of contract signing protocols is carried out. Besides, we present a modified version of a previous optimistic fair protocol for contract signing.	acknowledgement (data networks);digital signature;directive (programming);e-commerce;ftc fair information practice;fairness measure;formal verification;requirement;trusted third party	Josep Lluís Ferrer-Gomila;Apollònia Martínez Nadal;Magdalena Payeras-Capellà;Llorenç Huguet i Rotger	2002		10.1007/3-540-45705-4_36	law;computer security	Security	-43.41481431236542	71.68994274816212	117358

The pseudonyms of a patient are generated from the patient’s secrets and each of them is used as the index of an EHR entry of the patient. An encryption key derived from the pseudonym can be used to encrypt the corresponding EHR entry. The pseudonyms can also be used for the patient proving the ownership of the EHR without disclosing the identity of the patient.

6167bae6148e3d20193f59128417e8da1363a2c2	privacy-preserving publish/subscribe: efficient protocols in a distributed model		We consider the problem of modeling and designing efficient and privacy-preserving publish/subscribe protocols in a distributed model where parties can act as publishers or subscribers or both, and there are no brokers or other types of parties. The problem is particularly challenging as privacy demands on such protocols come with efficiency limitations; most notably, the publisher must send messages as long as the publications to all parties, and the cryptographic techniques to perform the publish/subscribe match need to be based on asymmetric cryptographic operation which are known to be less efficient than their symmetric counterpart. Our main result is a distributed publish/subscribe protocol which addresses and essentially nullifies the impact of both efficiency limitations, without sacrificing the required privacy properties. Our construction is based on very efficient design of a novel cryptographic tool, of independent interest, called ‘hybrid conditional oblivious transfer protocol’, as it resembles hybrid encryption, where asymmetric encryption is only used to transfer a short key, which enables (much more efficient) symmetric encryption of a long message.	asiacrypt;authorization;computation;confidentiality;cryptographic primitive;diffie–hellman key exchange;digital signature;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;elisa bertino;encryption;eurocrypt;goto;hybrid cryptosystem;lecture notes in computer science;oblivious transfer;precomputation;privacy;provable security;public-key cryptography;publish–subscribe pattern;springer (tank);stan frankel;symmetric-key algorithm;wright (adl)	Giovanni Di Crescenzo;Brian A.

8f0502461693d016c6a46b73ad20f4fc23f45c54	on efficiently transferring the linear secret-sharing scheme matrix in ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption		Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption(CP-ABE) is a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data, in which attributes are used to describe a user’s credentials and a party encrypting data determines a policy over attributes for who can decrypt. In CP-ABE schemes, access policy is attached to the ciphertext to be the input of the decryption algorithm. An access policy can be expressed in terms of monotone boolean formula or monotone access structure, and can be realized by a linear secretsharing scheme(LSSS). In recent provably secure and efficient CP-ABE schemes, the LSSS induced from monotone span program(MSP) is used, where the LSSS is a matrix whose rows are labeled by attributes. And a general algorithm for converting a boolean formula into corresponding LSSS matrix is described recently. However, when there are threshold gates in the access structure, the number of rows of the LSSS matrix generated by the algorithm will be unnecessary large, and consequently the ciphertext size is unnecessary large. In this paper, we give a more general and efficient algorithm that the number of rows of the LSSS matrix is as small as possible. And by some tricks, the boolean formula acts as the label function, so that only the boolean formula needs to be attached to the ciphertext, which decreases the communication cost drastically.	access control;access structure;algorithm;attribute-based encryption;ciphertext;credential;matrix multiplication;provable security;monotone	Zhen Liu;Zhenfu Cao	2010	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		ciphertext;theoretical computer science;matrix (mathematics);computer science;secret sharing;attribute-based encryption	Crypto	-40.56817491020259	69.00539203233112	117880

22a12e59bf49873d11c35c4d3d1beca144a80198	conditionally secure multiparty computation using secret sharing scheme for n < 2k-1 (short paper)		Typically, when secrecy multiplication is performed in multiparty computation using Shamir's (k,n) threshold secret sharing scheme, the result is a polynomial with degree of 2k-2 instead of k-1 This causes a problem where, in order to reconstruct a multiplication result, the number of polynomials needed will increase from k to 2k-1. In this paper, we propose a multiparty computation that uses a secret sharing scheme that is secure against a product-sum operation but does not increase the degree of polynomial of the output. We prove that all combinations of the basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) can be performed securely using this scheme. We also propose three preconditions and finally show that our proposed method is information-theoretic secure against a passive adversary.	adversary (cryptography);information theory;polynomial;precondition;secret sharing;secure communication;secure multi-party computation	Ahmad Akmal Aminuddin Mohd Kamal;Keiichi Iwamura	2017	2017 15th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)	10.1109/PST.2017.00034	computer security;computer science;subtraction;degree of a polynomial;cryptography;adversary;multiplication;polynomial;secure multi-party computation;distributed computing;secret sharing	Crypto	-39.803009029968926	74.50742027950352	118184

Our proposed DRM architecture provides scalability of business model and allows to make proper business strategies for different regions and cultures. The encrypted digital content sent by a package server can only be decrypted by the DRM client and is protected from attacks by other parties/servers in the system. Our key management protects the key used to encrypt a digital content during its delivery from the package server to the DRM client, not only from purchasers but also from the distribution servers and the license server. The IBE enables efficiency gains in computation time and storage over the existing certificate-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based approaches as no certificate management and verification is needed by the entities in the system.	access structure;key management	Ratna Dutta;Dheerendra Mishra;Sourav Mukhopadhyay	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22726-4_24	database;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-44.784785746680086	69.40727661692898	118253

Therefore, protecting the confidentiality of such data has become a very challenging issue. The conventional way to achieve data confidentiality is to encrypt the data via asymmetric or symmetric encryptions before outsourcing. However, this is computationally inefficient because encryption/decryption operations are time-consuming. In recent years, a few DOC schemes based on secret sharing have emerged due to their low computational complexity. However, Dautrich and Ravishankar pointed out that most of them are insecure against certain kinds of collusion attacks. In this paper, we proposed a novel DOC scheme based on Shamir’s secret sharing to overcome the security issues of these schemes. Our scheme can allow an authorized data user to recover all data files in a specified subset at once rather than one file at a time as required by other schemes that are based on secret sharing. Our thorough analyses showed that our proposed scheme is secure and that its performance is satisfactory.

Unlike most classical cryptography, the security of the protocol does not rely on the amount of computations required to find the encryption key, but on physical properties of the transmission medium (i.e., quantum mechanical properties). The session key shared between participants is concealed from the trusted third party while the participants trust the third party regarding the authentication part. Thus, the proposed system will be preferable for network systems in/between institutions, which deal with highly sensitive information (e.g., military bases, research facilities, hospitals).	adversary (cryptography);authentication;computation;cryptography;demultiplexer (media file);encryption;faraday cage;information sensitivity;key (cryptography);key distribution;polarizer;quantum mechanics;random number generation;secure communication;session key;trusted third party	Yoshito Kanamori;Bogdan Hoanca;Seong-Moo Yoo	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.354	photonics;trusted third party;computer science;cryptography;information security;key-agreement protocol;authentication;internet privacy;key distribution;computer security;quantum cryptography;computer network	Security	-41.29886490048696	73.94337570956384	118300

In order to incentivize the legal distribution of these contents and prevent the network from free riders, we propose a charging model where distributors become merchants and receivers become customers. To help in the advertisement of digital contents and collection of payment details, an intermediary agent is introduced. An underlying P2P payment protocol presented in [1] is applied to this scenario without total trust on the intermediary agent.	centralized computing;digital distribution;emergence;entity;grid computing;peer-to-peer;requirement;server (computing);trust (emotion);usb hub	Jose Antonio Onieva;Jianying Zhou;Javier López	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39927-8_11	computer science;peer-to-peer	ECom	-45.94646299441871	61.20497638381799	118657

1cc30b8d6037e08615e6ffab5d1b0a51b90d94b2	new biometrics-based authentication scheme for multi-server environment in critical systems		The critical system is an open control system using distributed computing method and possessing increasing levels of autonomy. Due to openness of the network, the system is vulnerable various attacks. To enhance its security, the mutual authentication among the server, the user and the registration is essential. In last several years, many biometrics-based authentication schemes for critical systems based on the client-server environment were proposed for practical applications. However, those schemes are not suitable for critical systems based on the multi-server environment. To guarantee secure communication in critical systems based on the multi-server environment, we propose a new biometrics-based authentication scheme for the multi-server environment. Security analysis and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme avoids security weaknesses in previous schemes while additional cost is small.	authentication;biometrics;server (computing)	Han Shen;Chongzhi Gao;Debiao He;Libing Wu	2015	J.

It eliminates redundant data at the file or subfile level and identifies duplicate content by its cryptographically secure hash signature (i.e., collision-resistant fingerprint), which is shown to be much more computationally efficient than the traditional compression approaches in large-scale storage systems. In this paper, we first review the background and key features of data deduplication, then summarize and classify the state-of-the-art research in data deduplication according to the key workflow of the data deduplication process. The summary and taxonomy of the state of the art on deduplication help identify and understand the most important design considerations for data deduplication systems. In addition, we discuss the main applications and industry trend of data deduplication, and provide a list of the publicly available sources for deduplication research and studies. Finally, we outline the open problems and future research directions facing deduplication-based storage systems.	algorithmic efficiency;collision resistance;cryptographic hash function;data deduplication;digital data;fingerprint	Wen Xia;Hong Jiang;Dan Feng;Fred Douglis;Philip Shilane;Yu Hua;Min Fu;Yucheng Zhang;Yukun Zhou	2016	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571298	data compression;computer vision;search engine indexing;entropy;data deduplication;computer science;information security;data mining;database;internet privacy;redundancy;fingerprint recognition	OS	-46.32523572076807	67.7100986163533	118847

They claimed that their protocol is efficient and resistant to prominent security attacks. The careful analysis of this study proves that Mun et al.'s protocol is susceptible to several attacks such as replay attack, man-in-middle attack, user impersonation attack, privileged insider attack, denial-of-service attack, no login phase and imperfect mutual authentication phase. In addition, this study proposes an enhanced lightweight authentication with key-agreement protocol for mobile networks based on elliptic curve cryptography using smart cards. The proposed protocol is lightweight and perfectly suitable for real-time applications as it accomplishes simple one-way hash function, message authentication code and exclusive-OR operation. Furthermore, it achieves all the eminent security properties and is resistant to various possible attacks. The security analysis and comparison section demonstrates that the proposed protocol is robust compared with Mun et al.'s protocol.	authentication;key-agreement protocol;smart card	Goutham Reddy Alavalapati;Eun-Jun Yoon;Ashok Kumar Das;Kee-Young Yoo	2016	IET Information Security	10.1049/iet-ifs.2015.0390	message authentication code;man-in-the-middle attack;otway–rees protocol;smart card;reflection attack;universal composability;length extension attack;challenge–response authentication;computer science;interlock protocol;authentication protocol;key-agreement protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;wide mouth frog protocol;elliptic curve cryptography;internet privacy;computer security;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;computer network	Security	-45.93312060742931	73.72912690155418	119205

Rating releases AT (Attribute Table) and IDT (ID Table) based on different sensitivity coefficients for different attributes. This approach not only protects privacy for multiple sensitive attributes, but also keeps a large amount of correlations of the micro data. We develop algorithms for computing AT and IDT that obey the privacy requirements for multiple sensitive attributes, and maximize the utility of published data as well. We prove both theoretically and experimentally that our method has better performance than the conventional privacy preserving methods on protecting privacy and maximizing the utility of published data. To quantify the utility of published data, we propose a new measurement named classification measurement.	algorithm;coefficient;convergence insufficiency;curse of dimensionality;experiment;interrupt descriptor table;privacy;requirement	Jinfei Liu;Jun Luo;Joshua Zhexue Huang	2011	2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops	10.1109/ICDMW.2011.144	microdata;privacy software;information privacy;computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy	DB	-40.83998954349112	63.55365686845133	119245

We discuss the two leading contactless EMV payment protocols (Visa’s payWave and MasterCard’s PayPass). Stopping a relay attack against cards using these protocols is hard: either the overhead of the communication is low compared to the (cryptographic) computation by the card or the messages can be cached before they are requested by the terminal. We propose a solution that fits within the EMV Contactless specification to make a payment protocol that is resistant to relay attacks from commercial off-the-shelf devices, such as mobile phones. This solution does not require significant changes to the cards and can easily be added to existing terminals. To prove that our protocol really does stop relay attacks, we develop a new method of automatically checking defences against relay attacks using the applied pi-calculus and the tool ProVerif.	cs games;communications security;computation;contactless payment;cryptographic nonce;cryptography;distributed computing;exception handling;fits;francis;gerhard j. woeginger;https;leo (computer);lecture notes in computer science;mobile phone;near field communication;new super luigi u;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;proverif;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;relay attack;schmidt decomposition;springer (tank);virtual instrument software architecture;π-calculus	Tom Chothia;Flavio D.

It is natural to expect that if we have a leakage-resilient primitive tolerating $\ell$ bits of leakage, we can take $n$ copies of it to form a system tolerating $n\ell$ bits of leakage. In this paper, we show that this is not always true. We construct a public key encryption system which is secure when at most $\ell$ bits are leaked, but if we take $n$ copies of the system and encrypt a share of the message under each using an $n$-out-of-$n$ secret-sharing scheme, leaking $n\ell$ bits renders the system insecure. Our results hold either in composite order bilinear groups under a variant of the subgroup decision assumption \emph{or} in prime order bilinear groups under the decisional linear assumption. We note that the $n$ copies of our public key systems share a common reference parameter.	bilinear filtering;decision linear assumption;encryption;expect;public-key cryptography;rendering (computer graphics);secret sharing;spectral leakage	Allison Bishop;Brent Waters	2010	2010 IEEE 51st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science	10.1109/FOCS.2010.57	40-bit encryption;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;key distribution;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;psychological resilience;56-bit encryption	Theory	-39.414516374516666	73.79816245840193	119545
146db899dcd97132f6d8380ce784587ea6e7c842	privacy preserving consensus-based economic dispatch in smart grid systems		Economic dispatch is a well-known optimization problem in smart grid systems which aims at minimizing the total cost of power generation among generation units while maintaining some system constraints. Recently, some distributed consensus-based approaches have been proposed to replace traditional centralized calculation. However, existing approaches fail to protect privacy of individual units like cost function parameters, generator constraints, output power levels, etc. In this paper, we show an attack against an existing consensus-based economic dispatch algorithm from [16] assuming semi-honest non-colluding adversaries. Then we propose a simple solution by combining a secure sum protocol and the consensus-based economic dispatch algorithm that guarantees data privacy under the same attacker model. Our Privacy Preserving Economic Dispatch (PPED) protocol is information-theoretically secure.

To explore this potential, we propose the Konfidi system. Konfidi uses PGP connections to determine authenticity, and topical trust connections described in RDF to compute inferred trust values. Between yourself and some person X whom you do not know, Konfidi works to find a path of cryptographic PGP signatures to assure the identity of X, and estimates a trust rating by an algorithm that operates along the trust paths that connect you to X. The trust paths are formed from public personto-person trust ratings that are maintained by those individuals. We discuss the design of the network and system architecture and the current state of implementation.	algorithm;cryptography;email filtering;pretty good privacy;resource description framework;signature;systems architecture;web of trust	David Brondsema;Andrew Schamp	2006			rdf;high voltage;insulator (electricity);optoelectronics;materials science;bushing;adapter (computing);electrical conductor	Security	-45.87541835637145	64.16531616677867	119622
4fdc211bbdfdf66f5a0435ee72b8dd6ec38a6662	official arbitration with secure cloud storage application		Static and dynamic proof of storage schemes have been proposed for use in secure cloud storage scenarios. In this setting, a client outsources storage of her data to a server, who may, willingly or not, corrupt the data (e.g., due to hardware or software failures), or delete infrequently accessed parts to save space. Most of the existing schemes only solve part of this problem: The client may ask for a cryptographic proof of integrity from the server. But what happens if this proof fails to verify? We argue that in such a case, both the client and the server should be able to contact an official court, providing cryptographic proofs, so that the Judge can resolve this dispute. We show that this property is stronger than what has been known as public verifiability in the sense that official arbitration should handle a malicious client as well. We clearly show this formalization difference, and then present multiple schemes that work for various static and dynamic storage solutions in a generic way. We implement our schemes and show that they are very efficient, diminishing the validity of arguments against their use, where the overhead for adding the ability to resolve such disputes at a court is only 2 ms and 80 bytes for each update on the stored data, using standard desktop hardware. Finally, we note that disputes may arise in many other situations, such as when two parties exchange items (e.g., e-commerce) or agree on something (e.g., contract-signing). We show that it is easy to extend our official arbitration protocols for a general case, including dynamic authenticated data structures.	authentication;byte;cloud storage;cryptographic hash function;cryptography;data structure;desktop computer;e-commerce;formal verification;memory management;overhead (computing);server (computing)	Alptekin Küpçü	2015	Comput.

A password manager is used to address this security-convenience dilemma by storing and retrieving multiple existing passwords using one master password. On the other hand, a password manager liberates human brain by enabling people to generate strong passwords without worry about memorizing them. While a password manager provides a convenient and secure way to managing multiple passwords, it centralizes the passwords storage and shifts the risk of passwords leakage from distributed service providers to a software or token authenticated by a single master password. Concerned about this one master password based security, biometrics could be used as a second factor for authentication by verifying the ownership of the master password. However, biometrics based authentication is more privacy concerned than a non-biometric password manager. In this paper we propose a cloud password manager scheme exploiting privacy enhanced biometrics, which achieves both security and convenience in a privacy-enhanced way. The proposed password manager scheme relies on a cloud service to synchronize all local password manager clients in an encrypted form, which is efficient to deploy the updates and secure against untrusted cloud service providers.	authentication;biometrics;cloud computing;encryption;master password;password manager;privacy;spectral leakage;web service	Bian Yang;Huiguang Chu;Guoqiang Li;Slobodan Petrovic;Christoph Busch	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering	10.1109/IC2E.2014.91	zero-knowledge password proof;cognitive password;password policy;s/key;password psychology;passphrase;salt;microsoft office password protection;business;internet privacy;key derivation function;one-time password;key stretching;syskey;world wide web;password;computer security;hmac-based one-time password algorithm;password strength;password cracking	Security	-43.60176211265274	67.86105733269491	119824

Thus, a cryptographic protocol should be offered to ensure the legitimacy of both clients and servers, and to provide communication confidentiality. In the past, a large number of ID-based mutual authentication and key agreement (ID-MAKA) protocols have been proposed regarding this issue. Several circumstances require a revocation mechanism to revoke misbehaving/compromised clients and servers before their intended expiration dates. To do so, the existing ID-MAKA protocols generally adopt a black/white list to revoke/permit clients for access authorization. So far, no work addresses the revocation problem on servers in the sense that clients should be notified to avoid malicious services or applications provided by revoked servers. In this letter, we propose the first list-free ID-MAKA protocol with an efficient revocation mechanism for multiserver architectures. Compared with previously proposed protocols, our protocol possesses three main merits. First, it provides a simple revocation mechanism to solve the management problem of both compromised clients and servers. Second, neither clients nor servers need to keep any black/white list. Finally, it is well suitable for mobile clients by performance analysis and experimental data.	authentication and key agreement (protocol);authorization;confidentiality;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;key-agreement protocol;malware;mutual authentication;profiling (computer programming);whitelist	Yuh-Min Tseng;Sen-Shan Huang;Tung-Tso Tsai;Jia-Hua Ke	2016	IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing	10.1109/TETC.2015.2392380	communications protocol;computer science;operating system;mobile device;authentication;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;computer security;server;computer network	Security	-45.82709245876968	72.73579163921102	120226

However, mining the distorted database can be orders of magn itude more time-consuming as compared to mining the original database. In this paper, we a ddress this issue and demonstrate that by (a) generalizing the distortion process to perform s y bol-specific distortion, (b) appropriately chooosing the distortion parameters, and (c) a pplying a variety of optimizations in the reconstruction process, runtime efficiencies that are w ell within an order of magnitude of undistorted mining can be achieved.	association rule learning;data mining;distortion;emoticon;experiment;norm (social);privacy;window of opportunity	Shipra Agrawal;Vijay Krishnan;Jayant R.

For example, two organizations contemplating a merger may want to know how common their customer bases are so that they may better assess the benefits of the merger. Another example is a database of people who are forbidden from a certain activity by regulators, may need to be compared to a list of people engaged in that activity. The autonomous entities who wish to carry out the record matching computation are often reluctant to fully share their data; they fear losing control over its subsequent dissemination and usage, or they want to insure privacy because the data is proprietary or confidential, and/or they are cautious simply because privacy laws forbid its disclosure or regulate the form of that disclosure. In such cases, the problem of carrying out the linkage computation without full data exchange has been called private record linkage. Previous private record linkage techniques have made use of a third party. We provide efficient techniques for private record linkage that improve on previous work in that (1) our techniques make no use of a third party, and (2) they achieve much better performance than previous schemes in terms of their execution time while maintaining acceptable quality of output compared to nonprivacy settings. Our protocol consists of two phases. The first phase primarily produces candidate record pairs for matching, by carrying out a very fast (but not accurate) matching between such pairs of records.

An LTS can increase the risks to the privacy and security of individuals. Previous studies have failed to distinguish between losses and violations of privacy when the locations of individuals are recorded by an LTS. We argue that individual privacy is threatened not by the collection of public location information but by the centralization of aggregated information, and by the combination of location information with other personal information. Further, informed consent should be required when the collection of information might cause a violation of privacy.	location-based service;personally identifiable information;privacy;tracking system	Jessa Liying Wang;Michael C.

We have defined an open architecture that processes Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) in smartcards, which is the standard defined by IETF1 and IEEE-8022 committees for users’ authentication in various network environments like Wi-Fi, WiMax, or IPSEC.3 These tamper resistant devices are generally considered as the most trusted computing platforms. They have been selected by the DoD4 for military ID cards, by the Belgium government for citizen ID cards, and they will be included in US and European passports. Although secure, javacards are cheap and manufactured by many companies. We present and analyze results obtained with five different smartcards, for two authentication scenari. The first works with an asymmetric algorithm (EAP-TLS, a transparent transport of the well known SSL5 standard), the second uses a pre-share key scheme (EAP-PSK) based on the AES algorithm and the One-Key CBC MAC function (OMAC), which is under consideration by NIST6 for standardization. We demonstrate that this open and flexible approach, is working with existing components, although performances enhancement is necessary.	algorithm;extensible authentication protocol;java card;open architecture;performance;pre-shared key;progressive enhancement;public-key cryptography;scenari;smart card;tamper resistance;transport layer security;trusted computing;whole earth 'lectronic link;wireless security	Pascal Urien;Mesmin Dandjinou	2005		10.1007/978-0-387-49690-0_6	chip authentication program;direct anonymous attestation;authentication protocol;generic bootstrapping architecture;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;wireless lan controller;internet privacy;protected extensible authentication protocol;computer security;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;computer network	Security	-47.019855116794034	73.23618651663669	120612

On a practical level, we want to enable only authorized users to access an internal wireless network—while also permitting appropriate users to delegate internal access to external guests, and doing this all with standard client software. On a deeper level, PKI needs to be part of this emerging information infrastructure—since sharing secrets is not workable. However, the traditional approach to PKI—with a centralized hierarchy based on global names and heavy-weight X.509 certificates—has often proved cumbersome. On this level, we want to explore alternative PKI structures that might overcome these barriers. By using SPKI/SDSI delegation on top of X.509 certificates within EAP-TLS authentication, we provide a flexible, decentralized solution to guest access that reflects real-world authorization flow, without requiring guests to download nonstandard client software. Within the “living laboratory” of Dartmouth’s wireless network, this project lets us solve real problem with wireless networking, while also experimenting with trust flows and testing the limits of current tools.	access network;authentication;authorization;centralized computing;client (computing);credential;download;experiment;experimental system;fits;living lab;public key certificate;public key infrastructure;radius;server (computing);simple public-key infrastructure;transport layer security;ws-trust;x.509	Venus L.

We use this framework to conduct a comparative information-theoretic analysis of two biometric systems that are based on linear error correction codes, namely fuzzy commitment and secure sketches. We derive upper bounds for the probability of false rejection (PFR) and false acceptance (PFA) for these systems. We use mutual information to quantify the information leaked about a user's biometric identity, in the scenario where one or multiple biometric enrollments of the user are fully or partially compromised. We also quantify the probability of successful attack (PSA) based on the compromised information. Our analysis reveals that fuzzy commitment and secure sketch systems have identical PFR, PFA, PSA, and information leakage, but secure sketch systems have lower storage requirements. We analyze both single-factor (keyless) and two-factor (key-based) variants of secure biometrics, and consider the most general scenarios in which a single user may provide noisy biometric enrollments at several access control devices, some of which may be subsequently compromised by an attacker. Our analysis highlights the revocability and reusability properties of key-based systems and exposes a subtle design trade-off between reducing information leakage from compromised systems and preventing successful attacks on systems whose data have not been compromised.	access control;biometrics;code;ecc memory;error detection and correction;information leakage;information theory;multi-factor authentication;mutual information;polar surface area;predictive failure analysis;privacy;rejection sampling;requirement;spectral leakage	Ye Wang;Shantanu Rane;Stark C.

To be more flexible, the decryption time interval associated with a ciphertext can be adjusted on demand by a semi-trusted server.

02c20353e2db867eac0952215b2e4edc718a2f2b	pufferfish privacy mechanisms for correlated data		Many modern databases include personal and sensitive correlated data, such as private information on users connected together in a social network, and measurements of physical activity of single subjects across time. However, differential privacy, the current gold standard in data privacy, does not adequately address privacy issues in this kind of data.  This work looks at a recent generalization of differential privacy, called Pufferfish, that can be used to address privacy in correlated data. The main challenge in applying Pufferfish is a lack of suitable mechanisms. We provide the first mechanism -- the Wasserstein Mechanism -- which applies to any general Pufferfish framework. Since this mechanism may be computationally inefficient, we provide an additional mechanism that applies to some practical cases such as physical activity measurements across time, and is computationally efficient. Our experimental evaluations indicate that this mechanism provides privacy and utility for synthetic as well as real data in two separate domains.	algorithmic efficiency;database;differential privacy;information privacy;personally identifiable information;social network;synthetic data	Shuang Song;Yizhen Wang;Kamalika Chaudhuri	2017		10.1145/3035918.3064025	computer science;data mining;world wide web;computer security	DB	-39.60581008652238	63.098019526899826	120977

The proposal is robust, in that a pre-defined subset of modalities is required in order to derive the key, rendering the system able to accommodate exception handling for given modalities.

These systems consist of a central application for managing the sequencing of students’ tasks, and also on several other educational applications that allow its users (teachers and learners) to communicate, carry out experiments, etc. However, despite the widespread use of these systems they show a usability problem when both kinds of applications require spare authentication processes. Indeed, users have to introduce several kinds of credentials, preventing them from focusing their efforts on their studies and increasing the so-called ‘‘password stress’’. Several initiatives such as OAuth or Delegation Permits have dealt with the problem of delegated authorizations, but their requirements are different from those that arise from an e-learning environment.

af13997d5a0938de2ac66e4144d8e32e7e991462	decentralized policy-hiding attribute-based encryption with receiver privacy		Attribute-based encryption (ABE) enables limiting access to encrypted data to users with certain attributes. Different aspects of ABE were studied, such as the multi-authority setting (MA-ABE), and policy hiding, meaning the access policy is unknown to unauthorized parties. However, no practical scheme so far provably provides both properties, which are often desirable in real-world applications: supporting decentralization, while hiding the access policy. We present the first practical decentralized ABE scheme with a proof of being policy-hiding. Our construction is based on a decentralized inner-product predicate encryption scheme, introduced in this paper, which hides the encryption policy. It results in an ABE scheme supporting conjunctions, disjunctions and threshold policies, that protects the access policy from parties that are not authorized to decrypt the content. Further, we address the issue of receiver privacy. By using our scheme in combination with vector commitments, we hide the overall set of attributes possessed by the receiver from individual authorities, only revealing the attribute that the authority is controlling. Finally, we propose randomizing-polynomial encodings that immunize the scheme in the presence of corrupt authorities.	access control;attribute-based encryption;authorization;polynomial	Yan Michalevsky;Marc Joye	2018	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Security	-41.40344656317009	70.09570771801498	121591

a39262c7dfbe556ea83fdf94099f2ad373fb4563	unchained cellular obfuscation areas for location privacy in continuous location-based service queries		To access location-based service (LBS) and query surrounding points of interest (POIs), smartphone users typically use builtin positioning functions of their phones when traveling at unfamiliar places. However, when a query is submitted, personal information may be leaked when they provide their real location. Current LBS privacy protection schemes fail to simultaneously consider real map conditions and continuous querying, and they cannot guarantee privacy protection when the obfuscation algorithm is known. To provide users with secure and effective LBSs, we developed an unchained regional privacy protection method that combines query logs and chained cellular obfuscation areas. It adopts a multiuser anonymizer architecture to prevent attackers from predicting user travel routes by using background information derived from maps (e.g., traffic speed limits). The proposed scheme is completely transparent to users when performing continuous location-based queries, and it combines the method with actual road maps to generate unchained obfuscation areas that conceal the actual locations of users. In addition to using a caching approach to enhance performance, the proposed scheme also considers popular tourist POIs to enhance the cache data hit ratio and query performance.

A secure mechanism for mutual authentication and session key agreement is the most important requirements for E-Health Care Systems. Recently, Amin et al.’s proposed a mutual authentication and session key agreement protocol and claimed that their scheme is secure against all possible attacks. In this paper, we show that not only their scheme is vulnerable to privileged-insider attack, replay attack, session key disclosure attack, but also does not provide patient untraceability and backward secrecy. In order to withstand the mentioned security weaknesses, we propose an efficient remote mutual authentication scheme for the systems which are using ECC and Fuzzy Extractor. The proposed scheme not only resists against different security attacks, but it also provides an efficient registration, login, mutual authentication, session key agreement, and password and biometric update phases. During the experimentation, it has been observed that the proposed scheme is secure against various known attacks. Beside, our scheme is robust against privileged-insider attack that it rarely checked in security analysis. The informal analysis will ensure that our scheme provides well security protection against the different security attacks. Furthermore, we analyzed the security of the scheme using AVISPA software and Random Oracle Model. The formal analysis results and performance evaluation vouch that our scheme is also secure and efficient in computation and communication cost.	biometrics;computation;fuzzy extractor;key disclosure law;key-agreement protocol;login;mutual authentication;password;performance evaluation;random oracle;randomness extractor;replay attack;requirement;session key	Niloofar Ravanbakhsh;Mahboubeh Nazari	2016	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-016-4208-2	password;replay attack;computer science;random oracle;session key;multi-factor authentication;computer network;challenge–response authentication;computer security;mutual authentication;login	Security	-45.25381791865752	74.24998041603958	122009

Hence, mobile code, such as Java applets, needs to be analyzed before execution. The byte-code verifier checks low-level security properties that ensure that the downloaded code cannot bypass the virtual machine’s security mechanisms. One of the statically ensured properties is type safety. The type-inference phase is the overwhelming resource-consuming part of the verification process. This paper addresses the RAM bottleneck met while verifying mobile code in memoryconstrained environments such as smart-cards. We propose to modify classic type-inference in a ways that significantly reduces the memory consumption in the memory-constrained device at the detriment of its distrusted memory-rich environment. The outline of our idea is the following, throughout execution, the memory frames used by the verifier are MAC-ed and exported to the terminal and then retrieved upon request. Hence a distrusted memory-rich terminal can be safely used for convincing the embedded device that the downloaded code is secure. The proposed protocol was implemented on JCOP20 and JCOP30 Java cards using IBM’s JCOP development tool.	algorithm;byte;code mobility;data rate units;eeprom;embedded system;high- and low-level;iso/iec 7816;java card openplatform;java applet;kilobyte;mobile computing;on-board data handling;overhead (computing);performance;prototype;random-access memory;real life;real-time clock;smart card;type inference;type safety;usb;virtual machine	David Naccache;Alexei Tchoulkine;Christophe Tymen;Elena Trichina	2002		10.1007/3-540-36159-6_10	embedded system;smart card;parallel computing;type safety;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;type inference;mobile agent;database;distributed computing;programming language;computer security;algorithm	Security	-34.36446770820437	62.095540119728675	122274

b033fa68b0a8a8a25dae6c8f31625e1fbafb1ff2	pre-authentication schemes for umts-wlan interworking	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Interworking Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) introduce new challenges including the design of secured and fast handover protocols. Handover operations within and between networks must not compromise the security of the networks involved. In addition, handovers must be instantaneous to sustain the quality of service (QoS) of the applications running on the User Equipment (UE). There is a need to design fast and secured handover protocols to operate in UMTS-WLAN interworking architectures. This paper proposes two secured pre-authentication protocols in the UMTS-WLAN interworking architectures. Performance analysis of the proposed protocols show superior results in comparison to existing protocols in terms of authentication signaling cost, authentication delay and load on critical nodes involved in the authentication procedure. Additionally, the security of the proposed protocols was verified by the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) security analyzer.	authentication protocol;confidentiality;internet security;key management;mutual authentication;quality of service	Ali Al Shidhani;Victor C.

However, standard PKI validation and revocation mechanisms are considered major reasons for its unsuitability for delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN). DTN requires mechanism to authenticate messages at each node before forwarding it in the network. So, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) being distributed in DTN network will need to be authenticated and validated for issuer certificate authority (CA) at each node. In this study, the authors propose new validation and revocation mechanism which is compliant with DTN semantics and protocols. This study also proposes a new design for CRL in compliance with standard PKI X.509 standard to make the proposed mechanism easy to implement for DTN. The new designed CRL is of reduced size as it contains fewer entries as compared with standard X.509 CRL and also arranges the revocation list in the form of hash table (map) to increase the searching efficiency.	authentication;certificate authority;delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;hash table;key management;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;x.509	Muhammad Nasir Mumtaz Bhutta;Haitham S.

2cb385a76e902314f1b8f8658aea6a5ad7ae5381	dynamic data integrity auditing for secure outsourcing in the cloud		SummaryrnCloud servers provide cloud users with storage service and allow cloud users to access their files anytime. To guarantee security of the stored files, auditors need to periodically verify data block correctness. In the existing integrity verification schemes, there are few protocols to support the usersu0027 identity anonymity and the data block dynamic operation simultaneously. In this paper, we present an efficient and anonymous identity-based integrity auditing protocol, which supports data dynamic operation and can be extended to support batch auditing in the multifile or multiuser setting. Our scheme not only resists forgery, replace, and replay attacks but also maintains usersu0027 anonymity, which is not discussed in other related techniques. The computation efficiency of auditor is improved a lot. Comparing with Zhangu0027s efficient identity-based public auditing scheme, our scheme is more suitable for actual application scenario with large-scale storage system.	cloud computing;data integrity;dynamic data;outsourcing	Jinxia Wei;Ru Zhang;Jianyi Liu;Jing Li;Xinxin Niu;Yuangang Yao	2017	Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience	10.1002/cpe.4096	distributed computing;replay attack;cloud storage;computer science;cloud computing;computer network;block (data storage);computer security;dynamic data;audit;computer data storage;server	Security	-42.34676705011265	68.2174455320184	122519

Hence, those techniques cannot embed marks in database relations without primary key attributes. Further, the techniques are vulnerable to simple attacks that alter or delete the primary key attribute.This paper proposes a new fingerprinting scheme that does not depend on a primary key attribute. The scheme constructs virtual primary keys from the most significant bits of some of each tuple's attributes. The actual attributes that are used to construct then virtual primary key differ from tuple to tuple. Attribute selection is based on a secret key that is known to the merchant only. Further, the selection does not depend on an apriori ordering over the attributes, or on knowledge of the original relation or fingerprint codeword.The virtual primary keys are then used in fingerprinting as in previous work [6]. Rigorous analysis shows that, with high probability, only embedded fingerprints can be detected and embedded fingerprints cannot be modified or erased by a variety of attacks. Attacks include adding, deleting, shuffling, or modifying tuples or attributes (including a primary key attribute if one exists), guessing secret keys, and colluding with other recipients of a relation.	apriori algorithm;code word;embedded system;fingerprint (computing);key (cryptography);most significant bit;robustness (computer science);sensor;unique key;with high probability	Yingjiu Li;Vipin Swarup;Sushil Jajodia	2003		10.1145/947380.947398	unique key;natural key;entity integrity;relational database;computer science;data mining;database;compound key;superkey;world wide web	Security	-40.03344568543378	72.32794229802349	122522
6d1e1757a9fc33b93a0a789d0eb7079439c30726	prover efficient public verification of dense or sparse/structured matrix-vector multiplication		With the emergence of cloud computing services, computationally weak devices (Clients) can delegate expensive tasks to more powerful entities (Servers). This raises the question of verifying a result at a lower cost than that of recomputing it. This verification can be private, between the Client and the Server, or public, when the result can be verified by any third party. We here present protocols for the verification of matrix-vector multiplications, that are secure against malicious Servers. The obtained algorithms are essentially optimal in the amortized model: the overhead for the Server is limited to a very small constant factor, even in the sparse or structured matrix case; and the computational time for the public Verifier is linear in the dimension. Our protocols combine probabilistic checks and cryptographic operations, but minimize the latter to preserve practical efficiency. Therefore our protocols are overall more than two orders of magnitude faster than existing ones.	algorithm;amortized analysis;cloud computing;computation;cryptography;emergence;entity;overhead (computing);sparse matrix;time complexity;verification and validation	Jean-Guillaume Dumas;Vincent Zucca	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59870-3_7	distributed computing;computer science;computer security;theoretical computer science;cryptography;random oracle;matrix multiplication;delegate;probabilistic logic;matrix (mathematics);cloud computing;server	Crypto	-40.028822249424046	70.30901711514852	122635
c5c01a4949e0ce36dd0e901090ebde9d8166dc9d	large universe revocable fine-grained encryption with public auditing		Attribute-based encryption (ABE) allows for scalable and fine-grained data sharing in a cloud computing environment. However, most of existing ABE schemes with user revocation are not satisfactory on the efficiency side. In addition, since the data are stored on remote servers in the cloud storage environment, data owners do not know whether data is integrated in a timely manner. In this paper, we propose a novel large universe revocable fine-grained encryption with public audit- ing (LRA-FE) scheme based on prime-order bilinear groups. In this construction, we utilize extended proxy-assisted approach and appending redundancy approach, which weakens the trust of the cloud server. Furthermore, the proposed system in- troduces an auditor to inspect the integrity of data stored in the cloud. The size of attribute space can be exponentially large because our construction supports large u- niverse. After comprehensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art works, the LRA- FE scheme features lightweight computation at the user side such that users can use resource-constrained devices to access cloud data.

Hashing applications are abundant. For example, in computer security, a hash function is used to produce a """"fingerprint"""" of a file, password, message, or other block of data for integrity verification and message authentication etc. Computer compilers use hash tables, known as symbol tables, to keep track of declared variables in source codes. Hash functions are also used very commonly in on-line spelling checkers and in programs that play games. Design of efficient hash functions is crucial for lots of real world applications. Many existing open addressing hash functions, for example, the widely used double hashing, require that the table size m be prime, in order to produce full length probe sequences. In this paper, a new and efficient technique, called exponential hashing in finite fields, is proposed to construct a new hash function with table size m = pn, where p is prime and n ges 1. It is clear that the table size m = pn includes prime m as a special case when n = 1. We show that the proposed new hash function has the ability to spread table elements more randomly than the widely used double hashing, and at the same time produces full length probe sequences on all table elements. We demonstrate experimentally that the new hash function performs significantly better than double hashing for clustered data. Also, several properties of the proposed new hash function are presented along with experimental results."""	cluster analysis;code;compiler;computer security;double hashing;experiment;fingerprint;hash function;hash table;message authentication;online and offline;open addressing;password;randomness;symbol table;time complexity	Wenbin Luo;Gregory L.

The main characteristic of cyberspace is the interconnection of computers, information, devices, and people. Many actors are involved in cyberspace's construction and operation -- namely, telcos; application, service, and content providers; users; and governments. The issue of privacy protection is a global challenge that requires a global response. The regulation of privacy in cyberspace depends on regulatory, technical, and social factors.

58646dbe5803554d40e334863e8898ffbc14b21d	claimchain: decentralized public key infrastructure		We envision a decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) design, that we call ClaimChain, where each user or device maintains repositories of claims regarding their own key material, and their beliefs about public keys and, generally, state of other users of the system. High integrity of the repositories is maintained by virtue of storing claims on authenticated data structures, namely hash chains and Merkle trees, and their authenticity and non-repudiation by the use of digital signatures. We introduce the concept of crossreferencing of hash chains as a way of efficient and verifiable vouching about states of other users. ClaimChain allows to detect chain compromises, manifested as forks of hash chains, and to implement various social policies for deriving decisions about the latest state of users in the system. The claims about keys of other people introduces a privacy problem that does not exist in the centralized PKI design. Such information can reveal the social graph, and sometimes even communication patterns. To solve this, we use cryptographic verifiable random functions to derive private identifiers that are re-randomized on each chain update. This allows to openly and verifiably publish claims that can only be read by the authorized users, ensuring privacy of the social graph. Moreover, the specific construction of Merkle trees in ClaimChain, along with the usage of verifiable random functions, ensures users can not equivocate about the state of other people. ClaimChain is flexible with respect to deployment options, supporting fully decentralized deployments, as well as centralized, federated, and hybrid modes of operation. We have evaluated the ClaimChain’s computation and memory requirements using a prototype implementation. We also simulated the flow of the system using Enron dataset, comprising real-world email communication history within an organization, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of propagation of key material in a fully decentralized setting. 1 ar X iv :1 70 7. 06 27 9v 1 [ cs .C R ] 1 9 Ju l 2 01 7	antivirus software;authentication;authorization;block cipher mode of operation;centralized computing;computation;cryptography;data structure;digital signature;email;formal verification;identifier;markov chain;merkle tree;non-repudiation;prototype;public key infrastructure;randomized algorithm;requirement;social graph;software deployment;software propagation	Bogdan Kulynych;Marios Isaakidis;Carmela Troncoso;George Danezis	2017	CoRR		public key infrastructure;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;geography;computer security;merkle tree	Security	-41.629719668046825	71.69287510004594	123152

These networks can be used for many applications without the need for a dedicated IT infrastructure. In the context of opportunistic networks, content sharing in particular has attracted significant attention. To support content sharing, opportunistic networks often implement a publish-subscribe system in which users may publish their own content and indicate interest in other content through subscriptions. Using a smartphone, any user can act as a broker by opportunistically forwarding both published content and interests within the network. Unfortunately, opportunistic networks are faced with serious privacy and security issues. Untrusted brokers can not only compromise the privacy of subscribers by learning their interests but also can gain unauthorised access to the disseminated content. This paper addresses the research challenges inherent to the exchange of content and interests without: (i) compromising the privacy of subscribers, and (ii) providing unauthorised access to untrusted brokers. Specifically, this paper presents an interest and content sharing solution that addresses these security challenges and preserves privacy in opportunistic networks. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the solution by implementing a prototype and analysing its performance on smart phones.	authorization;privacy;prototype;publish–subscribe pattern;smartphone	Muhammad Rizwan Asghar;Ashish Gehani;Bruno Crispo;Giovanni Russello	2014		10.1145/2590296.2590303	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-43.43189694322091	62.4172788992617	123257

The proposed anonymous signature is similarly to ring signature in some respects, for example, there is no manager, and no revocation mechanism against signer’s anonymity. The most different between these two kinds of signatures is that the group in ring signature is adaptively constructed by the signer, while the group in our scheme is fixed.	antivirus software;digital signature;group signature;ring signature	Chunbo Ma;Jun Ao	2009	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-41.73111748040714	73.35694563293984	123487

An electric vehicle (EV) in a V2G network uses electricity instead of gasoline, and this benefits the environment and helps mitigate the energy crisis. By using its battery capacity, the vehicle can serve temporarily as a distributed energy storage system to mitigate peak load of the power grid. However, the two-way communication and power flows not only facilitate the functionality of V2G network, but they also facilitate attackers as well. Privacy is now a big obstacle in the way of the development of V2G networks. The privacy preservation problem in V2G networks could be more severe than in other parts of Smart Grid due to its e-mobility. In this paper, we will analyze and summarize privacy preservation approaches which achieve various privacy preservation goals. We will survey research works, based on existing privacy preservation techniques, which address various privacy preservation problems in V2G networks, including anonymous authentication, location privacy, identification privacy, concealed data aggregation, privacy-preserving billing and payment, and privacy-preserving data publication. These techniques include homomorphic encryption, blind signature, group signature, ring signature, third party anonymity, and anonymity networks. We will summarize solved problems and issues of these techniques, and introduce possible solutions for unsolved problems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

e5208522bee83e5a8fc88416b594b9ba2323eae1	towards smart healthcare: patient data privacy and security in sensor-cloud infrastructure		Nowadays, wireless body area networks (WBANs) systems have adopted cloud computing (CC) technology to overcome limitations such as power, storage, scalability, management, and computing. This amalgamation of WBANs systems and CC technology, as sensor-cloud infrastructure (S-CI), is aiding the healthcare domain through real-time monitoring of patients and the early diagnosis of diseases. Hence, the distributed environment of S-CI presents new threats to patient data privacy and security. In this paper, we review the techniques for patient data privacy and security in S-CI. Existing techniques are classified as multibiometric key generation, pairwise key establishment, hash function, attribute-based encryption, chaotic maps, hybrid encryption, Number Theory Research Unit, Tri-Mode Algorithm, Dynamic Probability Packet Marking, and Priority-Based Data Forwarding techniques, according to their application areas. Their pros and cons are presented in chronological order. We also provide our six-step generic framework for patient physiological parameters (PPPs) privacy and security in S-CI: (1) selecting the preliminaries; (2) selecting the system entities; (3) selecting the technique; (4) accessing PPPs; (5) analysing the security; and (6) estimating performance. Meanwhile, we identify and discuss PPPs utilized as datasets and provide the performance evolution of this research area. Finally, we conclude with the open challenges and future directions for this flourishing research area.	access control;cloud computing;computer science;conflict (psychology);data management;data access;data aggregation;encryption;extraction;generic drugs;handling (psychology);information privacy;nih roadmap initiative tag;network security;patients;silo (dataset);software engineering;usability	Isma Masood;Ying-dong Wang;Ali Daud;Naif R.

A few verifiable multi-secret schemes own the following drawbacks: insensitive to the differences of security levels, lack of expandability, high computation complexity of verification process, and low efficiency of execution. Addressing the issues, an extensible cheat-proofing multi-secret sharing scheme with low computation complexity is proposed. With the security of RSA public key system and discrete logarithm puzzle, the proposed scheme can realize the following functions: first, the secret dealer can set relatively threshold values according to different security levels; second, the participants and secret combiner can verify the secret shares, which can guard against cheating problem, resist various kinds of attacks and improve the success rate of secret reconstruction; in addition, the secret shares are reusable in the situations of new group secret and new participant joining the group, which brings about good expandability. Moreover, compared with the previous schemes, the proposed scheme reduces the information content published by secret dealer and brings down the computation complexity of verification, which makes the efficiency of the scheme greatly improved.

177186e30e6d174f85ed11bdcba699cdb8feedef	persistent asymmetric password-based key exchange	formal model;dictionary attack;public key;key exchange;random oracle;hash function	Asymmetric password based key exchange is a key exchange protocol where a client and a server share a low entropic password and the server additionally owns a high entropic private key of a public key. This problem has not been well studied in the literature although its harder variant (i.e., password-only key exchange), in which the only secret for both a server and a client is a shared password, has been extensively studied. This situation perhaps is due to the fact that the existing solutions (e.g, by Halevi and Krawczyk (ACM TISSEC 1999) and by Boyarsky (CCS 1999)), are already very simple and proven secure. In this paper, we will see that this understanding is not true by studying a new threat. That is, once the server’s high entropic private key gets compromised (e.g., due to cryptanalysis, virus stealth and faulty implementation), the adversary might be able to break in a larger number of accounts in a short time and cause uncountable damage. In this setting, we do not expect the protocol to remain secure against a off-line dictionary attack since, otherwise, the protocol is a secure passwordonly protocol (with server long key as part of common reference string) and is usually very inefficient. However, if the attacker only has the computing source (e.g., time) to enumerate one dictionary, she should not be able to break a lot of accounts. Achieving this is important as it saves time for server to realize the attack and respond properly. We formalize this problem and propose a simple and natural framework for it. Our framework is as efficient as the protocol by Halevi and Krawczyk (1999) and Boyarsky (1999) while neither of the latter can survive against the new threat. Our framework is proven secure in a normal model (i.e., server long key is uncorrupted). It is also proven secure against the new threat. For the latter, we show that if the adversary has the running time T , then it can break l account with probability negligibly bounded by exp(−2l(0.5 − α)) for T < lαD, where α < 1/2 is a constant and D is the dictionary size. The proof mainly relies on our analysis of a novel probability experiment, which is of independent interest.	adversary (cryptography);common reference string model;cryptanalysis;dictionary attack;enumerated type;interpretation (logic);key exchange;online and offline;password;provable security;public-key cryptography;server (computing);stealth;threat (computer);time complexity	Shaoquan Jiang	2014	J.

Table decomposition based method, which is suited for the current query evaluation of the database engine, provides an alternative to the conventional encryption method. Although some work on table decomposition has been done to handle single sensitive association in data publishing scenario or multiple associations in multiple servers, fewer attempts have been made to deal with multiple associations in single outsourced database. In this paper, we first illustrate that the simple extension of existing work will lead to new kinds of information leakages, and then we propose a novel table decomposition method, which achieves l-diversity, defeats the new information leakages, while at the same time, considers the query efficiency over the decomposed sub-tables. The final experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.	database engine;encryption;functional dependency;outsourcing	Xiao Jiang;Jun Gao;Tengjiao Wang;Dongqing Yang	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12098-5_10	decomposition method;computer science;data mining;database;view;world wide web	DB	-40.793955017459155	67.1526519374313	124037

For years the main approach to cryptographic protocols has been logical, and a number of papers have examined the limitations of those logics. This paper takes a similar cautionary look at the design principal approach. Limitations and exceptions are offered on some of the previously given basic design principals. The focus is primarily on public key protocols, especially on the order of signature and encryption. But, other principles are discussed as well. Apparently secure protocols that fail to meet principles are presented. Also presented are new attacks on protocols as well as previously claimed attacks which are not.	antivirus software;cryptographic protocol;digital signature;encryption;human-readable medium;needham–schroeder protocol;non-repudiation;oracle database;paul van oorschot;public-key cryptography	Paul F.

However, patients are probably one of the actors that, despite being the main actor to be protected by regulations, have the least access to its information and control over what, who, when, how and why other actors in the healthcare system are doing with their information, especially in cases where just the existence of some tests may reveal an illness or a condition that should remain private. There is existing work and regulations on defining user-centered access control to the data, but the options are usually focused on defining policies on who has access to the information. This work introduces an incremental data access options in order to increase privacy over the data by considering the possibility of offering slightly altered or obfuscated data as an option to protect the original information, revealing just enough to enable the desired services. A differential privacy classification of access is presented, tested on lab data and evaluated, showing that different levels of privacy protection can be used in certain cases and for a limited number of services, while preserving privacy of the data. In addition, this technique can be integrated with other access-control techniques in literature.		Omar Gutiérrez;Jeffreys J. Saavedra;Mayra Zurbarán;Augusto Salazar;Pedro M.

8eaf1e34eba19b8e26004ee62d4d3ce809348c60	authenticated location-aware publish/subscribe services in untrusted outsourced environments		Location-aware publish/subscribe is an important location-based service based on server-initiatedmodel. Often times, the owner of massive spatio-textual messages and subscriptions outsources its location-aware publish/subscribe services to a third-party service provider, for example, cloud service provider, who is responsible for delivering messages to their relevant subscribers. The issue arising here is that the messages delivered by the service provider might be tailored for profit purposes, intentionally or not. Therefore, it is essential to develop mechanisms which allow subscribers to verify the correctness of the messages delivered by the service provider. In this paper, we study the problem of authenticating messages in outsourced location-aware publish/subscribe services. We propose an authenticated framework which not only can deliver the messages efficiently but also can make the subscribers’ authentication available with low cost. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed authenticated framework.

Indeed, Cloud data centres store each time more sensitive data such as personal data, organizational and enterprise data, transactional data, etc. However, achieving confidentiality with flexible searchable capability is a challenging issue. In this article, we show how to construct an efficient predicate encryption with fine-grained searchable capability. Predicate Encryption ( PE ) can achieve more sophisticated and flexible functionality compared with traditional public key encryption. We propose an efficient predicate encryption scheme by utilizing the dual system encryption technique, which can also be proved to be IND-AH-CPA (indistinguishable under chosen plain-text attack for attribute-hiding) secure without random oracle. We also carefully analyse the relationship between predicate encryption and searchable encryption. To that end, we introduce a new notion of Public-Key Encryption with Finegrained Keyword Search ( PEFKS ). Our results show that an IND-AH-CPA secure PE scheme can be used to construct an IND-PEFKS-CPA (indistinguishable under chosen plain-text attack for public-key encryption with fine-grained keyword search) secure PEFKS scheme. A new transformation of PE-to-PEFKS is also proposed and used to construct an efficient PEFKS scheme based on the transformation from the proposed PE scheme. Finally, we design a new framework for supporting privacy preserving predicate encryption with finegrained searchable capability for Cloud storage. Compared to most prominent frameworks, our framework satisfies more features altogether and can serve as a basis for developing such frameworks for Cloud data centres. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper focuses on a biometric cryptosystem using a fuzzy commitment scheme and demonstrates correlation between fingerprint bit strings by using our method for evaluating the content of biometric information. Additionally, attacks to guess biometric bit strings, which take advantage of correlation between them, are explained, and the security against these attacks is theoretically and experimentally discussed.	authentication;biometrics;bit array;code;commitment scheme;cryptosystem;dictionary attack;experiment;fingerprint;forward error correction;self-information;surround sound	Seira Hidano;Tetsushi Ohki;Kenta Takahashi	2012	2012 BIOSIG - Proceedings of the International Conference of Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)		computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;mathematics;internet privacy;computer security;statistics	Security	-37.49010873892634	70.18116073647336	124355

c682d64b6abcd65209bf7f6f4877432f3b1ecdc4	trust, privacy and security in digital business		In this paper, we introduce an approach that aims at increasing individuals’ privacy awareness. We perform a privacy risk assessment of the smartphone applications (apps) installed on a user’s device. We implemented an app behaviour monitoring tool that collects information about access to sensitive resources by each installed app. We then calculate a privacy risk score using a fuzzy logic based approach that considers type, number and frequency of access on resources. The combination of these two concepts provides the user with information about the privacy invasiveness level of the monitored apps. Our approach enables users to make informed privacy decisions, i.e. restrict permissions or report an app based on resource access events. We evaluate our approach by analysing the behaviour of selected apps and calculating their associated privacy score. Initial results demonstrate the applicability of our approach, which allows the comparison of apps by reporting to the user the detected events and the resulting privacy risk score.	fuzzy logic;mobile app;privacy;risk assessment;smartphone	Josef Kittler;John C.

In these protocols, a sender can obliviously transfer n messages to a receiver without communication with him/her. The public keys that a sender used to encrypt his/her messages are made by a third party. The receiver can extract k out of n messages at his/her choices by using the corresponding secret keys. The choices of the receiver are unconditionally secure. The sender's secrecy is guaranteed if the receiver is semi-honest in the standard model since the decision bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem (DBDH) is hard and the sender's secrecy is achieved when the receiver is a malicious party in the random oracle model since the bilinear DiffieHellman problem assumption (BDHA) holds. When a sender is a cheating party, the receiver will detect him/her and halt the protocol. A precise proof of the security of the protocols is presented.	bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;cryptographic protocol;diffie–hellman problem;e-commerce;encryption;halting problem;interactivity;internet;key (cryptography);map;oblivious transfer;random oracle;semiconductor industry;video clip	Jing Qin;Huawei Zhao	2010	JSW	10.4304/jsw.5.1.65-72	computer science;oblivious transfer;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	Crypto	-41.254252200037904	73.99957916874239	124749

This paper addresses a question on whether we can design a compact, efficient and authenticated key establishment protocol that has the following two properties: (1) each message exchanged between two participants can be transferred in a short packet such as an ATM cell whose payload has only 384 bits, and (2) messages that carry key materials are unforgeable and nonrepudiatable without the involvement of a trusted key distribution center. We discuss why the answer to this question is negative if one follows the currently standard approach to key establishment, namely employing secret/public key encryption and, possibly, digital signature. We then present a number of protocols that represent a positive answer to the question. Our protocols are all based on a recently introduced cryptographic primitive called “signcryption” that fulfills both the functions of digital signature and public key encryption with a cost far smaller than that required by “digital signature followed by encryption”.	atm turbo;authentication;cryptographic primitive;digital signature;encryption;key distribution center;key exchange;network packet;network security;public-key cryptography;session key;signcryption	Yuliang Zheng;Hideki Imai	1998		10.1109/INFCOM.1998.665057	key;key authentication;security association;key exchange;computer science;network security;public key infrastructure;key wrap;diffie–hellman key exchange;static key;key management;key generation;ephemeral key;public key fingerprint;cryptographic key types;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;key distribution;computer security;encryption;key encapsulation;computer network	Crypto	-47.089241447937205	72.43219896252087	124869

b967699eaa21db8d792a6072f707196d267b34be	outsourced privacy-preserving classification service over encrypted data		Abstract With the diversity of cloud services, remote data services based on the machine learning classification have been provided in many applications including risk assessment and image recognition. In a classification service, a classifier owner that acts a service provider establishes a protocol to allow a user to query for the evaluation of his/her data. However, such an owner has to keep on-line continuously and equip with enough bandwidth and computing resources. Although the owner can outsource the service to a powerful service, there remains a challenge that is protecting the privacy of the data and the classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for a classifier owner to delegate a remote server to provide the privacy-preserving classification service for users. In the proposed scheme, we design efficient classification protocols for two concrete classifiers respectively. We implement the prototype of the scheme and conduct experiments. The experimental results show that the scheme is practical.	encryption	Tong Li;Zhengan Huang;Ping Li;Zheli Liu;Chunfu Jia	2018	J.

We propose Crypto-Book, an extension to existing digital identity infrastructures that offers privacy-preserving, digital identities through the use of public key cryptography and ring signatures. Crypto-Book builds a privacy-preserving cryptographic layer atop existing social network identities, via third-party key servers that convert social network identities into public/private key-pairs on demand. Using linkable ring signatures, these key-pairs along with the public keys of other identities create unique pseudonyms untraceable back to the owner yet can resist anonymous abuse.  Our proof-of-concept implementation of Crypto-Book creates public/private key pairs for Facebook users, and includes a private key pickup protocol based on E-mail. We present Black Box, a case study application that uses Crypto-Book for accountable anonymous whistle-blowing. Black Box allows users to sign files deniably using ring signatures, using a list of arbitrary Facebook users -- who need not consent or even be aware of this use -- as an explicit anonymity set.	antivirus software;authentication;black box;cross-site cooking;digital identity;oauth;openid;privacy;public-key cryptography;ring signature;social network	John Maheswaran;David Wolinsky;Bryan Ford	2013		10.1145/2535771.2535798	anonymity;computer science;authentication;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-47.2726088956206	64.8985799122929	125409

55a229c038c5f03baaee1caacfd25108e0c94625	cryptographically secure multiparty computation and distributed auctions using homomorphic encryption		We introduce a robust framework that allows for cryptographically secure multiparty computations, such as distributed private value auctions. The security is guaranteed by two-sided authentication of all network connections, homomorphically encrypted bids, and the publication of zero-knowledge proofs of every computation. This also allows a non-participant verifier to verify the result of any such computation using only the information broadcasted on the network by each individual bidder. Building on previous work on such systems, we design and implement an extensible framework that puts the described ideas to practice. Apart from the actual implementation of the framework, our biggest contribution is the level of protection we are able to guarantee from attacks described in previous work. In order to provide guidance to users of the library, we analyze the use of zero knowledge proofs in ensuring the correct behavior of each node in a computation. We also describe the usage of the library to perform a private-value distributed auction, as well as the other challenges in implementing the protocol, such as auction registration and certificate distribution. Finally, we provide performance statistics on our implementation of the auction.	authentication;homomorphic encryption;secure multi-party computation;zero-knowledge proof	Anunay Kulshrestha;Akshay Rampuria;Matthew Denton;Ashwin Sreenivas	2017	Cryptography	10.3390/cryptography1030025	common value auction;certificate;encryption;public-key cryptography;computation;computer science;authentication;zero-knowledge proof;secure multi-party computation;distributed computing	Security	-40.90866266652749	71.94963606607678	125752

In these applications, we often need to search for a particular set of products in a large-scale collection of products. Existing schemes have been proposed, but they are limited by a couple of problems. Firstly, they fail to work under the situation when the cardinality of X is much larger than that of Y. Secondly, they implicitly assume the RFID readers are adequate powerful so that readers can handles a large number of query requests in a short time. To this end, we propose ITSP – Cloud-based Iterative Tag Search Protocol, which can locate the tags in a secure and efficient manner. To be secure, ITSP authenticates the communications between RFID readers and tags to in advance. To be efficient, ITSP reformats the single-round communication model to a multi-round communication one between readers and tags. Furthermore, ITSP employs a cloud-based service to rapidly conduct the searching process. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high-levels of searching efficiency with the improvement at least 19 %.	bloom filter;radio-frequency identification	Yuming Qian;Daqiang Zhang;Shengjie Zhao;Xiaopeng Fan;Ke Fan	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-16050-4_14	computer science	Mobile	-38.771625189567914	66.440091968046	125875

Standard certification criteria, in particular the Common Criteria, define security requirements but do not sufficiently address the problem of interoperability. Here we consider the interoperability problem which arises when various applications interact with different smartcards through a middleware. In such a situation it is possible that a smartcard of typeS receives commands that were supposed to be executed on a different smartcard of type S. Such “external commands” can interleave with the commands that were supposed to be executed on S. We experimentally demonstrate this problem with a Common Criteria certified digital signature process on a commercially available smartcard. Importantly, in some of these cases the digital signature processes terminate without generating an error message or warning to the user.

6bb9b27036003bcd170fb97afe04b0ae4829b313	secure data migration between cloud storage systems		Cloud computing is a trending paradigm that combines several computing concepts and technologies of the Internet to create a platform for more agile, cost effective and reliable model for the public users, business applications and IT infrastructure. There are various requirements that need to be addressed by Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for enabling the cloud services to the users such as security, performance, availability, integrability, customization with minimal cost. If any of these requirements are not met, then the user wishes to switch from current CSP to a new CSP. To achieve that the user has to download all the digital assets, services, IT resources and applications from one CSP and upload into another CSP. This process has many issues like security, vendor management, technical integration, requirement of time and energy resources, etc; The first one being a major concern which we are addressing it in this paper. Here we propose a secure data migration technique to migrate the data from one cloud storage system to another cloud storage system. The proposed approach comprises of mutual authentication, blended with key splitting and sharing methods that ensure pre-migration authentication. The migration of data is then performed by encrypting with symmetric keys, which are shared using RSA Cryptosystem. The security factors such as confidentiality, authorization, authenticity, integrity are ensured by this technique. The proposed methodology is implemented and validated on two OpenStack servers using the Object Storage Service accessed by swiftclient.	agile software development;algorithm;authorization;cloud computing;cloud storage;computer data storage;computer security;confidentiality;cryptographic hash function;cryptosystem;data integrity;digital asset;download;encryption;internet;mutual authentication;object storage;programming paradigm;rsa (cryptosystem);reduced cost;requirement;secret sharing;upload	Chetan Gudisagar;Bibhu Ranjan Sahoo;M.

0c1561ab383c60100088e7f23ab3c991099f943b	a novel threshold conference-key agreement protocol based on generalized chinese remainder theorem		The conference-key agreement protocol is a mechanism for generating a common session key among the authorized conference members. The common session key is used to encrypt communication messages transmitted over an open network. Inspired by traditional key agreement protocols and threshold cryptosystems, we have proposed a novel threshold conference-key agreement protocol in this paper. In the proposed protocol, we used a secret sharing scheme based on the generalized Chinese remainder theorem (GCRT) to achieve the threshold characteristic, and we can alter the shared data by adjusting an additional parameter k of the GCRT. If the number of conference members involved in generating the conference key exceeds a certain number, the members can cooperate to generate a valid common session key that also can be verified and used by other authorized conference members. Compared with traditional key agreement protocols, the proposed protocol has some unique characteristics that are beneficial in real applications.	algorithmic efficiency;authorization;confidentiality;encryption;key authentication;key-agreement protocol;polynomial remainder theorem;profiling (computer programming);replay attack;secret sharing;session key;threshold cryptosystem	Cheng Guo;Chin-Chen Chang	2015	I.

We formalize this problem and propose an extension to the Pretty Good Privacy Web Of Trust, a mechanism for reciprocally certifying identities between peers. The extension (a) enables agents to certify additional relevant statements about others, and (b) gives agents opportunities for negative authentication statements (e.g., on ineligibility of an identity). A Bayesian Network model enables inferences on the data provided by the proposed PGP extension.

However, overhead costs associated with cryptographic primitives used towards this end introduce significant practical implementation challenges for resource-bounded systems, such as cyber-physical systems. For example, many control systems are built on legacy components which are computationally limited but have strict timing constraints. If integrity protection is a binary decision, it may simply be infeasible to introduce into such systems; without it, however, an adversary can forge malicious messages, which can cause significant physical or financial harm. We propose a formal game-theoretic framework for optimal stochastic message authentication, providing provable integrity guarantees for resource-bounded systems based on an existing MAC scheme. We use our framework to investigate attacker deterrence, as well as optimal design of stochastic message authentication schemes when deterrence is impossible. Finally, we provide experimental results on the computational performance of our framework in practice.	adversary (cryptography);control system;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;cyber-physical system;data integrity;forge;game theory;malware;message authentication code;optimal design;overhead (computing);provable security	Aron Laszka;Yevgeniy Vorobeychik;Xenofon D.

587c85ba2c724670d20aa8b056bb43e92e7d44df	certifying trust	certifying trust	A basic function of all signatures, digital or not, is to express trust and authority, explicit or implied. This is especially the case with digital signatures used in certificates. In this paper, we study the trust relationships expressed by the certificates used in X.509, PGP and SPKI. Especially, we present and re vise the idea of a certificate loop, or a loop of certificates from the verifying party to the communicating peer, requesting access or acceptance. We also show ho w that kind of certificate loops can be used to explicitly express security policy decisions. In the end of the paper, we briefly describe our own SPKI implementation that is specially tailored to wards policy management. The implementation is based on Ja v and build using Design Patterns. It functions as a separate process, providing security services to the local kernel and applications.	access control;antivirus software;authentication;digital signature;electronic signature;loop invariant;pretty good privacy;public key certificate;simple public-key infrastructure;trust (emotion);x.509	Ilari Lehti;Pekka Nikander	1998		10.1007/BFb0054017		Security	-42.749507834592286	71.8587398732653	126771

When this encrypted data are queried, complete record has to be decrypted to fetch the actual results. This paper is concentrating on improving the performance of different query operations, that is, non-aggregate, aggregate, and user-defined query operations on encrypted data. The performance of these query operations over the encrypted data is compared with that of the available methods in terms of the execution time, and it is found that the efficiency of the proposed approach is better than that of the traditional approach. Effectiveness of different types of non-aggregate query operations is identified in terms of filter ratio and false ratio. The analysis has shown that the filter ratio increases and the false ratio decreases with increase in size of sensitive string and the reachability matrix generated for non-aggregate attribute.

As traditionally most user authentication schemes are knowledge and/or possession based, firstly in this paper we present a methodology for a security analysis of Internet-based biometric authentication systems by enhancing known methodologies such as the CERT attack-taxonomy with a more detailed view on the OSI-Model. Secondly as proof of concept, the guidelines extracted from this methodology are strictly applied to an open source Internet-based biometric authentication system (BioWebAuth). As case studies, two exemplary attacks, based on the found security leaks, are investigated and the attack performance is presented to show that during the biometric authentication schemes beside biometric error performance tuning also security issues need to be addressed. Finally, some design recommendations are given in order to ensure a minimum security level.

Our disclosure risk measures are more applicable to real-life situations, compute the overall disclosure risk, and are not linked to a target individual. After defining those disclosure risk measures, we then introduce an information loss measure for microaggregation. The minimal disclosure risk measure represents the percentage of records, which can be correctly identified by an intruder based on prior knowledge of key attribute values. The maximal disclosure risk measure considers the risk associated with probabilistic record linkage for records that are not unique in the masked microdata. The weighted disclosure risk measure allows the data owner to compute the risk of disclosure based on weights associated with different clusters of records. Information loss measure, introduced in this paper, extends the existing measure proposed by Domingo-Ferrer, and captures the loss of information at record level as well as from the statistical integrity point of view. Using simulated medical data in our experiments, we show that the proposed disclosure risk and information loss measures perform as expected in real-life situations.	confidentiality;experiment;linkage (software);maximal set;microdata (html);real life;risk measure;simulation	Traian Marius Truta;Farshad Fotouhi;Daniel C.

To enable these services, many different applications have to be run on a user terminal, and it is necessary to establish an environment where any service provider can create applications and distribute them to users. The danger is that malicious service providers might distribute applications which may cause user terminals to take undesirable actions. To prevent such applications from being distributed, we propose an application authentication protocol for hybrid broadcasting and communications services. Concretely, we modify a key-insulated signature scheme and apply it to this protocol. In the protocol, a broadcaster distributes a signing key to a service provider that the broadcaster trusts. As a result, users can verify that an application is reliable. If a signed application causes an undesirable action, a broadcaster can revoke the privileges and permissions of the service provider. In addition, it can update the signing key. That is, our protocol is secure against leakage of the signing key by the broadcaster. Moreover, a user terminal uses only one verification key for verifying a signature, so the memory needed for storing the verification key in the user terminal's is very small. With our protocol, users can securely receive hybrid services from broadcasting and communications networks.	authentication;telecommunications network	Go Ohtake;Kazuto Ogawa	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27890-7_15	computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-46.623121981046836	69.9461432592226	127300
ad5836ca3cf3b14eda76b350d776a2ee5f804e8f	providing ontology-based privacy-aware data access through web services		Web services enable software systems to exchange data over the Internet. Often Web services need to disclose sensible data to service consumers. For data providers, the disclosure of sensitive data is often restrictive only to particular users for some particular purposes. Therefore, preserving privacy is a fundamental requirement in Web services. Hippocratic database has been introduced for privacy protection in relational database systems where the access decisions, allowed or denied, are based on privacy policies and authorization tables. To provide more options of data access, purpose trees are proposed to capture purpose hierarchies so that information can be provided to users according to proposes. Ontology has been used for classification hierarchies, which can be efficiently accessed via ontology query languages. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based data access model so that different level of data access can be provided to Web service users with different roles for different purposes. To do this we will use ontology to capture purpose hierarchies and data generalization hierarchy. We demonstrate our access model with prototypes of finance services, and also provide performance evaluation results.	data access;web service	Sven Hartmann;Hui Ma;Panrawee Vechsamutvaree	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25747-1_8	web service;web application security;web development;data web;web analytics;web standards;ws-policy;web navigation;ws-addressing;services computing;ws-i basic profile	DB	-42.74265733180478	61.25060912146208	127354

The Key Policy Attribute Based Encryption (KP-ABE) is an important method to implement the access control in cloud service. However, conventional user revocation scheme in KP-ABE costs huge computational overhead. In this paper, we focus on the important user revocation issue in KP-ABE. We introduce several control parameters, including version value, check value and user list. We combine KP-ABE with salt encryption for the implementation. We provide a novel user revocation scheme for KP-ABE to improve the user revocation issue, which can reduce the heavy computational overhead when user being revoked. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed user revocation scheme gives good performance with KP-ABE.	access control;algorithm;attribute-based encryption;broadcast encryption;cloud computing;computation;oddworld: abe's oddysee;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;pixel;salt (cryptography);server (computing);simulation	Yifan Ren;Jie Li;Yusheng Ji;Sajal K.

This paper presents a security analysis carried out in a collaboration between computer scientists and legal researchers. On the technical side it is shown that the modified Pret a Voter provides verifiability, robustness, and everlasting privacy towards the public. Everlasting privacy towards the authorities can be achieved by implementing several organisational measures. A legal evaluation of these measures demonstrates that the level of privacy achieved would be acceptable under German law.	prêt à voter	Denise Demirel;Maria Henning;Jeroen van de Graaf;Peter Y. A.

In this work-in-progress paper, we evaluate an application of blockchain as a service to implement distributed electronic voting systems. The paper proposes a novel electronic voting system based on blockchain that addresses some of the limitations in existing systems and evaluates some of the popular blockchain frameworks for the purpose of constructing a blockchain-based e-voting system. In particular, we evaluate the potential of distributed ledger technologies through the description of a case study; namely, the process of an election, and the implementation of a blockchain-based application, which improves the security and decreases the cost of hosting a nationwide election.

In formal approaches, the messages exchanged over the network are modelled by a term algebra equipped with an equational theory axiomatising the properties of the cryptographic primitives (e.g. encryption, signature). In this context, two classical notions of knowledge, deducibility and indistinguishability, yield corresponding decision problems. We propose a procedure for both problems under arbitrary convergent equational theories. Since the underlying problems are undecidable we cannot guarantee termination. Nevertheless, our procedure terminates on a wide range of equational theories. In particular, we obtain a new decidability result for a theory we encountered when studying electronic voting protocols. We also provide a prototype implementation.	communications security;computational model;computer security;constraint satisfaction problem;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;decision problem;dictionary attack;electronic notes in theoretical computer science;encryption;exclusive or;gnu indent;information and computation;karp's 21 np-complete problems;lecture notes in computer science;linear algebra;logic for programming, artificial intelligence and reasoning;natural deduction;network traffic control;online and offline;password;petri net;prototype;regular expression;springer (tank);term algebra;theory;trapdoor function;turing completeness;undecidable problem	Stefan Ciobaca;Stéphanie Delaune;Steve Kremer	2010	Journal of Automated Reasoning	10.1007/s10817-010-9197-7	discrete mathematics;formal methods;computer science;theoretical computer science;cryptographic protocol;mathematics;programming language;algorithm	Security	-36.2606713312836	73.42456480453964	128238
528869975839d4e6e353cbb1be725bfe9bcfc32b	efficient secure k-nearest neighbours over encrypted data		Enterprise customers of cloud services are wary of outsourcing sensitive user and business data due to inherent security and privacy concerns. In this context, storing and computing directly on encrypted data is an attractive solution, especially against insider attacks. Homomorphic encryption, the keystone enabling technology is unfortunately prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we focus on finding k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) directly on encrypted data, a basic data-mining and machine learning algorithm. The goal is to compute the nearest neighbours to a given query, and present exact results to the clients, without the cloud learning anything about the data, query, results, or the access and search patterns. We describe a novel protocol in the two-party cloud setting, using an underlying somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme. In comparison to the state-of-the-art protocol in this setting, we provide asymptotically faster performance, without sacrificing any security guarantees. We implemented our protocol to demonstrate that it is efficient and practical on large and relevant real-world datasets and study how it scales well across different parameters on simulated data.	cloud computing;data mining;homomorphic encryption;insider threat;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;keystone effect;machine learning;outsourcing	Manish Kesarwani;Akshar Kaul;Prasad Naldurg;Sikhar Patranabis;Gagandeep Singh;Sameep Mehta;Debdeep Mukhopadhyay	2018		10.5441/002/edbt.2018.67	data mining;database;encryption;computer science	Security	-40.04294047986045	66.05245538969133	128271

Model-based prediction algorithms without privacy concerns have been investigated with respect to shilling attacks. Similarly, various privacy-preserving model-based recommendation techniques have been proposed to handle privacy issues. However, privacy-preserving model-based collaborative filtering schemes might be subjected to shilling or profile injection attacks. Therefore, their robustness against such attacks should be scrutinized. In this paper, we investigate robustness of four well-known privacy-preserving model-based recommendation methods against six shilling attacks. We first apply masked data-based profile injection attacks to privacy-preserving k-means-, discrete wavelet transform-, singular value decomposition-, and item-based prediction algorithms. We then perform comprehensive experiments using real data to evaluate their robustness against profile injection attacks. Next, we compare non-private model-based methods with their privacy-preserving correspondences in terms of robustness. Moreover, well-known privacy-preserving memory- and model-based prediction methods are compared with respect to robustness against shilling attacks. Our empirical analysis show that couple of model-based schemes with privacy are very robust.	algorithm;attack model;bandwagon effect;cluster analysis;collaborative filtering;confidentiality;discrete logarithm;discrete wavelet transform;experiment;imperative programming;k-means clustering;nuke;numerical analysis;online shopping;privacy;reverse engineering;scalability;sensor;singular value decomposition	Alper Bilge;Ihsan Gunes;Huseyin Polat	2014	Expert Syst.

7e54421d9765b71a5134a32c68f122a73f5914e1	towards the blockchain technology for ensuring the integrity of data storage and transmission		Ensuring the security and integrity of data storage and transmission is a big challenge. One of the methods of its provision is the use of cryptographic techniques, which unfortunately require an additional time associated with the need for data encryption. The paper presents the solutions that ensure the data integrity, using blockchain technology. It describes two cases – an end-to-end verifiable blockchain-based electronic voting system with the ability to follow and verify votes and election results and a lightweight blockchain based protocol for secure data transfer to ensure the integrity of transferred data with a minimal cryptographic overhead.	bitcoin	Michal Pawlak;Sayed Mohammad Sakhaei;Aneta Poniszewska-Maranda	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-02671-4_18	verifiable secret sharing;computer security;cryptography;data security;encryption;data transmission;electronic voting;data integrity;computer data storage;computer science	Arch	-42.81603981483396	67.59656194113316	128503

In internet communications, efficient and secure trust negotiation between virtual individuals/organizations is very important because it can achieve resource sharing, collaborative computing and communication security. This investigation aims to strengthen the efficiency and security of trust negotiation by (1) introducing a new negotiation strategy to set up trust relationships, (2) using more precise principles to attain better access control policy assignments, and (3) involving iterative computation and a cache mechanism to further enhance negotiation efficiency. Experimental evaluation shows that our new scheme, which achieves a well-balanced tradeoff between efficiency and security, is able to outperform related schemes in most situations.	access control;communications security;computation;credential;internet;iteration;iterative method;recurrent neural network;spectral leakage;trust management (managerial science);ws-trust	Po-Jen Chuang;Ming-Yu Ni	2012	2012 Fifth International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming	10.1109/PAAP.2012.11	security association;business;internet privacy;computer security;computational trust;computer network	Security	-43.55880782901482	66.40363362502679	128565

But still it could not mark a remarkable contribution to neither rural nor urban areas. People realized its impact when it saved a life from becoming an extinct. Telemedicine connects patient and specialized doctors remotely and also allows them to share the sensitive medical records. Irrespective of the mode of data exchange, all types of media are vulnerable to security and performance issues. Remote data exchange during an emergency situation should not be delayed and at the same time should not be altered. While transit, a single bit change could be interpreted differently at the other end. Hence telemedicine comes with all the challenges of performance and security issues. Delay, cost and scalability are the pressing performance factors whereas integrity, availability and accountability are the security issues need to be addressed. This paper lights up on security without compromising quality of service. Telemedicine is on track from standard PSTN, wireless Mobile phones and satellites.

To achieve confidentiality, we encrypt the data using the encryption algorithm in our prior work before uploading to the cloud, and then attach pre-classified keywords to them for ciphertext-searching, which are generated by a statistically consistent public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) scheme, so the service provider can use the corresponding trapdoor to identify all data containing some specific keywords without learning anything else.

We argue that this is due to poor performance, functionality, and scalability, as well as architectures that do not meet the needs of e-commerce applications.

In order to reduce the authentication delay, the IEEE 802.11 work group has defined a pre-authentication scheme; however, the defined scheme works in the MAC layer and does not work in the network layer in IP routing-based multi-domain networks. In this study, the authors proposed a practical secure and fast handoff framework, called V2V, which not only extends the 802.11i pre-authentication scheme to overcome the above limitations, but also supports pre-configuration with dynamic host configuration protocol to reduce the handoff delay further. A prototype of the V2V system is implemented and the testing results show that one can reduce the overall handoff delay, including association, authentication, IP configuration and mobile IP location update, to no more than 50 ms, which can support most time-sensitive applications such as VoIP.

Because data stored in the cloud may be lost or corrupted, users are suggested to verify data integrity before the utilization of cloud data. A series of schemes have been proposed to enable a public verifier to efficiently check the correctness of cloud data without downloading the whole data from the cloud server. Unfortunately, few of them have considered about public verification on multi-owner cloud data while still preserving identity privacy of owners from public verifiers, where each block in these cloud data should be signed by multiple owners. In this paper, we design a novel public verification scheme to audit the integrity of multi-owner data stored in the cloud. With our scheme, a public verifier is able to efficiently check the integrity of multi-owner data with a very small communication cost compared with the size of the entire data. Meanwhile, the private identities of these owners are protected and not revealed to any public verifier. In addition, our scheme can also efficiently support group dynamics for multiple owners and enable batch verification. Security analyses and experimental results indicate our scheme is correct, secure and efficient. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In order to reduce the user's anxiety to store the private and confidential information in the cloud, various Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) techniques are developed, which enable the cloud to perform data mining from secured data. In this paper, we propose a PPDM technique specialized in data aggregation that satisfies following two requirements: (1)The information stored in the cloud is guaranteed against information leakage, because no profitable information is obtained from the secured data without the users' secret information, which is not stored in the cloud. (2)The cloud provides multi-level granularity of the aggregation results according to the user's authority.	cloud computing;confidentiality;data aggregation;data mining;information leakage;privacy;requirement;spectral leakage	Mebae Ushida;Kouichi Itoh;Yoshinori Katayama;Fumihiko Kozakura;Hiroshi Tsuda	2013	2013 16th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems	10.1109/NBiS.2013.24	cloud computing security;cloud computing;information privacy;computer science;data mining;database;iterative method;authorization;internet privacy;computer security;encryption	DB	-42.133987398692405	65.9766581260907	129123

Moreover, users on nets might also be intermediaries, inter-actors, interferences or message providers, even service providers. Information on the Internet is dramatically growing. On one hand, it is good for all users to gain more information; on the other hands, it is getting more annoying to get too much information or too many messages daily. Some of them are useful, but the rest is annoying and useless. The useless information a user gets is often called “Spam”. When a user is unwilling to receive spam, it is his/her privilege to reject it. Many self-service web services are applied to categorize the incoming messages through rough site policies, especially on email servers. Junk emails are classified and put into a folder of spam if it fits a specified filter. Thus, a user does not have to read through the suspicious junk emails in his normal incoming folder. However, this spam is not trashed. When the user wants to read the junk email, those emails can still be found. When cellular phones are involved in our daily life, mobile messages become another fast growing issue. Unfortunately, junk mobile message filters are not provided in the mobile phone environment yet. Users are forced to receive every incoming message, and then manually choose to read or ignore it. If every acceptance or refusal requests users’ approval, the time wasted and nuisance is unacceptable. CAIS, which stands for Context Awareness Information Services, is proposed in this paper. CAIS is composed of several mobile services, so it provides a mobile context awareness communication based on the idea of information sharing and location based communication. It also contains a set of pre-defined policy, so users can only get and share the information on demand. By means of location based communication, the cost of transferring messages is negligible and information sharing is processed in silence.	categorization;context awareness;email;fits;internet;location-based service;mobile phone;spamming;web service	Yih-Jiun Lee	2010	AISS	10.4156/aiss.vol2.issue3.7	computer science;knowledge management;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-48.25535273742729	65.3777165818883	129168
d8ecce854767d4ec5442268c3939018ce66006fb	a privacy-preserving method with flexible charging schedules for electric vehicles in the smart grid		The Smart Grid (SG) is an emerging modernized electrical power system with advanced monitoring and control mechanism, and improved fault-tolerance. Electric Vehicles (EVs), with their energy storage capability, are gaining popularity as an integral part of the energy management system in the SG. To balance the load-demand condition of the grid, EVs are required to schedule a charging event before participation. However, the information transmitted by an EV in charging events can reveal personal information of its owner. The privacy-preserving methods for EVs in existing literature are based on anonymous authentication mechanism, where, missing a charging event by an EV is considered as malicious and the EV is penalized. However, missing a charging event may happen due to many valid reasons and flexibility of scheduling can encourage consumer participation. In this paper, an authentication method is proposed to achieve anonymity and flexibility in charging events for EVs. Additionally, a charging station network setup that divides a large regional area into smaller zones to improve privacy, is proposed. Results based on a MATLAB simulation are presented to demonstrate the Degree of Anonymity (DoA) achieved in different stages of the proposed method, the optimal number of missed charging events, and sub-division of zones.	authentication;cascading style sheets;degree of anonymity;entity;extended validation certificate;fault tolerance;floor and ceiling functions;grid computing;matlab;personally identifiable information;privacy;scheduling (computing);simulation;sonic generations;subdivision surface;suicidegirls	Sabrina Afrin;Andres Kwasinski	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384130	charging station;grid;computer network;electric power;business;embedded system;smart grid;electric vehicle;energy management system;schedule;authentication	EDA	-45.23579197439124	66.38790171013723	129219

E-healthcare is the use of web-based systems to share and deliver information across the internet. The design of proper models for authorization and access control for e-Health system services is necessary in a large health service. Usage control has been considered as the next generation access control model with distinguishing properties of decision continuity. It has been proven to be efficient to improve security administration with flexible authorization management. Usage control enables finer-grained control over usage of digital objects than that of traditional access control policies and models. In this paper, we have enriched the research for usage access control with purpose extension that is able to be applied in the field of medical information system or e-Healthcare system.

A cryptographic file system protects the users’ data from the file server, which is possibly untrusted and might exhibit Byzantine behavior, by encrypting the data before sending it to the server. The consistency of the encrypted file objects that implement a cryptographic file system relies on the consistency of the two components used to implement them: the file storage protocol and the key distribution protocol. We first define two generic classes of consistency conditions that extend and generalize existing consistency conditions. We then formally define consistency for encrypted file objects in a generic way: for any consistency conditions for the key and file objects belonging to one of the two classes of consistency conditions considered, we define a corresponding consistency condition for encrypted file objects. We finally provide, in our main result, necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of the key distribution and file storage protocols under which the encrypted storage is consistent. Our framework allows the composition of existing key distribution and file storage protocols to build consistent encrypted file objects and simplifies complex proofs for showing the consistency of encrypted storage.	british undergraduate degree classification;causal consistency;cryptography;file server;filesystem-level encryption;first-class function;high- and low-level;key distribution;linearizability;race condition;release consistency;server (computing)	Alina Oprea;Michael K.

e6a29f48e4b20b800b4a94fe118b445b181d5373	expsos: secure and verifiable outsourcing of exponentiation operations for mobile cloud computing		Discrete exponential operation, such as modular exponentiation and scalar multiplication on elliptic curves, is a basic operation of many public-key cryptosystems. However, the exponential operations are considered prohibitively expensive for resource-constrained mobile devices. In this paper, we address the problem of secure outsourcing of exponentiation operations to one single untrusted server. Our proposed secure outsourcing scheme for general exponential (ExpSOS) only requires a very limited number of modular multiplications at local mobile environment, and thus it can achieve significant computational performance gain. ExpSOS also provides a secure verification scheme with probability approximately 1 to ensure that the mobile end users can always receive valid results. The comprehensive analysis as well as the simulation results in real mobile device demonstrates that our proposed ExpSOS can significantly improve the existing schemes in efficiency, security, and result verifiability. We apply ExpSOS to securely outsource several cryptographic protocols to show that ExpSOS can be widely applied to many computation-intensive applications and achieve significant performance improvement.	computation;cryptographic protocol;cryptosystem;formal verification;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;modular exponentiation;outsourcing;overhead (computing);public-key cryptography;security parameter;server (computing);simulation;time complexity	Kai Zhou;Mohamed Hossam Afifi;Jian Ren	2017	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2017.2710941	computer science;verifiable secret sharing;cloud computing;cryptography;mobile cloud computing;cryptographic protocol;modular exponentiation;exponentiation;outsourcing;distributed computing	Security	-40.15446218396728	70.39951200201818	129973

In 2011, Zhou et al. proposed a mutual authentication and key agreement scheme with the user anonymity for roaming environments. In this article, however, we reveal that the authentication protocol presented by Zhou et al. suffers from certain weaknesses which have been overlooked during design. As a consequence of these weaknesses, Zhou et al.’s scheme cannot achieve desired security. Therefore, here we propose a novel authentication scheme to overcome these weaknesses that is efficient, secure, and causes significantly less computational overhead as compared to Zhou et al.’s scheme. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

65b4c7c331ac29f36a4da28989345de783e9d4fe	breaking pptp vpns via radius encryption		We describe an efficient cross-protocol attack, which enables an attacker to learn the VPN session key shared between a victim client and a VPN endpoint. The attack recovers the key which is used to encrypt and authenticate VPN traffic. It leverages a weakness of the RADIUS protocol executed between a VPN endpoint and a RADIUS server, and allows an “insider” attacker to read the VPN traffic of other users or to escalate its own privileges with significantly smaller effort than previously known attacks on MS-CHAPv2.	authentication;chosen-ciphertext attack;ciphertext;communication endpoint;computational complexity theory;computer;encryption;key derivation function;key space (cryptography);known-plaintext attack;layer 2 tunneling protocol;linux;ms-chap;operating system;password cracking;plaintext;point-to-point tunneling protocol;radius;server (computing);session key;smartphone;virtual private network	Matthias Horst;Martin Grothe;Tibor Jager;Jörg Schwenk	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-48965-0_10	distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-44.75962983859905	68.65330190639186	130346
6da2d8112a8b5b7b687b06178e2a4b6fd0edaafe	a new quantum sealed-bid auction protocol with secret order in post-confirmation	collusion;quantum sealed bid auction;quantum communication	A new security protocol for quantum sealed-bid auction is proposed to resist the collusion attack from some malicious bidders. The most significant feature of this protocol is that bidders prepare their particles with secret order in post-confirmation for encoding bids. In addition, a new theorem and its proof are given based on the theory of combinatorial mathematics, which can be used as evaluation criteria for the collusion attack. It is shown that the new protocol is immune to the collusion attack and meets the demand for a secure auction. Compared with those previous protocols, the security, efficiency and availability of the proposed protocol are largely improved.

However, c loud stores lack the ability to manage data provenance. Data provenance desc ribes how a particular piece of data has been produced. It is vital for a post-incide t investigation, widely used in healthcare, scientific collaboration, forensic analys is and legal proceedings. Data provenance needs to be secured since it may reve l private information about the sensitive data while the cloud service provider d oes not guarantee confidentiality of the data stored in dispersed geographica l locations. This paper proposes a scheme to secure data provenance in the c loud while offering the encrypted search.	attribute-based encryption;boolean expression;cloud computing;cloud storage;confidentiality;cryptography;encryption;entity;google search;overhead (computing);personally identifiable information;prototype;range query (data structures);response time (technology);scalability	Muhammad Rizwan Asghar;Mihaela Ion;Giovanni Russello;Bruno Crispo	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27585-2_12	computer science;database;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-41.57302309291019	66.29218478759296	130559
0da1db8528463bb1dabc367f85e1b58f4642dc38	on the quantification of identity and link disclosures in randomizing social networks	social network;background knowledge;empirical evaluation	Many applications of social networks require identity and/or relationship anonymity due to the sensitive, stigmatizing, or confidential nature of user identities and their behaviors. Recent work showed that the simple technique of anonymizing graphs by replacing the identifying information of the nodes with random ids does not guarantee privacy since the identification of the nodes can be seriously jeopar- dized by applying subgraph queries. In this chapter, we investigate how well an edge based graph randomization approach can protect node identities and sensitive links. Specifically, we quantify both identity disclosure and link disclosure when adver- saries have one specific type of background knowledge (i.e., knowing the degrees of target individuals). Our theoretical studies and empirical evaluations show that edge randomization is a necessity in addition to node anonymization in order to preserve privacy in the released graph.	social network	Xiaowei Ying;Xintao Wu;Kai Pan;Ling Guo	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04141-9_5	data mining;mathematics;social psychology;computer security	ML	-39.10230157424343	63.372758764842175	130623

However, the absence of formal verification can lead to security errors remaining undetected. Formal verification techniques, on the other hand, provide a systematic way of discovering protocol flaws. This paper discusses the process of formal verification using modal logics. The verification process is demonstrated by way of case studies on three security protocols, which are designed for use in mobile communications. Our formal analysis discovers all known flaws in the three chosen protocols. Further, a hitherto unknown flaw is identified in these protocols. This flaw causes a protocol failure, which can be exploited in an attack where an adversary impersonates a legitimate protocol participant. A new protocol, resistant to this attack, is proposed and formally verified, giving confidence in the correctness of the protocol. The result of these case studies, where formal verification successfully discovers all these flaws, demonstrates that using formal verification techniques is an imperative step in the design of security protocols. 2003 Elsevier B.V.

13d0f69204bc4a78acc9b8fecb91f41ab1a76823	privacy aspects of recommender systems	technology and engineering	The popularity of online recommender systems has soared; they are deployed in numerous websites and gather tremendous amounts of user data that are necessary for the recommendation purposes. This data, however, may pose a severe threat to user privacy, if accessed by untrusted parties or used inappropriately. Hence, it is of paramount importance for recommender system designers and service providers to find a sweet spot, which allows them to generate accurate recommendations and guarantee the privacy of their users. In this chapter we overview the state of the art in privacy enhanced recommendations. We analyze the risks to user privacy imposed by recommender systems, survey the existing solutions, and discuss the privacy implications for the users of the recommenders. We conclude that a considerable effort is still required to develop practical recommendation solutions that provide adequate privacy guarantees, while at the same time facilitating the delivery of high-quality recommendations to their users.

32642e02d362b2edbce716709b083789091e9abd	parallel real time investigation of communication security changes based on probabilistic timed automata		The proposition is connected with the research of the security or threats referring to message decryption, user dishonesty, a non-fresh nonce, uncontrolled information jurisdiction, etc. (that means security properties - attributes), in network communication processes [3]. Encrypted messages are usually sent in the form of protocol operations. Protocols may be mutually interleaving, creating the so called runs, and their operations can appear as mutual parallel processes. The investigation regards both particular security attributes and their compositions referring to more general factors, such as: concrete users, protocols, public keys, secrets, messages, etc. Probabilistic timed automata (PTA) and Petri nets characterize the token set and the complex form of conditions which have to be fulfilled for the realization of transition [5]. The abovementioned situation forms a conception pertaining to the parallel strategy realized with the help of the Petri net that includes the set of security tokens (attributes) in each node.	communications security;timed automaton	Henryk Piech;Grzegorz Grodzki	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39426-8_13	real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;timed automaton	Theory	-37.0774647545291	72.21306873945566	130747

We show that while recent advances in anonymization algorithms provide increased levels of protection, it is still possible to calculate approximations to the original data set. In some cases, one can even uniquely reconstruct entries in a table before anonymization. In this paper, we demonstrate how knowledge of an anonymization algorithm based on ambiguating data cell entries can be used to undo the anonymization process. We investigate the effect of this algorithm and its reversal on data sets of varying sizes and distributions. It is shown that by using a computationally complex disambiguation process, information on individuals can be extracted from an anonymized data set.	algorithm;approximation;data anonymization;database;extraction;undo;word-sense disambiguation;anonymized	Stephan Dreiseitl;Staal A.

These are designed either to bind a cryptographic key or to generate cryptographic key using biometric features. The deployment of bio-cryptosystem technique, namely fuzzy extractor in multimodal biometric system leads to increase in user privacy and system security. This paper provides with a framework where feature level fusion of iris and dual fingerprint forms a multimodal template and key is generated using fuzzy extractors, in order to provide reliability and good recognition performance. The hash function is used to protect the key generated from biometric traits. Since fuzzy extractor operates only on ordered dataset. However the minutiae points of fingerprint are unordered, so an algorithm is designed for conversion of unordered minutiae points to ordered minutiae dataset to make it consistent for key generation methods.	algorithm;authentication;biometrics;british informatics olympiad;cryptography;cryptosystem;database;encryption;experiment;fingerprint;fuzzy concept;fuzzy extractor;hash function;key (cryptography);key generation;lock (computer science);minutiae;multimodal interaction;randomness extractor;software deployment;unordered associative containers (c++)	Taranpreet Kaur;Manvjeet Kaur	2017	2017 Tenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3)	10.1109/IC3.2017.8284321	artificial intelligence;encryption;pattern recognition;cryptography;cryptosystem;biometrics;minutiae;hash function;key generation;computer science;key (cryptography)	Security	-45.56891377501391	70.06866130011826	131446

Although the data sources are willing to mine the union of their data, they don’t want to reveal any sensitive and private information to other sources due to competition or legal concerns. In this paper, we consider two scenarios where data are vertically or horizontally partitioned over more than two parties. We focus on the classification problem, and present novel privacy preserving decision tree learning methods. Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that these methods can provide good capability of privacy preserving, accuracy and efficiency.	algorithm;association rule learning;cluster analysis;data mining;decision tree learning;homomorphic encryption;personally identifiable information;privacy;structure mining	Weiwei Fang;Bingru Yang;Dingli Song	2010	JCP	10.4304/jcp.5.5.733-740	homomorphic encryption;decision tree learning;computer science;machine learning;decision tree;incremental decision tree;data mining;database;internet privacy	ML	-40.06197199657241	64.4518301088354	131472

This paper proposes a pseudonymization protocol for data gathered by the meters: the protocol relies on a network infrastructure that involves a set of Privacy Preserving Nodes (PPNs). These nodes perform data pseudonymization without having access to the measurements, which are masked by means of a secret splitting scheme. Multiple entities such as utilities and third parties are allowed to collect pseudonymized data, which maintain their temporal sequentiality along a time window of finite duration, but cannot relate them to the identities of the users that generated the data or to the data generated by the same user in the preceding or following time windows.

Second, it converts a numericalized EPAL policy specified as a list of rules following the first-match semantics to a tree structure for efficient processing of numericalized requests.	algorithm;data structure;enterprise privacy authorization language;experiment;formal language;ibm notes;information security;mathematical optimization;meta-object facility;numerical analysis;privacy policy;tree structure;web application	Zheng Qin;Fei Chen;Qiang Wang;Alex X.

However, due to the multiple readings in many cases in detecting an RFID tag and the deployment of multiple readers, RFID data contains many duplicates. Since RFID data is generated in a streaming fashion, it is difficult to remove duplicates in one pass with limitedmemory.We propose one pass approximate methods based on Bloom Filters using a small amount of memory. We first devise Time Bloom Filters as a simple extension to Bloom Filters. We then propose Time Interval Bloom Filters to reduce errors. Time Interval Bloom Filters need more space than Time Bloom Filters. We propose a method to reduce space for Time Interval Bloom Filters. Since Time Bloom Filters and Time Interval Bloom Filters are based on Bloom Filters, they do not produce false negative errors. Experimental results show that our approaches can effectively remove duplicates in RFID data streams in one pass with a small amount of memory. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

54652b948e25b302d174826087d408cb0a1426a7	stochastic privacy		Online services such as web search and e-commerce applications typically rely on the collection of data about users, including details of their activities on the web. Such personal data is used to maximize revenues via targeting of advertisements and longer engagements of users, and to enhance the quality of service via personalization of content. To date, service providers have largely followed the approach of either requiring or requesting consent for collecting user data. Users may be willing to share private information in return for incentives, enhanced services, or assurances about the nature and extent of the logged data. We introduce stochastic privacy, an approach to privacy centering on the simple concept of providing people with a guarantee that the probability that their personal data will be shared does not exceed a given bound. Such a probability, which we refer to as the privacy risk, can be given by users as a preference or communicated as a policy by a service provider. Service providers can work to personalize and to optimize revenues in accordance with preferences about privacy risk. We present procedures, proofs, and an overall system for maximizing the quality of services, while respecting bounds on privacy risk. We demonstrate the methodology with a case study and evaluation of the procedures applied to web search personalization. We show how we can achieve near-optimal utility of accessing information with provable guarantees on the probability of sharing data.	algorithm;e-commerce;e-services;file spanning;np-hardness;online service provider;personalization;personally identifiable information;privacy;provable security;quality of service;risk aversion;systems design;user (computing);web search engine	Adish Singla;Eric Horvitz;Ece Kamar;Ryen W.

Although data outsourcing provides many benefits, especially for parties with limited resources for managing an ever more increasing amount of data, it introduces new privacy and security concerns. In this paper we discuss the main privacy issues to be addressed in data outsourcing, ranging from data confidentiality to data utility. We then illustrate the main research directions being investigated for providing effective data protection to data externally stored and for enabling their querying.	confidentiality;information privacy;outsourcing;programming paradigm	Pierangela Samarati;Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati	2010		10.1145/1755688.1755690	confidentiality;data quality;computer science;database;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-41.78413855977707	65.28503851205247	132287
43510ed8a73490874c851a2b1ba4321cdf28c004	enhanced pki authentication with trusted product at claimant		In this paper, a data structure to enhance PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) authentication is proposed generalizing the concept of ISO/IEC 24761. Current technologies do not provide sufficient information on products which are used in the authentication process at the Claimant to the Verifier. As a result, the Verifier cannot sufficiently distinguish the authentication result executed with a trusted product from that without a trusted product. The difference is made clear if evidence data of the execution of authentication process at the Claimant are generated by the trusted product and used for verification by the Verifier. Data structure for such data is proposed in this paper as client Authentication Context (cAC) instance. Relation to other works and extension of the proposal where biometrics is used are also described for further improvement of PKI authentication. For this proposal to realize, standardization activities are to be considered as the next steps.	authentication;public key infrastructure	Asahiko Yamada;Tatsuro Ikeda	2017	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2017.01.001	data authentication algorithm;chip authentication program;computer science;authentication protocol;generic bootstrapping architecture;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-43.44610558100231	73.49432718901849	132347

In the proposed scheme, multiple agents can be added or deleted and the shared secret need not be changed. Our DQDSS scheme has several advantages. The dealer is not required to retain any photons and can further share a predetermined key instead of a random key to the agents. Agents can update their shadows periodically, and the dealer does not need to be online. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can resist not only the existing attacks, but also cheating attacks from dishonest agents. Hence, compared to some famous DQSS schemes, the proposed scheme is more efficient and more practical. Finally, we establish a mathematical model about the efficiency and security of the scheme and perform simulation analyses with different parameters using MATLAB.	greenberger–horne–zeilinger state;key (cryptography);matlab;mathematical model;property (philosophy);secret sharing;shared secret;simulation	Yun Song;Zhihui Li;Yongming Li	2018	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-018-1970-2	cheating;shared secret;theoretical computer science;photon;quantum mechanics;secret sharing;physics;shadow;quantum	Crypto	-40.48774496825568	73.44875558539898	132374

In banking applications of some countries, the authorization of user transactions is performed with support of cryptographic One-Time-Password (OTP) tokens implementing ANSI X9.9-based challenge-response protocols. The legacy ANSI X9.9 standard is a DES-based authentication method on which we will demonstrate an attack based on a special-purpose hardware cluster. In this work we show how to break such an OTP-token with little effort in terms of costs and time. With an investment of about US $ 10,000 we are able to perform an attack which computes the key of a DES-based OTP token in less than a week having only three challenge-response pairs. Our attack can even be scaled linearly according to the budget of the attacker resulting in even faster breaking times. With this work, we want to point out once more that the immediate migration from legacy products using the DES algorithm is absolutely mandatory for security critical applications.	algorithm;authorization;best, worst and average case;brute-force attack;challenge–response authentication;computation;confidentiality;cryptography;custom hardware attack;e-commerce;encryption;online banking;password;scalability;single sign-on;token ring;transaction authentication	Tim Güneysu;Christof Paar	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-85230-8_10	cryptanalysis;computer science;internet privacy;one-time password;world wide web;computer security;statistics	Security	-44.73860866429498	70.56705685968146	132759
0c76f8095b60ce2b00356296b20e5882a091d423	a lightweight privacy-preserving oauth2-based protocol for smart city mobile apps		In the forthcoming Smart City scenario, users' mobile applications will be of fundamental role towards supporting the envisioned functionalities and services. Mobile users, provided with a smartphone, will be capable of ubiquitously connecting to service providers through their installed mobile applications. However, this connection must be authenticated, which threatens the citizen privacy rights. Privacy-preserving mechanisms have already been proposed in the past; nevertheless, they are based on RSA groups or groups with bilinear pairings, which are inefficient in mobile devices due to its computational complexity. Thus, in this paper, we integrate a lightweight anonymous credential mechanism, suitable for computationally-limited mobile devices, into the user authentication phase of the OAuth2 protocol, which has become a de facto solution for user authentication in mobile applications. The proposed protocol enables citizen's authentication towards service providers, while preserving their privacy. Additionally, the protocol is compliant with the OAuth2 specification, which enables an easy integration in current mobile application implementations.	authentication;authentication server;autonomous robot;bilinear filtering;computational complexity theory;digital credential;digital signature;entity;mobile app;mobile device;oauth;privacy;server (computing);smart city;smartphone	Victor Sucasas;Georgios Mantas;Ayman Radwan;Jonathan Rodriguez	2016	2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7848816	mobile search;mobile web;mobile database;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network;mobile payment	Mobile	-46.58201509619377	65.59132885287515	132830

However, biometric features such as fingerprints are unchangeable throughout the life of individuals. Thus, once biometric data have been compromised, they cannot be used for authentication securely ever again. To address this issue, an authentication scheme called cancellable biometrics has been studied. However, there remains a major challenge to achieve both strong security and practical accuracy. The correlation invariant random filtering (CIRF) is an algorithm for cancellable biometrics with provable security and practical accuracy. However, the security proof requires an unrealistically strong assumption with regard to biometric features. The authors examine the security of the CIRF when the assumption is not satisfied, and show that there are vulnerabilities. To address the problems, the authors interpret the CIRF from an algebraic point of view and generalise it based on a quotient polynomial ring. Then several theorems are proved, which derive a new transformation algorithm. The security of the algorithm without any condition on the biometric features is proved. The authors also evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm by applying it to the chip matching algorithm for fingerprint verification and show that it does not degrade the matching accuracy.	biometrics;polynomial ring;provable security	Kenta Takahashi;Ken Naganuma	2012	IET Biometrics	10.1049/iet-bmt.2011.0007	fingerprint verification competition;vulnerability;computer science;theoretical computer science;archaeology;mathematics;internet privacy;computer security;biometrics	Crypto	-38.046170617014575	70.83898697492268	132838

An emerging application of DTNs are rural area DTNs, which provide Internet connectivity to rural areas in developing regions using conventional transportation mediums, like buses. Potential applications of these rural area DTNs are e-governance, telemedicine and citizen journalism. Therefore, security and privacy are critical for DTNs. Traditional cryptographic techniques based on PKI-certified public keys assume continuous network access, which makes these techniques inapplicable to DTNs. We present the first anonymous communication solution for DTNs and introduce a new anonymous authentication protocol as a part of it. Furthermore, we present a security infrastructure for DTNs to provide efficient secure communication based on identity-based cryptography. We show that our solutions have better performance than existing security infrastructures for DTNs.	access network;authentication protocol;bus (computing);ciphertext;delay-tolerant networking;e-governance;electronic billing;end-to-end principle;id-based cryptography;information-based complexity;public key infrastructure;routing;secure communication;store and forward;traffic analysis	Aniket Kate;Gregory M.

The key problems of this approach include establishing access control for the encrypted data, and revoking the access rights from users when they are no longer authorized to access the encrypted data on cloud servers. This paper aims to solve these problems. Firstly, based on the attribute encryption and the dual encryption system, we propose a concrete access control scheme constructed over the composite order bilinear groups, and we prove its security under the standard model. Then, we propose a fully fine-grained revocation scheme under the direct revocation model, so as to efficiently revoke access rights from users on cloud servers.	access control;authorization;bilinear filtering;broadcast encryption;chosen-ciphertext attack;ciphertext;cloud computing;outsourcing;semantic security	Shan-Shan Tu;Shao-Zhang Niu;Hui Li;Xiao-Ming Yun;Meng-Jiao Li	2012	2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum	10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.265	40-bit encryption;cloud computing;client-side encryption;computer science;cryptography;access control;operating system;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption;computer network	Security	-41.74165238626379	68.15717239530049	133470
1575522f1ea0fbddd3bc8916d988fe224cead0a4	rare: defeating side channels based on data-deduplication in cloud storage		Client-side data deduplication enables cloud storage services (e.g., Dropbox) to achieve both storage and bandwidth savings, resulting in reduced operating cost and high level of user satisfaction. However, the deduplication checks (i.e., the corresponding essential message exchange) create a side channel, exposing the privacy of file existence status to the attacker. In particular, the binary response from the deduplication check reveals the information about the existence of a copy of the file in the cloud storage. This behavior can be exploited to launch further attacks such as learning the sensitive file content and establishing a covert channel. While current solutions provide only weaker privacy or rely on unreasonable assumptions, we propose RAndom REsponse (RARE) approach to achieve stronger privacy. The idea behind our proposed RARE solution is that the uploading user sends the deduplication request for two chunks at once. The cloud receiving the deduplication request returns the randomized deduplication response with the careful design so as to preserve the deduplication gain and at the same time minimize the privacy leakage. Our analytical results confirm privacy guarantee and results show that both deduplication benefit and privacy of RARE can be preserved.	client-side;cloud computing;cloud storage;covert channel;data deduplication;dropbox;high-level programming language;randomized algorithm;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;upload	Zahra Pooranian;Kang-Cheng Chen;Chia-Mu Yu;Mauro Conti	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2018.8406888	cloud computing;covert channel;data deduplication;side channel attack;cloud storage;computer network;upload;server;computer science;communication channel	Security	-42.80471266971082	68.74296541833282	133472

63ce098607d39dd7f87aba049e57748f287d4e4d	paying the guard: an entry-guard-based payment system for tor		When choosing the three relays that compose a circuit, Tor selects the first hop among a restricted number of relays called entry guards, pre-selected by the user himself. The reduced number of entry guards, that until recently was fixed to three, helps in mitigating the effects of several traffic analysis attacks. However, recent literature indicates that the number should be further reduced, and the time during which the user keeps the relays as guards increased. Therefore, developers of Tor recently proposed selecting only one entry guard, which is to be used by the user for all circuits and for a prolonged period of time (nine months). While this design choice was made to increase the security of the protocol, it also opens an unprecedented opportunity for a market mechanism where relays get paid for traffic by the users. In this paper, we propose to use the entry guard as the point-of-sale: users subscribe to their entry guard of choice, and deposit an amount that will be used for paying for the circuits. From the entry guard, income is then distributed to the other relays included in circuits through an interrelay accounting system. While the user may pay the entry guard using BitCoins, or any other anonymous payment system, the relays exchange I Owe You (IOU) certificates during communication, and settle their balances only at synchronized, later points in time. This novel deferred payment approach overcomes the weaknesses of the previously proposed Tor payment mechanisms: we separate the user’s payment from the interrelay payments, and we effectively unlink both from the chosen path, thus preserving the secrecy of the circuit.	bitcoin;point of sale;relay;routing;tor messenger;traffic analysis	Paolo Palmieri;Johan A.

In a recent paper, Das et al. proposed a secure and efficient uniqueness-and-anonymity-preserving remote user authentication scheme for connected health care. This scheme uses three factors, e.g. biometrics, password, and smart card, to protect the security. It protects user privacy and is believed to have many abilities to resist a range of network attacks, even if the secret information stored in the smart card is compromised. In this paper, we analyze the security of Das et al.’s scheme, and show that the scheme is in fact insecure against the replay attack, user impersonation attacks and off-line guessing attacks. Then, we also propose a robust uniqueness-and-anonymity-preserving remote user authentication scheme for connected health care. Compared with the existing schemes, our protocol uses a different user authentication mechanism to resist replay attack. We show that our proposed scheme can provide stronger security than previous protocols. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme through the BAN (Burrows, Abadi, and Needham) logic.	authentication;authorization;biologic preservation;biometrics;burrows–abadi–needham logic;health care;needham–schroeder protocol;online and offline;password;protocols documentation;replay attack;smart card;stolen product;weakness;women's health services;interest	Fengtong Wen	2013	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-013-9980-1	smart card;anonymity;challenge–response authentication;computer science;information security;authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;biometrics	Security	-44.28457078831975	64.45114756021519	133792

Password-based authentication scheme is the most common method to check the validity of the login message and authenticate the user. Recently, many authentication schemes [1]–[12] have been proposed to improve the security and practicability of authentication. Quite recently, Wang et al. [12] proposed an efficient and secure dynamic ID-based remote user authentication scheme based on the one-way secure hash function. Wang et al. claimed that their scheme has the following merits: 1) it allows users to change and choose passwords freely; 2) server does not maintain any verifier tables because it uses a smartcard to store a secret key; 3) it provides mutual authentication between user and remote server; 4) it overcomes the fatal drawback that user’s authentication is independent of the password; 5) it is secure to against ID-theft [9]–[11], replay attacks and insider attacks, etc. Unfortunately, we find that Wang et al.’s scheme [12] is still vulnerable to impersonation attacks. Accordingly, this letter demonstrates that Wang et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to impersonation attacks, in which an attacker can easily impersonate any legal user.	cryptographic hash function;key (cryptography);login;mutual authentication;one-way function;password;replay attack;server (computing);smart card	Eun-Jun Yoon;Kee-Young Yoo	2012	IEICE Transactions		data authentication algorithm;smart card;password policy;chip authentication program;s/key;pass the hash;challenge–response authentication;computer science;authentication protocol;generic bootstrapping architecture;hash chain;multi-factor authentication;hash-based message authentication code;internet privacy;one-time password;password;computer security;cryptographic hash function;computer network	Security	-45.01436610930335	73.61114580057382	134254

Conversely, the business model is not clear: given a copy-protected object, its owner must be paid back for each transaction taking place from a provider to a receiver. The P2P paradigm assumes that a receiver turns into a provider, but it is questionable why she/he should provide properly the content, if the owner wants to be reimbursed. Actual systems introduce fairness, giving incentives (e.g., a differential service, like in BitTorrent) to altruistic peers, with the consequence that the owner of an object is economically damaged everyday. Hence, music and film industry sees P2P techniques as a hostile framework for distributing copy protected content for free: today’s answer of the industry is investing in DRM-based solutions, that are not interoperable between different devices and players. In this paper, we present FairPeers, a P2P market framework, that joins a straightforward intellectual property protection and a fair economic model by maintaining the efficiency typical of P2P file sharing systems. The study is completed with an exhaustive security analysis, and the description of a prototype implementation that shows that the P2P paradigm is mature enough to present to the broadest community new revenue models, simply using available tools and state-of-the-art techniques.	bittorrent;copy protection;digital distribution;fairness measure;file sharing;interoperability;malware;micropayment;multi-source;peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;prototype;scalability	Giancarlo Ruffo;Rossano Schifanella	2007	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-007-9066-9	business model;bittorrent;differentiated service;computer science;economic model;peer-to-peer;internet privacy;security analysis;computer security;file sharing;intellectual property;computer network	Networks	-46.24297286612878	67.49231507965042	134455

It has been extensively applied in privacy-preserving computation, such as privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM), to protect data privacy. However, most SMC-based solutions are ad-hoc. They are proposed for specific applications, and thus cannot be applied to other applications directly. To address this issue, we propose a privacy model DAG (Directed A cyclic Graph) that consists of a set of secure operators (e.g., Multiplication and division). Our DAG model is general -- its operators, if pipelined together, can implement various functions. It is also extendable -- secure operators can be defined to add new features to the model. As an application study, we have applied our DAG to kernel regression. Experiments on datasets of more than 680,000 tuples show that our DAG model is effective and its running time is nearly thrice that of non-privacy setting, where parties directly disclose data.	cloud computing;confidentiality;data mining;directed acyclic graph;extensibility;hoc (programming language);information privacy;secure multi-party computation;time complexity;web service	Sin Gee Teo;Jianneng Cao;Vincent Cheng-Siong Lee	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services	10.1109/ICWS.2015.47	communications protocol;logic gate;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;distributed computing;computational model;encryption	DB	-40.44269393266859	69.21474670237225	134699

Such systems are employed by companies in order to satisfy their existing customers and attract new ones. However, many small or medium companies do not possess adequate customer data to generate satisfactory recommendations. To solve this problem, we propose that the companies should generate recommendations based on a joint set of customer data. For this purpose, we present a privacy-preserving collaborative filtering algorithm, which allows one company to generate recommendations based on its own customer data and the customer data from other companies. The security property is based on rigorous cryptographic techniques, and guarantees that no company will leak its customer data to others. In practice, such a guarantee not only protects companies' business incentives but also makes the operation compliant with privacy regulations. To obtain precise performance figures, we implement a prototype of the proposed solution in C++. The experimental results show that the proposed solution achieves significant accuracy difference in the generated recommendations.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;c++;collaborative filtering;computation;cryptography;database;differential privacy;privacy;prototype;recommender system;software deployment	Arjan Jeckmans;Qiang Tang;Pieter H.

299d71d31ab072a9d9403a6b7d59a4b795e35cbd	automated reasoning for equivalences in the applied pi calculus with barriers		Observational equivalence allows us to study important security properties such as anonymity. Unfortunately, the difficulty of proving observational equivalence hinders analysis. Blanchet, Abadi & Fournet simplify its proof by introducing a sufficient condition for observational equivalence, called diff-equivalence, which is a reachability condition that can be proved automatically by ProVerif. However, diff-equivalence is a very strong condition, which often does not hold even if observational equivalence does. In particular, when proving equivalence between processes that contain several parallel components, e.g., P | Q and P' | Q', diff-equivalence requires that P is equivalent to P' and Q is equivalent to Q'. To relax this constraint, Delaune, Ryan & Smyth introduced the idea of swapping data between parallel processes P' and Q' at synchronisation points, without proving its soundness. We extend their work by formalising the semantics of synchronisation, formalising the definition of swapping, and proving its soundness. We also relax some restrictions they had on the processes to which swapping can be applied. Moreover, we have implemented our results in ProVerif. Hence, we extend the class of equivalences that can be proved automatically. We showcase our results by analysing privacy in election schemes by Fujioka, Okamoto & Ohta and Lee et al., and in the vehicular ad-hoc network by Freudiger et al.	automated reasoning;compiler;diff utility;formal verification;forward secrecy;hoc (programming language);observational equivalence;paging;privacy;proverif;reachability;regular language description for xml;tom proulx;turing completeness;π-calculus	Bruno Blanchet;Ben Smyth	2016	2016 IEEE 29th Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF)	10.3233/JCS-171013	synchronization;formal methods;computer science;information security;theoretical computer science;semantics;computer security;algorithm	Security	-35.96332398661517	72.58077540752818	135083

While most cloud storage systems guarantees data retrievability of high level, they may be vulnerable to data privacy since the stored data may be exposed to others by accident or design. On the other hand, P2P storage system keeps any peer from accessing the whole data by dividing the data into small pieces and distributing them to multiple participating peers, but may degrade data retrievability due to unstable peers. The proposed hybrid storage system attempts to enhance data retrievability and privacy by effectively distributing fountain encoded symbols to cloud server system and participating peers. It is demonstrated that the proposed hybrid storage system achieves the desired level of data retrievability with a short upload time, and enhance privacy by preventing others from reading the contents.	algorithm;cloud storage;computer data storage;control theory;fountain code;high-level programming language;information privacy;peer-to-peer;retrievability;server (computing);simulation;upload;virtual private server	Gi Seok Park;Hwangjun Song	2016	Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications	10.1007/s12083-015-0337-z	database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	OS	-42.55084441018661	68.25006810261748	135163
c1d717f4bbe83305d05646d1998a7fd5d0b747ef	the utility cost of robust privacy guarantees		Consider a data publishing setting for a data set with public and private features. The objective of the publisher is to maximize the amount of information about the public features in a revealed data set, while keeping the information leaked about the private features bounded. The goal of this paper is to analyze the performance of privacy mechanisms that are constructed to match the distribution learned from the data set. Two distinct scenarios are considered: (i) mechanisms are designed to provide a privacy guarantee for the learned distribution; and (ii) mechanisms are designed to provide a privacy guarantee for every distribution in a given neighborhood of the learned distribution. For the first scenario, given any privacy mechanism, upper bounds on the difference between the privacy-utility guarantees for the learned and true distributions are presented. In the second scenario, upper bounds on the reduction in utility incurred by providing a uniform privacy guarantee are developed.	privacy;universal quantification	Hao Wang;Mario Diaz;Flávio du Pin Calmon;Lalitha Sankar	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2018.8437735	data publishing;mathematical optimization;computer science;bounded function;distributed computing	Theory	-38.56363014383176	63.65064247842407	135341

Existing schemes assume that the sender knows the identity of the receiver. In this paper we relax this assumption by proposing the first Attribute Based Searchable Encryption Scheme (ABSE). An ABSE is a type of public key encryption with keyword search that allows the user encrypting the data to specify a policy that determines, among the users of the system, who is eligible to decrypt and search the data. Each user of the system owns a set of attributes and the policy is a function of these attributes expressed as a predicate. Only members who own sufficient attributes to satisfy that policy can send the server a valid search query. In our work we introduce the concept of a secure ABSE by defining the functionalities and the relevant security notions such as correctness, chosen keyword attacks, and attribute forgeability attacks. Our definitions are based on provable security formalizations. We further propose a secure construction of an ABSE based on bilinear maps. We illustrate the use of our proposed scheme in a shared storage for medical records.	bilinear filtering;computer data storage;correctness (computer science);encryption;error guessing;predicate (mathematical logic);provable security;public-key cryptography;search algorithm;server (computing)	Dalia Khader	2014		10.1145/2663876.2663878	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;attribute-based encryption	Security	-41.3606240224725	70.05113934992303	135521

In order to achieve high-speed authentication in large-scale RFID systems, researchers propose tree-based approaches, in which any pair of tags share a number of key components. Such designs, being efficient, often fail to achieve forward secrecy and resistance to attacks, such as compromising and desynchronization. Indeed, these attacks may still take effect even after a tag successfully finishes the authentication and key-updating procedure. To address the issue, we propose a lightweight RFID private authentication protocol, RWP, based on the random walk concept. RWP also provides the forward security and temporal resistance to the tracking attack. The analysis results show that RWP effectively enhances the security protection for RFID private authentication, and increases the authentication efficiency from O(logN) to O(1).	authentication protocol;forward secrecy;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification	Qingsong Yao;Yong Qi;Jinsong Han;Jizhong Zhao;Xiang-Yang Li;Yunhao Liu	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications	10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912773	radio-frequency identification;forward secrecy;information privacy;computer science;information security;authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-46.48622829737595	73.81897802456464	135653

It uses some parameterized transforms to convert an original biometric template into a new version for authentication. The security of cancelable biometrics lies on noninvertibility of the transformed template, that is, the transforms should be noninvertible so that the original template can not be recovered. One way to achieve the noninvertibilty is through the use of many-to-one transforms. The idea of Ratha¿s scheme of generating fingerprint templates just depends on this. However, it is revealed in this paper that the form of the transforms and the parameters chosen in his implementation weaken the many-to-one property. This results in the possible recovery of original minutiae from one transformed template.	authentication;biometrics;brute-force attack;fingerprint;minutiae;one-to-many (data model);password cracking	Quan Feng;Fei Su;Anni Cai;Feifei Zhao	2008	2008 International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology	10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.226	data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-37.802262222188745	69.81548202701975	135735
26c973e52934bb7af0fc219e428bfee6257036c9	a study on remote data integrity checking techniques in cloud		Remote Data Integrity Checking (RDIC) is crucial for implementing secure cloud storage. It enables the users to check the integrity of the outsourced data without downloading the entire data. As a solution to this, some RDIC protocols have been proposed by many researchers. Most of the existing RDIC protocols are designed based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and ID-Based Cryptography (IBC). However, each protocol has its own advantages and disadvantages. This paper presents a detailed study on RDIC protocols in a cloud environment and discusses the taxonomy of RDIC protocols such as Provable Data Possession (PDP), Proof of Retrievability (POR), Proof of Ownership (POW) and ID-based RDIC protocols. We also analysze and compares the existing RDIC approaches based on the parameters such as integrity checking method, cryptographic model, auditing mode and data recovery. Finally, it throws light on the open issues such as research directions in designing RDIC protocol.	cloud storage;data integrity;data recovery;download;id-based cryptography;information-based complexity;outsourcing;provable security;public key infrastructure;retrievability	C.

They are becoming increasingly popular models as part of prediction systems in finance, marketing, bio-informatics, speech recognition, signal processing, and so on. However, traditional HMMs do not allow people and model owners to generate predictions without disclosing their private information to each other. To address the increasing needs for privacy, this work identifies and studies the private prediction problem; it is demonstrated with the following scenario: Bob has a private HMM, while Alice has a private input; and she wants to use Bob’s model to make a prediction based on her input. However, Alice does not want to disclose her private input to Bob, while Bob wants to prevent Alice from deriving information about his model. How can Alice and Bob perform HMMs-based predictions without violating their privacy? We propose privacy-preserving protocols to produce predictions on HMMs without greatly exposing Bob’s and Alice’s privacy. We then analyze our schemes in terms of accuracy, privacy, and performance. Since they are conflicting goals, due to privacy concerns, it is expected that accuracy or performance might degrade. However, our schemes make it possible for Bob and Alice to produce the same predictions efficiently while preserving their privacy.	alice and bob;artificial neural network;bayesian network;bioinformatics;british informatics olympiad;commodity computing;decision tree;hidden markov model;markov chain;online and offline;overhead (computing);personally identifiable information;privacy;requirement;server (computing);signal processing;speech recognition	Huseyin Polat;Wenliang Du;Sahin Renckes;Yusuf Oysal	2010	Artificial Intelligence Review	10.1007/s10462-010-9161-2	speech recognition;private information retrieval;prediction;performance;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;privacy;hidden markov model	Security	-37.39816037239448	65.1659806635481	135946
1050eba18b220b35f99e1c419ac588d725f89071	a high-throughput method to detect privacy-sensitive human genomic data	measurement;design;security	Finding the balance between privacy protection and data sharing is one of the main challenges in managing human genomic data nowadays. Novel privacy-enhancing technologies are required to address the known disclosure threats to personal sensitive genomic data without precluding data sharing. In this paper, we propose a method that systematically detects privacy-sensitive DNA segments coming directly from an input stream, using as reference a knowledge database of known privacy-sensitive nucleic and amino acid sequences. We show that adding our detection method to standard security techniques provides a robust, efficient privacy-preserving solution that neutralizes threats related to recently published attacks on genome privacy based on short tandem repeats, disease-related genes, and genomic variations. Current global knowledge on human genomes demonstrates the feasibility of our approach to obtain a comprehensive database immediately, which can also evolve automatically to address future attacks as new privacy-sensitive sequences are identified. Additionally, we validate that the detection method can be fitted inline with the NGS---Next Generation Sequencing---production cycle by using Bloom filters and scaling out to faster sequencing machines.	bloom filter;communications satellite;image scaling;privacy;privacy-enhancing technologies;stream (computing);throughput	Vinicius V.

Even though such vast amount of information presents great opportunities for knowledge discovery, organizations might not want to share their data due to legal or competitive reasons. This posts the challenge of mining knowledge while preserving privacy. Current efficient privacy-preserving data mining algorithms are based on an assumption that it is acceptable to release all the intermediate results during the data mining operations. However, it has been shown that such intermediate results can still leak private information. In this work, we use differential privacy to quantitatively limit such information leak. Differential privacy is a newly emerged privacy definition that is capable of providing strong measurable privacy guarantees. We propose Secure group Differential private Query(SDQ), a new algorithm that combines techniques from differential privacy and secure multiparty computation. Using decision tree induction as a case study, we show that SDQ can achieve stronger privacy than current efficient secure multiparty computation approach, and better accuracy than current differential privacy approach while maintaining efficiency.	algorithm;data storage technology;data mining;database;decision tree;differential privacy;experiment;internet;personally identifiable information;secure multi-party computation	Ning Zhang;Ming Li;Wenjing Lou	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962863	privacy software;computer science;decision tree;data mining;database;internet privacy;distributed database;computer network	DB	-40.03529347008232	64.57005253683676	136542

6b26885a6da6bea58a6092efe2daca70de612699	an extended identity based authenticated asymmetric group key agreement protocol		Lei et al. [26] proposed a new asymmetric group key agreement protocol allowing a set of users to negotiate a common encryption key accessible by any user, and each user holds her respective decryption key. This enables the confidential message communication among group users, and grants any outsider to send message to the group. In this paper, an authenticated asymmetric group key agreement protocol is proposed, which offers security against active as well as passive attacks. Proposed protocol uses broadcast encryption mechanism without relying on the trusted dealer to distribute the secret key. An identity based feature is included in the protocol to provide authentication.	authentication;bilinear transform;broadcast encryption;ciphertext;computation;confidentiality;cryptography;group key;key generation;key-agreement protocol;plaintext	Reddi Siva Ranjani;Dhavala Lalitha Bhaskari;Peri S.

In any PKI system, the authentication of a received message is performed by checking if the certificate of the sender is included in the current CRL, and verifying the authenticity of the certificate and signature of the sender. In this paper, we propose an Expedite Message Authentication Protocol (EMAP) for VANETs, which replaces the time-consuming CRL checking process by an efficient revocation checking process. The revocation check process in EMAP uses a keyed Hash Message Authentication Code ({HMAC}), where the key used in calculating the {HMAC} is shared only between nonrevoked On-Board Units (OBUs). In addition, EMAP uses a novel probabilistic key distribution, which enables nonrevoked OBUs to securely share and update a secret key. EMAP can significantly decrease the message loss ratio due to the message verification delay compared with the conventional authentication methods employing CRL. By conducting security analysis and performance evaluation, EMAP is demonstrated to be secure and efficient.	authentication protocol;certificate authority;hash-based message authentication code;hoc (programming language);key (cryptography);key distribution;performance evaluation;public key infrastructure	Albert Wasef;Xuemin Shen	2013	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2011.246	vehicular ad hoc network;message authentication code;wireless ad hoc network;computer science;revocation list;communications security;authentication;cryptographic protocol;internet privacy;mobile computing;privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-47.69876268101103	74.07641774002317	137251

The variety of biometric traits, capturing devices, targeted populations and working scenarios makes the development of a universal solution for all-purpose deployment quite a difficult task. This paper describes the design, implementation and applicability of an open framework for distributed biometric authentication oriented to access-control in web environment. The open principle makes this framework a novel and practical development tool for testing and integrating biometric algorithms and devices from third parties. Special attention has been paid to security and interoperability standards to ease concurrent integration and testing of biometric trait matchers developed by different laboratories or companies.

fe23a904484e4d116f46d8fc4c2836d766c70030	low-cost mitigation against cold boot attacks for an authentication token		Hardware tokens for user authentication need a secure and usable mechanism to lock them when not in use. The Pico academic project proposes an authentication token unlocked by the proximity of simpler wearable devices that provide shares of the token’s master key. This method, however, is vulnerable to a cold boot attack: an adversary who captures a running Pico could extract the master key from its RAM and steal all of the user’s credentials. We present a cryptographic countermeasure—bivariate secret sharing—that protects all the credentials except the one in use at that time, even if the token is captured while it is on. Remarkably, our key storage costs for the wearables that supply the cryptographic shares are very modest (256 bits) and remain constant even if the token holds thousands of credentials. Although bivariate secret sharing has been used before in slightly different ways, our scheme is leaner and more efficient and achieves a new property—cold boot protection. We validated the efficacy of our design by implementing it on a commercial Bluetooth Low Energy development board and measuring its latency and energy consumption. For reasonable choices of latency and security parameters, a standard CR2032 button-cell battery can power our prototype for 5–7 months, and we demonstrate a simple enhancement that could make the same battery last for over 9 months.	8-bit;adversary (cryptography);authentication;authorization;bivariate data;bluetooth;booting;cold boot attack;coprocessor;credential;cryptography;dangling pointer;database schema;debugger;electronic component;encryption;fido alliance;flash memory;general-purpose markup language;hal;hardware abstraction;hash function;iar systems;identifier;intel mcs-51;jones calculus;library (computing);low-power broadcasting;microprocessor development board;no silver bullet;operating system abstraction layer;password;peripheral;pico;polynomial;protocol stack;prototype;purchasing;radio frequency;random-access memory;reboot (computing);sim lock;secret sharing;security token;sensor;system on a chip;tamper resistance;toolchain;watchdog timer;wearable computer;wearable technology;workbench	Ian Goldberg;Graeme Jenkinson;Frank Stajano	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39555-5_3	telecommunications;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-33.69869139478159	67.94286797423814	137534

f738e4a1ada6421948e7499bc3836cad692f7ecb	a new approach for private searches on public-key encrypted data	threshold searchable encryption;public key encryption with keyword search;blind identity based encryption	Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) allows authorized users to search by keywords on encrypted data by generating trapdoors for the desired keywords. Basically there are two requirements for the process of trapdoors generation. On one hand, it is important to allow users to privately search on encrypted data without revealing keywords to the Trapdoor Generation Entity T GE , and solutions proposed are based on the use of blinding protocols between user and T GE . On the other hand, in some applications it is necessary to prevent T GE from generating trapdoors on behalf of a legitimate user, this is done by splitting the T GE and generating trapdoors in distributed manner. Until now, these two requirements in PEKS were considered separately and many solutions were proposed dealing with each one. However, no solution is known to satisfy the two requirements at the same time. In this paper we present a new approach to deal with this issue. First, we extend the notion of anonymous Identity-Based Encryption with distributed Private Key Generator to handle the blind key-extraction protocols as in Blind IBE. We call such new schemes blind anonymous (n, t)IBE, and we give concrete construction of such schemes. Second, we generically transform the blind anonymous (n, t)-IBE into a threshold PEKS with oblivious keyword search satisfying the requirements specified above.	authorization;blind signature;blinding (cryptography);computer security model;id-based encryption;key generator;public-key cryptography;requirement;search algorithm;systems architecture;uc browser	Amar Siad	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32805-3_13	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-41.76865866809325	73.20696552336757	137732

Although AES algorithm is chosen as the subject algorithm in the case study, the method is generic in the sense that it can be applied in many other algorithms that are subject to side-channel attacks. The adopted approach bases its analysis method on intermediate values used during the cryptographic computation observed via side-channels and explores the extent, to which the observations can be exploited in a successful attack. The method allows us to accurately estimate the feasibility of an attack strategy and compare efficiency of different attacks. Ultimate goal is to explore every attack possibility and estimate its corresponding feasibility to determine the optimal level of appropriate countermeasures. Using the method, we analyze four different cache-based attacks on AES and determine the complexity, feasibility, and strength of each attack. Our analysis demonstrates that second round-only attack on AES is feasible when the first and the last rounds are already protected.	algorithm;cpu cache;computation;computational complexity theory;countermeasure (computer);cryptography;generic-case complexity;information theory;side-channel attack;vii	Erkay Savas;Cemal Yilmaz	2012	2012 5th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)	10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208720	entropy;pre-play attack;computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;side channel attack;computer security;encryption;algorithm	Crypto	-34.3021095005246	73.90018493927388	137824

Moreover, by putting this data on the Cloud and providing the functionality of the DNN to other organizations, they can obtain new knowledge and can subsequently create new services. However, because such DNNs are generated from sensitive attribute values, we cannot share them freely without the explicit consent of the persons whose data are used for the DNNs. On the other hand, in recent years, e-differential privacy has emerged as the de facto privacy metric. Many researchers use e-differential privacy for privacy-preserving data mining such as correlation analysis and association rule analysis. In this paper, we modify e-differential privacy for machine learning, and we propose three approaches for creating privacy-preserved DNNs based on the modified e-differential privacy. Our proposed approaches are experimentally evaluated using a real data set, and we show that our approaches can protect personal attribute values while maintaining the accuracy of the DNNs.	artificial neural network;association rule learning;cloud computing;data mining;deep learning;differential privacy;experiment;machine learning;neural networks;personally identifiable information	Yuichi Sei;Hiroshi Okumura;Akihiko Ohsuga	2016	2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)	10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0202	privacy software;information privacy;computer science;data mining;histogram;distributed computing;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;artificial neural network;measurement;computer network	DB	-40.92870939435999	63.76134326356194	137840

The major advantage of this approach is the positive relationship for the level of privacy security and analysis precision.

In the symbolic model, an attacker cannot guess a secret at all and can only apply a pre-defined set of operations, whereas in the computational model, he can hope to guess secrets and apply any polynomial-time operation. Security properties in the computational model are more difficult to establish and to check. In this paper we present a framework for certified proofs of computational indistinguishability, written using the Coq proof assistant, and based on CIL, a specialized logic for computational frames that can be applied to primitives and protocols. We demonstrate how CIL and its Coq-formalization allow proofs beyond the black-box security framework, where an attacker only uses the input/output relation of the system by executing on chosen inputs without having additional information on the state. More specifically, we use it to prove the security of a protocol against a particular kind of side-channel attack which aims at modeling leakage of information caused by an intrusion into Alice and Bob’s computers.	alice and bob;black box;common intermediate language;computation;computational indistinguishability;computational model;computer;coq (software);cryptography;input/output;polynomial;proof assistant;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;time complexity	Pierre Corbineau;Mathilde Duclos;Yassine Lakhnech	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25379-9_27	computer security model;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computational hardness assumption;computer security	Security	-36.846639027497375	74.01369544079367	137950

Legislative acts require service providers to protect the privacy of customers. Privacy policy frameworks, such as P3P, assist the service providers by describing their privacy policies to customers (e.g. publishing privacy policy on websites). Unfortunately, providing the policies alone does not guarantee that they are actually enforced. Furthermore, a privacy-preserving model should consider the privacy preferences of both the data provider and collector. This paper discusses the challenges in development of capturing privacy predicates in a lattice structures. A use case study is presented to show the applicability of the lattice approach to a specific domain. We also present a comprehensive study on applying a lattice-based approach to P3P. We show capturing privacy elements of P3P in a lattice format facilitates managing and enforcing policies presented in P3P and accommodates the customization of privacy practices and preferences of data and service providers. We also propose that the outcome of this approach can be used on lattice-based privacy aware access control models [8].	access control;adobe flash player;information privacy;lattice model (finance);lattice-based cryptography;p3p;privacy policy	Kambiz Ghazinour;Ken Barker	2011		10.1145/1971690.1971694	privacy software;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-42.59897376211652	61.720800496433405	137982

a8501e0014b6a20ecfc66f8e759d9ef43ebd18a9	"""33 bits of entropy: myths and fallacies of """"personally identifiable information"""""""		Data is the currency of the digital economy, but increasing data collection by companies and sharing with third parties threatens privacy. “Anonymization” is the usual answer to privacy concerns, typically implemented via removal of “personally identifiable information.” Sweeney’s work on reidentification of Massachusetts hospital records showed that naive deidentification via PII removal can be reversed [3]. That led to a cat-and-mouse game between deidentification and reidentification, with standards such as HIPAA mandating removal of a more comprehensive set of attributes. In parallel, techniques for data transformations that enable specific categories of computations in a mathematically rigorous privacy-preserving way were developed — “differential privacy” enables sidestepping the need for anonymization altogether [1]. However, the anonymization paradigm is extremely popular due to its convenience and because it avoids the need to circumscribe allowed computations in advance. Several theoretical and practical questions remained open. Given the increasingly easy availability of public “auxiliary information” about individuals (e.g., from social media), is it possible to provide any technical privacy guarantees via anonymization, while maintaining data utility? How identifiable are people’s footprints in the rich “longitudinal” databases that are common today? Can we characterize which types of data can lead to reidentification, thus salvaging the notion of “Personally Identifiable Information?” Finally, how many bits of uncorrelated information (“entropy”) are required to reidentify individuals in large datasets? This paper references the recent work, Myths and Fallacies of “Personally Identifiable Information” [2]. BODY Anonymization of rich consumer data is infeasible—people are unique, and any piece of data can help reidentify. 33 bits of entropy will do.	computation;data anonymization;database;de-identification;differential privacy;entropy (information theory);health insurance portability and accountability act;personally identifiable information;programming paradigm;social media	Arvind Narayanan	2012	TinyToCS		political science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	ML	-41.84008169626143	62.94150916727733	138184

205c004316ad011f0a503d2e263691985a40816a	practical backward-secure searchable encryption from symmetric puncturable encryption		Symmetric Searchable Encryption (SSE) has received wide attention due to its practical application in searching on encrypted data. Beyond search, data addition and deletion are also supported in dynamic SSE schemes. Unfortunately, these update operations leak some information of updated data. To address this issue, forward-secure SSE is actively explored to protect the relations of newly updated data and previously searched keywords. On the contrary, little work has been done in backward security, which enforces that search should not reveal information of deleted data. In this paper, we propose the first practical and non-interactive backward-secure SSE scheme. In particular, we introduce a new form of symmetric encryption, named symmetric puncturable encryption (SPE), and construct a generic primitive from simple cryptographic tools. Based on this primitive, we then present a backward-secure SSE scheme that can revoke a server's searching ability on deleted data. We instantiate our scheme with a practical puncturable pseudorandom function and implement it on a large dataset. The experimental results demonstrate its efficiency and scalability. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our scheme achieves a speedup of almost 50x in search latency, and a saving of 62% in server storage consumption.	cryptographic primitive;cryptography;encryption;interactivity;memory leak;pseudorandom function family;pseudorandomness;random oracle;scalability;server (computing);speedup;symmetric-key algorithm	Shifeng Sun;Xingliang Yuan;Joseph K.

However, the existing proposals mostly focus on participators' location privacy, and few are done on participators' trajectory privacy. The effective analysis on trajectories that contain spatial-temporal history information will reveal participators' whereabouts and the relevant personal privacy. In this paper, we propose a trajectory privacy-preserving framework, named TrPF, for participatory sensing. Based on the framework, we improve the theoretical mix-zones model with considering the time factor from the perspective of graph theory. Finally, we analyze the threat models with different background knowledge and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal on the basis of information entropy, and then compare the performance of our proposal with previous trajectory privacy protections. The analysis and simulation results prove that our proposal can protect participators' trajectories privacy effectively with lower information loss and costs than what is afforded by the other proposals.	digital history;embedded system;emergence;entropy (information theory);graph theory;microphone;mobile device;participatory sensing;privacy;sensor;simulation;threat model	Sheng Gao;Jianfeng Ma;Weisong Shi;Guoxing Zhan;Cong Sun	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2013.2252618	entropy;computer science;sensor;graph theory;trajectory;operating system;data mining;mobile device;internet privacy;mobile computing;privacy;computer security;server;entropy	Mobile	-39.68855134745266	60.51326058370244	138383
ebf3a526581f59398106c20c73ba7b711ba795d9	enhanced security for cloud storage using file encryption		Cloud computing is a term coined to a network that offers incredible processing power, a wide array of storage space and unbelievable speed of computation. Social media channels, corporate structures and individual consumers are all switching to the magnificent world of cloud computing. The flip side to this coin is that with cloud storage emerges the security issues of confidentiality, data integrity and data availability. Since the “cloud” is a mere collection of tangible super computers spread across the world, authentication and authorization for data access is more than a necessity. Our work attempts to overcome these security threats. The proposed methodology suggests the encryption of the files to be uploaded on the cloud. The integrity and confidentiality of the data uploaded by the user is ensured doubly by not only encrypting it but also providing access to the data only on successful authentication.

This is a realistic privacy concern which continues to exist because data holders do not collaborate prior to making disclosures. In this paper, we present STRANON, a novel computational protocol that enables data holders to work together to determine records that can be disclosed and satisfy a formal privacy protection model. STRANON incorporates a secure encrypted environment, so no data holder reveals information until the trails of disclosed records are provably unlinkable. We evaluate STRANON on real-world datasets with known susceptibilities and demonstrate data holders can release significant quantities of data with zero trail re-identifiability.	arabic numeral 0;computation;disclosure;disease susceptibility;encryption;holder device component;internet privacy;name;patients;quantity	Bradley A Malin;Latanya Sweeney	2005	AMIA ...

We identify some new attacks on these protocols, showing in particular that these protocols are not computationally fair. Specifically, with our attacks, an adversary can do the following damages: • It can compute the session-key output with much lesser computational complexity than that of the victim honest player, and can maliciously nullify the contributions from the victim honest players. • It can set the session-key output to be some pre-determined value, which can be efficiently and publicly computed without knowing any secrecy supposed to be held by the attacker. We remark these attacks are beyond the traditional security models for group key-exchange and identity-based key-exchange. Then, based on the computationally fair Diffie-Hellman keyexchange in [21], we present some fixing approaches, and prove that the fixed protocols are computationally fair.	adversary (cryptography);blu-ray;computational complexity theory;diffie–hellman key exchange;entity–relationship model;group key;mike lesser;session key	Andrew Chi-Chih Yao;Yunlei Zhao	2012	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-29952-0_26	mathematics;distributed computing;computer security	Crypto	-40.67399441059006	74.04538055280841	138613

With increasing sophistication of cyber attackers and advancement of cryptanalysis techniques, encryption alone is not sufficient to ensure data security. A more adaptive and flexible approach to data security is thus required. In this paper, we introduce a secure distributed file system which can be layered transparently on existing public cloud storage infrastructure. Our approach combines secret sharing and information dispersal algorithm with more flexible authentication and access control security measures to provide secure storage for enterprise data in the cloud. Our proposed architecture supports a clear separation of roles of storage owner and information owner.	access control;algorithm;authentication;cloud computing;cloud storage;clustered file system;cryptanalysis;cyber spying;data security;encryption;secret sharing	Kheng Kok Mar;ZhengQing Hu;Chee Yong Law;Meifen Wang	2016	2016 11th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST)	10.1109/ICITST.2016.7856692	cloud computing security;cloud computing;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-42.37288215816506	66.77802494150492	138658
b9ca2ba3d0aa2febfb90a550963c71576309177f	protecting document outside enterprise network: a confirmed framework		Sharing e-documents are important components of any enterprise workflow. Keeping these e-documents secure is fundamental to enterprise security, especially in multi-site enterprises or when sharing e-documents with third party. For that purpose, enterprises use document management software. However, document leakage is the most challenging security issue. These leaks are mainly caused by internal attack wither intentional or due to accident and employee ignorance. After exploring the landscape of the current e-document sharing security issues, this chapter proposes a framework to address these issues. The proposed framework is adapting current technologies in new novel approach to deliver a secure environment to share e-documents and track them. The confirmed framework secures documents not only inside the enterprise, but also when they leave the enterprise boundaries via networks or portable devices. As the author’s knowledge extends, there is no other work similar to what this paper provide regarding proposing such a framework. The framework provides a persistent and secure environment through the e-document life cycle and ability to track the document. The framework components design is based on analysing the literature of the current issues and available solutions. These components were confirmed after surveying security professionals and interviewing fourteen security experts. The framework includes components utilising active document concept, digital right management concept, context awareness, and a central certification authority service.	certificate authority;context awareness;digital rights management;email;mobile device;personal digital assistant;secure environment;spectral leakage;triangulation (geometry)	Zeyad S.

The formal verification of these functions therefore becomes a prerequisite to firmly assess any security property. We propose an approach for the construction of a library of formally verified low-level arithmetic functions that can be used to implement realistic cryptographic schemes in a trustful way. For that purpose, we introduce a formalization of data structures for signed multi-precision arithmetic and we experiment it with formal verification of basic functions, using Separation logic. Because this direct style of formal verification leads to technically involved specifications, we also propose for larger functions to show a formal simulation relation between pseudo-code and assembly. This is illustrated with the binary extended gcd algorithm.	arbitrary-precision arithmetic;cryptography;data structure;direct style;extended euclidean algorithm;formal verification;high- and low-level;information security;pseudocode;separation logic;simulation	Reynald Affeldt	2012	Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering	10.1007/s11334-013-0195-x	separation logic;arbitrary-precision arithmetic;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;hoare logic;proof assistant;programming language;primitive recursive arithmetic;algorithm;assembly language	Logic	-35.35363725808999	74.21819535598122	139417

This recurrent advice from the public broadcasting attests that security breaches can happen and no identity management system can provide full-proof security. The challenge is even greater in service-oriented architectures where each user has their identities scattered across many services and has no control over management of those identities. Recent research in the area of the user-centric identity management makes user control and consent the key concept for identity management, but there is no consensus on the level of user-centricity. This paper proposes a service-oriented architecture framework called personal identity management that truly puts users in control over the management of their identities. The advantages of this proposal can be demonstrated through a comparison analysis of relevant identity management systems against a set of criteria required for today's identity management.	architecture framework;identity management system;privacy;service-oriented architecture;user interface	Ty Mey Eap;Marek Hatala;Dragan Gasevic	2007	IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2007)	10.1109/SCC.2007.56	business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;identity management	DB	-46.50235283504893	60.80871050874596	139739

Mobile IPv6 is using Mobile IP with Route Optimization to improve performance by avoiding the triangle routing and adopting Return Routability as a secure process for binding update. Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is an experimental security protocol which provides mobility management and multi-homing by its new namespace. Its architecture is similar to that of Mobile IP with Route Optimization. In this paper, we have introduced a Secure Mobile IP with HIP Style Handshaking and Readdressing (SMIP), which has stronger security, better performance and lower binding cost in binding update process compared with Mobile IPv6. The dependence of home agent in the new scheme is also shown dramatically decreased. The initiated scheme integrated the primary features of two completely different mobility management solutions and has set up a migration path from mobile-IP based solution to a public-key based solution in mobile IP networks.	cryptographic protocol;handshaking;host identity protocol;interconnection;internet protocol suite;missile guidance;mobile ip;multihoming;public-key cryptography;triangular routing	Yick Hon Joseph So;Junjie Wang;Deddy Chandra	2006	African J. of Inf. & Commun.

Main obstacle for wide adoption of this technology is the concerns about its security and privacy issues. Many RFID authentication protocols have been proposed to provide desired security and privacy level for RFID systems. Recently, Benssalah et al. have proposed a chaotic map-based RFID security protocol. In this paper, we analyze the security of this protocol and discover its vulnerabilities. We show that message generation arises some weaknesses, and this protocol is vulnerable to tracking, tag impersonation, and de-synchronization attacks. The success probabilities of the proposed attacks are significant, and their complexities are polynomial. Furthermore, we propose an RFID authentication protocol. Our protocol utilizes the Chebyshev chaotic map hard problem and conforms to the EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 EPC C1-G2 standard. Our protocol eliminates the weaknesses of the protocol of Benssalah et al. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.		Mete Akgün;Ali Osman Bayrak;M.

However, there is an inherent conflict between trust and privacy: the more knowledge a first entity knows about a second entity, the more accurate should be the trustworthiness assessment; the more knowledge is known about this second entity, the less privacy is left to this entity. This conflict needs to be addressed because both trust and privacy are essential elements for a smart working world. The solution should allow the benefit of adjunct trust when entities interact without too much privacy loss. We propose to achieve the right trade-off between trust and privacy by ensuring minimal trade of privacy for the required trust. We demonstrate how transactions made under different pseudonyms can be linked and careful disclosure of such links fulfils this right trade-off.	entity;privacy;pseudonymity;trust (emotion)	Jean-Marc Seigneur;Christian Damsgaard Jensen	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24747-0_8	privacy software;confidentiality;transaction processing;information privacy;express trust;privacy by design;trade-off;computer science;artificial intelligence;technical report;database;mediation;confidence;computer security	Security	-35.43889138359904	67.59363383176174	140325

In this paper we propose a framework based on the Trusted Computing (TC) techniques to improve the efficiency of private key issue in identity-based cryptosystem. We take the trusted platform module (TPM) as a local trusted authority for key extraction. The model, scheme and a survey on how to implement popular identity-based key issue on TPM are given. The security and performance analysis are provided, together with implementation issues for several popular identity-based cryptographic schemes.	authentication;cryptosystem;programming paradigm;public-key cryptography;secure channel;trusted computing;trusted platform module	Zhi Guan;Huiping Sun;Zhong Chen;Xianghao Nan	2008	2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists	10.1109/ICYCS.2008.523	direct anonymous attestation;computer science;information security;cryptosystem;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;world wide web;computer security	Security	-43.748658053116124	74.26094448756024	140358

However, dealing with algebraic properties of operators such as the exclusive OR (XOR) and Diffie-Hellman exponentiation has been problematic. Recently, we have developed an approach which enables ProVerif, and related tools, to analyze a large class of protocols that employ the XOR operator. In this work, we adapt this approach to the case of Diffie-Hellman exponentiation. The core of our approach is to reduce the derivation problem for Horn theories modulo algebraic properties of Diffie-Hellman exponentiation to a purely syntactical derivation problem for Horn theories. The latter problem can then be solved by tools such as ProVerif. Our reduction works for a large class of Horn theories, allowing to model a wide range of intruder capabilities and protocols. We implemented our reduction and, in combination with ProVerif, applied it in the automatic analysis of several state-of-the-art protocols that use Diffie-Hellman exponentiation. While the general idea of our approach follows the one for XOR in our previous work, the reduction itself and the proof of soundness and completeness of our reduction are entirely different from the XOR case. Surprisingly, the reduction for Diffie-Hellman exponentiation is more efficient than the one for XOR.	authentication;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman key exchange;exclusive or;linear algebra;modulo operation;observational equivalence;proverif;process calculus;theory;turing completeness	Ralf Küsters;Tomasz Truderung	2009	2009 22nd IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium	10.1109/CSF.2009.17	exclusive or;process calculus;horn clause;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematical model;cryptographic protocol;public-key cryptography;programming language;algorithm	Security	-36.01183127323084	73.2205481073086	140654

Rule-based cyber security is proposed for Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) outstation devices, with a focus on smart distribution system devices. The security utilizes the DNP3 application layer function codes and data objects to determine data access authorization for outstations, augmenting other security solutions that include firewalls, encryption, and authentication. The cyber security proposed in this article protects outstation devices when masters are compromised or attempt unauthorized access that bypass the other security solutions. In this article, non-utility stakeholder data access is limited through DNP3 data sets rather than granting direct access to the data points within an outstation. The data set utilization greatly constrains possible attack methods against a device by reducing the interaction capabilities with an outstation. The data sets also decrease the security complexity through rule reduction, thereby increasing the security applicability for retrofitted or process constrained devices. Temporal security constraints are supported for the data sets, increasing security against denial of service attacks. a 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Domain Name Service (DNS) protocol is modified to provide the encrypted location information to all clients and a Key Server is introduced to provide the decryption Key only to the legitimate clients thereby ostracizing unscrupulous clients.

We make use of a trusted third party(TTP) but in an optimistic sense[1][2], i.e., the TTP takes part in the protocol only if one bidder cheats or simply crashes. Previous schemes[3][4] require the bidder's help during opening procedures. On the other hand, our protocol is quite eÆcient since a bidder takes part only at the beginning. More importantly, our scheme is robust against cheating bidders; i.e. any deviation of bidders cannot prevent the auctioneer from determining the auction. A strati ed distributed encryption-key chaining mechanism and a veri able encryption protocol are employed as building blocks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the rst construction of a universally veri able bid-privacy preserving sealed-bid auction protocol with an o -line TTP.	cryptographic protocol;encryption;online and offline;opening (morphology);strati (automobile);trusted third party	Yuji Watanabe;Hideki Imai	2000		10.1145/352600.352612	anonymity;computer science;pseudonymity;internet privacy;secret sharing;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-42.69911058619711	72.23723579344481	140864

The senders using an IBE do not need to look up the public keys and the corresponding certificates of the receivers, the identities (e.g. emails or IP addresses) of the latter are sufficient to encrypt. Any setting, PKI- or identity-based, must provide a means to revoke users from the system. Efficient revocation is a well-studied problem in the traditional PKI setting. However in the setting of IBE, there has been little work on studying the revocation mechanisms. The most practical solution requires the senders to also use time periods when encrypting, and all the receivers (regardless of whether their keys have been compromised or not) to update their private keys regularly by contacting the trusted authority. We note that this solution does not scale well -- as the number of users increases, the work on key updates becomes a bottleneck. We propose an IBE scheme that significantly improves key-update efficiency on the side of the trusted party (from linear to logarithmic in the number of users), while staying efficient for the users. Our scheme builds on the ideas of the Fuzzy IBE primitive and binary tree data structure, and is provably secure.	attribute-based encryption;binary tree;bottleneck (engineering);data structure;email;id-based cryptography;id-based encryption;provable security;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;scalability;tree (data structure)	Alexandra Boldyreva;Vipul Goyal;Virendra Kumar	2008		10.1145/1455770.1455823	data structure;binary tree;computer science;public key infrastructure;provable security;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;world wide web;computer security;keyfile	Security	-39.61540531850188	74.2727504717309	140907

68a30f73c52f0fde790aa7487a7a72a9a425933f	social insecurity: the unintended consequences of identity fraud prevention policies		Designed as identifiers of accounts tracking US residents' earnings, Social Security numbers (SSNs) have become over time sensitive authenticators for private sector services. Since their abuse is a major vector of identity theft, numerous initiatives have attempted to reduce their public availability. However, recent research has shown that unavailable SSNs may still be accurately predicted from publicly available data. Such predictability may undermine the effectiveness of current strategies aimed at curtailing identity theft. This manuscript examines the policy initiatives that made SSNs predictable, the extent to which their predictability heightens the risks of identity theft for US residents, and the effectiveness of current identity theft prevention strategies in light of said predictability. We find that, surprisingly, a number of past policy initiatives designed to combat identity fraud actually created the conditions for the predictability of SSNs. We also find that current policies aimed at enhancing privacy and security of SSNs, while well-meaning, may too prove countereffective. Our results support alternative identity management solutions, such as banning the usage of SSNs for authentication and replacing them with credential systems based on usable cryptographic protocols.	authentication;blind signature;credential;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;holism;identifier;identity management;information privacy;personally identifiable information;semiconductor industry;social security;static single assignment form;terminate (software);unintended consequences	Alessandro Acquisti;Ralph Gross	2009			unintended consequences;identity fraud;business;public relations	Security	-46.70365170000156	62.02099652285153	141304
80885aba8ece12b094878e03087a60071ba1f9b7	deanonymizing mobility traces with co-location information		Mobility traces have been widely used in the design and evaluation of mobile networks. To mitigate the privacy threat of publishing mobility traces, the traces are often anonymized and obfuscated. However, even with anonymization and obfuscation techniques, traces can still be deanonymized by exploiting some side information such as usersu0027 co-location. With online social networks, mobile users increasingly report their co-locations with other users. For example, a user may report being with friends at a restaurant for lunch or dinner, and hence his friendsu0027 location information can be inferred. To find out whether co-location information can be exploited to identify a user and reveal his behavior from a set of mobility traces, we use a dataset from Twitter and Swarm to illustrate how an adversary can gather side information consisting of usersu0027 location and co-location. Based on the collected information, the adversary can run a simple yet effective location inference attack. We generalize this attack, formulate the identity inference problem, and develop inference attacks, under different observed side information, that deem effective in identifying the users. We perform comprehensive experimental analysis based on real datasets for taxi cabs and buses. The evaluation results show that co-location information can be used to significantly improve the accuracy of the identity inference attack.	adversary (cryptography);data anonymization;elsevier biobase;inference attack;location inference;social network;swarm;tracing (software)	Youssef Khazbak;Guohong Cao	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)	10.1109/CNS.2017.8228621	computer science;telecommunications network;computer security;obfuscation;adversary;social network;inference;publishing;inference attack;mobile computing;distributed computing	Security	-38.94053589542382	60.67601390895964	141329
11508e3e07480252dfd72ae8638af722facf8d93	(t, n) multi-secret sharing scheme based on bivariate polynomial		In a (t, n) secret sharing scheme (SS), a dealer divides the secret into n shares in such way that any t or more than t shares can reconstruct the secret but fewer than t shares cannot reconstruct the secret. The multi-SS is an extension of the (t, n) SS in which shares can be reused to reconstruct multiple secrets. Thus, the efficiency of the multi-SS is better than the efficiency of the (t, n) SS. In this paper, we propose the first multi-SS using a bivariate polynomial. Our design is unique in comparing with all existing multi-SSs. Shares generated using a bivariate polynomial can not only be used to reconstruct multiple secrets but also be used to establish pairwise keys between any pair of shareholders. The pairwise keys can protect exchange information in the secret reconstruction to prevent outsiders from obtaining the recovered secrets. All existing multi-SSs require additional key establishment to accomplish this.	correctness (computer science);key exchange;polynomial;secret sharing	Lein Harn;Ching-Fang Hsu	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3862-z	theoretical computer science;data mining;mathematics;proactive secret sharing;secret sharing;verifiable secret sharing;algorithm	Crypto	-40.17540206297205	73.3177174312016	141356

In LBSs, users can conveniently obtain their interested information by sending queries to the LBS server. However, users' queries include their identities, locations, interests, etc, which may result in the leakage of users' trajectory and other sensitive information. Although the existing obfuscation and location anonymization techniques along with a long-term pseudonym can protect users' location privacy to some extent, users' real identities and moving trajectories can still be deduced through long-term observation and side information aided inference attacks. To address these problems, we propose a dynamic pseudo-ID system, where unlinkable pseudo-IDs are used by users to completely hide their identities in the queries, in order to break the link between users' identities and their locations. Moreover, we employ certificates to ensure the verifiability and traceability of the dynamic pseudo-IDs. Security analysis and evaluation results show that the proposed scheme can enhance user' privacy and is feasible to implement into mobile devices.	adversary (cryptography);authentication;data anonymization;elegant degradation;formal verification;information sensitivity;location-based service;mobile device;obfuscation (software);privacy;server (computing);spectral leakage;traceability	Xiaoyan Zhu;Haotian Chi;Shunrong Jiang;Xiaosan Lei;Hui Li	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883667	privacy software;mobile search;location-based service;internet privacy;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	DB	-39.838014319921456	60.91077039044974	141602

In this context, the graph structure of a system constrains the propagation of information through it. Suppose a set of channels is a cut set between an information source and a potential sink. We prove that, if there is no disclosure from the source to the cut set, then there can be no disclosure to the sink. We introduce a new formalization of partial disclosure, called blur operators, and show that the same cut property is preserved for disclosure to within a blur operator. A related compositional principle ensures limited disclosure for a class of systems that differ only beyond the cut.	box blur;cut (graph theory);distributed computing;graph (discrete mathematics);information flow;information source;software propagation	Joshua D.

Current IdM systems tend to lack the trust component in particular for online transactions. We propose the use of ePassport as a globally interoperable trust token to bridge the gap between offline and online environments. The paper analyses trust attributes of the ePassport and recognizes the extensions required to its deployment in an online IdM for high-value transactions. An architecture is proposed for a network-based IdM system to support three categories of life processes: eGovernment services, high value private services, and eCommerce. The solution is compatible with privacy-enhancing technologies while at the same time creating trusted digital identities and offering users convenience.	biometric passport;digital identity;digital rights management;e-commerce;identity management;interoperability;online and offline;privacy-enhancing technologies;software deployment	Pravir Chawdhry;Ioannis Vakalis	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-14282-6_10	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-47.08130600922351	64.29447449115357	141691

Hence, mobile code, such as Java applets, needs to be analyzed before execution. The byte-code verifier checks low-level security properties that ensure that the downloaded code cannot bypass the virtual machine’s security mechanisms. One of the statically ensured properties is type safety. The type-inference phase is the overwhelming resource-consuming part of the verification process. This paper addresses the RAM bottleneck met while verifying mobile code in memory-constrained environments such as smart-cards. We propose to modify classic type-inference in a way that significantly reduces the memory consumption in the memory-constrained device at the detriment of its distrusted memory-rich environment. The outline of our idea is the following, throughout execution, the memory frames used by the verifier are MAC-ed and exported to the terminal and then retrieved upon request. Hence a distrusted memory-rich terminal can be safely used for convincing the embedded device that the downloaded code is secure. The proposed protocol was implemented on JCOP20 and JCOP30 Java cards using IBM’s JCOP development tool.	byte;code mobility;data rate units;eeprom;embedded system;high- and low-level;iso/iec 7816;java card openplatform;java applet;kilobyte;mobile computing;on-board data handling;overhead (computing);performance;prototype;random-access memory;real life;real-time clock;smart card;type inference;type safety;usb;virtual machine	Konstantin Hyppönen;David Naccache;Elena Trichina;Alexei Tchoulkine	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39927-8_6	embedded system;smart card;java card;real-time computing;type safety;computer science;operating system;type inference;smart card application protocol data unit;mobile computing;java applet	Security	-34.33415815114776	62.081876530496395	141963
ed76c1c317d3ece0589dcce1b6a8996d2057986f	a feasibility evaluation of fair and privacy-enhanced matchmaking with identity linked wishes		The Prom Problem (TPP) represents a special class of matchmaking challenges that amplify the conflicting requirements of anonymity and authentication necessitating fair and privacy-enhanced matchmaking with identity-linked wishes (ILW). ILW are wishes that involve particular identities and are valid only if all associated parties have those same wishes. In this paper, we provide a feasibility evaluation of an implementation of a previously proposed algorithm for TPP along with a detailed characterization of its fairness, and present results from computation and communication specific performance testing. To quantify fairness, we propose the use of a fairness index that combines the concepts underlying Jain’s index with previously established definitions of fair matchmaking and details of the protocol. We also delineate upper and lower bounds for the fairness index values in this context and discuss its relationship to the participants’ confidence in the result. Finally, we present performance results that answer key questions thereby demonstrating the practicality of the solution both in terms of computational costs and communication overhead. The results quantify relative impacts of higher degrees of confidence and anonymity to guide identification of appropriate tradeoffs as the solution is applied to varying problem domains with security and privacy requirements comparable to TPP with ILW.

762de3b2c4aa6b79d68665d4add6d1b747ccacb5	a dependable storage service system in cloud environment	data integrity;authentication;data storage;data dynamics;cloud computing	With the rapid development of the cloud computing, the concepts of cloud computing technology have been applied gradually in many high-tech industries. There are many applications of cloud computing, and among them, cloud storage service is one of the best known because of its extensive utilization in people's daily lives. The use of cloud storage services eliminates the need for people to purchase heavy, expensive devices to provide the large storage space required for their data. Instead, they only need a networked device, which allows them to store their data in the cloud storage server and access the data anywhere. Therefore, more and more people are using the cloud storage server, and this is accompanied by an increasing number of security issues. In this paper, we proposed a secure protocol for the cloud storage service system. Analyses showed that our proposed protocol can withstand potential attacks and that it possesses essential functionalities, such as user anonymity, data dynamics, and data integrity. Therefore, our proposed protocol is suitable for practical implementation.

17118429589c5265bc42b172d2027dd2757caa79	contour: a practical system for binary transparency		Transparency is crucial in security-critical applications that rely on authoritative information, as it provides a robust mechanism for holding these authorities accountable for their actions. A number of solutions have emerged in recent years that provide transparency in the setting of certificate issuance, and Bitcoin provides an example of how to enforce transparency in a financial setting. In this work we shift to a new setting, the distribution of software package binaries, and present a system for so-called “binary transparency.” Our solution, Contour, uses proactive methods for providing transparency, privacy, and availability, even in the face of persistent man-in-the-middle attacks. We also demonstrate, via benchmarks and a test deployment for the Debian software repository, that Contour is the only system for binary transparency that satisfies the efficiency and coordination requirements that would make it possible to deploy today.

Because services using big data on the cloud computing environment consider a lot of users, an efficient user access control scheme is required. However, the existing schemes have a critical problem that the cost of the key management for the user access control is high. To solve the problem, we propose a hierarchical Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) based user access control scheme using a resource set tree. The proposed scheme reduces the number of authentication keys based on a resource set tree by applying the minimum spanning tree. Finally, we show from the performance analysis that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing scheme in terms of both key generation cost and update cost.	access control;authentication;big data;cathode ray tube;cloud computing;file spanning;key generation;key management;minimum spanning tree;profiling (computer programming)	Seung-Tae Hong;Hyeong-Il Kim;Taehoon Kim;Jae-Woo Chang	2015	2015 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BIGCOMP)	10.1109/35021BIGCOMP.2015.7072816	computer access control;computer science;database;distributed computing;internet privacy	DB	-41.41988322969678	67.90110206251168	142611

Recently, it is shown that (α, k)anonymity is a feasible technique when we are given some sensitive attribute(s) and quasi-identifier attributes. In previous work, generalization of the given data table has been used for the anonymization. In this paper, we show that we can project the data onto two tables for publishing in such a way that the privacy protection for (α, k)-anonymity can be achieved with less distortion. In the two tables, one table contains the undisturbed non-sensitive values and the other table contains the undisturbed sensitive values. Privacy preservation is guaranteed by the lossy join property of the two tables. We show by experiments that the results are better than previous approaches.	data anonymization;data mining;distortion;experiment;identifier;information sensitivity;lossy compression;privacy;quasi-identifier;quasi-quotation;table (information);turing completeness;unique key	Raymond Chi-Wing Wong;Yubao Liu;Jian Yin;Zhilan Huang;Ada Wai-Chee Fu;Jian Pei	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72524-4_75	computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-40.47558532192156	63.650280161672875	142622

When transferred over the air this data should be accessible only to legitimate users such as doctors, nurses etc. In this paper, we propose a unique Secure Health Sensor (SHS) node which provides fine access control mechanism such that only legitimate users can access sensitive medical data. Medical data security is achieved through ensuring a secure communication by encrypting sensor data, preventing loss of sensor data by using wired connection between Raspberry Pi and sensors and using Ciphertext Policy Based Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE) to provide access control in multi-user enviroment. We propose storage of cyrptogrphic credentials on Raspbery Pi on hardware tamper resistant area such as Secure Element on form factors such as Go Trust microSD card.

df7654d0883766a51d0e13a04144174bb90d5ced	a time-based group key management algorithm based on proxy re-encryption for cloud storage		Users are motivated to outsource their data into the cloud for its great flexibility and economic saving. However, outsourcingdata to cloud also increases the risk of privacy leak.A straightforward method to protect the users’privacy is to encrypt the files before outsourcing.The existing group key management methods always presume that the server is trustworthy, but cloud storage applications do not meet this condition. Therefore, how to manage the group key to enable authenticated usersto access the files securely and efficientlyis still a challenging problem.In our paper, wepropose a Time-basedGroup Key Management (TGKM)algorithmforcryptographiccloud storage applications, which uses the proxy re-encryption algorithm to transfermajorcomputingtask of the group key management to the cloud server.So, the proposed TGKM scheme greatly reduces the user’s computation and storage overhead and makes full use of cloud server to achieve an efficient group key management for the cryptographic cloud storage applications.Moreover, we introduce a key seed mechanism to generate a time-based dynamic group key which effectively strengthens the cloud data security. Our security analysis and performance evaluations both show that the proposed TGKM scheme is a secure and efficient group key management protocol for the cloud storage applications with low overheads of computation and communication.	algorithm;cloud storage;encryption;group key;key management;proxy re-encryption	Yihui Cui;Zhiyong Peng;Wei Song;Xiaojuan Li;Fangquan Cheng;Luxiao Ding	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11116-2_11	internet privacy	Security	-42.192130412785275	67.91535049913718	142758

However, under open networks and not fully trusted cloud environments, they face enormous security and privacy risks (e.g., data leakage or disclosure, data corruption or loss, and user privacy breach) when outsourcing their data to a public cloud or using their outsourced data. Recently, several studies were conducted to address these risks, and a series of solutions were proposed to enable data and privacy protection in untrusted cloud environments. To fully understand the advances and discover the research trends of this area, this survey summarizes and analyzes the state-of-the-art protection technologies. We first present security threats and requirements of an outsourcing data service to a cloud, and follow that with a high-level overview of the corresponding security technologies. We then dwell on existing protection solutions to achieve secure, dependable, and privacy-assured cloud data services including data search, data computation, data sharing, data storage, and data access. Finally, we propose open challenges and potential research directions in each category of solutions.	cloud computing;computation;computer data storage;data access;dependability;high- and low-level;outsourcing;privacy law;requirement;spectral leakage	Jun Tang;Yong Cui;Qi Li;Kui Ren;Jiangchuan Liu;Rajkumar Buyya	2016	ACM Comput.

Nusser In this paper we review the state of the art in content protection for video games by describing the capabilities and shortcomings of currently deployed solutions. In an attempt to address some of the open issues, we present two novel approaches. The first approach uses branch-based software watermarking to discourage and detect piracy through a registration-based system. In the second approach, based on the parallels between games and premium audio and video content, we propose the use of current physical-media copy-protection technologies for gaming content. In particular, we focus on broadcast encryption technology. The use of an open, standard-based architecture enables the development of a more restrictive protection system for games. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed protection mechanisms can be applied to video-game copy protection through five scenarios.	broadcast encryption;copy protection;digital video;parallels desktop for mac;protection mechanism	Ginger Myles;Stefan Nusser	2006	IBM Systems Journal	10.1147/sj.451.0119	open standard;computer science;operating system;multimedia;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	HCI	-46.67816587520229	67.89097586430204	143085
8f524ebdfb638ededef50bf3cbb07f30c7ab44a1	fast: near real-time data analytics for the cloud	data analytics;cloud storage	Existing cloud storage systems have largely failed to offer an adequate capability for real-time data analytics. Since the true value of data heavily depends on how efficiently data analytics can be carried out on the data in (near-) real-time, large fractions of data unfortunately end up with their values being lost or significantly reduced due to the staleness of data. To address this problem, we propose a near real-time and cost-effective data analytics methodology, called FAST, in the cloud. FAST explores and exploits the semantic correlation property within and among datasets via correlation-aware hashing and manageable flat-structured addressing to significantly reduce the processing latency, while incurring acceptably small loss of accuracy. FAST is demonstrated to be a useful tool in supporting near real-time processing of real-world cloud applications.	cloud computing;cloud storage;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time data	Yu Hua;Hong Jiang;Dan Feng;Lei Tian	2013		10.1145/2523616.2525932	computer science;data mining;database;data analysis;world wide web	OS	-36.72749938961359	66.46846169144796	143167

Using trusted SGX-processors for this task yields high performance, but requires a careful selection, adaptation, and implementation of machine-learning algorithms to provably prevent the exploitation of any side channels induced by data-dependent access patterns. We propose data-oblivious machine learning algorithms for support vector machines, matrix factorization, neural networks, decision trees, and k-means clustering.

In this paper, we study the problem of differentially private histogram release for random workloads. We study two multidimensional partitioning strategies including: 1) a baseline cell-based partitioning strategy for releasing an equi-width cell histogram, and 2) an innovative 2-phase kd-tree based partitioning strategy for releasing a v-optimal histogram. We formally analyze the utility of the released histograms and quantify the errors for answering linear queries such as counting queries. We formally characterize the property of the input data that will guarantee the optimality of the algorithm. Finally, we implement and experimentally evaluate several applications using the released histograms, including counting queries, classification, and blocking for record linkage and show the benefit of our approach.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);blocking (computing);differential privacy;experiment;linkage (software);smoothing;two-phase commit protocol	Yonghui Xiao;Li Xiong;Liyue Fan;Slawomir Goryczka	2014	Trans.

eec98a979c5ac3e46a6671719b6486e5bd5264df	auditable zerocoin		Bitcoin is the first widely adopted decentralized digitale-cash system. All Bitcoin transactions that include addresses of senders and receivers are stored in the public blockchain which could cause privacy problems. The Zerocoin protocol hides the link between individual Bitcoin transactions without adding trusted third parties. However such an untraceable remittance system could cause illegal transfers such as money laundering. In this paper we address this problem and propose an auditable decentralized e-cash scheme based on the Zerocoin protocol. Our scheme allows designated auditors to extract link information from Zerocoin transactions while preventing other users including miners from obtaining it. Respecting the mind of the decentralized system, the auditor doesn't have other authorities such as stopping transfers, confiscating funds, and deactivating accounts. A technical contribution of our scheme is that a coin sender embeds audit information with a non-interactive zeroknowledge proof of knowledge (NIZKP). This zero-knowledge prevents malicious senders from embedding indiscriminate audit information, and we construct it simply using only the standard Schnorr protocol for discrete logarithm without zk-SNARKs or other recent techniques for zero-knowledge proof.	bitcoin;decentralised system;discrete logarithm;interactivity;proof of knowledge;zero-knowledge proof;zerocoin	Ken Naganuma;Masayuki Yoshino;Hisayoshi Sato;Takayuki Suzuki	2017	2017 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops (EuroS&PW)	10.1109/EuroSPW.2017.51	proof of knowledge;decentralised system;computer network;money laundering;public-key cryptography;communication source;computer security;computer science;remittance;audit;discrete logarithm	Security	-42.88098397397135	71.70555091361672	143678
05040f5b98968a8f89a5cc93afa50072235f4220	panel session: what are the key challenges in distributed security?	panel session;distinguished researcher;principal motivation;data security;key future challenge;major importance;conference debate	The principal motivation for organizing a panel session at DBSEC’08 was to invite a number of distinguished researchers in data security to present their thoughts and to stimulate conference debate on a question of major importance: what are the key future challenges in distributed data security? The thoughts of the panellists on this issue are summarized in this article. Steve Barker, the session moderator, opened the discussion by commenting that the term “distributed data security” describes a very wide-ranging space of issues that are often quite loosely related. For example, in terms of technologies, “distributed security” is applicable at the levels of the minute (e.g., hand-held devices) and the massive (e.g., the Internet). Barker noted that although there are common challenges (e.g., dealing with incomplete, contradictory, non-contemporary, and unreliable distributed sources) specific distributed systems present specific challenges. Barker also noted that the term “security” in “distributed data security” is also very general and covers privacy and integrity issues that present particular challenges in the distributed context. Barker concluded by observing that the contributions of the panellists revealed that the key challenges in distributed security remain many and varied. David Chadwick argued that security will be increasingly policy-based with common policies being distributed to many sites so that a consistent approach to security can be developed throughout the system. Chadwick predicted that there would be significant advances in user-friendly tools for creating security policies and that these will be based on natural language so that humans will be able to understand clearly the policies they create. Many systems will have multiple stakeholders, each of whom will want to express their own security policies for (some of) the data in the system. Consequently there will be conflicting policies from the different stakeholders, which will require automated mechanisms for the resolution of policy conflicts. Chadwick suggested that federated identity management will increase in prominence, with single sign-on and attribute-based authorization, with the attributes coming from a variety of authorities. Trusted platform modules will be utilized to increase trust between the federated systems. Users will become more aware of protecting their privacy as losses from identity theft increase. National ID-based schemes will be increasingly rolled out throughout Europe and will tend to be used for valuable transactions. Biometrics will be used more frequently for authentication. Biometric databases of entire populations will become more prevalent and will lead to increased fears of privacy leaks. (We already have the biometrics of 4 million people on the UK police database). Furthermore, networks will be patrolled by governments, police and the security services, and all traffic on the Internet will be routinely analysed. (Either legislation will be introduced to enforce ISPs to record all traffic, or it will be done surreptitiously at key gateways.) Chadwick noted that these developments will increase users concerns about privacy, making them turn to OpenID or similar systems, in which the users choose their own globally unique pseudonyms. There will be advances in anonymized data access for medical and other applications that require access to large distributed data stores of personal information, and intelligent history-based protection mechanisms will stop users from trawling and aggregating output in order to flout privacy rules. Jason Crampton observed that access control models for closed, centralized environments assume the existence of components that are responsible for authenticating users, for intercepting requests and enforcing authorization decisions, and for deciding whether a request is authorized or not. Moreover, Crampton noted that, in the centralized case, it is assumed that mutual trust relationships exist between these components and that they share a common “vocabulary” for authentication and authorization. Crampton expressed the view that implementing access control in open distributed environments can be very challenging because the assumptions that hold in the centralized case do not necessarily apply to decentralized systems. For example, prior trust relationships may not necessarily exist between components; indeed, they may not even be aware of each other’s existence. Crampton suggested that five challenges emerge: 1. To be able tomapa user in one domain to one or more principals defined in the authorization policy of another domain without any prior agreement between the domains. 2. To be able toidentifyall of the user attributes that are required to make an authorization decision. 3. To be able tocollectall of the statements about user attributes that are required to make an authorization decision. 4. To develop a language to encodestatements about user attributes in a common format with a universal semantics. 5. To be able toverify the authenticity of statements binding user identifiers to user attributes. Emil Lupu suggested that the trend towards ”pervasive systems” leads us to envisage a world that includes mobile devices such as phones and PDAs, body area sensornetworks (e.g., for health monitoring), autonomous vehicles and instrumented environments such as smart-homes, autonomous buildings and watchful urban environments. Lupu noted that, in such environments, data is continuously acquired, aggregated and proactively exchanged amongst devices and amongst infrastructure services. Beyond access control, data protection requires privacy, dissemination and usage controls. Decisions regarding data protection, retention and disclosure need to be made in the presence of uncertain and partial authentication information and are often context dependent. Data exchanges are subject to regulations derived from legislation, organizational procedures and data sharing agreements between organizations. Expressing these, deriving operational policies, and deploying those policies to enforcement mechanisms close to the data remains a significant challenge. Policy analysis algorithms to detect and resolve conflicts between policies are also necessary. Frameworks in which data can be protected beyond the originator’s domain need to cater for a variety of protection requirements and threat models. On smaller scale devices this needs to be achieved with limited computational resources. Yet the same techniques that are used for data protection may be abused to ensure its survival and proliferation. Bhavani Thuraisingham observed that many technologies are being developed for distributed information management and that security and privacy issues have to be investigated in relation to these emerging technologies. Thuraisingham suggested that one of the main challenges in distributed information management is to support social networking algorithms and, for this, work on the integration of the information in disparate and diverse data sources is needed. In addition, the knowledge that is extracted from these information sources has to be integrated so that the manager(s) of them can make effective decisions. Today we see an explosion of social networks such as My Space and Face Book. Ensuring the security of access and privacy of individuals for such networks are critical issues. Thuraisingham reported that research at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) is focusing on developing novel and secure semantic web technologies for effective knowledge management and social networking. (Sponsors of this work include the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the National Science Foundation, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and Raytheon Corporation.) More specifically, a secure framework, based on the service oriented architecture paradigm, is being developed at UTD and is based on a three-level model that includes: The RDF Graph Manager, The Ontology Heuristics Reasoner and the Entity Extractor. Thuraisingham explained that novel dependable and secure semantic web technologies are being employed to realize this framework of connected layers. For example, the ontology-based heuristics reasoner will rely on the RDF graph manager to provide efficient storage and retrieval of RDF graphs. The entity extractor will depend on both the RDF graph manager and ontology-based heuristics reasoner to structure and reason about the graphs so that the entity extractor component can effectively carry out its task. All of the layers combined will provide the infrastructure support for distributed algorithms for social network analysis and knowledge management. Thuraisingham stated that one of the main focus areas for this work is security and privacy so that secure and private social networks can be supported. Thuraisingham noted that although research in secure distributed systems and distributed databases systems began in the 1980s, there remain many aspects of information distribution for which specific solutions for secure distributed networks, middleware, databases, information sources and applications are still needed.

4e4a62717f3cb1818faffac2538ab77c6a979898	a method of signal scrambling to secure data storage for healthcare applications		A body sensor network that consists of wearable and/or implantable biosensors has been an important front-end for collecting personal health records. It is expected that the full integration of outside-hospital personal health information and hospital electronic health records will further promote preventative health services as well as global health. However, the integration and sharing of health information is bound to bring with it security and privacy issues. With extensive development of healthcare applications, security and privacy issues are becoming increasingly important. This paper addresses the potential security risks of healthcare data in Internet-based applications and proposes a method of signal scrambling as an add-on security mechanism in the application layer for a variety of healthcare information, where a piece of tiny data is used to scramble healthcare records. The former is kept locally and the latter, along with security protection, is sent for cloud storage. The tiny data can be derived from a random number generator or even a piece of healthcare data, which makes the method more flexible. The computational complexity and security performance in terms of theoretical and experimental analysis has been investigated to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method is applicable to all kinds of data that require extra security protection within complex networks.	add-ons for firefox;addresses (publication format);biosensors;cloud storage;complex network;computational complexity theory;computer security;electronic health records;global health;health services;implants;internet;personal health information;personal health records;privacy;random number generation;wearable computer	Shu-Di Bao;Meng Chen;Guang-Zhong Yang	2017	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2017.2679979	cloud storage;application layer;wireless sensor network;the internet;data security;computer science;cloud computing security;computer security;security service;computer data storage	Security	-42.80470258397579	63.853164485724406	144231

Anonymous fingerprinting has appeared as a technique for copyright protection which is compatible with buyer anonymity in electronic transactions. However, the complexity of known algorithms for anonymous fingerprinting is too high for practical implementation on standard computers, let alone smart cards. A scheme for anonymous fingerprinting is presented in this paper where all buyer computations can be performed by the buyer’s smart card.	algorithm;computation;computer;e-commerce;electronic funds transfer;fingerprint (computing);smart card	Josep Domingo-Ferrer;Jordi Herrera-Joancomartí	1998		10.1007/10721064_20	e-commerce;smart card;computer science;cryptographic protocol;internet privacy;openpgp card;world wide web;computer security;intellectual property	Security	-44.32341881923937	71.43869140152657	144269

As a result, for the protection of secret data from unwanted access, hybrid security mechanisms employing the use of steganography to hide the encrypted data are gaining popularity. These mechanisms provide an extra level of security to the data. This paper proposes a hybrid mechanism that not only aims at providing good security but at the same time has high data embedding capacity and entropy values with low execution time complexity. To enhance the embedding capacity of the overall system, Improved Bit Plane Complex Steganography (IBPCS) along-with Huffman coding is used and for providing randomness, the use of chaos process wherever possible is done. The cryptographic technique employed is hierarchical visual cryptography due to its efficiency over other cryptographic mechanisms. The overall scheme is implemented in MATLAB-10 and the results prove that the proposed mechanism is efficient to other available schemes in literature.	bit plane;confidentiality;encryption;huffman coding;internet protocol suite;randomness;run time (program lifecycle phase);steganography;telecommunications network;time complexity;visual cryptography	Divya Chaudhary;Shailender Gupta;Manju Kumari	2016	IJIPSI	10.1504/IJIPSI.2016.078592	steganography tools;computer science;theoretical computer science;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-38.43681278501485	68.22508194226084	144278
85fdac175845cbdfbfaeff74c9b98f932f238fea	k-anonymity chord for anonymous query response		Peer-to-peer systems provide a distributed way of sharing and storing information. Each peer stores some infor-  mation and responds to queries. In some applications, protecting anonymity of a responding peer is important to  increase availability of information. This paper presents a cryptographic protocol on Chord to protect anonymity  of peers when responding to queries. In this protocol, peers form anonymity groups and generate responses inside  groups. Responder of a query has k-anonymity protection against an adversary who can sniff all communication  on the network. Validity of an anonymous reply can be verified so fake replies of malicious peers are prevented.  The proposed approach can be adapted to other DHT structures to protect responder anonymity.

This can be accomplished by using template protection mechanisms. These transform a feature vector that is derived from a data subject’s biometric characteristic into a protected template (pseudo identity) and thus guarantee that no additional information such as health-related information is stored in the biometric reference. Due to noise, two biometric samples of one data subject are not the same and differ in some feature values (intra-class variations). This paper proposes a new template protection method which deals with these intra-class differences by applying cryptographic hash functions in a step-wise manner to certain pieces of the biometric feature vector. This idea was inspired by Kornblum who proposed piecewise hashing for files. In this paper the method is applied to 3-dimensional facial data. The experimental results indicate that the biometric performance of the method is close to the biometric performance obtained without template protection.	biometric device;biometrics;block size (cryptography);cryptographic hash function;cryptography;feature vector;protection mechanism;security of cryptographic hash functions	Claudia Nickel;Christoph Busch;Xuebing Zhou	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.234	facial recognition system;information privacy;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security;cryptographic hash function;signature recognition	DB	-37.81922496103421	69.67661852247781	144611

Mobile signatures are used, for example, for user identification and authentication, the message authentication, non-repudiation of transactions and verifying the information integrity. The service is based on mobile PKI and on the federation of security assertions using ETSI MSS standards. The service provider needs an agreement only with one operator. Then all services in the Circle of Trust may request authentication and digital signing from user even if a service provider has made an agreement with other competing operator than the home operator of the user. The signature service platform is extremely secure using strong two-factor and two-channel model. All personal security credentials are stored and the crypto-operations run in the mobile operator's tamper-proof secure element, UICC. The Finnish mobile signature service fulfils the strong identification in the Finnish 'Identification' Act. The service platform offers potentially to millions of Finnish citizens and the participating Finnish businesses convenient to use and trusted signature services on various service channels for applications hosted on the premises or in the cloud. Signature services can be used also abroad where SMS services are provided and where user's operator has a roaming agreement.	mobile signature	Esa Kerttula	2015	J.

4296ce3529a9197db3ef3833a74a5aa7fb776f22	using blockchain for data auditing in cloud storage		Cloud storage is one of the most important service of cloud computing. Since cloud service providers can not be completely trusted, traditional auditing methods can’t guarantee the security of data sources. This paper proposes a security framework for cloud data audit using blockchain technology. User’s operational information on the file is formed to a block after validated by all checked nodes in the blockchain network, and then to be put into the blockchain. Any modification or fake to the operational information can be inspected through the chain structure of block, thus ensuring the security of auditing data source. We construct a prototype in an Ethereum-based blockchain using Aliyun as data storage service, then test the time overhead of uploading file, broadcasting operation information and packing information into block chain. The results show that the time for packaging block remains unchanged from an overall viewpoint, and as the file size increasing, packaging block occupies less percentage in the entire process of file uploading or downloading.

baaeb7a0884f9c3cf8bdb83b00f3a42eb09f3b0f	mutual authentication scheme for multimedia medical information systems		For Multimedia Medical Information System (MMIS), security and privacy are the significant measures. For the guarantee of MMIS significant measures, several authentication schemes have been proposed, though the authentication schemes fail to offer the measurable features, like Repetitive Registration, Verification Table, Mutual Authenticity with Key-Sharing, and Client Anonymity. In addition, the existing authentication schemes fail to provide the reasonable bandwidth utilization and signal congestion to improve the performance of the multimedia information system. Most importantly, the existing schemes fail to withstand against the attacks, like key-impersonation, man-in-the-middle, stolen-verifier and server-spoofing. In this research article, we thus propose and present an efficient Mutual Authentication Scheme (MAS) using bilinear-pairing system to enhance the security features of multimedia information system and it is specially designed and developed for purpose of telecare medicine system. To prove the significance of MAS protocol, this paper is analyzed experimentally the security features comparison, computational cost, execution efficiencies, signal congestion and bandwidth utilization using multimedia medical information system. The examination result is proven that the proposed protocol of MAS achieves better performance comparatively than the existing authentication schemes, such as Wang et al., Chen et al., Choi et al., Wu et al. and Yoon et al.	algorithmic efficiency;bilinear filtering;computation;entity–relationship model;experiment;information system;man-in-the-middle attack;mutual authentication;network congestion;overhead (computing);server (computing)	Bakkiam David Deebak	2016	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-016-3268-7	telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-45.982464913106625	73.9833154341092	144851

In the case of m-healthcare, however, the problem of a patient's information easily exposed to a third party and misused in an emergency situation still persists. This research paper proposed the attribute-based patient access control protocol to minimize violation of a patient's privacy using the patient's information saved in a smart phone in the environment of an emergency situation of m-healthcare. The proposed protocol, to prevent the exposure of a patient's sensitive information to a third party, includes sensitive information of the patient in Personal Health Information (PHI) and encodes the information with a signature key hashed by a random number created by the u-healthcare service center and the patient in question. In addition, to prevent misuse of patient information by a third party, the leak of PHI can be prevented by maintaining synchronization between the patient and officials at a hospital."""

In this paper, security and privacy requirements for an RFID authentication system are defined. Although some of the conventional cryptographic operations provide these requirements partially, they are not considered as suitable solution for RFID applications because operations cost is high especially for RFID tags. An unconventional use of homomorphic encryption is proposed to provide low-cost security and privacy in this research. HEADA is proposed as a novel authentication technique, which consists of deployment and authentication process stages. The homomorphic encryption is used solely in the generation of keys during deployment stage. These keys are used by RFID tags to generate anonymous authentication keys during the authentication process using only integer addition operations. Moreover, some of the conventional approaches have to use a brute-force search in the server side to identify a tag. Unlike these techniques, HEADA enables the server to identify a tag only by a binary search. It is shown that HEADA is the only technique to satisfy all security and privacy requirements using low-cost operations in both tag and server sides.

Their scheme uses separate indexes for the data and the verification information to realize the authenticity and completeness verification in outsourced database. In this paper, we analyze PMD and show the drawbacks in PMD such as the slow update, the collusion and forgery attacks, and no content access control etc. In order to overcome these defects, the idea of designated verifier signature is introduced into query verification, and a secure, efficient query verification scheme for dynamic outsourced databases is proposed based on PMD. The analysis of security and performance shows that the proposed scheme has not only the same advantages with PMD, but also prevents the collusion and forgery attacks as well as enforces content access control. Furthermore, the update speed of the proposed scheme is faster than PMD, the storage cast of the proposed is lower than PMD.	access control;database;designated verifier signature;digest access authentication;digital signature;experiment;message authentication code;pmd;paging	Xiaoming Wang;Duobao Yuan	2012	JCP	10.4304/jcp.7.1.156-160	computer science;information security;database;efficiency;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-40.84707878295536	67.97861273803596	144895

However, individuals visit many places and their location-visit patterns, or ''trails'', can re-identify seemingly anonymous data. In this paper, we introduce a formal model of privacy protection, called k-unlinkability, to prevent trail re-identification in distributed data. The model guarantees that sensitive data trails are linkable to no less than k identities. We develop a graph-based model and illustrate how k-unlinkability is a more appropriate solution to this privacy problem compared to alternative privacy protection models.	privacy	Bradley A Malin	2008	Data Knowl.

4080aa5d9b97a8d615af955aac75c6502fe286a9	the resurrecting duckling - what next?	wireless ad hoc network;security policy	In the context of the security of wireless ad hoc networks, we previously explored the problem of secure transient association between a master and a slave device in the absence of an online authentication server. We introduced the Resurrecting Duckling security policy model to address this problem. Master-slave relationships, however, do not exhaust the range of interesting interactions. We therefore extend the Duckling model to also cover relationships between peers. 1 The Duckling: why, what, and what’s missing The range of devices that contain a microprocessor is continually expanding in every field — from consumer goods to office equipment, “white goods”, vehicles and medical and scientific instrumentation. Looking ahead, the next development after endowing every device with a processor is going to be to allow all these computing nodes to communicate with each other, enabling them to co-operate and take advantage of each other’s services. For convenience, in many cases this connectivity will be wireless: devices will be able to talk to each other as required by forming short-lived ad hoc wireless networks. One respect in which such networks are fundamentally different from their well studied more traditional cousins is the absence of online servers for functions such as authentication. Your digital camera and your electronic organiser may spontaneously decide to communicate at any time, for example while you are taking pictures in the middle of the desert, and the ad hoc network they establish will be completely local, with no backbone infrastructure to connect it to the Internet or to anything else. This means that the problem of authentication can no longer be solved in the traditional way. The symmetric cryptography solutions in the tradition of Needham-Schroeder, Otway-Rees, Kerberos etc. explicitly require an online ticket-granting server; and even the solutions based on public key cryptography and signed certificates eventually fail if the certification authority is not online, due to the difficulty of performing timely revocation. 1 Certificates may certainly be marked with an expiration date, and the interval between renewals may be made sufficiently short that timely revocation becomes posB.

The reason is that the abstractions made to improve performance on fixed two- or three-party protocols either preclude the modeling of group protocols altogether or permit modeling only in a fixed scenario, which can prevent attacks from being discovered. This paper describes Coral, a tool for finding counterexamples to incorrect inductive conjectures, which we have used to model protocols for both group key agreement and group key management, without any restrictions on the scenario.

The protocol consists of two stages: 1) slot reservation and 2) message submission. In the slot reservation stage, a group of N participants cooperate to assign each member a message slot in a vector which is essentially a message submission schedule, in such a manner that each participant's slot is oblivious to other members and the application server. In the message submission stage, each participant transmits an encoded data to the application server based on the slot information known only to herself, in such a way that the application server cannot link a data to a specific participant. With such a data reporting protocol, the link between the data and the participants is broken, and as a result, participant's privacy is protected. We conduct theoretical analysis of the correctness and anonymity of our protocol, as well as experiments to demonstrate the efficiency in small-scale applications with periodic data sampling.	application server;correctness (computer science);encryption;exclusive or;experiment;participatory sensing;privacy;public-key cryptography;sampling (signal processing);server (computing)	Yonglei Yao;Laurence Tianruo Yang;Naixue N.

In such settings the data provider supplies access control keys to its legal customers on a periodical basis. A number of users may collude in order to publish those keys via the Internet or any other network. Dynamic traitor tracing schemes rely on the feedback from the pirate network in order to modify their key allocation until they are able either to incriminate and disconnect all traitors or force them to stop their illegal activity. Those schemes are deterministic in the sense that incrimination is always certain. As such deterministic schemes must multiply the critical data by at least p + 1, where p is the number of traitors, they may impose a too large toll on bandwidth. We suggest here probabilistic schemes that enable one to trace all traitors with almost certainty, where the critical data is multiplied by two, regardless of the number of traitors. These techniques are obtained by combining dynamic traitor tracing schemes with binary fingerprinting techniques, such as those proposed by Boneh and Shaw.	access control;bandwidth (signal processing);fingerprint (computing);internet;traitor tracing	Tamir Tassa	2004	Journal of Cryptology	10.1007/s00145-004-0214-z	binary code;telecommunications;image processing;digital watermarking;computer science;theoretical computer science;computer security;algorithm	Security	-42.020762488934274	71.32565936043112	145943
41f736df8d25098e14cec20c1e695a1d36afeb0b	enhancing data privacy in the cloud		Due to its low cost, robustness, flexibility and ubiquitous nature, cloud computing is changing the way entities manage their data. However, various privacy concerns arise whenever potentially sensitive data is outsourced to the cloud. This paper presents a novel approach for coping with such privacy concerns. The proposed scheme prevents the cloud server from learning any possibly sensitive plaintext in the outsourced databases. It also allows the database owner to delegate users to conducting content-level fine-grained private search and decryption. Moreover, our scheme supports private querying whereby neither the database owner nor the cloud server learns query details. Additional requirement that user’s input be authorized by CA can also be supported.	access control;authorization;cloud computing;cloud storage;cryptography;database;encryption;entity;information privacy;outsourcing;plaintext;server (computing);virtual private server	Yanbin Lu;Gene Tsudik	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-22200-9_11	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-41.73112847521454	66.46675259581431	146045

In order to reach an agreement, existing average consensus algorithms require each agent to exchange explicit state information with its neighbors. This leads to the disclosure of private state information, which is undesirable in cases where privacy is of concern. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables secure and privacy-preserving average consensus in a decentralized architecture in the absence of any trusted third-parties. By leveraging homomorphic cryptography, our approach can guarantee consensus to the exact value in a deterministic manner. The proposed approach is light-weight in computation and communication, and applicable to time-varying interaction topology cases. A hardware implementation is presented to demonstrate the capability of our approach.	algorithm;computation;consensus (computer science);cryptography;distributed control system;encode;noise (electronics);privacy;randomness;system dynamics;trusted third party	Minghao Ruan;Muaz Ahmad;Yongqiang Wang	2017		10.1145/3140241.3140243	decentralised system;architecture;cryptography;computation;ranging;homomorphic encryption;uniform consensus;distributed computing;computer science	Security	-39.860486900488155	71.60668079564466	146265
549509aa96e756a40321a9e9d8788b367987cfdb	efficient privacy-preservation multi-factor ranking with approximate search over encrypted big cloud data		Encrypting data before outsourcing data has become a challenge in using traditional search algorithms. Many techniques have been proposed to cater the needs. However, as cloud service has a pay-as-yougo basis, these techniques are inefficiency. In this paper we attack the challenging problem by proposing an approximate multi keyword search with multi factor ranking over encrypted cloud data. Moreover, we establish strict privacy requirements and prove that the proposed scheme is secure in terms of privacy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first who propose approximate matching technique on semantic search. Furthermore, to improve search efficiency, we consider multi-factor ranking technique to rank a query for documents. Through comprehensive experimental analysis combined with real world data, our proposed technique shows more efficiency and can retrieve more accurate results and meanwhile improve privacy by introducing randomness in query data.	approximation algorithm;cloud computing;encryption;outsourcing;privacy;randomness;regular expression;requirement;search algorithm;semantic search	Jing He;Yiming Wu;Guangli Xiang;Zhendong Wu;Shouling Ji	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-69471-9_33	randomness;data mining;cloud computing;information retrieval;semantic search;encryption;outsourcing;search algorithm;inefficiency;computer science;ranking	DB	-40.20817051317138	66.9516201752913	146348
45f6f2425f3e21abea774fa6261eb6c457efd140	versum: verifiable computations over large public logs	verifiable computation;cloud computing	VerSum allows lightweight clients to outsource expensive computations over large and frequently changing data structures, such as the Bitcoin or Namecoin blockchains, or a Certificate Transparency log. VerSum clients ensure that the output is correct by comparing the outputs from multiple servers. VerSum assumes that at least one server is honest, and crucially, when servers disagree, VerSum uses an efficient conflict resolution protocol to determine which server(s) made a mistake and thus obtain the correct output.  VerSum's contribution lies in achieving low server-side overhead for both incremental re-computation and conflict resolution, using three key ideas: (1) representing the computation as a functional program, which allows memoization of previous results; (2) recording the evaluation trace of the functional program in a carefully designed computation history to help clients determine which server made a mistake; and (3) introducing a new authenticated data structure for sequences, called SeqHash, that makes it efficient for servers to construct summaries of computation histories in the presence of incremental re-computation. Experimental results with an implementation of VerSum show that VerSum can be used for a variety of computations, that it can support many clients, and that it can easily keep up with Bitcoin's rate of new blocks with transactions.	authentication;bitcoin;certificate transparency;computation history;data structure;functional programming;memoization;namecoin;outsourcing;overhead (computing);server (computing);server-side	Jelle van den Hooff;M.

A variety of security protocols based on cryptographic primitives are used to establish secure communication over insecure open networks and distributed systems. Unfortunately, security protocols often contain serious errors. Formal verification can be used to obtain assurance that a protocol cannot be attacked by an intruder. In this paper, we present how the process-algebraic language μCRL can be used to specify and analyze security protocols. To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, we analyze the Needham-Schroeder public-key protocol and reproduce the error found by Gavin Lowe [Low96a]. Two more definitions of authentication are studied.

We address the case of vertically partitioned data -- multiple data owners/agencies each possess a few attributes of every data record. We focus on the case of the agencies wanting to conduct a linear regression analysis with complete records without disclosing values of their own attributes. This paper describes an algorithm that enables such agencies to compute the exact regression coefficients of the global regression equation and also perform some basic goodness-of-fit diagnostics while protecting the confidentiality of their data. In more general settings beyond the privacy scenario, this algorithm can also be viewed as method for the distributed computation for regression analyses.	algorithm;coefficient;computation;confidentiality;data mining;database;distributed computing;row (database)	Ashish P.

f4d9295f1e6e83a98179dda5cba43ba3e2cd1094	privacy preserving extreme learning machine using additively homomorphic encryption		Recently, computational outsourcing using cloud services is getting popular for big data analysis, and many cloud sourcing providers provide machine learning platforms where we can perform various prediction and classification tasks very easily. On the other hand, there still remains a big hurdle to analyze personal big data on cloud services because the leakage of personal information is a critical issue. As a remedy for this, we propose a privacy preserving machine learning algorithm for Extreme Learning Machine (PP-ELM), which can learn from data encrypted with an additively homomorphic encryption. In the proposed outsourcing method, we consider a three-participants model consisting of data contributors, outsourced server, and data analyst. A data contributor preprocesses and encrypts data, and an outsourced server receives encrypted data and calculate hidden layer outputs using additive operations. Then, a data analyst receives the hidden outputs of ELM from the outsourced server and they are used to obtain ELM connection weights. Since the proposed outsourcing model can learn ELM over encrypted data, it is expected to mitigate a hurdle to deal with personal data on cloud services. In addition, the proposed PP-ELM allows us to learn multiple sources of personal data in a secure way, and this might lead to a better solution for a practical problem than before.	algorithm;approximation;big data;cloud computing;computation;confidentiality;cryptography;experiment;homomorphic encryption;logistic regression;machine learning;nonlinear system;outsourcing;pp (complexity);personally identifiable information;preprocessor;server (computing);spectral leakage;utility functions on indivisible goods	Shohei Kuri;Takuya Hayashi;Toshiaki Omori;Seiichi Ozawa;Yoshinori Aono;Le Trieu Phong;Lihua Wang;Shiho Moriai	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)	10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285190	data mining;extreme learning machine;cloud computing;big data;outsourcing;encryption;personally identifiable information;homomorphic encryption;computer science	ML	-37.45694361863942	65.25276857095079	147207
ef976aa31be511210a01107ab0709beedfb15c2c	towards a publicly-verifiable mix-net providing everlasting privacy		All implementations of verifiable mix-nets provide computational privacy only, because the audit information published is encrypted using some public key algorithm. Consequently, at some time in the future, when the underlying cryptographic assumption is broken, privacy is violated, and each output message can be traced back to its input. We address this problem by presenting a mix-net that uses a homomorphic, unconditionally hiding commitment scheme to encrypt the audit information, implying unconditional or everlasting privacy towards the public. The correctness of our mix-net is guaranteed with overwhelming probability even if all authorities conspire, under the assumption that the commitment scheme is computationally binding until the mixing process has ended. An implication of our result is that many current applications that use mix-nets can be upgraded to unconditional privacy.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;commitment scheme;computation;computational hardness assumption;computational problem;computational resource;correctness (computer science);encryption;formal verification;mix network;privacy;prêt à voter;public-key cryptography;semantic security	Johannes A.

Recently, the journal engineering applications of artificial intelligence published a paper by Chen and Deng (2009) where the authors propose a mutual authentication protocol for RFID. This protocol has fundamental flaws that can be readily taken advantage by a resourceful adversary.

HIPAA has also e stablished principles for security standards that globale-health industry tends to follow. In this paper, a hybrid pub lic key infrastructure solution (HPKI) is proposed to comply with the HIPAA regulations. The main contribution is the newe-health security architecture that is contract oriented instead of session oriented which exists in most literatures. The proposed HPKI has delegated the trust and security manag ement to the medical service provider during the contract period, which is more realistic. It is mu ch an analogy to existing paper based health care systems in terms of functional structure. The cryptogr aphically strong PKI scheme is deployed for the mutual authentication and the distribution of sensitiv e yet computational non-intensive data while efficient symmetric cryptographic technology is used for th e storage and transmission of high volume of medical data such as medical images. One advantage is that the proposed HPKI can be constructed from existing cryptographic technologies where various re levant security standards, tools and products are available. Discussion has been provided to illustrate h ow proposed schemes can address the HIPAA privacy and security regulations.	computer security;health insurance portability and accountability act;mutual authentication;privacy;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography	Jiankun Hu;Hsiao-Hwa Chen;Ting-Wei Hou	2010	Computer Standards & Interfaces	10.1016/j.csi.2009.04.005	computer security model;personally identifiable information;cloud computing security;security through obscurity;security information and event management;security convergence;computer science;information security;public key infrastructure;security service;internet privacy;security analysis;security testing;computer security;computer network	Security	-44.71408546355052	63.20911064596419	147672

The use of these devices generates a huge collection of spatio-temporal data, variously called moving object data, trajectory data, or moblity data. These data can be used for various data analysis purposes such as city traffic control, mobility management, urban planning, and location-based service advertisements. Clearly, the spatio-temporal data so collected may help an attacker to discover personal and sensitive information like user habits, social customs, religious and sexual preferences of individuals. Consequently, it raises serious concerns about privacy. Simply replacing users' real identifiers (name, SSN, etc.) with pseudonyms is insufficient to guarantee anonymity. The problem is that due to the existence of quasi-identifiers, i.e., spatio-temporal data points that can be linked to external information to re-identify individuals, the attacker may be able to trace the anonymous spatio-temporal data back to individuals.  In this survey, we discuss recent advancement on anonymity preserving data publishing of moving object databases in an off-line fashion. We first introduce several anonymity models, then we describe in detail some of the proposed techniques to enforce trajectory anonymity, discussing their merits and limitations. We conclude by identifying challenging open problems that need attention.	data point;database;global positioning system;graph coloring;identifier;information sensitivity;location awareness;location-based service;mobile phone;online and offline;personal digital assistant;privacy;pseudonymity;quasi-identifier;radio-frequency identification;sensor;subscriber identity module	Francesco Bonchi;Laks V.

518e937388f11bbf5376705af45f32ec56d93245	cooperative query answer authentication scheme over anonymous sensing data	protocols;sensors;authentication;publishing;cloud computing;data models	In cloud service over crowd-sensing data, the data owner (DO) publishes the sensing data through the cloud server, so that the user can obtain the information of interest on demand. But the cloud service providers (CSP) are often untrustworthy. The privacy and security concerns emerge over the authenticity of the query answer and the leakage of the DO identity. To solve these issues, many researchers study the query answer authentication scheme for cloud service system. The traditional technique is providing DO’s signature for the published data. But the signature would always reveal DO’s identity. To deal with this disadvantage, this paper proposes a cooperative query answer authentication scheme, based on the ring signature, the Merkle hash tree (MHT) and the non-repudiable service protocol. Through the cooperation among the entities in cloud service system, the proposed scheme could not only verify the query answer, but also protect the DO’s identity. First, it picks up the internal nodes of MHT to sign, as well as the root node. Thus, the verification computation complexity could be significantly reduced from  $O({log}_{2}N)$  to  $O({log}_{2}N^{0.5})$  in the best case. Then, it improves an existing ring signature to sign the selected nodes. Furthermore, the proposed scheme employs the non-repudiation protocol during the transmission of query answer and verification object to protect trading behavior between the CSP and users. The security and performance analysis prove the security and feasibility of the proposed scheme. Extensive experimental results demonstrate its superiority of verification efficiency and communication overhead.	authentication;best, worst and average case;cloud computing;computation;entity;mhtml;merkle tree;non-repudiation;overhead (computing);profiling (computer programming);ring signature;server (computing);spectral leakage;tree (data structure);virtual private server	Liangmin Wang;Qingqing Xie;Hong Zhong	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2676008	data modeling;communications protocol;cloud computing;computer science;sensor;operating system;authentication;publishing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-42.45766324840463	66.97153575005825	147992

While intensive research efforts have been focused on ensuring data correctness in AMI data collection and protecting data confidentiality in smart grid communications, less effort has been devoted to privacy protection in smart grid data management and sharing. In smart grid data management, the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) collects high-frequency energy consumption data, which often contains rich inhabitant and lifestyle information about the end consumers. The data is often shared with various stakeholders, such as the generators, distributors and marketers. However, the utility may not have consent of the users to share potentially sensitive data. In this paper, we develop comprehensive mechanisms to enable privacy-preserving smart data management. First, we analyze the privacy threats and consumer identifiability issues associated with high-frequency AMI data. We then present the first solution based on data sanitization, which eliminates sensitive/identifiable information before sharing usage data with external peers. Meanwhile, we present solutions based on secure multi-party computing to enable external peers to perform aggregate/statistical operations on original metering data in a privacy-preserving manner. Experiments on real-world consumption data demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed solutions.	aggregate data;code injection;confidentiality;correctness (computer science);grid systems corporation;privacy;sanitization (classified information);secure multi-party computation;smart meter;usage data	Lei Yang;Hao Xue;Fengjun Li	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007759	engineering;smart grid;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;internet of things	DB	-44.979606512076735	66.29371028439934	148012

Recently proposed schemes such as “provable data possession” and “proofs of retrievability” are designed to address this problem, but they are designed to audit static archive data and therefore lack of data dynamics support. Moreover, threat models in these schemes usually assume an honest data owner and focus on detecting a dishonest cloud service provider despite the fact that clients may also misbehave. This paper proposes a public auditing scheme with data dynamics support and fairness arbitration of potential disputes. In particular, we design an index switcher to eliminate the limitation of index usage in tag computation in current schemes and achieve efficient handling of data dynamics. To address the fairness problem so that no party can misbehave without being detected, we further extend existing threat models and adopt signature exchange idea to design fair arbitration protocols, so that any possible dispute can be fairly settled. The security analysis shows our scheme is provably secure, and the performance evaluation demonstrates the overhead of data dynamics and dispute arbitration are reasonable.	antivirus software;archive;cloud computing;computation;experiment;ftc fair information practice;fairness measure;formal verification;html element;index mapping;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;provable security;retrievability;sensor;software deployment;static library;threat model	Hao Jin;Hong Jiang;Ke Zhou	2018	IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing	10.1109/TCC.2016.2525998	real-time computing;distributed computing;security analysis;computer science;retrievability;data modeling;possession (law);cloud computing;arbitration;threat model;audit	Mobile	-42.30596399619895	68.51220348114528	148240

In this paper, we present two variants of a privacyfriendly loyalty system to be used by online vendors for issuing loyalty points. The systems prevent vendors from exploiting data for the creation of customer profiles by providing unconditional unlinkability of loyalty points with regard to purchases. We propose a simple token-based approach and a counter-based approach which is much more efficient while preserving the privacy and security properties. Furthermore, the counter-based loyalty system prevents pooling of loyalty points issued to distinct customers.	blind signature;customer relationship management;privacy;purchasing	Matthias Enzmann;Markus Schneider	2004		10.1109/EEE.2004.1287337	customer to customer;loyalty business model;marketing;customer intelligence;advertising;business;customer retention;commerce;customer advocacy	Security	-44.0556204870464	71.25862512108625	148329

Our protocols for securely computing the set intersection functionality are based on secure pseudorandom function evaluations, in contrast to previous protocols that used secure polynomial evaluation. In addition to the above, we also use secure pseudorandom function evaluation in order to achieve secure pattern matching. In this case, we utilize specific properties of the Naor-Reingold pseudorandom function in order to achieve high efficiency.#R##N##R##N#Our results are presented in two adversary models. Our protocol for secure pattern matching and one of our protocols for set intersection achieve security against malicious adversaries under a relaxed definition where one corruption case is simulatable and for the other only privacy (formalized through indistinguishability) is guaranteed. We also present a protocol for set intersection that is fully simulatable in the model of covert adversaries. Loosely speaking, this means that a malicious adversary can cheat, but will then be caught with good probability.

This paradigm is aimed at organizations that lack the technical expertise or the computational resources enabling them to outsource their data mining tasks to a third party service provider. One of the main issues in this regard is the confidentiality of the valuable data at the server which the data owner considers as private. In this work, we study the problem of privacy preserving frequent itemset mining in outsourced transaction databases. We propose a novel hybrid method to achieve k-support anonymity based on statistical observations on the datasets. Our comprehensive experiments on real as well as synthetic datasets show that our techniques are effective and provide moderate privacy.	association rule learning;cloud computing;computational resource;confidentiality;data mining;database;experiment;outsourcing;privacy;programming paradigm;scalability;server (computing);synthetic data;synthetic intelligence	Iyer Chandrasekharan;Pallav K.

We highlight five categories of Privacy Enhancing Technologies ( PETS). First, we introduce the multiple virtual identities that can represent a person, and the way the person can manage them. Then, we focus on the untraceability problem, which has been a major field of research since the very first papers on privacy protection in the early eighties. Anonymous access to services will be the central point of the third category of PETSwe consider. To complete this overview, we describe the current and future authorization pets, and finish by a presentation of personal data management. For each of these categories we present some of the current technologies and the most promising ones under development.	authorization;internet;personal information management;personally identifiable information;privacy;privacy-enhancing technologies	Yves Deswarte;Carlos Aguilar Melchor	2006	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/BF03219914	privacy software;privacy by design;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;authentication;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-47.148860666974414	68.13282414548108	148841
12bc94598818cf935d9163730942e811c469fcd0	privacy increase on telecommunication processes		The telecommunication is the corner stone in the current global economic context, which requires an opening in all areas and an interaction using different communication media. To satisfy this need, several telecommunication service providers have focused on modernizing their platforms and technologies (from 2G to 5G) to support different medias such as voice, video, and data services. In such context, personal data are massively collected, stored and processed for different aims. When this huge quantity of data is not correctly protected, it became an important issue for privacy, which is considered as a human right and is protected by the law. This paper focus on the weakness in telecommunication process related to the management of personnel data. It shows how data are exposed and propose an approach to manage personnel data to preserve privacy and in the same time take benefit from the presence of this data treasure.	personally identifiable information;privacy	Siham Arfaoui;Abdelhamid Belmekki;Abdellatif Mezrioui	2018	2018 International Conference on Advanced Communication Technologies and Networking (CommNet)	10.1109/COMMNET.2018.8360266	telecommunications service;business;data as a service;telecommunications	DB	-48.08943179729179	65.42946387353012	148852

We argue that determinism of the abstracted low-security viewpoint provides the best type of property. By changing the form of abstraction mechanism we are able to model different assumptions about how systems behave, including handling the distinction between input and output actions. A detailed analysis of the nature of nondeterminism shows why certain security properties have had the paradoxical property of not being preserved by refinement – a disadvantage not shared by the determinism-based conditions. Finally we give an efficient algorithm for testing the determinism properties on a model-checker.	algorithm;confidentiality;input/output;model checking;refinement (computing)	A. W.

We propose a coding approach for multicast stream authen tication using the list-decoding property of ReedSolomon codes. We divide the data to be authenticated into a stream of packe ts nd associate a single trapdoor hash collision for everyλn packets whereλ andn are predesignated parameters. Our scheme, which is also joinable at the boundary of anyn-packet block, can be viewed as an extension of Lysyanskaya, Tama ssia and Triandopoulos’s technique in which λ = 1. We show that by choosing λ andn appropriately, our scheme outperforms theirs in time spent for processing data at the sender and receiver. Our approach relies on the dispersion process as SAIDA and eSAIDA. Assuming that we use RSA for signing and SHA256 for hashing, we give an approximation of the proportion of extra packe ts p r block which could be processed via our technique with respect to the previous schemes. As example when we pro cessλ = 1000 blocks of2650 64-byte-packets, the gain of our scheme with respect to Lysyanskaya et l.’s is about30%.	adversary (cryptography);approximation;authentication;code;collision (computer science);diffie–hellman key exchange;list decoding;multicast;network model;network packet;norm (social);sha-2;tamagotchi	Christophe Tartary;Huaxiong Wang	2007	IJSN	10.1504/IJSN.2007.013172	computer science;cryptography;information security;network model;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-41.4430611117036	73.74162202854387	148945

e4593e9d84eab369cf39752640e87fa25fc1893a	cryptanalysis of a chaotic image encryption algorithm based on information entropy		Recently, a chaotic image encryption algorithm based on information entropy (IEAIE) was proposed. This paper scrutinizes the security properties of the algorithm and evaluates the validity of the used quantifiable security metrics. When the round number is only one, the equivalent secret key of every basic operation of IEAIE can be recovered with a differential attack separately. Some common insecurity problems in the field of chaotic image encryption are found in IEAIE, e.g., the short orbits of the digital chaotic system and the invalid sensitivity mechanism built on information entropy of the plain image. Even worse, each security metric is questionable, which undermines the security credibility of IEAIE. Hence, IEAIE can only serve as a counterexample for illustrating common pitfalls in designing secure communication method for image data.

If some participant tries to cheat by submitting more than one vote, her anonymity will be lifted. In the last years, several proposals following this paradigm, including Mu and Varadharajan's, have been shown to be cryptographically weak. In this paper we first show that a recent proposal by Baseri et al. is also weak. After that, we give a general construction that, employing an offline e-coin protocol as a building block, provides an anonymous voting system following the aforementioned paradigm. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Meanwhile, it has a tremendous impact on digital content providers as well as the mobile industry that a large number of digital content have been pirated and illegally distributed. Digital Rights Management (DRM) aims at protecting digital contents from being abused through regulating their usage. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, fewer of these DRM schemes are concerned with the cost of the servers in a DRM system when the number of users scales up, and consider benefits of content providers who can be seen as tenants of a content server. In this paper, we propose CSDRM, a cloud-based SIM DRM scheme, for the mobile Internet. The SIM card is introduced into CS-DRM to both reduce the cost and provide higher security. Also, the characteristics of cloud computing enable CS-DRM to bring benefits for content providers, and well satisfy the performance requirements with low cost when the number of users increases significantly. Furthermore, we have implemented a prototype of our DRM scheme, which demonstrates that CS-DRM is efficient, secure, and practicable.	cloud computing;digital recording;digital rights management;mathematical optimization;mobile app;phosphor;prototype;requirement;server (computing);subscriber identity module;xml	Changping Wang;Peng Zou;Zhang Liu;Jianmin Wang	2011	EURASIP J.

83f27656e3928d6b1b7872309d0d8fd4efff1bb0	practical fully simulatable oblivious transfer with sublinear communication		During an adaptive k-out-of-N oblivious transfer (OT), a sender has N private documents, and a receiver wants to adaptively fetch k documents from them such that the sender learns nothing about the receiver’s selection and the receiver learns nothing more than those chosen documents. Many fully simulatable and universally composable adaptive OT schemes have been proposed, but those schemes typically require O(N) communication in the initialization phase, which yields O(N) overall communication. On the other hand, in some applications, the receiver just needs to fetch a small number of documents, so the initialization cost dominates in the entire protocol, especially for 1-outof-N OT. We propose the first fully simulatable adaptive OT with sublinear communication under the DDH assumption in the plain model. Our scheme has O(N) communication in both the initialization phase and each transfer phase. It achieves better (amortized) overall communication complexity compared to existing schemes when k = O(N).	amortized analysis;communication complexity;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;oblivious transfer	Bingsheng Zhang;Helger Lipmaa;Xinyu Wang;Kui Ren	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39884-1_8	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	Crypto	-38.797838106019384	74.29763186695898	149831

To protect data privacy, sensitive data should be encrypted by the data owner before outsourcing, which makes the traditional and efficient plaintext keyword search technique useless. The existing searchable encryption schemes support only exact or fuzzy keyword search, not support semantics-based multi-keyword ranked search. In the real search scenario, it is quite common that cloud customers' searching input might be the synonyms of the predefined keywords, not the exact or fuzzy matching keywords due to the possible synonym substitution (reproduction of information content) and/or her lack of exact knowledge about the data. Therefore, synonym-based multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data remains a very challenging problem. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an effective approach to solve the problem of synonym-based multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data. We make contributions mainly in two aspects: synonym-based search for supporting synonym query and multi-keyword ranked search for achieving more accurate search result. Two secure schemes are proposed to meet privacy requirements in two threat models of known ciphertext model and known background model. In enhanced scheme, the sensitive frequency information can be well protected by introducing some dummy keywords, which is not adopted in basic scheme. We give security analysis to justify the correctness and privacy-preserving guarantee of the proposed schemes. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate our analysis and show that our proposed solution is very efficient and effective in supporting synonym-based searching.	anaphora (linguistics);authorization;ciphertext;ciphertext-only attack;cloud computing;correctness (computer science);dummy variable (statistics);encryption;experiment;fuzzy concept;information privacy;natural language processing;outsourcing;plaintext;requirement;search algorithm;self-information;substitution (logic);threat model	Zhangjie Fu;Xingming Sun;Zhihua Xia;Lu Zhou;Jiangang Shu	2013	2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)	10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742783	frequency modulation;cloud computing;information privacy;computer science;cryptography;pattern matching;data mining;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;encryption	DB	-40.051487765299214	66.9702716175031	149999

In this chapter, we discuss the main privacy concerns that arise when releasing information to third parties.

However, in the database outsourcing paradigm, the third-party service provider is not always trustworthy, therefore, ensuring spatial query integrity is critical. In this paper, we propose an efficient road network k-nearest-neighbor query verification technique which utilizes the network Voronoi diagram and neighbors to prove the integrity of query results. Unlike previous work that verifies k-nearest-neighbor results in the Euclidean space, our approach needs to verify both the distances and the shortest paths from the query point to its kNN results on the road network. We evaluate our approach on real-world road networks together with both real and synthetic points of interest datasets. Our experiments run on Google Android mobile devices which communicate with the service provider through wireless connections. The experiment results show that our approach leads to compact verification objects (VO) and the verification algorithm on mobile devices is efficient, especially for queries with low selectivity.	android;authentication;correctness (computer science);data structure;experiment;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;location-based service;mobile device;national vulnerability database;nearest neighbor search;outsourcing;point of interest;precomputation;programming paradigm;selectivity (electronic);shortest path problem;spatial database;spatial query;synthetic intelligence;voronoi diagram	Yinan Jing;Ling Hu;Wei-Shinn Ku;Cyrus Shahabi	2014	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2013.174	voronoi diagram;computational geometry;computer science;euclidean space;location-based service;data mining;authentication;database;world wide web;outsourcing	DB	-39.70250661393051	60.8122996480054	150067

Not only the information about individuals but also about companies should be kept private. In order to satisfy the needs of both individuals and companies, corresponding privacy protection mechanisms have to be implemented. For example, systems which assist customers during their shopping process in a physical retail store require customer related information, such as the shopping list, allergy or bank account information as well as data from the retailer, like the product range and prices. In this paper, we introduce a concept for decoupling both information sources implemented in a shopping scenario, which amongst others allows Mobile Payment without the transmission of private data. The implemented prototype has been presented at a large fair to potential users in order to receive valuable feedback.	coupling (computer programming);information privacy;mobile payment;protection mechanism;prototype	Gerrit Kahl;Denise Paradowski	2013		10.1145/2451176.2451223	computer science;operating system;retail;near field communication;world wide web;mobile payment	DB	-44.98516700033146	60.90194946247489	150084

In many cases data is distributed, and bringing the data together in one place for analysis is not possible due to privacy laws (e.g. HIPAA) or policies. Privacy preserving data mining techniques have been developed to address this issue by providing mechanisms to mine the data while giving certain privacy guarantees. In this work we address the issue of privacy preserving nearest neighbor search, which forms the kernel of many data mining applications. To this end, we present a novel algorithm based on secure multiparty computation primitives to compute the nearest neighbors of records in horizontally distributed data.

Existing solutions [9,13,16,17] either adopt multiple encryption schemes for data confidentiality that only support limited operations, or focus on providing efficient retrieval with problematic update support. In this paper, we propose a secure database outsourcing scheme (SEDB) based on Shamir’s threshold secret sharing for practical confidentiality against honest-but-curious database servers. SEDB supports a set of commonly used operations, such as addition, subtraction, and comparison, and is among the first to support multiplication, division, and modulus. We implement a prototype of SEDB, and the experiment results demonstrate a reasonable processing overhead.	confidentiality;database server;multiple encryption;outsourcing;overhead (computing);prototype;secret sharing	Quanwei Cai;Jingqiang Lin;Fengjun Li;Qiongxiao Wang	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-21966-0_2	confidentiality;computer science;database;internet privacy;secret sharing;computer security;outsourcing;computer network	Security	-41.643808459725875	67.32961471457565	150453

In this paper, we address the concern of data security by introducing SECRESO, a SEcure storage model for Cloud data based on REed-SOlomon code. In our proposed model, we enhance Reed-Solomon code with an extra security layer in which a password is always required to reconstruct data from its encoded blocks in the storage. In this way, without a correct password, unauthorized users cannot see the data, and hence the data is secure. Additionally, to support fault tolerance, we also introduce a log based data recovery scheme that allows data recovery without knowing the password. In this way, even though the recovered data can be incorrect, as soon as the password is provided, information from the log can be used to correct the data.	authentication;authorization;cloud computing;cloud storage;clustered file system;computer data storage;confidentiality;data recovery;data security;distributed computing;erasure code;fault tolerance;open-source software;password;planetlab;prototype;reed–solomon error correction;secure communication;storage model;tahoe-lafs;testbed	Muhra Ahmed;Quang Hieu Vu;Rasool Asal;Hassan Al-Muhairi;Chan Yeob Yeun	2014	Electronic Commerce Research	10.1007/s10660-014-9140-9	erasure code;computer security model;zero-knowledge password proof;cloud computing security;password policy;cloud computing;computer science;security service;data security;internet privacy;one-time password;world wide web;computer security;reed–solomon error correction;password strength	DB	-42.812549622796105	67.97182238970058	150644

In this way, any two users' relationship can be quickly determined from evaluating their associated polynomials. Moreover, whenever a new user is added to or deleted from the user hierarchy, none or only some relevant polynomial needs to be updated, differing from the previously proposed schemes where the information needs to be reconstructed all over.

65e32d5c605e1d71dc4171bb1e6cee7e5f0c6e60	conquering generals: an np-hard proof of useful work		Proof of Work systems are used in cryptocurrencies to obtain consensus in distributed peer-to-peer systems that share no trust. Miners of cryptocurrency compete by engaging in the Proof of Work to solve a cryptographic challenge. The first to successfully provide a solution to the challenge wins by minting new currency. The process of mining also simultaneously prevents double-spending through the creation of an append-only distributed database known as the blockchain. The most widely adopted Proof of Work is the Hashcash scheme and the most widely deployed miners are ASIC-based. Despite the popularity of Hashcash, two issues are commonly identified its use. Firstly, the high energy consumption of the scheme is perceived as wasteful because the solutions found provide no useful output, and secondly, the computational complexity class of the scheme is not formally known. Based on these deficiencies, we propose a novel Proof of Work system which achieves the following goals:  - to provide a fiscally incentivized platform for algorithm research that aims to optimize an NP-Hard computational problem. This provides indirect insight into the P Versus NP Clay Institute Millennium problem, thus providing useful output.  - to construct a challenge within a known hard computational complexity class.  - to ensure the Proof of Work created is inclusive of ASIC hardware. Our proposal is a hybrid Proof of Work system that initially uses the Hashcash scheme and which subsequently constructs an instance of the NP-Hard Travelling Salesman Problem. We build on the ambitions of others to develop Proofs of Useful Work. We differentiate our paper from related work as the first to consider the current capital investment into ASIC hardware, thus including them in our proposal.	algorithm;append;application-specific integrated circuit;complexity class;computation;computational complexity theory;computational problem;cryptocurrency;cryptography;distributed database;double-spending;hashcash;mathematical optimization;millennium prize problems;np-hardness;p versus np problem;peer-to-peer;proof-of-work system;travelling salesman problem;while;work systems	Angelique Faye Loe;Elizabeth A.

When a pirated copy of the material is observed, a traitor tracing scheme should allow to identify at least one of the real subscribers (traitors) who participate in the construction of a pirated copy. In this paper, we focus on the pay-per-view type of subscription-based scenarios, in which materials are divided into multiple segments and each segment has multiple variations. We present a systematic way to assign the variations for each segment and for each subscriber using an error-correcting code. We give sufficient conditions for a code to be able to trace at least a traitor when faced with a coalition of m traitors. We also prove that these sufficient conditions are also necessary when the code is an MDS code.	brute-force attack;code word;concatenation;cryptography;forward error correction;internet;overhead (computing);qr code;requirement;singleton bound;traceability;traitor tracing	Hongxia Jin;Jeffrey B.

The mechanism of Web services technology naturally provides a platform for deploying mobile agent technology. Therefore, the integration of the mobile agent technology and Web Service technology has been actively investigated in recent years. On the other hand, the security issues of the integration system have not drawn much attention. In this paper, we present a new security architecture for the integration of mobile agent and the Web services technology. This architecture provides a new authentication scheme for Web service provider to verify the mobile agent owner's identity by employing an identity-based signature protocol without using the username/password pair, which is infeasible for mobile agent. We also propose a new Web services and mobile agent system confidentiality protocol, which provides an alternative method to current security mechanisms without using certification authorities (CA) based public key infrastructure. With this scheme, it can simplify the key management and reduce the computation load particularly for group-oriented web services. In addition, this scheme also inherently has the non-repudiation property.	algorithm;authentication;authorization;certificate authority;computation;computer security;confidentiality;e-services;key management;mobile agent;non-repudiation;password;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;security service (telecommunication);user (computing);ws-security;web service;world wide web	Junqi Zhang;Yan Wang;Vijay Varadharajan	2007	IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA '07)	10.1109/SOCA.2007.29	web service;web application security;web development;web modeling;mobile search;mobile web;computer science;information security;ws-policy;mobile technology;mobile agent;database;mobile business development;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;web server	Mobile	-47.080701481121146	65.71427069611298	151405

This API controls access to the tamper-resistant Hardware Security Modules where PIN encryption, decryption and verification takes place. The attacks are differential attacks, whereby an attacker gains information about the plaintext values of encrypted customer PINs by making changes to the non-confidential inputs to a command. Our proposed fix adds an integrity check to the parameters passed to the command. It is novel in that it involves very little change to the existing ATM network infrastructure.	64-bit computing;atm turbo;application programming interface;brute-force search;card security code;computer security;confidentiality;coprocessor;crypto++;declassification;differential cryptanalysis;encryption;exclusive or;hardware security module;ibm 4758;lecture notes in computer science;pci-x;personal identification number;plaintext;qr code;tamper resistance;theoretical computer science	Riccardo Focardi;Flaminia L.

faf32fff916069ff0021f7120d2c6b95c1398c82	efficient and privacy-aware attribute-based data sharing in mobile cloud computing		In the era of cloud computing, it is convenient to share large-scale data among various kinds of users. As a kind of attribute-based encryption, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a potential technique for realizing fine-grained access control on shared data. However, traditional CP-ABE is not suitable for mobile cloud computing, where mobile users are resource-limited and privacy is fragile. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-aware attribute-based data sharing system supporting offline key generation and offline encryption. In the proposed system, sensitive attribute values specified in an access structure are not explicitly sent along with a ciphertext. The online/offline encryption mechanism alleviates the computational burden of mobile users by performing most of encryption tasks without draining the battery. In addition, the online/offline key generation mechanism allows the attribute authority to finish most of operations in the key generation process in advance, which enables efficient mobile user registration. Finally, the proposed system is proven fully secure in the standard model and performance analysis shows its effectiveness in mobile cloud computing.	mobile cloud computing	Yinghui Zhang;Axin Wu;Dong Zheng	2018	J.

The increasing capacity of the power storages in the electric vehicles (EV) motivates this concept and makes it more feasible. However, the privacy of the customers can be compromised by tracing the stations that an EV has been connected to during a period of the time. The stations that are providing power charging as well as purchasing the power back from EVs can be owned by third party businesses. EVs should be authenticated through these stations in order to give or receive appropriate credit for the power. In this paper, we identify potential privacy issues and propose a robust privacy-preserving authentication scheme for communication of the EV and the station to prevent customer information leakage. In our approach, the EV and the station communication utilizes pseudonym of the EV, in which only the smart grid server (a trusted entity) can map the pseudonym to the real vehicle identity and provide the identity management. The pseudonym of an EV changes when the EV moves from one station to another, which prevents the adversary from tracing foot prints of the EV. Our analysis shows that our model is robust enough to make sure the privacy of the customers is fully preserved, and at the same time, it is efficient by consuming very limited resources.	adversary (cryptography);authentication;columbia (supercomputer);extended validation certificate;identity management;information leakage;privacy;purchasing;scalability;scheduling (computing);server (computing);spectral leakage	Hasen Nicanfar;Seyedali Hosseininezhad;Peyman TalebiFard;Victor C.

2d0daef861ce2973a57b2b642a839acc8ac23807	towards a fine-grained privacy-enabled attribute-based access control mechanism		Due to the rapid development of large scale and big data systems, attribute-based access control (ABAC) model has inaugurated a new wave in the research field of access control. In this paper, we propose a novel and comprehensive mechanism for enforcing attribute-based security policies stored in JSON documents. We build a lightweight grammar for conditional expressions that are the combination of subject, resource, and environment attributes so that the policies are flexible, dynamic and fine grained. Besides, we also present an extension from the ABAC model for privacy protection with the approach of purpose usage. The notion of purpose is associated with levels of data disclosure and constraints to support more fine-grained privacy policies. A prototype built for the proposed model using Java and MongoDB has also presented in the paper. The experiment is carried out to illustrate the relationship between the processing time for access decision and the complexity of policies.	access control	Que Nguyet Tran Thi;Tran Khanh Dang	2017	T.

Therefore, it is necessary to have a secure authentication scheme to protect transactions between users and servers from illegal adversaries. Especially, users are people vulnerable to attacks and there are many authentication schemes with smart cards proposed to guarantee them. Recently, Chen et al have proposed a scheme integrated with fingerprint of users to enhance security for authentication. With this idea, Chen et al.'s scheme truly is more secure than previous ones. However, their scheme is easy to be compromised by replay attack. Furthermore, attackers can steal identity to re-register to obtain secret key to fake users and servers. In this paper, we present an improvement to their scheme in order to isolate such problems.	biometrics;cryptosystem;denial-of-service attack;electronic funds transfer;entity–relationship model;fingerprint;key (cryptography);mobile device;mutual authentication;password cracking;polynomial-time approximation scheme;replay attack;server (computing);smart card	Toan-Thinh Truong;Minh Tran;Anh Duc Duong	2012	2012 IEEE 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2012.47	smart card;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-45.53311888364966	73.53591452475695	152283

Users generate a high volume of biomedical data during health monitoring, which can be used by the mHealth server for training predictive models for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, the biomedical sensing data raise serious privacy concerns because they reveal sensitive information such as health status and lifestyles of the sensed subjects. This paper proposes and experimentally studies a scheme that keeps the training samples private while enabling accurate construction of predictive models. We specifically consider logistic regression models which are widely used for predicting dichotomous outcomes in healthcare, and decompose the logistic regression problem into small subproblems over two types of distributed sensing data, i.e., horizontally partitioned data and vertically partitioned data. The subproblems are solved using individual private data, and thus mHealth users can keep their private data locally and only upload (encrypted) intermediate results to the mHealth server for model training. Experimental results based on real datasets show that our scheme is highly efficient and scalable to a large number of mHealth users.	computation;converge;convergence (action);distributed computing;encryption;experiment;information privacy;information sensitivity;logistic regression;mhealth;mobile health;overhead (computing);personally identifiable information;predictive modelling;scalability;server (computer);server (computing);support vector machine;upload;sensor (device)	Yuanxiong Guo;Yuguang Fang;Yuanxiong Guo	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics	10.1109/TCBB.2016.2515610	logistics;computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;predictive modelling;logistic regression;computational model;world wide web;server;biosensor	ML	-37.555272089384324	62.286620246371164	152324

To protect the privacy of outsourced data, cloud service providers should not be able to view or use the data. This paper proposes DISC, a retrieval scheme to answer range queries over databases on the Cloud Service Provider. DISC protects the confidentiality and supports dynamic updates on the outsourced data. To be able to support queries and updates on the Cloud Service Provider, the database index is encrypted using Order-Preserving Encryption. This way, DISC achieves a balance between efficient query execution and data confidentiality in a cloud environment. The security analysis section studies the confidentiality provided by DISC. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed scheme has a lower communication cost in comparison to existing cloud retrieval schemes.	cloud computing;confidentiality;database index;emergence;encryption;experiment;outsourcing;range query (data structures);range query (database);scalability;spatial database	Ayesha M.

By changing the external force, different methods of modification can be obtained. The method based on least square, which results from applying no force, is local and simpler, but the modified shape seems less smooth. While the method based on global deformation, which is more complicated by adding synthetic spring force, can give more natural and smooth results.	b-spline;computation;finite element method;spline (mathematics);synthetic intelligence	Siyuan Cheng;Xiangwei Zhang;Kelun Tang	2007	2007 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS 2007)	10.1109/CIS.2007.43	computer security model;data authentication algorithm;computer science;information security;national security;authentication protocol;public key infrastructure;computational intelligence;provable security;authentication;cryptographic protocol;session initiation protocol;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;pre-shared key;computer security;web server;computer network	Robotics	-44.76748454148138	74.4862273599197	152717

In this setting, privacy preserving protocols are useful to enable the offering of personalized online services, thus preventing the unnecessary disclosure of personal data. A problem often neglected in privacy-preserving protocols is the need to ensure that processed signals, which are often recorded by non-expert consumers, are of sufficient quality, hence raising the need for solutions that assess the quality of the recorded signals to guarantee correct (medical) decisions. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving protocol that assesses signal quality and combines this with a linear classifier used to decide whether the measured signal is of high enough quality or not. In particular, the protocol computes a frame based Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR) from the original signal and a filtered version of the signal itself; evaluates the mean and the variance of the SNRs obtained and computes the overall signal SNR. Finally these measures are combined with a linear classifier used to assess the quality of the signal. The proposed scheme relies on a hybrid multi-party computation protocol based on Homomorphic Encryption and Yao's Garbled Circuits. The analysis of the protocol indicates that it needs the transmission of less than 4~MBytes of data to analyze 30 seconds of ECG signals providing a classification accuracy close to 85%.	algorithm;computation;dhrystone;dolev–yao model;e-services;homomorphic encryption;linear classifier;local-density approximation;microsoft windows;personalization;personally identifiable information;principal component analysis;privacy;property (philosophy);signal-to-noise ratio;test set;yao graph	Riccardo Lazzeretti;Jorge Guajardo;Mauro Barni	2012		10.1145/2361407.2361435	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-42.88717787856013	64.75028224674062	153267

To implement this without modifying existing components, we make use of the Aspect-Oriented Programming technique.	authentication;authorization;grid computing	Hyunjoon Jung;Hyuck Han;Hyungsoo Jung;Heon Young Yeom	2008	IJCIS	10.1504/IJCIS.2008.017443	aspect-oriented programming;computer science;information security;authentication;database;world wide web;computer security	HPC	-35.48952077955213	61.50295162436898	153340
1cab3dbca9fcc5e98d30b38a289ec98009f69b67	mpcs: an account-based secure mobile payment consortia system for educational institutions	secure communication;mobile payment;open standard;public key infrastructure;mobile user	Mobile Payment services have become an essential for every human being at the personal level and professional level. To create global and open standard solutions for mobile payments, there are number of consortia that have taken the initiatives. However, none of the consortia is widely accepted due to lack of security and many companies participate in more than one consortium. The current status of the consortia is at infancy stage. A study reveals that there is no specific and global mobile payment consortium for educational institu- tions to collect the fees as well as for student community to pay the fees. To overcome, an innovative model has been proposed namely, Mobile Payment Consortia System which provides an end-to-end security among the mobile user, institution, MPCS server and the institution bank using Public Key Infra- structure (PKI). This paper mainly focuses on secure communication between the mobile user and the payment gateway namely, MPCS Server.	mobile payment	S. Britto R. Kumar;S.

e4526552ca12f84dc247b981ddbae7b07b005a9f	social-aware privacy-preserving correlated data collection		We study a privacy-preserving data collection problem, by jointly considering data reportersu0027 data correlation and social relationship. A data collector gathers data from individuals to perform a certain analysis with a privacy-preserving mechanism. Due to data correlation, the data analysis based on the reported data can cause privacy leakage to other individuals (even if they do not report data). The data reporters will take such a privacy threat into account, owing to the social relationship among individuals. This motivates us to formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game: In Stage I, the data collector selects some individuals as data reporters and designs a privacy-preserving mechanism for a sum query analysis. In Stage II, the selected data reporters contribute their data with possible perturbations (through adding noise). By analyzing the data reportersu0027 equilibrium decisions in Stage II, we show that given any fixed reporter set, only one data reporter with the most significant joint consideration of the social relationship and data correlation may add noise to his reported data. The rest of the data reporters will truthfully report their data. In Stage I, we derive the data collectoru0027s optimal privacy-preserving mechanism and propose an efficient algorithm to select the data reporters. We conclude that the data collector should jointly capture the impact of data correlation and social relation to ensure all data reporters truthfully reporting their data. We conduct extensive simulations based on random network and real-world social data to investigate the impact of data correlation and social network on the system. We find that the availability of social network information is more critical to the data collector compared with data correlation information.	algorithm;game theory;image noise;interaction;interrupts in 65xx processors;logistic regression;markov chain;markov random field;privacy;random graph;simulation;social inequality;social network;spectral leakage;universal quantification;verification and validation	Guocheng Liao;Xu Chen;Jianwei Huang	2018		10.1145/3209582.3209584	data mining;data collection;social relation;stackelberg competition;distributed computing;social network;random graph;computer science	ML	-37.02991300058958	63.708170153784394	153375

6d714dad0d2903350cd5153c59a2ac4f68672232	verifiable oblivious storage		We formalize the notion of Verifiable Oblivious Storage (VOS), where a client outsources the storage of data to a server while ensuring data confidentiality, access pattern privacy, and integrity and freshness of data accesses. VOS generalizes the notion of Oblivious RAM (ORAM) in that it allows the server to perform computation, and also explicitly considers data integrity and freshness. We show that allowing server-side computation enables us to construct asymptotically more efficient VOS schemes whose bandwidth overhead cannot be matched by any ORAM scheme, due to a known lower bound by Goldreich and Ostrovsky. Specifically, for large block sizes we can construct a VOS scheme with constant bandwidth per query; further, answering queries requires only poly-logarithmic server computation. We describe applications of VOS to Dynamic Proofs of Retrievability, and RAM-model secure multi-party computation.	confidentiality;data integrity;oblivious ram;overhead (computing);random-access memory;replay attack;retrievability;secure multi-party computation;server (computing);server-side	Daniel Christopher Apon;Jonathan Katz;Elaine Shi;Aishwarya Thiruvengadam	2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-54631-0_8	computer science;theoretical computer science;database;distributed computing;computer security	Security	-40.01739238201484	68.44790845255605	153451

Due to limitations of the SLAs in this direction, the challenge is to build mechanisms that provides data security by design and assures data nondisclosure protection implicitly. In this paper we present an evaluation of the Data Confidentiality in Cloud Storage using a brute-force setup with the aim of studying its effectiveness. Through experimentation on the CloudSim environment we found that the probability of unauthorized data reconstruction can be exponentially decreased by using a sufficiently large number of chunks. Also, increasing the number of used storage volumes leads to a linear decrease of unauthorized data reconstruction.	brute-force attack;cloud storage;confidentiality;secret sharing	Alexandru Butoi;Mircea Moca;Nicolae Tomai	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-18491-3_13	internet privacy;proactive secret sharing;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-42.59577543844759	67.72859240781699	153749

In this context, keeping data secure from malicious external adversaries (the security problem) and limiting the leakage of personal data (the privacy problem) are important problems with tremendous societal impact. Traditionally, data security is ensured via cryptographic techniques. However, emerging systems require security and privacy mechanisms at all levels, from transmission to storage to access, which thus requires information protection techniques beyond traditional cryptography. The aim of this special issue of IEEE Signal Processing Magazine is to examine information security and privacy methods that complement traditional cryptographic services. The articles chosen survey the challenges associated with achieving security and privacy in both communications networks as well as distributed systems and identify signal processing approaches to protect information. Throughout this special issue are articles covering security and privacy, and thus it is worthwhile to differentiate between the two as privacy and security are related and often conflated. However, there are distinct differences: while the focus in security problems is on keeping data safe from malicious and illegitimate users, the privacy problem is concerned with curtailing inadvertent leakage or inference of correlated private information during a legitimate information transaction. This special issue seeks to provide a venue for ongoing research on the signal and information processing approaches to the security and privacy problems. We received a total of 34 manuscripts, out of which eight high-quality articles were selected for publication after rigorous peer reviews.

This mechanism uses minute patterns of human body parts as biometric information. Minimization of the biometric information used for the authentication enables the mechanism to satisfy the following three requirements needed for biometric authentication systems: (i) higher tolerance against a masquerade attack, (ii) consideration of the issue of traceability, and (iii) higher authentication accuracy. As a first attempt, we developed a micro biometric authentication system that uses minute patterns of human skin texture. Experimental results showed that the system can achieve an EER of about 0.5% and that the mechanism satisfies all three requirements."""	authentication;biometrics;enhanced entity–relationship model;requirement;spoofing attack;traceability	Masahiro Fujita;Yuto Mano;Takuya Kaneko;Kenta Takahashi;Masakatsu Nishigaki	2016	2016 19th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems (NBiS)	10.1109/NBiS.2016.13	internet privacy;computer security;biometrics	Mobile	-46.01159338441132	70.10613610727617	153863

To meet its demands, organizations apply privacy-enhancing technologies and identity management to their business processes. But the increasing number of privacy breaches shows that this task is complex and not well understood. In this position paper, a formal method for modeling an proving information privacy within a process model is envisioned. Such a model would allow an integration at process design, increase the understanding and effectiveness of the privacy protection mechanisms, and enable compliance checks and data protection auditing. Acknowledgment: This research work was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of the Federal Republic of Germany (Funding-Id: 01|S08016B). 1 Information Privacy in Business Processes With the shift from a paper-based to a digital information society, collection and processing of data have become much easier and very fast. Without the proper carefulness, information easily can be used for purposes they are neither intended for nor permitted to. This problem is documented by the increasing number of incidents regarding data leakages, missuses of personal data and even identity thefts. Like in the latest incident, where a secret file of the US-Army was found by a civilian on an second-hand mp3-player, often the reason is the missing awareness in using non-confidential communication channels. This results in loss of control on information flow and enables data misuse and theft. A predictable and comprehensible information flow could avoid such incidents or even aids investigation. We call this information privacy. Reasonable information privacy requires at least reconcilement of privacy and accountability of a data subject’s electronic interaction (empowering the data subject in its self-determination) [CSS05] and a privacy-aware identity and information lifecycle management within the data processing organizations (including compliance, data protection, and access control) [MB07]. Both depend on the underlying business processes and the involved information privacy techniques. 1In January 2009, the New Zealand news channel One News gets possession of a 60 page long file containing name and contact information of US-Soldiers, details on equipment, and other secret information. The file was stored on an mp3-player bought at a second-hand shop by a civilian.	access control;acknowledgment index;business process;confidentiality;digital data;formal methods;identity management;information privacy;mp3;personally identifiable information;privacy-enhancing technologies;process modeling;protection mechanism	Ralph Herkenhöner;Hermann de Meer	2009			computer science;systems engineering;creatine;creatine kinase;adenosine diphosphate;data mining;reagent;phosphate;chromatography	DB	-46.9207849945952	61.840733470098506	153896

Currently, most of those jobs are done in the centralised cloud. However, with rapidly increasing number of devices and amount of produced data, edge computing represents a much more efficient solution decreasing the cost, the delay and improves users’ privacy. To enable wide deployment of execution nodes at the edge, the requesting devices require a way to pay for submitted tasks. We present SPOC a secure payment system for networks where nodes distrust each other. SPOC allows any node to execute tasks, includes result verification and enforce users’ proper behaviour without 3rd parties, replication or costly proofs of computations. We implement our system using Ethereum Smart Contracts and Intel SGX and present first evaluation proving its security and low usage cost.	adversary (cryptography);centralisation;cloud computing;computation;cost efficiency;distrust;edge computing;ethereum;job stream;outsourcing;overhead (computing);secure mobile payment service;small private online course;smart contract;software deployment;trusted execution environment	Michal Król;Ioannis Psaras	2018	CoRR		computer security;computer science;payment system;payment;software deployment;outsourcing;computation;distributed computing;cloud computing;distrust;edge computing	Security	-42.04295238116155	66.80641482406226	154160
9a0e4d8ca94da8563a66a063a54cd1970fd05ce2	scs: koanlogic's secure cookie sessions for http		This document provides an overview of SCS, a small cryptographic protocol layered on top of the HTTP cookie facility, that allows its users to produce and consume authenticated and encrypted cookies, as opposed to usual cookies, which are un-authenticated and sent in clear text. An interesting property, rising naturally from the given confidentiality and authentication properties, is that by using SCS cookies, it is possible to avoid storing the session state material on the server side altogether. In fact, an SCS cookie presented by the user agent to the origin server can always be validated (i.e. possibly recognized as self-produced, untampered material) and, as such, be used to safely restore application state. Hence, typical use cases may include devices with little or no storage offering some functionality via an HTTP interface, as well as web applications with high availability or load balancing requirements which would prefer to handle application state without the need to synchronize the pool through shared storage or peering. Nevertheless, its security properties allow SCS to be used whenever the privacy and integrity of cookies is a concern, by paying an affordable price in terms of increased cookie size, additional CPU clock cycles needed by the symmetric key encryption and HMAC algorithms, and related key management, which can be made a nearly transparent task.

We design a recursive version of Matrix ORAM, where data addresses are stored on the server instead of client, and are recursively accessed with revealing important information.

The presented framework utilizes XML security concept, PKI cryptosystem and an XML-based metadata embedding approach mainly to address the problem of information leakage which may happen through employees of a company (also known as the insider threat). By utilizing the above-mentioned techniques, our suggested framework wraps the confidential documents with an additional layer of security meta-data that can be investigated in critical network points of an organization to prevent illegal data distribution. This solution also can guarantee data confidentiality, integrity, and support for non-repudiation. We believe our suggested model can effectively prevent intentional or unintentional data leak incidents.	authorization;confidentiality;cryptosystem;data breach;information leakage;insider threat;non-repudiation;public key infrastructure;spectral leakage;xml	Kamran Morovati;Sanjay Kadam;Ali Ghorbani	2016	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2016.02.003	confidentiality;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-48.261733571400576	60.68529235711552	155001

Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) provides fine-grained access control of encrypted data in the cloud; in a CP-ABE scheme, an access structure, also referred to as ciphertext-policy, is sent along with a ciphertext explicitly, and anyone who obtains a ciphertext can know the access structure associated with the ciphertext. In certain applications, access structures contain very sensitive information and must be protected from everyone except the users whose private key attributes satisfy the access structures. In this paper, we propose a new model for CP-ABE with partially hidden access structure (See Figure 2). In our model, each attribute consists of two parts: an attribute name and its value; if the private key attributes of a user do not satisfy the access structure associated with a ciphertext, the specific attribute values of the access structure are hidden, while other information about the access structure is public. Based on the CP-ABE scheme proposed by Lewko and Waters [1] recently, we then present a concrete construction of CP-ABE with partially hidden access structure and prove that it is fully secure in the standard model. In addition, we discuss how our new model can be employed to construct a privacy-preserving electronic medical record system in the cloud environment.

86368625dfe981e348ccc0cccd9b111b93b1cd4b	key derivation policy for data security and data integrity in cloud computing		Cloud computing is currently emerging as a promising next-generation architecture in the Information Technology (IT) industry and education sector. The encoding process of state information from the data and protection are governed by the organizational access control policies. An encryption technique protects the data confidentiality from the unauthorized access leads to the development of fine-grained access control policies with user attributes. The Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) verifies the intersection of attributes to the multiple sets. The handling of adding or revoking the users is difficult with respect to changes in policies. The inclusion of multiple encrypted copies for the same key raised the computational cost. This paper proposes an efficient Key Derivation Policy (KDP) for improvement of data security and integrity in the cloud and overcomes the problems in traditional methods. The local key generation process in proposed method includes the data attributes. The secret key is generated from the combination of local keys with the user attribute by a hash function. The original text is recovered from the ciphertext by the decryption process. The key sharing between data owner and user validates the data integrity referred MAC verification process. The proposed efficient KDP with MAC verification analyze the security issues and compared with the Cipher Text–Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) schemes on the performance parameters of encryption time, computational overhead and the average lifetime of key generation. The major advantage of proposed approach is the updating of public information and easy handling of adding/revoking of users in the cloud.	access control;algorithmic efficiency;applied cryptography and network security;attribute-based encryption;authorization;cipher;ciphertext;cloud computing;confidentiality;data integrity;data security;distributed computing;elisa bertino;entity–relationship model;hicss;hash function;holographic principle;icdcs;key (cryptography);key generation;mobile cloud computing;multi-user;overhead (computing);pp (complexity);search algorithm;springer (tank)	P.

The advantages of this approach are that the analysis is quantitative, and therefore capable of expressing partial leakage, and that proofs are performed using the HOL4 theorem-prover, and are therefore guaranteed to be logically and mathematically consistent with the formalization. The applicability of this methodology to proving privacy properties of Privacy Enhancing Technologies is demonstrated by proving the anonymity of the Dining Cryptographers protocol. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first machine-verified proof of privacy of the Dining Cryptographers protocol for an unbounded number of participants and a quantitative metric for privacy.	automated theorem proving;dining cryptographers problem;hol (proof assistant);information theory;list of cryptographers;privacy;privacy-enhancing technologies;spectral leakage	Aaron Richard Coble	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-70630-4_6	privacy software;computer science;theoretical computer science;cryptographic protocol;automated theorem proving;computer security;algorithm	Security	-36.35762240763168	72.15870664669755	155419

This paper presents a novel approach for cancelable biometric authentication using random multiplicative transform. The proposed method transforms the original biometric feature vector through element-wise multiplication with a random vector, and the sorted index numbers of the resulting vector in the transformed domain are stored as the biometric template. The changeability and privacy protecting properties of the generated biometric template are analyzed in detail. The effectiveness of the proposed method is well supported by extensive experimentation on a face verification problem.	authentication;biometrics;facial recognition system;feature vector;privacy;software deployment;software verification	Yongjin Wang;Dimitrios Hatzinakos	2010	2010 20th International Conference on Pattern Recognition	10.1109/ICPR.2010.314	facial recognition system;information privacy;computer science;machine learning;data mining;internet privacy;computer security;biometrics;signature recognition	Vision	-37.75252967680721	69.71981362898701	155468

We propose a service- oriented privacy-preserving model for data integration across autonomous clouds. Our model allows to execute aggregations of cloud data sharing services without revealing any extra information to any of the involved services. Thus, involved services enforce locally their privacy policies by applying their own access control models and data anonymization algorithms. We illustrate lack of data protection in current data sources through examples of querying data in a healthcare system.	access control;aggregate function;algorithm;autonomous robot;data anonymization;identifier;information privacy;information sensitivity;privacy policy	Samer Abdul Ghafour;Parisa Ghodous;Christine Bonnet	2015	2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing	10.1109/CLOUD.2015.160	privacy software;service;cloud computing;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;data virtualization;data integration;operating system;data mining;services computing;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web	DB	-43.001053481373006	61.29183853118032	155606
43b8336a4239f0f29f7e6d8459716e656e0c417c	minimum cost rule enforcement for cooperative database access		In this paper, we consider restricted data sharing between a set of parties that wish to provide some set of online services requiring such data sharing. Each party is assumed to store its data in private relational databases, and is given a set of mutually agreed set of authorization rules that specify access to attributes over individual relations or joins over relations owned by one or more parties. The access restrictions introduce significant additional complexity in rule enforcement and query planning as compared with a traditional distributed database environment. We examine the problem of minimum cost rule enforcement which simultaneously checks for the enforceability of each rule and generation of minimum cost plan of its execution. However, the paper is not focused on specific cost functions, but instead of efficient methods for enforcing rules in the face of access restrictions and inter-party data transfer needs. We propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for this minimal enforcement since the exact problem is NP-hard. In some cases, it is not possible to enforce the rules with the regular parties only. In such cases, we need help of trusted third parties (TPs). If all parties trust a single TP, such a party can enforce all unenforced rules, but it is desirable to use the TP minimally. We also consider the extended case where multiple TPs are required since not every regular party can trust a single TP.	algorithm;authorization;automated planning and scheduling;collaborative software;distributed database;e-services;gloss (annotation);heuristic (computer science);join (sql);np-hardness;outsourcing;privacy;relational database;rule 184;sensor;trusted third party	Meixing Le;Krishna Kant;Malek Athamnah;Sushil Jajodia	2016	Journal of Computer Security	10.3233/JCS-160548	data mining;database;computer security	DB	-38.61386958332299	66.74651648427952	155647

The nature of the proxy representation is dependent on the nature of the desired data mining to be undertaken. Secure collaborative clustering is considered where the (varPhi )-data is in the form of a Super Secure Chain Distance Matrices (SSCDM) encrypted using a proposed Multi-User Order Preserving Encryption (MUOPE) scheme. SSCDMs can be produced with respect to horizontal and vertical data partitioning. The DBSCAN clustering algorithm is adopted for illustrative and evaluation purposes. The results indicate that the proposed solution is efficient and produces comparable clustering configurations to those produced using an unencrypted, “standard”, algorithm; while maintaining data privacy and security.	cluster analysis;encryption;multi-user	Nawal Almutairi;Frans Coenen;Keith Dures	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-04191-5_1	multi-user;data mining;encryption;cluster analysis;horizontal and vertical;information privacy;dbscan;computer science;distance matrices in phylogeny	Crypto	-38.97982531185563	65.35393341794376	156018

Whilst the output of typical online signature verification systems are threshold-based true-false decisions, based on a comparison between test sample signals and sets of reference signals, our system responds to a signature input with a biometric hash vector, which is calculated based on an individual interval matrix. Especially for applications, which require key management strategies (e.g. e-Commerce, smart cards), hash values are of great interest, as keys can be derived directly from the hash value, whereas a verification decision can only grant or refuse access to a stored key. Further, our new approach does not require storage of templates for reference signatures, thus increases the security of the system. In our prototype implementation, the generated biometric hash values are calculated on a pen-based PDA and used for key generation for a future secure data communication between a PDA and a server by encryption. First tests show that the system is actually able to generate stable biometric hash values of the users and although the system was exposed to skilled forgeries, no test person was able to reproduce another subject’s hash vector. During tests, we were able to tune the system to a FAR of 0% at a FRR level of 7.05%.	antivirus software;biometrics;digital signature;e-commerce;encryption;hash function;key generation;key management;personal digital assistant;prototype;server (computing);smart card;while	Claus Vielhauer;Ralf Steinmetz;Astrid Mayerhöfer	2002		10.1109/ICPR.2002.1044628	feature hashing;smart card;hash function;speech recognition;feature extraction;sha-2;computer science;machine learning;key management;hash chain;handwriting recognition;world wide web;computer security;cryptographic hash function;signature recognition	Security	-44.259787107227694	69.98951867722344	156043
64deb76c3315f2a364df4d4e37aa328ff92d6223	dps-discuss: demonstrating decentralized, pseudonymous, sybil-resistant communication		A current trend on the Internet is the increasing surveillance of its users. A few big service providers have divided most of the user-facing Internet between them, observing and recording the activities of their users to increase profits. Additionally, government agencies have been found to practice mass surveillance.  With regard to this it becomes even more important to provide online services that protect the privacy of their users and avoid censorship by single, powerful entities. To reach these goals, a trusted third party should be avoided. A prototype service which fulfills these goals is DPS-Discuss, a decentralized, pseudonymous online discussion application. It uses the libraries BitNym and Peer-Tor-Peer for pseudonym management and anonymous communication.	e-services;entity;internet;library (computing);pictbridge;privacy;prototype;pseudonymity;tor messenger;trusted third party	Sebastian Friebe;Martin Florian	2017		10.1145/3123878.3131991	online discussion;service provider;the internet;computer network;computer science;trusted third party;internet privacy;pseudonymity;computer security;government;censorship	Security	-46.147697477642346	61.08693664866377	156063

This paper presents predecryption as a method of providing this security with less overhead by using well-known prefetching techniques to retrieve data from memory and perform decryption before it is needed by the processor. Our results, tested mostly on SPEC 2000 benchmarks, show that using our predecryption scheme can actually result in no increase in execution time despite an extra 128 cycle decryption latency per memory block access.	benchmark (computing);cpu cache;encryption;input/output (c++);overhead (computing);run time (program lifecycle phase)	Brian Rogers;Yan Solihin;Milos Prvulovic	2005	SIGARCH Computer Architecture News	10.1145/1055626.1055631	multiple encryption;uniform memory access;attack;parallel computing;40-bit encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;information security;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;extended memory;flat memory model;computer security;encryption;tamper resistance;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption;memory management	Arch	-36.259701779606054	66.52646167735026	156465

VANETs are negatively affected by any malicious user’s behaviors, such as bogus information and replay attacks on the disseminated messages. Among various security threats, privacy preservation is one of the new challenges of protecting users’ private information. Existing authentication protocols to secure VANETs raise challenges, such as certificate distribution and reduction of the strong reliance on tamper-proof devices. In 2011, Yeh et al. proposed a PAACP: a portable privacy-preserving authentication and access control protocol in vehicular ad hoc networks. However, PAACP in the authorization phase is breakable and cannot maintain privacy in VANETs. In this paper, we present a cryptanalysis of an attachable blind signature and demonstrate that the PAACP’s authorized credential (AC) is not secure and private, even if the AC is secretly stored in a tamper-proof device. An eavesdropper can construct an AC from an intercepted blind document. Any eavesdropper can determine who has which access privileges to access which service. For this reason, this paper copes with these challenges and proposes an efficient scheme. We conclude that an improving authentication scheme and access control protocol for VANETs not only resolves the problems that have appeared, but also is more secure and efficient.

Access control mechanism in healthcare services characterises authorising users to access EHR records. Role Based Access Control helps to restrict EHRs to users in a certain role. Significant works have been carried out for access control since last one decade but little emphasis has been given to on-demand role based access control. Presented work achieved access control through physical data isolation which is more robust and secure. We propose an algorithm in which selective combination of policies for each user of the EHR database has been defined. We extend well known data mining technique 'classification' to group EHRs with respect to the given role. Algorithm works by taking various roles as class and defined their features as a vector. Here, features are used as a Feature Vector for classification to describe user authority.

Based on the RSA signature scheme, a new digital contract signing protocol is proposed in this paper. Like the existing RSA-based solutions for the same problem, our protocol is not only fair, but also optimistic, since the third trusted party is involved only in the situations where one party is cheating or the communication channel is interrupted. Furthermore, the proposed protocol satisfies a new property, i.e., it is abuse-free. That is, if the protocol is executed unsuccessfully, none of the two parties can show the validity of intermediate results to others. Technical details are provided to analyze the security and performance of the proposed protocol. In summary, we present the first abuse-free fair contract signing protocol based on the RSA signature, and show that it is both secure and efficient.	antivirus software;channel (communications);communications protocol;digital signature;interrupt;rsa (cryptosystem)	Guilin Wang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1145/1060745.1060807	e-commerce;digital signature;computer science;information security;cryptographic protocol;internet privacy;blind signature;computer security;computer network	Security	-42.86934978097371	72.8174336076415	156630

Storage nodes are responsible for storing data from nearby sensor nodes and answering queries from Sink. It is critical to protect data security from a compromised storage node. In this paper, the Communication-efficient Secure Range Query (CSRQ)-a privacy and integrity preserving range query protocol-is proposed to prevent attackers from gaining information of both data collected by sensor nodes and queries issued by Sink. To preserve privacy and integrity, in addition to employing the encoding mechanisms, a novel data structure called encrypted constraint chain is proposed, which embeds the information of integrity verification. Sink can use this encrypted constraint chain to verify the query result. The performance evaluation shows that CSRQ has lower communication cost than the current range query protocols.	anatomic node;biologic preservation;checking (action);data security;data structure;embedded system;embedding;encryption;hl7publishingsubsection <query>;node - plant part;performance evaluation;protocols documentation;question (inquiry);range query (data structures);range query (database);sensor node;verification of theories	Hua Dai;Qingqun Ye;Geng Yang;Jia Xu;Ruiliang He	2016		10.3390/s16020259	range query;computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy	Security	-41.63085019149635	64.74724627386207	156644

We design multiple-control fuzzy vaults suggesting applications using biometric credentials as locking and unlocking values. Furthermore we assess the security of our obtained generalizations for insider/ outsider attacks and examine the access-complexity for legitimate vault owners.	access structure;biometrics;credential;lock (computer science);multi-user;secret sharing;vault	Marianne Hirschbichler;Colin Boyd;Wageeh W.

67bd0df5c0552895bbc5e9aba223692abd5ae958	a survey of distributed biometric authentication systems	biometric authentication	In ACISP’07, Bringer et al proposed a new approach for remote biometric based verification, which consists of a hybrid protocol that distributes the server side functionality in order to detach the biometric data storage from the service provider. Besides, a new security model is defined using the notions of Identity and Transaction Privacy, which guarantees the privacy of the identity-biometrics relationship under the assumption of non-colluding servers. In this survey, we review the scheme of Bringer et al and the following biometric verification systems that improve upon it in terms of computation and communication complexity. In this context, we discuss about the recent result of Sarier, which describes a secure and efficient multi-factor authentication scheme with a different biometric storage method that results in reduced computation and database storage cost.	authentication protocol;biometrics;communication complexity;computation;computer data storage;database storage structures;encryption;feature vector;multi-factor authentication;protein information resource;public-key cryptography;server (computing);server-side	Neyire Deniz Sarier	2009			computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;biometrics	Security	-40.02450158930982	69.28636082832811	157047

As a secure multiparty computations of principal component analysis (PCA), in this paper, we propose S-PCA, which compute PCA securely among the distributed nodes. PCA is widely used in many applications including time-series analysis, text mining, and image compression. In general, we compute PCA after concentrating all data in a single server, but this approach discloses data privacy of each node. In contrast, the proposed S-PCA computes PCA without disclosing the sensitive data of individual nodes. In S-PCA, the nodes share non-sensitive mean vectors first and compute covariance matrices and PCA securely using the shared mean vectors. In this paper, we formally prove the correctness and secureness of S-PCA and apply it to an application of secure similar document detection. Experimental results show that the performance of S-PCA is slightly worse than that of PCA due to guarantee of secureness, but it significantly improves the performance of secure similar document detection by up to two orders of magnitudes.

Due to the serious privacy concerns in the cloud, database need to be encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. Therefore, various kNN query processing techniques have been proposed over the encrypted database. However, the existing schemes are either insecure or inefficient. So, we, in this paper, propose a new secure kNN query processing algorithm. Our algorithm guarantees the confidentiality of both the encrypted data and a user's query record. To achieve the high query processing efficiency, we also devise an encrypted index search scheme which can perform data filtering without revealing data access patterns. We show from our performance analysis that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing scheme in terms of a query processing cost while preserving data privacy.	cloud computing;cloud database;confidentiality;data access;encryption;information privacy;information sensitivity;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;outsourcing;profiling (computer programming);skyline operator	Hyeong-Il Kim;Hyeong-Jin Kim;Jae-Woo Chang	2016	2016 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)	10.1109/BIGCOMP.2016.7425806	online aggregation;sargable;query optimization;query expansion;web query classification;computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy;web search query;view;query language	DB	-40.445218934651834	67.15324164663424	157294

Limiting knowledge is the goal of existing information release policies that employ mechanisms such as noising, anonymization, and redaction. Knowledge-based policies are more general: they increase flexibility by not fixing the means to restrict information flow. We enforce a knowledge-based policy by explicitly tracking a model of a querier's belief about secret data, represented as a probability distribution, and denying any query that could increase knowledge above a given threshold. We implement query analysis and belief tracking via abstract interpretation using a novel probabilistic polyhedral domain, whose design permits trading off precision with performance while ensuring estimates of a querier's knowledge are sound. Experiments with our implementation show that several useful queries can be handled efficiently, and performance scales far better than would more standard implementations of probabilistic computation based on sampling.	abstract interpretation;computation;data anonymization;experiment;information flow (information theory);knowledge-based systems;polyhedron;probabilistic turing machine;sampling (signal processing);sanitization (classified information)	Piotr Mardziel;Stephen Magill;Michael Hicks;Mudhakar Srivatsa	2011	2011 IEEE 24th Computer Security Foundations Symposium	10.1109/CSF.2011.15	data modeling;information flow;computer science;information security;technical report;theoretical computer science;probability;data mining;database;semantics;probabilistic logic;privacy;computer security	DB	-38.39007483243236	63.360527346785396	157629

However, precision medicine and personalized care require access to the complete medical records. The first step toward this is to enable the linkage of health records spread across different sites. Existing record linkage solutions assume that data are centralized with no privacy or security concerns restricting sharing. However, that is often untrue. Therefore, we have designed and implemented a portable method for privacy-preserving record linkage based on garbled circuits to accurately and securely match records. We have also developed a novel approximate-matching mechanism that significantly improves efficiency.	approximation algorithm;centralized computing;linkage (software);matching;personalization;precision medicine;privacy;regular expression;genetic linkage;health records	Feng Chen;Xiaoqian Jiang;Shuang Wang;Lisa M.

In other to the protection of patient privacy, several authentication schemes have been proposed in TMIS, however, most of them have a security problems. Recently, Das proposed a secure and robust password-based remote user authentication scheme for the integrated EPR information system. However, in this paper, we show that his scheme have some security flaws. Then, we shall propose a secure authentication scheme to overcome their weaknesses. We prove the proposed scheme with random oracle and also use the BAN logic to prove the correctness of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we simulate our scheme for the formal security analysis using the AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool.	authentication;burrows–abadi–needham logic;correctness (computer science);epr paradox;information system;internet security;medical privacy;password;random oracle;simulation;weakness	Omid Mir;Theo P. van der Weide;Cheng-Chi Lee	2015	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-015-0265-8	random oracle;smart card;challenge–response authentication;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-45.2903546166304	74.2821371589262	157780

dc4b568dcf897acf3e3f37e0b31834502c369a2e	multi-client verifiable computation service for outsourced data		"""The introduction of verifiable computation came as a result of the increasingly common phenomenon of """"outsourcing"""" computation to untrusted servers and also to the growing desire of weak clients to outsource computational tasks to more powerful computation services like in cloud computing. Verifiable computation enables a computer to offload the computation of some function, to other perhaps untrusted cloud servers, while maintaining verifiable results. The servers evaluate the function and return the result with a proof that the computation of the function was carried out correctly. In the previous setting of verifiable computation, there is only one data provider. But in practice, there exist scenarios such as a network of sensors where each sensor collects data (e.g. air temperature in a certain area of a city) and stores them on servers. A control unit performs computation (e.g. the average air temperature of the city in certain period) on the outsourced data on the cloud (e.g. Amazon Cloud). When the control unit receives the results, it wants to verify the correctness of the computation results returned by the servers. For this scenario, we define a novel two-server multiclient verifiable computation service framework for outsourced data. An efficient construction is proposed, whose security is based on the existence of one-way functions. There are two advantages in our construction: (1) The size of the proof vouching for the correctness of computation result is independent with the number of data providers. (2) The verification only needs two equality tests executed by one who wants to get the computation result. We also experimentally analyze our construction and show our construction is very efficient in practice."""	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);amazon web services;cloud computing;computation;control unit;correctness (computer science);existential quantification;experiment;formal verification;one-way function;outsourcing;overhead (computing);sensor;server (computing)	Ying Wu;Rui Zhang;Rui Xue;Ling Liu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)	10.1109/ICWS.2017.65	computer science;verifiable secret sharing;database;outsourcing;computation;correctness;cloud computing;control unit;server;phenomenon	DB	-39.58995557454054	70.07868708720348	157907

In light of useful information from such dynamic networks, there is a continuous demand for privacy-preserving data sharing with analyzers, collaborators or customers. In this paper, we address the privacy risks of identity disclosures in sequential releases of a dynamic network. To prevent privacy breaches, we proposed novel kw-structural diversity anonymity, where k is an appreciated privacy level and w is a time period that an adversary can monitor a victim to collect the attack knowledge. We also present a heuristic algorithm for generating releases satisfying kw-structural diversity anonymity so that the adversary cannot utilize his knowledge to reidentify the victim and take advantages. The evaluations on both real and synthetic data sets show that the proposed algorithm can retain much of the characteristics of the networks while confirming the privacy protection.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;control table;distortion;experiment;heuristic (computer science);privacy;social network;synthetic data	Chih-Hua Tai;Peng-Jui Tseng;Philip S.

1a5079581c4c1e16bd27277deacfca51e6faa302	information hiding in probabilistic concurrent systems	information hiding;satisfiability;information flow;concurrent systems	Information hiding is a general concept which refers to the goal of preventing an adversary to infer secret information from the observables. Anonymity and Information Flow are examples of this notion. We study the problem of information hiding in systems characterized by the presence of randomization and concurrency. It is well known that the raising of nondeterminism, due to the possible interleavings and interactions of the parallel components, can cause unintended information leaks. One way to solve this problem is to fix the strategy of the scheduler beforehand. In this work, we propose a milder restriction on the schedulers, and we define the notion of strong (probabilistic) information hiding under various notions of observables. Furthermore, we propose a method, based on the notion of automorphism, to verify that a system satisfies the property of strong information hiding, namely strong anonymity or no-interference, depending on the context.	admissible heuristic;adversary (cryptography);concurrency (computer science);information flow;interaction;interference (communication);nondeterministic algorithm;observable;scheduling (computing);sergio verdú;undecidable problem	Miguel E.

Most of the current research on protecting health data privacy is centered around data de-identification and data anonymization, which removes the identifiable information from the published health data to prevent an adversary from reasoning about the privacy of the patients. However, published health data is not the only source that the adversaries can count on: with a large amount of information that people voluntarily share on the Web, sophisticated attacks that join disparate information pieces from multiple sources against health data privacy become practical. Limited efforts have been devoted to studying these attacks yet. We study how patient privacy could be compromised with the help of today’s information technologies. In particular, we show that private healthcare information could be collected by aggregating and associating disparate pieces of information from multiple online data sources including online social networks, public records and search engine results. We demonstrate a real-world case study to show user identity and privacy are highly vulnerable to the attribution, inference and aggregation attacks. We also show that people are highly identifiable to adversaries even with inaccurate information pieces about the target, with real data analysis. We claim that too much information has been made available electronic and available online that people are very vulnerable without effective privacy protection.	adversary (cryptography);data sources;data anonymization;de-identification;inference;information privacy;medical privacy;patients;scientific publication;social network;threat (computer);web search engine;world wide web;attribution;benefit	Fengjun Li;Xukai Zou;Peng Liu;Jake Yue Chen	2011		10.1186/1471-2105-12-S12-S7	personally identifiable information;privacy software;masking;the internet;confidentiality;dna microarray;information privacy;computer science;bioinformatics;data mining;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;data collection	Security	-42.17120530079655	63.63614030086449	158110

Privacy is one of very important security consideration. The customer information privacy in smart grid need to be protected. Smart grid data privacy encompasses confidentiality and anonymity of the information extracted from smart device metering transmission in smart grid communication system. In this paper, we consider a home area network as a basic reading data aggregation and dispatch unit in smart grid systems. Then, we propose a secure in-network data aggregation and dispatch scheme to keep the confidentiality and anonymity for collecting power usage information of home smart devices to the household smart meter and the reverse control message distributing procedure. Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal chip code to spread reading-data of different home smart devices into spread code, followed by a circuit shifting operation to coupling neighboring smart devices tightly. We adopt an in-network mechanism to further mask it with its spread data with its forwarding data. Finally, we analyze the cyber security protection levels using an information theoretic quantity, residual uncertainty. Simulation studies are conducted to test the performance on different metering datasets for the proposed scheme. This paper sets the ground for further research on optimizing of home power management systems with regarding to the privacy of customer power usage behaviors.	authentication;code;computer security;confidentiality;data aggregation;dynamic dispatch;information privacy;power management;pseudorandomness;requirement;simulation;smart device;smart meter;theory	Ye Yan;Yi Qian;Hamid Sharif	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6133655	chip;data aggregator;payload;strontium;information privacy;computer science;authentication;smart grid;shift operator;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;internet of things;automatic meter reading;communications system;computer network	EDA	-45.41269196145635	66.38503955939838	158171

These protocols go back to the early 1990s, when a universal PKI was thought to be just around the corner. Ten years later, it's still just around the corner, and it probably always will be. Consequently, existing protocols originally designed to rely on a global PKI must either employ ad hoc solutions or use any public key that turns up, because the only alternative is not to use any keys at all. In the absence of a PKI, system administrators can incorporate alternative approaches that are easy to use, transparent to end users, and have a low unit cost.	hoc (programming language);key management;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;system administrator	Peter Gutmann	2004	Computer	10.1109/MC.2004.1266303	computer science;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;world wide web;computer security	Security	-48.175801966960336	71.74995055858771	158437

We present new polynomial-time algorithms for deciding both notions under subterm convergent equational theories and under a theory representing symmetric encryption with the prefix property. For these equational theories, polynomial-time algorithms for the decision problems associated to both notions are well-known (although this has not been proven for static equivalence under the prefix theory). However, our algorithms have a significantly better asymptotic complexity than existing approaches. As an application, we use our algorithm for static equivalence to discover off-line guessing attacks on the Kerberos protocol when implemented using a symmetric encryption scheme for which the prefix property holds.	computational complexity theory;cryptographic protocol;decision problem;encryption;kerberos;online and offline;polynomial;prefix code;symmetric-key algorithm;time complexity;turing completeness	Bruno Conchinha;David A.

In this paper, we propose a contextual role-based access control authorization model aiming to increase the patient privacy and the confidentiality of patient data, whereas being flexible enough to consider specific cases. This model regulates user's access to EPR based on organizational roles. It supports a role-tree hierarchy with authorization inheritance; positive and negative authorizations; static and dynamic separation of duties based on weak and strong role conflicts. Contextual authorizations use environmental information available at access time, like user/patient relationship, in order to decide whether a user is allowed to access an EPR resource. This enables the specification of a more flexible and precise authorization policy, where permission is granted or denied according to the right and the need of the user to carry out a particular job function.	access time;authorization documentation;confidentiality;conflict (psychology);deny (action);epr paradox;medical records;medical privacy;patients;role-based access control;separation of duties;specification	Gustavo Henrique Matos Bezerra Motta;Sérgio Shiguemi Furuie	2003	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/TITB.2003.816562	index term;computer access control;information privacy;computer science;access control;role-based access control;data mining;separation of duties;authorization;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-43.7233475828787	61.94120753753962	158531

We suggest a new access control model for mobile code that copes with the shortcomings of the current access control model of Java. This new model is based on two key enhancements: the association of access control information with each mobile code segment in the form of attributes and the introduction of intermediate elements in the access control schema. The combination of the current ACL-based approach with the capability scheme achieved through mobile code attributes allows the new access control model to address dynamic multi-party scenarios while keeping the burden of security policy connguration at a minimum.

Even as password is endowed with the property of simple and human memorable, for which causes such an attack of brute force, for example, the previous works often suffer off-line password guessing attack.

1df40be1d11fcda345e8ed367d3d9ec9722cbcca	privacy-preserving machine learning as a service		Machine learning algorithms based on deep Neural Networks (NN) have achieved remarkable results and are being extensively used in different domains. On the other hand, with increasing growth of cloud services, several Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) are offered where training and deploying machine learning models are performed on cloud providers’ infrastructure. However, machine learning algorithms require access to the raw data which is often privacy sensitive and can create potential security and privacy risks. To address this issue, we present CryptoDL, a framework that develops new techniques to provide solutions for applying deep neural network algorithms to encrypted data. In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundation for implementing deep neural network algorithms in encrypted domain and develop techniques to adopt neural networks within practical limitations of current homomorphic encryption schemes. We show that it is feasible and practical to train neural networks using encrypted data and to make encrypted predictions, and also return the predictions in an encrypted form. We demonstrate applicability of the proposed CryptoDL using a large number of datasets and evaluate its performance. The empirical results show that it provides accurate privacy-preserving training and classification.	activation function;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;chebyshev polynomials;cloud computing;deep learning;experiment;homomorphic encryption;machine learning;neural network software;polynomial;privacy;secure multi-party computation	Ehsan Hesamifard;Hassan Takabi;Mehdi Ghasemi;Rebecca N.

We recently proposed a privacy preserving access control model for relational databases,where purpose information associated with a given data element specifies the intended use of the data element. In this paper, we extend our previous work to handle other advanced data managementsystems, such as the ones based on XML and the ones based on the object-relational data model. Another contribution of our paper isthat we address the problem of how to determine the purpose forwhich certain data are accessed by a given user. Our proposedsolution relies on the well-known RBAC model as well as the notionof conditional role which is based on the notions of role attributeand system attribute.	control system;data element;data model;hierarchical database model;high-level programming language;ibm notes;object-relational database;p3p;privacy policy;relational database;relational model;role-based access control;whole earth 'lectronic link;xml	Ji-Won Byun;Elisa Bertino;Ninghui Li	2005		10.1145/1063979.1063998	privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;data model;relational database;computer science;access control;data mining;database;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;complex data type	DB	-42.55988443761044	61.300459859583235	159056
c0b82441e30af45d7aedea2fa853456c56e59be1	another look at anonymous communication - security and modular constructions		Anonymous communication is desirable for personal, financial, and political reasons. Despite the abundance of frameworks and constructions, the anonymity definitions are usually either not well-defined or too complicated to use. In between two extremes are ad-hoc definitions, but they only work for specific protocols and sometimes only provide weakened anonymity guarantees. It is fair to say that constructing and analyzing anonymous communication protocols is not an easy task. This paper addresses this situation from the perspectives of syntax, security definition, and construction. We propose simple yet expressive syntax and security definition for anonymous communication. Our syntax covers protocols with different operational characteristics. We give a hierarchy of anonymity definitions, starting from the strongest possible one, to several relaxations. We also propose a modular construction of anonymous communication protocol, specifically, from any key-private public-key encryption scheme, and a new primitive we formulate which is called oblivious forwarding protocols. We then give two constructions of oblivious forwarding protocols. Our first design is a generic construction from any random walk algorithm over graphs, while the second design is optimized for probability of successful delivery, with experimental validation for our optimization. Our protocols provide anonymity even when the adversary can observe and control all traffic in the network and corrupt all but two nodes, in contrast to some efficient yet not-so-anonymous communication protocols. We hope this work can serve as an easier way to design and analyze efficient anonymous communication protocols in the future.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;communications protocol;encryption;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;modular design;public-key cryptography	Russell W.

In this paper, we propose a template protection system for iris-based biometric systems. A shuffling algorithm ensures revocability, while a combined Hadamard and Reed Solomon error correction coding ensures security, and as an improvement over previous research, cyclic redundancy check is introduced to eliminate the need to store user keys along with the templates in the database.	algorithm;authentication;biometrics;cross-reference;cyclic redundancy check;database;error detection and correction;forward error correction;reed–solomon error correction	Marwa Fouad;Abdulmotaleb El-Saddik	2011	2011 24th Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering(CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2011.6030421	error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;computer security;reed–solomon error correction;statistics	DB	-45.4780911269761	69.78100844083487	159236

System constructors can apply digital signature algorithm under this proposed concept to construct a practical cheater identi®cation method which is both ecient and simple. It is convenient for a system which already contains a digital signature algorithm and needs to detect or identify cheaters. The security of the constructed method is dependent on the selected digital signature algorithm. The bit length of the public value of the cheater identi®cation method which follows the proposed concept is independent on the total number of the participants in the secret sharing scheme. System constructors do not need to change the public value when he wants to include new participants into the system or to remove certain participants from the system. There exist ecient and secure commercial products for digital signature algorithm such as RSA. The proposed concept can be implemented in computer systems. Ó 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

40b18671bff9c061873bcbef88e6f62342da0005	efficient u-prove implementation for anonymous credentials on smart cards	part of book or chapter of book	In this paper we discuss an efficient implementation of anonymous credentials on smart cards. In general, privacy-preserving protocols are computationally intensive and require the use of advanced cryptography. Implementing such protocols for smart cards involves a trade-off between the requirements of the protocol and the capabilities of the smart card. In this context we concentrate on the implementation of Microsoft’s U-Prove technology on the MULTOS smart card platform. Our implementation aims at making the smart card independent of any other resources, either computational or storage. In contrast, Microsoft suggests an alternative approach based on device-protected tokens which only uses the smart card as a security add-on. Given our very good performance results we argue that our approach should be considered in favour of Microsoft’s one. Furthermore we provide a brief comparison between Java Card and MULTOS which illustrates our choice to implement this technology on the latter more flexible and low-level platform rather than the former.	add-ons for firefox;authentication;best, worst and average case;cryptography;digital credential;henk g. sol;high- and low-level;java card;multos;requirement;smart card;u-prove;usability	Wojciech Mostowski;Pim Vullers	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-31909-9_14	telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-44.33828712496077	73.1599075239575	159709

Extensive experimental evaluation that is conducted demonstrates that our technique is very efficient and more robust than the existing method.	algorithm;data anonymization;dummy variable (statistics);internet;overhead (computing);privacy;transmission (bittorrent client);transmitter;two-phase locking	Ji Zhang;Hongzhou Li;Xuemei Liu;Yonglong Luo;Fulong Chen;Hua Wang;Liang Chang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2015.2483503	robustness (computer science);the internet;computer science;information privacy;privacy software;categorical variable;data mining;internet privacy	DB	-42.36319697562333	64.98925436705949	159810
3c5c519314b57feba87d4e025777d6cf6f836f93	dynamic verifiable encrypted keyword search using bitmap index and homomorphic mac		Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) is a technique to securely outsource the data, which is encrypted using symmetric key primitives, while maintaining search functionality. While several solutions have been proposed to realize SSE over various data structures, the efficient solution using inverted index is due to Curtmola et.al. Hwang et.al. introduced a SSE scheme based on bitmaps in order to reduce the index size. In this paper, we consider Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) in the presence of a Semi-Honest-But-Curious Cloud Service Provider (SHBC-CSP). We have defined a new security notion for SSE in presence of SHBC-CSP, contrived two new SSE schemes and proved their security formally in the proposed security notion. Dynamic Verifiable Encrypted Keyword Search (DVSSE), is the first SSE scheme to the best of our knowledge, which is both dynamic and verifiable.

494792f82a5c26cf728d36ac4b297e5d002f2794	secure block device -- secure, flexible, and efficient data storage for arm trustzone systems		Recent years have seen a flurry of activity in the area of efficient and secure file systems for cloud storage, and also in the area of memory protection for secure processors. Both scenarios use cryptographic methods for data protection. Here, we consider the middle ground: the problem of using cryptographic methods to protect data integrity and confidentiality on a system with two strongly isolated execution environments, specifically an ARM TrustZone system with a Trusted Execution Environment. We introduce the Secure Block Device, a secure, easy to use, flexible, efficient, and widely applicable minimal Trusted Computing Base solution to provide data confidentiality and integrity for Data at Rest. The Secure Block Device is an open source C software library that uses a Merkle-Tree in conjunction with a selectable Authenticated Encryption scheme to provide an easy to integrate solution for applications that require fast and secure random access to data, but not a fully fledged file system. It was designed for Trusted Applications running in a Trusted Execution Environment that already have secure storage for cryptographic keys, but no secure general purpose data store. Beyond that, the Secure Block Device is applicable in all similar scenarios.

The protocols support software distribution both through retail stores and over the Internet. The user can transfer licenses from several cards onto a single card to avoid juggling between several cards in the reader. The protocols are based on signed delegation certificates that are mostly stored outside the smart card.

fbb9520ca577b35e34d42e0de28025505e8903f6	cryptographic approch for workflow systems	secret sharing;workflow system	This paper proposes encryption schemes to enforce the order of the procedure in a workflow system. In workflow systems, it is important to perform a procedure according to an order that is given by some regulation. In addition, it is desired that each reviewer checks a necessary part of a document to admit the application because the document sometime contains privacy information, e.g., name, birthday, income and so on. There is a procedure in a workflow system which it is sufficient to pass if one of two reviewers admits the document. More generally, there is a procedure in a workflow system that can be passed if k of n reviewers admit the document, which we call a “threshold procedure”. By applying a cryptographic technique, e.g., a multiple encryption and secret sharing, this paper gives a method to realize various procedures in workflow systems, i.e., controlling the order of reviewers, disclosing a part of document selectively, and a threshold procedure. Conventional workflow systems control their procedure by a server, which we consider a trusted one. This implies that an administrator might tamper a procedure. The proposed schemes help us to enforce a procedure even if he/she is not trustworthy.

It plays a crucial role in modern energy infrastructure. The main challenges of smart grids, however, are how to manage different types of front-end intelligent devices such as power assets and smart meters efficiently; and how to process a huge amount of data received from these devices. Cloud computing, a technology that provides computational resources on demands, is a good candidate to address these challenges since it has several good properties such as energy saving, cost saving, agility, scalability, and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a secure cloud computing based framework for big data information management in smart grids, which we call “Smart-Frame.” The main idea of our framework is to build a hierarchical structure of cloud computing centers to provide different types of computing services for information management and big data analysis. In addition to this structural framework, we present a security solution based on identity-based encryption, signature and proxy re-encryption to address critical security issues of the proposed framework.	big data;cloud computing;computational resource;confidentiality;frame language;id-based cryptography;id-based encryption;identity-based conditional proxy re-encryption;information management;proxy re-encryption;scalability;smart meter	Joonsang Baek;Quang Hieu Vu;Joseph K.

f55ac5e1a21b085c5f2ec85dfb9810088885ca40	a framework for analyzing verifiability in traditional and electronic exams		The main concern for institutions that organize exams is to detect when students cheat. Actually more frauds are possible and even authorities can be dishonest. If institutions wish to keep exams a trustworthy business, anyone and not only the authorities should be allowed to look into an exam’s records and verify the presence or the absence of frauds. In short, exams should be verifiable. However, what verifiability means for exams is unclear and no tool to analyze an exam’s verifiability is available. In this paper we address both issues: we formalize several individual and universal verifiability properties for traditional and electronic exams, so proposing a set of verifiability properties and clarifying their meaning, then we implement our framework in ProVerif, so making it a tool to analyze exam verifiability. We validate our framework by analyzing the verifiability of two existing exam systems – an electronic and a paper-and-pencil system.	authentication;book;computation;computational model;correctness (computer science);cryptoverif;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;formal verification;hoc (programming language);internet;item unique identification;mathematical induction;physical security;proverif;trust (emotion);verification and validation	Jannik Dreier;Rosario Giustolisi;Ali Kassem;Pascal Lafourcade;Gabriele Lenzini	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-17533-1_35	simulation;computer security	Security	-37.82261115949373	72.51505847544202	160336
5a70e5508eb50d5819ff9fe8766de9cafaf06ef3	achieving effective $k$ -anonymity for query privacy in location-based services		"""Location-based services (LBS) leveraged by ubiquitous mobile devices have brought great convenience to mobile users in various aspects, including communication, information exchange, social activities, and so on. However, privacy concerns arise at the same time, since the users need to submit their locations and query contents to the LBS servers. To this end, location privacy and query privacy have been recognized. In particular, this paper focuses on query privacy for preventing the leakage of users’ query contents. Cloaking region-based techniques using untrusted servers and client-based <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-anonymity approaches have been devised to preserve query privacy in LBS. However, these works suffer from single point of failure or insufficiency of query privacy.

a95129601945808b734fa543336eaf979aa06f92	smart collaboration mechanism using blockchain technology		Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was introduced to the world in 2008. The underlying technology behind bitcoin as well as the other cryptocurrencies which followed it is blockchain technology. Nowadays, collaborative engineering is gaining tremendous popularity, especially in the information technology industry. In the future, technological giants may have to work with each other to complete large projects of great importance and significance. In such projects, trust management is crucial. With multiple parties involved in such projects, it is important that no party monopolizes the project and adds patches which are not known to the other parties. In addition, no party should have the authority to disclose the full contents of the work to a third party. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based solution to the above issues. The only authentic version of the project would be the one maintained in the blockchain. Collaborators would broadcast the changes they make, and it would be added to the blockchain only after consensus from all parties. We use a threshold key system on private keys so that consensus is achieved. Our proposed system guarantees secure release of the project as well as non-repudiation to collaborators.	authentication;bitcoin;centralized computing;computer engineering;cryptocurrency;digital currency;entity;key;non-repudiation;patch (computing);trust management (information system)	Karanveer Singh Jhala;Rajvardhan Oak;Mrunmayee Khare	2018	2018 5th IEEE International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing (CSCloud)/2018 4th IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Scalable Cloud (EdgeCom)	10.1109/CSCloud/EdgeCom.2018.00029	computer security;cryptography;computer science;key (lock);cryptocurrency;collaborative engineering;software;popularity;information technology;digital currency	SE	-43.960020418562905	70.27139339985385	160758

Chaum first proposed the concept of blind digital signature, and designed untraceable payments. To avoid threats from chosen-message attacks presented by Coron et al. (1999), Fan et al. (2000) proposed a randomization enhanced Chaum blind signature scheme, by injecting a random factor into messages. In this paper, we first formally define the unlinkability of the blind signature scheme. According to this definition, we prove that Fan's scheme does not possess the unlinkablity property: after the message and signature have been revealed to the public by the sender, the signer can trace the corresponding blinded message and signature by constructing a linkage between the message and the blind message. Therefore, Fan's scheme cannot provide true blind signatures.	blind signature;scheme	Zichen Li;Junmei Zhang;Weidong Kou	2003		10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213443	e-commerce;ring signature;digital signature;merkle signature scheme;computer science;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;group signature;blind signature;schnorr signature;world wide web;computer security	Vision	-42.790953536687255	73.26594494050671	160858
5c8dc3b6e518e3135bfcf6d7c301358b864dd6b0	towards true decentralization: a blockchain consensus protocol based on game theory and randomness		One of the fundamental characteristics of blockchain technology is the consensus protocol. Most of the current consensus protocols are PoW (Proof of Work) based, or fixed-validators based. Nevertheless, PoW requires massive computational effort, which results in high energy and computing resources consumption. Alternatively, fixedvalidators protocols rely on fixed, static validators responsible for validating all newly proposed blocks, which opens the door for adversaries to launch several attacks on these validators such as DDoS and eclipse attacks. In this paper, we propose a truly decentralized consensus protocol that does not require PoW and randomly employs a different set of different size of validators on each block’s proposal. Additionally, our protocol utilizes a game theoretical model to enforce the honest validators’ behavior by rewarding honest validators and penalizing dishonest ones. We have analyzed our protocol and shown that it mitigates various attacks that current protocols suffer from.

3f7df8d63076f2917b695c905c503745edf31055	optimal contracts for outsourced computation		While expensive cryptographically verifiable computation aims at defeating malicious agents, many civil purposes of outsourced computation tolerate a weaker notion of security, i.e., “lazy-but-honest” contractors. Targeting this type of agents, we develop optimal contracts for outsourcing of computational tasks via appropriate use of rewards, punishments, auditing rate, and “redundancy”. Our contracts provably minimize the expense of the outsourcer (principal) while guaranteeing correct computation. Furthermore, we incorporate practical restrictions of the maximum enforceable fine, limited and/or costly auditing, and bounded budget of the outsourcer. By examining the optimal contracts, we provide insights on how resources should be utilized when auditing capacity and enforceability are limited. Finally, we present a light-weight cryptographic implementation of the contracts to mitigate the double moral hazard problem between the principal and the agents.	authorization;computation;cryptography;formal verification;lazy evaluation;moral hazard;nash equilibrium;norm (social);outsourcing;while	Viet Pham;M.

Our solution relies on the grouping of resources into buckets then organized with a binary search tree. The tree is built on an index computed in a non-invertible non-order preserving way, and supports efficient key-based retrieval. Our approach to provide access privacy builds on this data organization providing uniform observability to the server in access execution and dynamically changing not only the physical storage allocation, but also the logical structure itself.

However, CRL is an inefficient mechanism with drawbacks of “time granularity problem” and unmanageable sizes. This paper presents a new EECs revocation mechanism MEECRM (Mediated RSA-based End Entity Certificates Revocation Mechanism) to eliminate “key escrow” problem. MEECRM combines with MyProxy the online credential repository in Globus Tookit (GT). And some Schemes, such as HMAC, multi-SEM support and PVSS, have been introduced into MEECRM to increase the security and efficiency. MEECRM can ensure instantaneous revocation of invalid EECs in grid environments and can be used in many largescale grid projects because of inheriting from MyProxy.

However, most remote user authentication schemes on ECC are based on public-key cryptosystem, in which the public key in the system requires the associated certificate to prove its validity. Thus, the user needs to perform additional computations to verify the certificate in these schemes. In addition, we find these schemes do not provide mutual authentication or a session key agreement between the user and the remote server. Therefore, we propose an ID-based remote mutual authentication with key agreement scheme on ECC in this paper. Based upon the ID-based concept, the proposed scheme does not require public keys for users such that the additional computations for certificates can be reduced. Moreover, the proposed scheme not only provides mutual authentication but also supports a session key agreement between the user and the server. Compared with the related works, the proposed scheme is more efficient and practical for mobile devices.	cryptosystem;key-agreement protocol;mobile device;mutual authentication	Jen-Ho Yang;Chin-Chen Chang	2009	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2008.11.008	anonymity;computer science;threshold cryptosystem;cryptosystem;mobile device;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;elliptic curve;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-44.442935985580384	73.57059246094033	161537

c1be48d5dacce309e35d056107efe3db00c40527	performance and security evaluations of identity- and pairing-based digital signature algorithms on windows, android, and linux platforms: revisiting the algorithms of cha and cheon, hess, barreto, libert, mccullagh and quisquater, and paterson and schuldt		Bilinear pairing, an essential tool to construct-efficient digital signatures, has applications in mobile devices and other applications. One particular research challenge is to design cross-platform security protocols (e.g. Windows, Linux, and other popular mobile operating systems) while achieving an optimal security-performance tradeoff. That is, how to choose the right digital signature algorithm, for example, on mobile devices while considering the limitations on both computation capacity and battery life. In this paper, we examine the security-performance tradeoff of four popular digital signature algorithms, namely: CC (proposed by Cha and Cheon in 2003), Hess (proposed by Hess in 2002), BLMQ (proposed by Barreto et al. in 2005), and PS (proposed by Paterson and Schuldt in 2006), on various platforms. We empirically evaluate their performance using experiments on Windows, Android, and Linux platforms, and find that BLMQ algorithm has the highest computational efficiency and communication efficiency. We also study their security properties under the random oracle model and assuming the intractability of the CDH problem, we reveal that the BLMQ digital signature scheme satisfies the property of existential unforgeable on adaptively chosen message and ID attack. The efficiency of PS algorithm is lower, but it is secure under the standard model.	algorithm;android;bilinear transform;computation;computational diffie–hellman assumption;digital signature;experiment;linux;microsoft windows;mobile device;mobile operating system;random oracle;type signature	Sheng Zhong;Wei Chun Ren;Tianqing Zhu;Yi Ming Ren;Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2853703	distributed computing;computer science;microsoft windows;android (operating system);random oracle;computation;algorithm;digital signature;digital signature algorithm;mobile device;cryptographic protocol	Security	-44.41089598029693	73.69137500444259	161638
64e9c1a3980737e541bb8d0a35f8dce711d2eb3b	accountable storage		We introduce Accountable Storage (AS), a framework allowing a client with small local space to outsource n file blocks to an untrusted server and be able (at any point in time after outsourcing) to provably compute how many bits have been discarded by the server. Such protocols offer “provable storage insurance” to a client: In case of a data loss, the client can be compensated with a dollar amount proportional to the damage that has occurred, forcing the server to be more “accountable” for his behavior. The insurance can be captured in the SLA between the client and the server. Although applying existing techniques (e.g., proof-of-storage protocols) could address the AS problem, the related costs of such approaches are prohibitive. Instead, our protocols can provably compute the damage that has occurred through an efficient recovery process of the lost or corrupted file blocks, which requires only sublinear O(δ logn) communication, computation and local space, where δ is the maximum number of corrupted file blocks that can be tolerated. Our technique is based on an extension of invertible Bloom filters, a data structure used to quickly compute the distance between two sets. Finally, we show how our AS protocol can be integrated with Bitcoin, to support automatic compensations proportional to the number of corrupted bits at the server. We also build and evaluate our protocols showing that they perform well in practice.	bitcoin;bloom filter;computation;data structure;outsourcing;provable security;server (computing);service-level agreement	Giuseppe Ateniese;Michael T.

This paper presents a design and development of personal healthcare record (PHR) system, as well as the security process of the data while stored at un-trusted or semi-trusted party. Through our system, patients can participate on the control over access to their own PHR. In order to achieve the security of PHRs, we use a combination between the advanced encryption standard (AES) and the attribute based encryption (ABE) to encrypt the data before outsourcing it, and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) that secured the exchange of the users’ private key. The proposed scheme guarantees a high degree of patients privacy, and owner full control of his medical data.	attribute-based encryption;cipher;cloud computing;confidentiality;cryptosystem;elliptic curve cryptography;hash function;information privacy;information sensitivity;outsourcing;public-key cryptography;semiconductor industry;server (computing);steam rupture;trusted operating system;virtual private server;xml	Mohammed Amin Benamara;Huixian Li	2015	IJSN	10.1504/IJSN.2015.071833	40-bit encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-42.80656589253526	66.03099404995392	162016

Meanwhile, the risk of losing data stored with any untrustworthy service provider is the key barrier to widely adopt cloud storage service. To verify the integrity of data stored in cloud and relieve the security concerns of customers, a privacy-preserving data possession checking (DPC) scheme is presented. This scheme uses Merkle Hash Tree to support fully dynamic data operations. To achieve robustness, forward error-correcting codes can be combined with the proposed DPC scheme, which can recover the data when a small amount of file has been corrupted. The scheme allows unlimited times verification without the need for the verifier to compare against the original data, which reduces the communication and computation complexity dramatically and preserves the privacy of the data. Extensive security analysis and simulation show that the proposed scheme is highly provably secure.	cloud storage;dynamic data	Wenzhe Jiao;Guoqing Wang;Zhengjun Zhai;Xiaoxue Ye	2013	JNW	10.4304/jnw.8.12.2713-2720	merkle tree;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	OS	-42.37310668458089	67.7833263746323	162064

Typically, ABS schemes require two properties: unforgeability and privacy. In this paper, we propose a new structure and syntax for Traceable Attribute-Based Signature (TABS), which has a good balance between privacy and traceability. In a TABS scheme, the privacy of signers is also protected, each single user cannot link a signature to the identity (the set of attributes) of the signer. Meanwhile, given a malicious signature, the two trusted parties in our system can work together to trace the identity of the signer. Besides, we give a construction of a TABS scheme, and prove its existential unforgeability in the selective predicate security model under the q-Augmented Diffie-Hellman Exponent assumption. Compared to other ABS schemes, our scheme generates shorter signatures and is much more efficient.	antivirus software;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman problem;digital signature;formal grammar;monadic predicate calculus;non-interactive zero-knowledge proof;privacy;random oracle;traceability;type signature	Shenglong Ding;Yiming Zhao;Yuyang Liu	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2014.74	computer science;database;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-41.115895186299966	73.38866769194074	162086
fc1c344127f2a4b6f171849a33db6791c24d2137	an efficient electronic english auction system with a secure on-shelf mechanism and privacy preserving		With the rapid development of the Internet, electronic commerce has become more and more popular. As an important element of e-commerce, many Internet companies such as Yahoo! and eBay have launched electronic auction systems. However, like most electronic commerce products, safety is an important issue that should be addressed. Many researchers have proposed secure electronic auction mechanisms, but we found that some of them do not exhibit the property of unlinkability, which leads to the leakage of users&#x2019; privacy. Considering the importance of privacy preservation, we have designed a new auction mechanism. Through symmetrical key establishment in the registration phase, all messages transmitted over the Internet would be protected and, meanwhile, achieve the property of unlinkability. The security analysis and performance analysis show that our protocol fulfills more security properties and is more efficient for implementation compared with recent works.

83bc879120207d575fa92dbbc1d34f40351e6085	blendcac: a smart contract enabled decentralized capability-based access control mechanism for the iot		While the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been widely recognized as the essential part of Smart Cities, it also brings new challenges in terms of privacy and security. Access control (AC) is among the top security concerns, which is critical in resource and information protection over IoT devices. Traditional access control approaches, like Access Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), are not able to provide a scalable, manageable and efficient mechanism to meet the requirements of IoT systems. Another weakness in today’s AC is the centralized authorization server, which can be the performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. Inspired by the smart contract on top of a blockchain protocol, this paper proposes BlendCAC, which is a decentralized, federated capability-based AC mechanism to enable an effective protection for devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. A federated capability-based delegation model (FCDM) is introduced to support hierarchical and multi-hop delegation. The mechanism for delegate authorization and revocation is explored. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registering, propagating and revocating of the access authorization. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i.e., Raspberry PI node) and more powerful computing devices (i.e., laptops), and tested on a local private blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained AC solution for IoT systems.	access control list;authorization;bitcoin;centralized computing;information security;internet of things;laptop;prototype;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);reliability engineering;requirement;role-based access control;scalability;server (computing);single point of failure;smart city;smart contract	Ronghua Xu;Yu Chen;Erik Blasch;Genshe Chen	2018	Computers	10.3390/computers7030039	access control;single point of failure;pi;smart contract;security token;computer network;scalability;role-based access control;delegation;computer science	Security	-45.99144933533418	67.14718527336274	162278
49a230f2df11c8f374af6debae0d2a7fde472a05	adaptive garbled ram from laconic oblivious transfer		We give a construction of an adaptive garbled RAM scheme. In the adaptive setting, a client first garbles a “large” persistent database which is stored on a server. Next, the client can provide garbling of multiple adaptively and adversarially chosen RAM programs that execute and modify the stored database arbitrarily. The garbled database and the garbled program should reveal nothing more than the running time and the output of the computation. Furthermore, the sizes of the garbled database and the garbled program grow only linearly in the size of the database and the running time of the executed program respectively (up to poly logarithmic factors). The security of our construction is based on the assumption that laconic oblivious transfer (Cho et al., CRYPTO 2017) exists. Previously, such adaptive garbled RAM constructions were only known using indistinguishability obfuscation or in random oracle model. As an additional application, we note that this work yields the first constant round secure computation protocol for persistent RAM programs in the malicious setting from standard assumptions. Prior works did not support persistence in the malicious setting.	malware;oblivious transfer;persistence (computer science);random oracle;random-access memory;secure multi-party computation;server (computing);time complexity	Sanjam Garg;Rafail Ostrovsky;Akshayaram Srinivasan	2018	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-319-96878-0_18	theoretical computer science;oblivious transfer;computation;logarithm;random oracle;persistence (computer science);obfuscation;computer science;secure multi-party computation	Crypto	-39.38076823291742	69.00643167007567	162436

It is widely believed that the sheer scale of big data makes most conventional data privacy techniques ineffective for big data. In contrast to this pessimistic common belief, we propose a scheme that exploits the sheer scale to guarantee privacy. This scheme uses jointly artificial noise and secret matrix transform to scramble the source data. Desirable data utility can be supported because the noise and the transform preserve some important geometric properties of the source data. With a comprehensive privacy analysis, we use the blind/non-blind channel identification theories to show that the secret transform matrix and the source data can not be estimated from the scrambled data. The artificial noise and the sheer scale of big data are critical for this purpose. Simulations of collaborative filtering are conducted to demonstrate the proposed scheme.	big data;collaborative filtering;computer simulation;information privacy;signal processing;source data;transformation matrix	Xiaohua Li;Zifan Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE China Summit & International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)	10.1109/ChinaSIP.2014.6889293	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-38.64697237325568	64.77405370714973	162599

Unfortunately, there are some security constraints that avoid a massive use of mobile agents systems. The protection of mobile agents against the attacks of malicious hosts is considered by far the most difficult security problem to solve in mobile agent systems. This paper introduces some techniques that aim to solve the problem of the malicious hosts. This paper improves some aspects of the most widely known attack detection technique, the cryptographic traces approach. This approach presents some major drawbacks that can be solved by means of a Suspicious Detection Protocol. Additionally, this paper introduces some other protocols that can be used to punish the malicious host by using a Third Trusted Party, the Host Revocation Authority.	accessibility;cryptography;malware;mobile agent;tracing (software);trusted third party	Oscar Esparza;Jose L.

A typical exchange usually occurs within the context of a group of users and often takes place in a centrally managed infrastructure such as Facebook. Evidence has shown that such systems are unable to properly protect the privacy of its users.  Following this observation, we present a framework to support privacy-preserving group communication. Our framework is completely decentralized and leverages the social relationships between users to bootstrap a communication overlay whose robustness is improved with the addition of extra privacy-preserving links. The framework supports multiple groups in a scalable manner and defines mechanisms to handle churn in group membership. Finally, we also outline high-level protocols for a privacy-preserving micro-news application.	booting;centralized computing;experiment;high- and low-level;information sensitivity;internet;privacy;scalability;simulation	Abhishek Singh;Guido Urdaneta;Maarten van Steen;Roman Vitenberg	2012		10.1145/2181176.2181181	public relations;political science;internet privacy;world wide web	Security	-43.20709804100541	62.58718237394648	162945

Although searchable encryption (SE) technique enables cloud server to provide fundamental encrypted data retrieval services for data-owners, equipping with a result verification mechanism is still of prime importance in practice as semi-trusted cloud server may return incorrect search results. Besides, single keyword search inevitably incurs many irrelevant results which result in waste of bandwidth and computation resources. In this paper, we are among the first to tackle the problems of data-owner updating and result verification simultaneously. To this end, we devise an efficient cryptographic primitive called as verifiable multi-keyword search over encrypted cloud data for dynamic data-owner scheme to protect both data confidentiality and integrity. Rigorous security analysis proves that our scheme is secure against keyword guessing attack (KGA) in standard model. As a further contribution, the empirical experiments over real-world dataset show that our scheme is efficient and feasible in practical applications.	dynamic data;encryption;search algorithm	Yinbin Miao;Jianfeng Ma;Ximeng Liu;Zhiquan Liu;Limin Shen;Fushan Wei	2018	Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications	10.1007/s12083-016-0487-7	encryption;cryptographic primitive;cloud storage;data security;cloud computing;computer science;distributed computing;cloud computing security;dynamic data;data retrieval	Arch	-41.16677515210037	66.80799473498531	162994

A single-step protocol was presented for the occasion that the mobile node joins a new cluster. The presented protocol contains a valid request message and an answer authentication message, which rapidly implements identification authentication and privacy protection. The protocol’s privacy protection properties were formalized in the applied pi calculus and security performance was analyzed. It is concluded that the proposed protocol can resist replay attack, eavesdropping attack, and tracking or location privacy attack. It satisfies both untraceability and forward privacy these two privacy protection properties.

These extensions protect users from content that may be substituted by malicious servers, and therefore have immediate applications in improving the security of web caching, mirroring, and relaying systems that rely on untrusted machines [2,4]. Our proposal relies on Merkle trees to support 200 and 404 response authentication while requiring only a single cryptographic hash of trusted data per repository. While existing web protocols such as HTTPS can provide authenticity guarantees (in addition to confidentiality), HTTPS consumes significantly more computational resources, and requires that the hosting server act without malice in generating responses and in protecting the publisher's private key.	authentication;computational resource;confidentiality;cryptographic hash function;disk mirroring;experiment;https;hypertext transfer protocol;malware;merkle tree;pseudocode;public-key cryptography;server (computing);web cache;web content	Roberto J.

f55ad9e657ba59b65f9aeaa9920c12bcf051e876	mitigating traffic-based side channel attacks in bandwidth-efficient cloud storage		Data deduplication [3] is able to effectively identify and eliminate redundant data and only maintain a single copy of files and chunks. Hence, it is widely used in cloud storage systems to save the usersu0027 network bandwidth for uploading data. However, the occurrence of deduplication can be easily identified by monitoring and analyzing network traffic, which leads to the risk of user privacy leakage. The attacker can carry out a very dangerous side channel attack, i.e., learn-the-remaining-information (LRI) attack, to reveal usersu0027 privacy information by exploiting the side channel of network traffic in deduplication [1]. In the LRI attack, the attacker knows a large part of the target file in the cloud and tries to learn the remaining unknown parts via uploading all possible versions of the fileu0027s content. For example, the attacker knows all the contents of the target file X except the sensitive information θ . To learn the sensitive information, the attacker needs to upload m files with all possible values of θ , respectively. If a file X d with the value θ d is deduplicated and other files are not, the attacker knows that the information θ = θ d . In the threat model of the LRI attack, we consider a general cloud storage service model that includes two entities, i.e., the user and cloud storage server. The attack is launched by the users who aim to steal the privacy information of other users [1]. The attacker can act as a user via its own account or use multiple accounts to disguise as multiple users. The cloud storage server communicates with the users through Internet. The connections from the clients to the cloud storage server are encrypted by SSL or TLS protocol. Hence, the attacker can monitor and measure the amount of network traffic between the client and server but cannot intercept and analyze the contents of the transmitted data due to the encryption. The attacker can then perform the sophisticated traffic analysis with sufficient computing resources. We propose a simple yet effective scheme, called randomized redundant chunk scheme (RRCS), to significantly mitigate the risk of the LRI attack while maintaining the high bandwidth efficiency of deduplication. The basic idea behind RRCS is to add randomized redundant chunks to mix up the real deduplication states of files used for the LRI attack, which effectively obfuscates the view of the attacker, who attempts to exploit the side channel of network traffic for the LRI attack. RRCS includes three key function modules, range generation (RG), secure bounds setting (SBS), and security-irrelevant redundancy elimination (SRE). When uploading the random-number redundant chunks, RRCS first uses RG to generate a fixed range [0,λ N ] (λ e (0,1]), in which the number of added redundant chunks is randomly chosen, where N is the total number of chunks in a file and λ is a system parameter. However, the fixed range may cause a security issue. SBS is used to deal with the bounds of the fixed range to avoid the security issue. There may exist security-irrelevant redundant chunks in RRCS. SRE reduces the security-irrelevant redundant chunks to improve the deduplication efficiency. The design details are presented in our technical report [5]. Our security analysis demonstrates RRCS can significantly reduce the risk of the LRI attack [5]. We examine the performance of RRCS using three real-world trace-based datasets, i.e., Fslhomes [2], MacOS [2], and Onefull [4], and compare RRCS with the randomized threshold scheme (RTS) [1]. Our experimental results show that source-based deduplication eliminates 100% data redundancy which however has no security guarantee. File-level (chunk-level) RTS only eliminates 8.1% -- 16.8% (9.8% -- 20.3%) redundancy, due to only eliminating the redundancy of the files (chunks) that have many copies. RRCS with λ = 0.5 eliminates 76.1% -- 78.0% redundancy and RRCS with λ = 1 eliminates 47.9% -- 53.6% redundancy.	cloud storage	Pengfei Zuo;Yu Hua;Cong Wang;Wen Xia;Shunde Cao;Yukun Zhou;Yuanyuan Sun	2018		10.1109/IPDPS.2018.00124	distributed computing;computer science;cloud computing;computer network;cloud storage;encryption;side channel attack;exploit;data deduplication;distributed data store;spectral efficiency	Crypto	-42.96616884032626	68.8222464141359	163487
226cfb67d2d8eba835f2ec695fe28b78b556a19f	majority is not enough: bitcoin mining is vulnerable		The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed.  We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners' revenue is larger than their fair share. The attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the attackers, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.  Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any coalition size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by a coalition that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a coalition of any size can compromise the system.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;ecosystem;rational unified process	Ittay Eyal;Emin Gün Sirer	2014		10.1145/3212998	data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-42.951099772015816	71.12554425125089	163549

However, little has been done for the class of protocols that deals with group key management and distribution, and have special security properties, such as forward secrecy. In this paper, we define a formal model and establish rank theorems for forward properties based on a set of generic formal specification requirements for group key management and distribution protocols. Rank theorems imply the validity of the security property to be proved, and are deducted from a set of rank functions we define over the protocol. The above formalizations and rank theorems were implemented using the PVS theorem prover. We illustrate our approach on the verification of forward secrecy for the Enclaves protocol designed at SRI.	authentication;automated theorem proving;correctness (computer science);cryptographic protocol;cryptography;embedded system;first-order logic;formal language;formal methods;formal specification;forward secrecy;group key;inference engine;key distribution;key management;matroid rank;model checking;requirement	Amjad Gawanmeh;Sofiène Tahar	2007	21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)	10.1109/AINAW.2007.304	computer science;information security;theoretical computer science;formal specification;cryptographic protocol;programming language;computer security	Security	-36.30604250755314	72.28756017830571	163685

It can be claimed that proposing a cryptographic protocol to satisfy security and efficiency requirements is one of the significant challenging issues. Nevertheless, cryptographic research community suffers from non-existence of an integrated pattern to categorize and standardize possible challenges of mentioned concerns. These drawbacks could in turn lead to much confusion for the researchers who are not expert in this research area. Therefore, we paid particular attention to assemble a powerful document to fill this gap between the beginners and the experts. Our final goal is to make other researchers able to classify the challenges over Provably Secure cryptosystems or lightweight ones, analyze the proposed scheme based on the determined components and help them to find better solutions for the future researches.	categorization;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;cryptosystem;provable security;requirement	Seyed-Mohsen Ghoreishi;Shukor Abd Razak;Ismail Fauzi Isnin;Hassan Chizari	2014	2014 International Symposium on Biometrics and Security Technologies (ISBAST)	10.1109/ISBAST.2014.7013116	computer security model;cryptographic primitive;security of cryptographic hash functions;computer science;cryptographic protocol;security service;internet privacy;computational hardness assumption;world wide web;controlled cryptographic item;computer security	Security	-38.62305193570067	71.89193316355171	164094
5b1ef4f1155a8d55b6802ee46dbe24b486c0ccce	privacy preserving weighted similarity search scheme for encrypted data		Cloud computing has become increasingly popular among individuals and enterprises because of the benefits it provides by outsourcing their data to cloud servers. However, the security of the outsourced data has become a major concern. For privacy concerns, searchable encryption, which supports searching over encrypted data, has been proposed and developed rapidly in secure Boolean search and similarity search. However, different users may have different requirements on their queries, which mean different weighted searches. This problem can be solved perfectly in the plaintext domain, but hard to be addressed over encrypted data. In this study, the authors use locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) to deal with a privacy preserving weighted similarity search. In the authorsu0027 scheme, data users can generate a search request and set the weight for each attribute according to their requirements. They treat the LSH values as keywords and mix them into the framework of SSE. They use homomorphic encryption to securely address the weight problem and return the top-k data without revealing any weight information of data users. They formally analysed the security strength of their scheme. Extensive experiments on actual datasets showed that their scheme is extremely effective and efficient.

In order to coordinate independent services that have not yet established trust among each other, this  paper proposes to use electronic “vouchers” to link untrusted trading partners. A voucher is a digital representation of rights  to claim goods or services and can be securely transferred between trading partners using the Voucher Trading System (VTS).

df4d6416d79033ece2916476187f1e862328a151	replicated data integrity verification in cloud		Cloud computing is an emerging model in which computing infrastructure resources are provided as a service over the Internet. Data owners can outsource their data by remotely storing them in the cloud and enjoy on-demand high quality applications and services from a shared pool of configurable computing resources. However, since data owners and cloud servers are not in the same trusted domain, the outsourced data may be at risk as the cloud server may no longer be fully trusted. Therefore, data integrity is of critical importance in such a scenario. Cloud should let either the owners or a trusted third party to audit their data storage without demanding a local copy of the data from owners. Replicating data on cloud servers across multiple data centers provides a higher level of scalability, availability, and durability. When the data owners ask the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) to replicate data at different servers, they are charged a higher fee by the CSP. Therefore, the data owners need to be strongly convinced that the CSP is storing all the data copies that are agreed upon in the service level contract, and the data-update requests issued by the customers have been correctly executed on all the remotely stored copies. To deal with such problems, previous multi copy verification schemes either focused on static files or incurred huge update costs in a dynamic file scenario. In this paper, we propose some ideas under a Dynamic Multi-Replica Provable Data Possession scheme (DMR-PDP) that prevents the CSP from cheating; for example, by maintaining fewer copies than paid for. DMR-PDP also supports efficient dynamic operations like block modification, insertion and deletion on data replicas over cloud servers.	authorization;cloud computing;computer data storage;correctness (computer science);cryptography;data center;data integrity;delta encoding;display resolution;dual modular redundancy;durability (database systems);dynamic data;internet;key (cryptography);outsourcing;provable security;reconfigurable computing;scalability;seamless3d;self-replication;server (computing);trusted third party;virtual private server	Raghul Mukundan;Sanjay Kumar Madria;Mark Linderman	2012	IEEE Data Eng.

eabcd57707c2f4c2bee3e7a7c62578fa465b54cf	privasense: privacy-preserving and reputation-aware mobile participatory sensing		The integration of privacy into reputation systems is a crucial need for building secure and reliable participatory sensing applications. Participants are given the assurance that their privacy is preserved even if they contribute some personal sensitive data. In addition, reputation systems allow an application server to monitor participants' behaviors and evict those who provide the system with corrupted data. However, this integration requires achieving seemingly conflicting objectives. Reputation systems monitor participants behaviors along subsequent interactions. Whereas, one of the major objectives of privacy preserving systems is to unlink subsequent interactions. In this paper, we define a new attack (RR attack), which exploits this conflict in order to detect the succession of contributions provided by the same participant and to subsequently re-identify his original identity. We show that using this attack, more than 35% of contributions can be associated to their successive contributions in each campaign. We then propose PrivaSense as a new privacy preserving reputation system that integrates both reputation and privacy such that their objectives are simultaneously achieved. Experimental results are conducted using a real data-set. These results show that PrivaSense decreases by up to 80% the number of contributions linked to their original providers.	application server;authentication;entity;interaction;mean squared error;participatory sensing;privacy;replay attack;replication (computing);reputation system;round-robin scheduling;server (computing);succession	Hayam Mousa;Sonia Ben Mokhtar;Omar Hasan;Lionel Brunie;Osama Younes;Mohey M.

However, the protection method against an active attack is not clear. Moreover, there is an additional load in that it should append a reachability manager[1,6] to the proposed system. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme improving the method of Kesdogan et al. and analyze its security and effectiveness.	mobile phone	Soon Seok Kim;Sang-Soo Yeo;Hong-Jin Park;Sung Kwon Kim	2005		10.1007/11560326_36	internationalization and localization;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;reachability;mobile computing;computer security;information protection policy;telecommunications network	Mobile	-47.158408387217264	69.63275152047322	166011
7dfce578644bc101ae4ffcd0184d2227c6d07809	polymorphic encryption and pseudonymisation for personalised healthcare		Polymorphic encryption and Pseudonymisation, abbreviated as PEP, form a novel approach for the management of sensitive personal data, especially in health care. Traditional encryption is rather rigid: once encrypted, only one key can be used to decrypt the data. This rigidity is becoming an every greater problem in the context of big data analytics, where different parties who wish to investigate part of an encrypted data set all need the one key for decryption. Polymorphic encryption is a new cryptographic technique that solves these problems. Together with the associated technique of polymorphic pseudonymi-sation new security and privacy guarantees can be given which are essential in areas such as (personalised) healthcare, medical data collection via self-measurement apps, and more generally in privacy-friendly identity management and data analytics. The key ideas of polymorphic encryption are: 1. Directly after generation, data can be encrypted in a 'polymorphic' manner and stored at a (cloud) storage facility in such a way that the storage provider cannot get access. Crucially, there is no need to a priori fix who gets to see the data, so that the data can immediately be protected. For instance a PEP-enabled self-measurement device will store all its measurement data in polymorphically encrypted form in a back-end data base. 2. Later on it can be decided who can decrypt the data. This decision will be made on the basis of a policy, in which the data subject should play a key role. The user of the PEP-enabled device can, for instance, decide that doctors X, Y, Z may at some stage decrypt to use the data in their diagnosis, or medical researcher groups A, B, C may use it for their investigations, or third parties U, V, W may use it for additional services, etc. 3. This 'tweaking' of the encrypted data to make it decryptable by a specific party can be done in a blind manner. It will have to be done by a trusted party who knows how to tweak the ciphertext for whom. This PEP technology can provide the necessary security and privacy infrastructure for big data analytics. People can entrust their data in polymorphically encrypted form, and each time decide later to make (parts of) it available (de-cryptable) for specific parties, for specific analysis purposes. In this way users remain in control, and can monitor which of their data is used where by whom for which purposes.

f379d3ca5eade9b253259d6a8ba933b9b4967306	stre: privacy-preserving storage and retrieval over multiple clouds		Cloud computing is growing exponentially, whereby there are now hundreds of cloud service providers (CSPs) of various sizes. While the cloud consumers may enjoy cheaper data storage and computation offered in this multi-cloud environment, they are also in face of more complicated reliability issues and privacy preservation problems of their outsourced data. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving STorage and REtrieval (STRE) mechanism that not only ensures security and privacy but also provides reliability guarantees for the outsourced searchable encrypted data. The STRE mechanism enables the cloud users to distribute and search their encrypted data in multiple cloud service providers (CSPs), and is robust even when a certain number of CSPs crash. Besides the reliability, STRE also offers the benefit of partially hidden search pattern.	cloud computing;computation;computer data storage;encryption;privacy	Jingwei Li;Dan Lin;Anna Cinzia Squicciarini;Chunfu Jia	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-23829-6_3	computer science;cloud computing;computer network;encryption;computation;computer data storage;crash	Security	-41.340813441912765	66.70456397744186	166113

The correctness and feasibility of the proposal is demonstrated through formal models, while the integration in a cloud-based architecture is left to future work.	access control;best, worst and average case;cloud computing;cloud database;confidentiality;control system;correctness (computer science);credential;download;encryption;information leakage;key (cryptography);sql;semiconductor industry;spectral leakage	Luca Ferretti;Michele Colajanni;Mirco Marchetti	2013	2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science	10.1109/CloudCom.2013.172	cloud computing;information privacy;computer science;database;authorization;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-44.043179034503254	65.3839991407391	166131

The protocol is fully decentralised and allows users to share their cars conveniently in such a way that the security and privacy of the users is not sacrificed. It provides generation, update, revocation, and distribution mechanisms for access tokens to shared cars, as well as procedures to solve disputes and to deal with law enforcement requests, for instance in the case of car incidents. We prove that SePCAR meets its appropriate security and privacy requirements and that it is efficient: our practical efficiency analysis through a proof-of-concept implementation shows that SePCAR takes only 1.55 seconds for a car access provision.	bitbucket;privacy;prototype;requirement	Iraklis Symeonidis;Abdelrahaman Aly;Mustafa A.

Thanks to the privacy-preserving features of the WS, neither the cloud provider nor a third party intruder can guess which watchdog is queried in each POR query. Similarly, the responses to POR qu eries are also obfuscated. Hence to answer correctly to every new set of POR queries, the cloud provider has to retain the file in its entirety. StealthGuard stands out from the earlier sentinel-based POR scheme proposed by Juel s and Kaliski (JK), due to the use of WS and the support for an unlimited numbe r of queries by StealthGuard. The paper also presents a formal security analysis of the protocol.	algorithm;cloud computing;flip-flop (electronics);outsourcing;provable security;randomness;retrievability;watchdog timer	Monir Azraoui;Kaoutar Elkhiyaoui;Refik Molva;Melek Önen	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11203-9_14	computer science;theoretical computer science;world wide web;computer security	Security	-40.10797750719422	74.30783924065099	166147

In the past hierarchical threshold scheme participants are partitioned based on a single attribute. But in practice, each participant always has several attributes, and the group of participants always should be partitioned based on different attributes to satisfy the security requirements. For example, Distinguished by position, the bank employees can be tellers or department managers. Distinguished by department, the bank employees can be from account department, administration department or others. The bank policy could require the presence of 5 employees in opening the vault, at least one of whom must be department manager, and at least 3 of whom are from account department. Even though hierarchical threshold scheme has been studied extensively in the past, none of the existing solutions solves the above problem. We propose a multi-attribute hierarchical threshold scheme based on Tassa's scheme, which is based on Birkhoff interpolation, and Mignotte's scheme, which is based on Chinese Remainder Theorem, to solve this problem.	access structure;birkhoff interpolation;polynomial remainder theorem;rsa (cryptosystem);requirement;scheme	Dong Jiao;Mingchu Li;Cheng Guo;Jianhua Ma	2011	2011 International Conference on Internet of Things and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.102	birkhoff interpolation;interpolation;polynomial interpolation;cryptography;theoretical computer science;mathematical model;chinese remainder theorem;secret sharing;computer security;statistics;satisfiability	DB	-40.605510471851005	71.62015546450311	166440

The secret document is divided into n shares based on a k 1 degree polynomial, and the sharing scheme is tied in with a cover document. With the corresponding cover document, we can recover the secret by gathering at least k shares. To ensure each share is distinct, this work designs a method to avoid duplicate arguments of the polynomial. The security in the proposed scheme comes from two sides, secret sharing and steganography. The cover document is not restricted to the secret, hence our scheme is more flexible in choosing the cover document compared to other researchers’ schemes. Besides, the proposed scheme is easy to implement a hierarchical right management. Finally, experimental results and computational and security analysis are given to show that the proposed scheme is secure and practical. 2014 Elsevier Inc.

ef6c5f9a77a847709fa3eeb2ea98b9970ead22ac	towards leakage-resilient fine-grained access control in fog computing	dual system methodology;pair encoding;leakage resilient cryptography;functional encryption;fog computing	Fog Computing, a technology that takes advantage of both the paradigms of Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things, has a great advantage in reducing the communication cost. Since its introduction, fog computing has found a lot of applications, including, for instance, connected vehicles, wireless sensors, smart cities and etc. One prominent problem in fog computing is how fine-grained access control can be imposed. Functional encryption, a new cryptographic primitive, is known to support fine-grained access control. However, when it comes to some new threats in the fog computing scenario, such as side channel attacks, functional encryption cannot maintain its security. Therefore, we need new cryptographic primitives that not only provide a way to securely share data with a fine-grained access control but also are able to resist those new threats. In this paper, we consider how to construct functional encryption schemes (FEs) adaptively secure in continual memory leakage model (CML), which is one of the strongest models that allows continuous leakage on both user and master secret keys. Besides providing privacy and fine-grained access control in fog computing, our scheme can also guarantee security against side channel attacks. More concretely, we propose a generic framework for constructing fully secure leakage-resilient FEs (LR-FEs) in the CML model results from leakage-resilient pair encoding, which is an extension of pair encoding presented in the recent work of Attrapadung. In this way, our framework simplifies the design and analysis of LR-FEs into the design and analysis of predicate encodings. Moreover, we discover new adaptively secure LRFEs, including FE for regular languages, attribute-based encryption (ABE) for large universe and ABE with short ciphertext. Above all, leakage-resilient adaptively secure functional encryption schemes can equip fog computing with higher security and fine-grained access control. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

And they require embedded data management techniques. However, secure chips have severe hardware constraints which make traditional database techniques irrelevant. The main problem faced by secure chip DBMS designers is to be able to assess various design choices and trade-offs for different applications. Our solution is to use a benchmark for secure chip DBMS in order to (1) compare different database techniques, (2) predict the limits of on-chip applications, and (3) provide co-design hints. In this paper, we propose DiSC (Data management in Secure Chip), a benchmark which matches these three objectives. This work benefits from our long experience in developing and tuning data management techniques for the smart card. To validate DiSC, we compare the behavior of candidate data management techniques thanks to a cycle-accurate smart card simulator. Finally, we show the applicability of DiSC to future designs involving new hardware platforms and new database techniques.	benchmark (computing);dongle;embedded system;relevance;requirement;simulation;smart card;usb	Nicolas Anciaux;Luc Bouganim;Philippe Pucheral;Patrick Valduriez	2008	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2008.67	embedded system;smart card;data management;computer science;data mining;database;mobile computing;access method;world wide web;computer security	DB	-34.939306476607435	62.213476542081644	166591

The beauty of visual cryptographic scheme (VCS) is that its decoding is based on stacking and human visual system (HVS) without cryptographic computation. In this paper, for the first time essential and non-essential VCS (ENVCS) is introduced based on pre-existed (k,n) VCS. In the proposed (k 0,n 0,k,n) ENVCS, we generate the secret image into n shares which are classified into n 0 essential shares and n − n 0 non-essential shares. In the decoding phase, in order to reveal secret we should collect at least k shares, among which there are at least k 0 essential shares. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the security and efficiency of the proposed scheme.	cryptographic hash function;cryptography	Xuehu Yan;Shen Yun Wang;Xiamu Niu;Ching-Nung Yang	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-12643-2_77	discrete mathematics;pure mathematics;cryptographic protocol	Vision	-41.57319402967215	74.4198957362643	166942

Handover operations must not compromise the security of the network. In addition, handovers must be instantaneous to sustain the quality of service (QoS) of the applications running on the WLAN-User Equipment (WLAN-UE). Existing handover protocols are not suitable for 3G-WLAN interworking because they are limited to Intra Extended Service Set (ESS) roaming and lack the support of mutual authentication between the WLAN-UE and the authentication server. This paper proposes novel secured fast handover protocols for 3G-WLAN interworking architectures, which overcome the limitations of existing handover protocols. The functionality of Extensible Authentication Protocol with Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA) is extended to support Intra and Inter ESS secured handover messaging. Modifications to the standard EAP-AKA authentication and the standard EAP-AKA key hierarchy are proposed to achieve the security goals of the proposed protocols. The proposed protocols are more suitable for 3G-WLAN interworking handovers than existing handover protocols because they support Inter ESS handover, achieve mutual authentication service and adopts an efficient key management scheme.	authentication and key agreement (protocol);authentication server;extensible authentication protocol;key management;mutual authentication;quality of service;server (computing)	Ali Al Shidhani;Victor C.

01d64e72a3dd4f537780940dda96a25bfcd172c3	multi-party privacy-preserving record linkage using bloom filters		Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL), the problem of identifying records that correspond to the same real-world entity across several data sources held by different parties without revealing any sensitive information about these records, is increasingly being required in many real-world application areas. Examples range from public health surveillance to crime and fraud detection, and national security. Various techniques have been developed to tackle the problem of PPRL, with the majority of them considering linking data from only two sources. However, in many real-world applications data from more than two sources need to be linked. In this paper we propose a viable solution for multi-party PPRL using two efficient privacy techniques: Bloom filter encoding and distributed secure summation. Our proposed protocol efficiently identifies matching sets of records held by all data sources that have a similarity above a certain minimum threshold. While being efficient, our protocol is also secure under the semi-honest adversary model in that no party can learn any sensitive information about any other parties’ data, but all parties learn which of their records have a high similarity with records held by the other parties. We evaluate our protocol on a large real voter registration database showing the scalability, linkage quality, and privacy of our approach.

This system relies on participants' active contribution including intentional input data through mobile phone's applications, e.g. Facebook, Twitter and Linkdin. However, a number of privacy concerns will hinder the spread of community sensing applications. It is difficult for resource-constrained mobile phones to rely on complicated encryption scheme. We should prepare a privacy-preserving community sensing scheme with less computational-complexity. Moreover, an environment that is reassuring for participants to conduct community sensing is strongly required because the quality of the statistical data is depending on general users' active contribution. In this article, we suggest a privacy-preserving community sensing scheme for human-centric data such as profile information by using the combination of negative surveys and randomized response techniques. By using our method described in this paper, the server can reconstruct the probability distributions of the original distributions of sensed values without violating the privacy of users. Especially, we can protect sensitive information from malicious tracking attacks. We evaluated how this scheme can preserve the privacy while keeping the integrity of aggregated information.	computation;computational complexity theory;encryption;information sensitivity;malware;mobile phone;personally identifiable information;privacy;randomized algorithm;server (computing);time series;transmitter	Shunsuke Aoki;Masayuki Iwai;Kaoru Sezaki	2013	2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops	10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.54	probability distribution;privacy software;computer science;database;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;statistics	Mobile	-39.110212268224096	61.74949412148114	167088

a20a718d44b807baa88ac2e0e7e469c08e21967f	sdss-mac: secure data sharing scheme in multi-authority cloud storage systems		Secure data access control has become a challenging issue in cloud storage system schemes. Some attribute-based encryption techniques have been proposed to achieve more secure data access control for sharing data in a semi-trusted cloud storage system with multiple attribute authorities. However, based on Dolev–Yao model, security goals such as active attack resistance, confidentiality, anti-collusion, and attribute revocation security for most schemes cannot be all perfectly guaranteed since the capable adversary can overhear, intercept, replay, and synthesis arbitrary information in the open communication channels. In this paper, we first propose a Security-enhanced Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (SMA-ABE) scheme against common drawbacks for existing Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE) schemes such as key distribution on secure channel assumption and non-reliable decryption algorithms. Then based on our SMA-ABE scheme, a Secure Data Sharing Scheme in Multi-Authority Cloud-storage-systems (SDSS-MAC) is constructed to achieve fine-grained access control and efficient decryption with offloaded and verifiable transformation on cloud, and to support secure attribute-level immediate revocation of users' attribute. It can be formally proved that SDSS-MAC can achieve the confidentiality, provenance verification and integrity of data, secure key distribution, multiple collusions resistance, and attribute-revocation security. Finally, performance comparison among SDSS-MAC and other related schemes are given to demonstrate that SDSS-MAC can balance above security goals with practical efficiency of storage, computation and communication comparing with other related schemes.	cloud storage;spatial decision support system	Rui Jiang;Xianglong Wu;Bharat K.

07bd5287251097668daaed3d8e8f822be4bae274	a survey of inference control methods for privacy-preserving data mining		Inference control in databases, also known as Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC), is about protecting data so they can be published without revealing confidential information that can be linked to specific individuals among those to which the data correspond. This is an important application in several areas, such as official statistics, health statistics, e-commerce (sharing of consumer data), etc. Since data protection ultimately means data modification, the challenge for SDC is to achieve protection with minimum loss of the accuracy sought by database users. In this chapter, we survey the current state of the art in SDC methods for protecting individual data (microdata). We discuss several information loss and disclosure risk measures and analyze several ways of combining them to assess the performance of the various methods. Last but not least, topics which need more research in the area are identified and possible directions hinted.	confidentiality;data mining;database;e-commerce;information privacy;microdata (html);risk measure;smart data compression;statistical disclosure control	Josep Domingo-Ferrer	2008		10.1007/978-0-387-70992-5_3	data mining	ML	-40.95500326454178	63.25945501396033	167666

464579108f8c2dfaeb72cec8ce45d2f7b601c297	d2i2d: a novel secure approach for cloud storage with cost minimization		Nowadays Cloud computing has made a revolutionary change in the concept of computation on the web. It has been able to provide low cost services to its users all over the world. Millions of users are using the service of cloud either by IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Now the main concern of cloud service providers and users how to preserve security in these low cost services. Throughout this research we have first reviewed some cost minimization technique and data security approaches used in the cloud. Then we propose a novel data hiding approach called ‘D2i2D’ which is able to provide security to any data stored in the cloud as well as reduce the file size in cloud storage. Our technique is based on data to RGB image and RGB image to data conversion technique with multiple-key-cryptography (MKC) to provide more security on cloud data. We have been able to show that this technique is able to reduce 38.82% of storage where file size is less than 1 MB and 30.34% of storage where file size is within 1 to 2 MB. Lastly we propose a framework to implement this technique in cloud.	cloud computing;cloud storage;computation;cryptography;data security;megabyte;platform as a service;software as a service	Tushar Kanti Saha;A.

In other words, our scheme enables everyone to transmit the encrypted digital contents almost without any redundancy. As for tracing, our scheme supports black-box tracing, i.e., identifying colluders without opening the pirate decoder. Moreover, in our scheme, the storage requirement for legitimate subscribers and digital content broadcasters is smaller than that of previous schemes.	traitor tracing	Yi-Ruei Chen;Wen-Guey Tzeng	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-11145-7_11	telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;computer security	Crypto	-42.488484672927584	71.31266737390953	168631

(and some remarks on the recent paper by huang et al. in ndss'12)		Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a useful cryptographic primitive that allows two parties (client and server) to interact based on their respective (private) input sets, in such a way that client obtains nothing other than the set intersection, while server learns nothing beyond client set size. This paper considers one PSI construct from [DT10] and reports on its optimized implementation and performance evaluation. Several key implementation choices that significantly impact real-life performance are identified and a comprehensive experimental analysis (including micro-benchmarking, with various input sizes) is presented. Finally, it is shown that our optimized implementation of this RSA-OPRF-based PSI protocol markedly outperforms the one presented in [HEK12].	client (computing);cryptographic primitive;cryptography;performance evaluation;rsa (cryptosystem);real life;server (computing)	Emiliano De Cristofaro;Gene Tsudik	2012	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		world wide web;theoretical computer science;intersection (set theory);computer science	Security	-40.0083098567473	74.4356548093855	168718
1ecfe23503600b7a6a6ed3dcce86542420e36a06	dependence makes you vulnberable: differential privacy under dependent tuples.		Differential privacy (DP) is a widely accepted mathematical framework for protecting data privacy. Simply stated, it guarantees that the distribution of query results changes only slightly due to the modification of any one tuple in the database. This allows protection, even against powerful adversaries, who know the entire database except one tuple. For providing this guarantee, differential privacy mechanisms assume independence of tuples in the database – a vulnerable assumption that can lead to degradation in expected privacy levels especially when applied to real-world datasets that manifest natural dependence owing to various social, behavioral, and genetic relationships between users. In this paper, we make several contributions that not only demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting the above vulnerability but also provide steps towards mitigating it. First, we present an inference attack, using real datasets, where an adversary leverages the probabilistic dependence between tuples to extract users’ sensitive information from differentially private query results (violating the DP guarantees). Second, we introduce the notion of dependent differential privacy (DDP) that accounts for the dependence that exists between tuples and propose a dependent perturbation mechanism (DPM) to achieve the privacy guarantees in DDP. Finally, using a combination of theoretical analysis and extensive experiments involving different classes of queries (e.g., machine learning queries, graph queries) issued over multiple large-scale real-world datasets, we show that our DPM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in managing the privacy-utility tradeoffs for dependent data.	adversary (cryptography);authorization;coefficient;dsqi;data dependency;data-directed programming;differential dynamic programming;differential privacy;exptime;elegant degradation;experiment;ibm notes;inference attack;information privacy;information sensitivity;machine learning;parameter (computer programming);reza iravani;social network	Changchang Liu;Supriyo Chakraborty;Prateek Mittal	2016		10.14722/ndss.2016.23279	tuple;computer science;internet privacy;differential privacy	DB	-38.91024705004248	63.42922401088495	168759
eb9d16e3c4acd20deb2c90203119cc6278036e38	perturbation for privacy-preserving participatory sensing on mobile	data privacy;mobile computing	Summary form only given. Participatory sensing applications collect data from participants to construct statistical information of environment or phenomenon, using their mobile phone. Mobile phone is closely related to participant's daily life, therefore the invasion of privacy in participatory sensing would have dire consequences. In this research, we study privacy-preserving participatory sensing technique which is the perturbation using negative surveys and limited negative surveys on mobile to promote use of participatory sensing in healthcare, investigation, and other useful applications. When participants report the data in negative surveys, their mobile phones automatically select a value from the set complement of the sensed data value at random. In other words, we can construct public statistics without knowing the personal information of citizens. Additionally, our research extends negative surveys to limited negative surveys, which have the capable of change, according to the feature of data, especially the number of categories. We combine negative survey and limited negative survey, because it is difficult to construct valuable databases when the categories of perturbed is large size on mobile phone. We also present the evaluation of these schemes on the view point of privacy and utility of data sets in central collection server.	database;mobile phone;participatory sensing;personally identifiable information;privacy;server (computing)	Shunsuke Aoki;Masayuki Iwai;Kaoru Sezaki	2012	2012 International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions		computer science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Mobile	-39.995981696500714	62.04318612962628	168762

0a5406ea5d724d3533ad1be465745f5aaa068219	secure authentication scheme for iot and cloud servers	cookies;authentication;internet of things;elliptic curve cryptography;cloud computing	Internet of Things (IoT) is an upcoming platform where information and communication technology connect multiple embedded devices to the Internet for performing information exchange. Owing to the immense development of this technology, embedded devices are becoming more sophisticated every day and are being deployed in various arenas of life. An important advancement in today's technology is the ability to connect such devices to large resource pools such as cloud. Integration of embedded devices and cloud servers brings wide applicability of IoT in many commercial as well as Government sectors. However, the security concerns such as authentication and data privacy of these devices play a fundamental role in successful integration of these two technologies. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based algorithms give better security solutions in comparison to other Public Key Cryptography (PKC) algorithms due to small key sizes and efficient computations. In this paper, a secure ECC based mutual authentication protocol for secure communication of embedded devices and cloud servers using Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookies has been proposed. The proposed scheme achieves mutual authentication and provides essential security requirements. The security analysis of the proposed protocol proves that it is robust against multiple security attacks. The formal verification of the proposed protocol is performed using AVISPA tool, which confirms its security in the presence of a possible intruder.	authentication	Sheetal Kalra;Sandeep K.

50308edd8ee46462d8533106c040785a1a1c3c29	towards doubly efficient private information retrieval		Private Information Retrieval (PIR) allows a client to obtain data from a public database without disclosing the locations accessed. Traditionally, the stress is on preserving sublinear work for the client, while the server’s work is taken to inevitably be at least linear in the database size. Beimel, Ishai and Malkin (JoC 2004) show PIR schemes where, following a linear-work preprocessing stage, the server’s work per query is sublinear in the database size. However, that work only addresses the case of multiple non-colluding servers; the existence of single-server PIR with sublinear server work remained unaddressed. We consider single-server PIR schemes where, following a preprocessing stage in which the server obtains an encoded version of the database and the client obtains a short key, the per-query work of both server and client is polylogarithmic in the database size. Concentrating on the case where the client’s key is secret, we show: • A scheme, based on one-way functions, that works for a bounded number of queries, and where the server storage is linear in the number of queries plus the database size. • A family of schemes for an unbounded number of queries, whose security follows from a corresponding family of new hardness assumption that are related to the hardness of solving a system of noisy linear equations. We also show the insufficiency of a natural approach for obtaining doubly efficient PIR in the setting where the preprocessing is public.	convergence insufficiency;database;linear equation;one-way function;polylogarithmic function;preprocessor;private information retrieval;server (computing)	Ran Canetti;Justin Holmgren;Silas Richelson	2017	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-319-70503-3_23	theoretical computer science;computer science;private information retrieval;preprocessor;server;distributed computing;sublinear function	Crypto	-39.71613364273863	68.72575147971038	168950

We propose a caching mechanism that operates across the three devices, enabling interactive order-preserving encryption schemes on resource-constrained devices. Additionally, the system can use a high-level description of an IoT application to select automatically appropriate encryption for the data on corresponding tiers and their mathematical operations. This assists in fine-tuning and choosing the core parameters for underlying data structures.	cache (computing);data structure;encryption;high- and low-level;internet of things	Laurynas Riliskis;Hossein Shafagh;Philip Levis	2015		10.1145/2810103.2810111	computer science;system;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;bus encryption	HCI	-38.75894624962051	67.78372452400157	168989

As such, it is particularly vulnerable to privacy concerns, which may seriously hamper the large-scale adoption of participatory sensing applications. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving system architecture for participatory sensing contexts which relies on cryptographic techniques and distributed computations in the cloud. Each individual is represented by a personal software agent, which is deployed on one of the popular commercial cloud computing services. The system enables individuals to aggregate and analyse sensor data by performing a collaborative distributed computation among multiple agents. No personal data is disclosed to anyone, including the cloud service providers. The distributed computation proceeds by having agents execute a cryptographic protocol based on a homomorphic encryption scheme in order to aggregate data. We show formally that our architecture is secure in the Honest-But-Curious model both for the users and the cloud providers. Our approach was implemented and validated on top of the NoiseTube system [1], [2], which enables participatory sensing of noise. In particular, we repeated several mapping experiments carried out with NoiseTube, and show that our system is able to produce identical outcomes in a privacy-preserving way. We experimented with real and simulated data, and present a live demo running on a heterogeneous set of commercial cloud providers. The results show that our approach goes beyond a proof-of-concept and can actually be deployed in a real-world setting. To the best of our knowledge this system is the first operational privacy-preserving approach for participatory sensing. While validated in terms of NoiseTube, our approach is useful in any setting where data aggregation can be performed with efficient homomorphic cryptosystems.	aggregate data;amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);cloud computing;computation;crowdsourcing;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;cryptosystem;data aggregation;distributed computing;experiment;homomorphic encryption;image scaling;map;multi-user;participatory sensing;personally identifiable information;privacy;prototype;software agent;systems architecture;tracing (software)	George Drosatos;Pavlos S.

36454c5a02dbd9ee1c1c57501762c53acacf1b29	achieving differential privacy in secure multiparty data aggregation protocols on star networks	secret sharing;differential privacy;homomorphic encryption	We consider the problem of privacy-preserving data aggregation in a star network topology, i.e., several untrusting participants connected to a single aggregator. We require that the participants do not discover each other's data, and the service provider remains oblivious to each participant's individual contribution. Furthermore, the final result is to be published in a differentially private manner, i.e., the result should not reveal the contribution of any single participant to a (possibly external) adversary who knows the contributions of all other participants. In other words, we require a secure multiparty computation protocol that also incorporates a differentially private mechanism. Previous solutions have resorted to caveats such as postulating a trusted dealer to distribute keys to the participants, or introducing additional entities to withhold the decryption key from the aggregator, or relaxing the star topology by allowing pairwise communication amongst the participants. In this paper, we show how to obtain a noisy (differentially private) aggregation result using Shamir secret sharing and additively homomorphic encryption without these mitigating assumptions. More importantly, while we assume semi-honest participants, we allow the aggregator to be stronger than semi-honest, specifically in the sense that he can try to reduce the noise in the differentially private result.  To respect the differential privacy requirement, collusions of mutually untrusting entities need to be analyzed differently from traditional secure multiparty computation: It is not sufficient that such collusions do not reveal the data of honest participants; we must also ensure that the colluding entities cannot undermine differential privacy by reducing the amount of noise in the final result. Our protocols avoid this by requiring that no entity -- neither the aggregator nor any participant -- knows how much noise a participant contributes to the final result. We also ensure that if a cheating aggregator tries to influence the noise term in the differentially private output, he can be detected with overwhelming probability.	a* search algorithm;adversary (cryptography);cryptography;data aggregation;differential privacy;entity;homomorphic encryption;key (cryptography);network topology;news aggregator;secure multi-party computation;semiconductor industry;shamir's secret sharing;star network	Vincent Bindschaedler;Shantanu Rane;Alejandro E.

Privacy preservation is a challenging research issue for this kind of service. A possible solution consists of ensuring users' anonymity, i.e., ensuring that the user issuing a request is indistinguishable, among a group of users, by any attacker who has access to the service requests. In this paper we propose a formal framework to model the problem of guaranteeing anonymity when requiring location-based services. The proposed framework extends existing approaches by allowing to model different kinds of knowledge that may be available to the attacker. We show application examples of our framework, modeling both known scenarios and new ones. From a practical point of view, the framework makes it possible to define anonymity-preserving techniques that best suite the system assumptions as derived from the applicative context, and the level of privacy protection defined by the user.	applicative programming language;experiment;location-based service;semantics (computer science);tracing (software)	Claudio Bettini;Sergio Mascetti;Xiaoyang Sean Wang;Sushil Jajodia	2007	2007 International Conference on Mobile Data Management	10.1109/MDM.2007.19	information privacy;computer science;location-based service;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-41.21701041679587	60.466347182804	169865

Unfortunately, passwords suffer from two seemingly intractable problems: password cracking and password theft. In this paper, we propose PasswordAgent, a new password hashing mechanism that utilizes both a salt repository and a browser plug-in to secure web logins with strong passwords. Password hashing is a technique that allows users to remember simple low-entropy passwords and have them hashed to create high-entropy secure passwords. PasswordAgent generates strong passwords by enhancing the hash function with a large random salt. With the support of a salt repository, it gains a much stronger security guarantee than existing mechanisms. PasswordAgent is not vulnerable to offline attacks, and it provides stronger protection against password theft. Moreover, PasswordAgent offers usability advantages over existing hash-based mechanisms, while maintaining users’ familiar password entry paradigm. We build a prototype of PasswordAgent and conduct usability experiments.	authentication;experiment;hash function;key derivation function;online and offline;password cracking;password strength;plug-in (computing);programming paradigm;prototype;salt (cryptography);usability	Benjamin Strahs;Chuan Yue;Haining Wang	2009			zero-knowledge password proof;cognitive password;password policy;hash function;s/key;rainbow table;computer science;hash chain;password psychology;salt;internet privacy;key derivation function;one-time password;key stretching;world wide web;password;computer security;password strength;password cracking	Security	-44.71487751552437	68.50429222682408	169937

The design rationale is to enable the mutual authentication between the roaming mobile device (MD) and the visited network to be locally performed without invoking the MD's home ISP. The mutual authentication ensures that the visited network has authenticity as well as a mechanism for establishing the appropriate revenue stream for the roaming MD. The proposed scheme guarantees that the overhead associated with the authentication time is significantly reduced and that the impact of this overhead on the roaming MD is also minimized, although the nested depth of the network mobility is increased. In this paper, we use analytical comparisons to show that the proposed scheme creates less overhead than that of the previous approaches in terms of security and communication performance.	access control;authentication protocol;design rationale;mobile device;molecular dynamics;mutual authentication;overhead (computing);proxy mobile ipv6;public key certificate;public-key cryptography	Hyung-Jin Lim;Moonseong Kim;Jong-Hyouk Lee;Dae-Hee Seo;Tai-Myung Chung	2011	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2011.2158864	computer science;roaming;authorization;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-47.39993512552985	72.43889966679686	169995

Classic SSO systems re-authenticate a user to different applications based on a fixed set of attributes (e.g. Username-password combinations). However, the use of a fixed set of attributes fail to account for mobility and contextual variations of user activities. Thus, in a SSO based system, robust persistent authentications and secure session termination management are vital for ensuring secure operations. In this paper we propose a novel persistent authentication technique using multiplicative attribute graph model. We use multiple attribute based persistent authentication model using facial biometrics, location and activity specific information. We propose a novel membership (or group affiliations) based session management technique for user initiated SSO global logout management. Significance and viability of these methods are demonstrated by security, complexity and numerical analyses. In conclusion, our model provides meaningful insights and more pragmatic approaches for persistent authentication and session termination management in implementing SSO based mobile collaborative applications.	authentication;biometrics;complexity;login;numerical analysis;password;prototype;real-time clock;session (computer science);single sign-on;user (computing)	Uthpala Subodhani Premarathne;Ibrahim Khalil	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2014.33	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-47.427414104660286	71.93984064262835	170423

The authors analyse the associated processes, the certificate contents and the roles of the parties involved. The authors’ motive for its formulation is the belief that research previously done in this field is either too restrictive, too proprietary, too difficult to implement, or a combination of the above. In addition, the PKIs that have been deployed in most countries, both public and private, do not in the authors view protect personal information privacy. Instead, the authors propose a model that adheres to standards, is easy to implement, requires as little as possible application development for integration into commercial PKI systems, is suitable for large-scale deployment and concedes little in the protection of personal information privacy.	public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography	Dionysis Kefallinos;Efstathios D.

Recently, Zhang et al. proposed a password-authenticated key agreement protocol for SIP by using smart cards to protect the VoIP communications between users. Their protocol provided some unique features, such as mutual authentication, no password table needed, and password updating freely. In this study, we performed cryptanalysis of Zhang et al.’s protocol and found that their protocol was vulnerable to the impersonation attack although the protocol could withstand several other attacks. A malicious attacker could compute other users’ privacy keys and then impersonated the users to cheat the SIP server. Furthermore, we proposed an improved password-authentication key agreement protocol for SIP, which overcame the weakness of Zhang et al.’s protocol and was more suitable for Voice over Internet Protocol communications.

152d2951586a734c80027606c17cf30c468efdce	light-weight white-box encryption scheme with random padding for wearable consumer electronic devices	performance evaluation;encryption;consumer electronics;data mining;context	Wearable devices can be potentially captured or accessed in an unauthorized manner because of their physical nature. In such cases, they are in white-box attack contexts, where the adversary may have total visibility on the implementation of the built-in cryptosystem, with full control over its execution platform. Dealing with white-box attacks on wearable devices is undoubtedly a challenge. To serve as a countermeasure against threats in such contexts, we propose a lightweight encryption scheme to protect the confidentiality of data against white-box attacks. We constructed the scheme's encryption and decryption algorithms on a substitution-permutation network that consisted of random secret components. Moreover, the encryption algorithm uses random padding that does not need to be correctly decrypted as part of the input. This feature enables non-bijective linear transformations to be used in each encryption round to achieve strong security. The required storage for static data is relatively small and the algorithms perform well on various devices, which indicates that the proposed scheme satisfies the requirements of wearable computing in terms of limited memory and low computational power.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;authorization;canonical account;computation;confidentiality;cryptography;cryptosystem;encryption;requirement;substitution-permutation network;wearable computer;wearable technology	Yang Shi;Xiaoping Wang;Hongfei Fan	2017	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2017.014722	multiple encryption;h.235;disk encryption theory;40-bit encryption;disk encryption;telecommunications;client-side encryption;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;link encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;disk encryption hardware;deterministic encryption;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption	Security	-40.37718123508484	70.04203253946972	171576
a19325ad85f1c31ba3cb2509d51d7dde50b26fd4	an efficient anonymous authentication protocol in multiple server communication networks (eaam)	multi-server authentication;anonymity;chaotic maps	In a multi-server authentication environment, a user only needs to register once at a central registration place before accessing the different services on the different registered servers. Both, from a user point of view as for the management and maintenance of the infrastructure, these types of environments become more and more popular. Smartcard- or smartphone-based approaches lead to more secure systems because they offer two- or three-factor authentication, based on the strict combination of the user’s password, the user’s biometrics and the possession of the device. In this paper, we propose an efficient anonymous authentication protocol in multiple server communication networks, called the EAAM protocol, which is able to establish user anonymity, mutual authentication, and resistance against known security attacks. The novelty of the proposed scheme is that it does not require a secure channel during the registration between the user and the registration center and is resistant to a curious but honest registration system. These features are established in a highly efficient way with the minimum amount of communication flows between user and server during the establishment of the secret shared key and by using light-weight cryptographic techniques such as Chebyshev chaotic map techniques and symmetric key cryptography. The performance and security of the protocol are analyzed and compared with the latest new proposals in this field.	authentication protocol;biometrics;chaos theory;cryptography;mutual authentication;password;point of view (computer hardware company);secure channel;server (computing);smart card;smartphone;symmetric-key algorithm;telecommunications network	An Braeken;Pardeep Kumar;Madhusanka Liyanage;Ta Thi Kim Hue	2017	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-017-2190-8	challenge-handshake authentication protocol;distributed computing;computer science;password;challenge–response authentication;mutual authentication;server;authentication protocol;internet authentication service;computer network;data authentication algorithm	Security	-45.764926372903844	73.27109640839055	171579

In this paper, a microcontroller based RSA is designed and proposed. Arduino Mega2560R3 microcontroller supported with external memory and a screen touch LCD as well as a double keypad has been used under the programming of C language to implement the proposed RSA coprocessor with 32 bits. It was found that the trade of between message size and the encryption time can be drawn as a liner relationship according to the block size of the encryption phase. However, such design with a MCU provided with a small solar cell (and off course with a backup battery) as well as small block sizes is considered useful for the use in wireless sensor network (WSN) applications due to the ease of connecting the MCU to the WSN which as well avoid the processing time of encryption/decryption processes that could be executed by the MCU instead of the life limited sensors.	arduino;cryptosystem;microcontroller;rsa (cryptosystem)	Qasem Abu Al-Haija;Mashhoor Al Tarayrah;Hasan Al-Qadeeb;Abdulmohsen Al-Lwaimi	2014		10.1016/j.procs.2014.07.091	embedded system;computer hardware;computer science;cryptography;information security;operating system;computer security	Crypto	-36.62891748655483	68.2997315935767	171730
bfe4eacd070fef266552ed5a4fe8580ca2a39030	preventing “bad” content dispersal in named data networking		"""Named Data Networking (NDN) improves the data delivery efficiency by caching contents in routers. To prevent corrupted and faked contents be spread in the network, NDN routers should verify the digital signature of each published content. Since the verification scheme in NDN applies the asymmetric encryption algorithm to sign contents, the speed of content verification is too slow to satisfy the high speed requirement. In this paper, we propose two schemes to improve the verification performance of NDN routers to prevent content poisoning. The first content verification scheme, called """"user-assisted"""", leads to the best performance, but can be by-passed if the clients and the content producer collude. To prevent the aforementioned collusion attack, we improve the user-assisted content verification scheme and propose the second content verification scheme, named """"Router-Cooperation"""", in which the edge routers verify the contents independently without the assistance of users and the core routers no longer verify the contents. The Router-Cooperation verification scheme reduces the computing complexity of cryptographic operation by replacing the asymmetric encryption algorithm with symmetric encryption algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that this Router-Cooperation scheme can speed up 145.5x (in hardware) and 18.85x (in software) of the original content verification scheme with merely extra transmission overhead."""	digital signature;encryption;overhead (computing);public-key cryptography;simulation;symmetric-key algorithm;user-generated content	Yi Wang;Zhuyun Qi;Kai Lei;Bin Liu;Chen Tian	2017	China Communications	10.1145/3063955.3063993	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-43.11464197409427	71.74279594317507	171789

Fiat and Tassa proposed the framework of dynamic traitor tracing. Their framework requires dynamic computation transactions according to the real-time responses of the pirate, and it presumes real-time observation of content redistribution. Therefore, it cannot be simply utilized in an application where such an assumption is not valid. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that provides the advantages of dynamic traitor tracing schemes and also overcomes their problems. key words: dynamic traitor tracing, watermarking, digital rights management, content distribution	computation;digital distribution;digital recording;digital rights management;digital watermarking;real-time locating system;traitor tracing	Go Ohtake;Kazuto Ogawa;Goichiro Hanaoka;Hideki Imai	2009	IEICE Transactions		telecommunications;digital watermarking;computer science;computer security	Security	-42.736169398502426	71.08717030308351	172015

Growing attraction in Electric Vehicles (EV) shall likely provide a fundamental shift not only in transportation sector but also in the existing electrical grid infrastructure. In Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) network, participating EVs can be used to store energy and supply this energy back to the power grid when required. To realize proper deployment of V2G network, charging infrastructure having various entities such as charging facility, clearinghouse, and energy provider has to be constructed. So use of Public key infrastructure (PKI) is indispensable for provisioning security solutions in V2G networks. The ISO/IEC 15118 standard is ascribed that incorporates X.509 PKI solution for V2G network. However, as traditional X.509 based PKI for V2G network has several shortcomings, we have proposed a multi-domain PKI model for V2G network that is built on elliptic curve cryptography and a self-certified public key technique having implicit certificate. We illustrate that the proposed solutions outperform the existing ones.	algorithm;elliptic curve cryptography;entity;extended validation certificate;grid network;iso/iec 42010;implicit certificate;performance evaluation;provable security;provisioning;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;software deployment;x.509	Binod Vaidya;Dimitrios Makrakis;H.

These sensors offer multiple services to users locally or across the Internet, and travel between multiple WSNs. However, users should only have access to a limited subset of services. Due to a need for direct interactions of users with nodes, authentication and authorisation at the node level is critical. This paper presents an access control infrastructure consisting of three parts: 1) an authentication protocol to ensure authenticity of messages, 2) a role based authorisation framework to perform access control, and 3) a user management service to enable user and permission management. A prototype implementation on the ContikiOS demonstrates the validity and feasibility of node local role based access control on low power micro-controllers.	authentication protocol;authorization;control system;cryptography;encryption;information security;interaction;internet;multi-user;overhead (computing);prototype;role-based access control;routing;sap business one;sensor;symmetric-key algorithm	Jef Maerien;Sam Michiels;Christophe Huygens;Danny Hughes;Wouter Joosen	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-36672-7_3	wireless sensor network;computer access control;computer science;role-based access control;authentication;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;authorization;internet privacy;network access control;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.0815418640938	72.03130515044502	172429

It is composed of a mobile application (assigned to medical staff and helpers), a web service and Near Field Communication wristbands assigned to victims. The mobile application is devoted to providing medical staff with the geolocation of victims as well as with an assistant indicating the best route to follow in order to take care of them based on the severity of their conditions and based on a triage method. Resolution of the routes is solved based on a classical problem, a Travelling Salesman Problem, using a k-parition algorithm to divide the huge number of victims in different clusters. Thus, each doctor has a specific area to assist victims. Besides, doctors can use a functionality of the application to contact their peers through a video call when additional help is needed.

2ec160820afbcb13729176a0ca031d94c667117e	a security scheme of big data identity for cloud environment		Nowadays, the security and privacy protection of Big Data have faced with severe challenges, especially on cloud environment with insecure channel. To address this issue, this paper proposes a security scheme of Big Data identity (SSBDI) for cloud environment, which can guarantee the security of Big Data transmission in the insecure channel. In SSBDI, firstly, linear congruential generator (LCG) based encryption matrixes and Vigenère cipher are employed to set the identity encryption by the client. After that, key bits are added to the end of cipher text in the encryption process. Finally, cipher texts are decrypted and computed in the cloud environment. Innovatively, each key bit can determine the encoding rule of one or more cipher text bits. Experimental results on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test show that the proposed scheme can meet the randomness of the security requirements. More important, with a very small amount of memory and CPU time cost, the scheme can encrypt massive data, which is particularly significant for Big Data identity encryption.	authentication;big data;central processing unit;cipher;ciphertext;cloud computing;data security;encryption;linear congruential generator;load (computing);mobile device;privacy;randomness;requirement;scalability	Rongxin Bao;Xu Yuan;Zhikui Chen;Yujie Zhang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-72395-2_46	theoretical computer science;cloud computing;big data;ciphertext;vigenère cipher;cipher;linear congruential generator;encryption;communication channel;computer science	Security	-41.69677586270468	67.73222284135524	172505

We argue that its findings are highly abstract. Our argument is supported by the mechanised inductive analysis of a protocol based on smart cards that was shown to enjoy provable security and then implemented. It appears that the protocol grants no reasonable guarantees of session key confidentiality to its peers in the realistic setting where an intruder can exploit other agents' cards. Indeed, the formal argument on confidentiality requires assumptions that no peer can verify in practice. We discover and prove that the lack of explicitness of two protocol messages is the sole cause of the protocol weaknesses. Our argument requires significant extensions to the Inductive Approach [9] in order to allow for smart cards.	livecode	Giampaolo Bella	2000		10.1007/3-540-44810-1_14	smart card;computer science;provable security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-38.045729931555314	72.97975202390468	172676
67e2fcf52d4eae1242891ef0bc32690ee9ae9246	ensuring semantic validity in privacy-preserving aggregate statistics		Aggregate statistics are becoming increasingly commonplace for mobile sensing applications which crowdsources data from individual users. In order to relieve user's concerns for privacy leakage, privacy preserving mechanisms have to be applied to enable the aggregator to compute aggregate statistics without learning each individual data. Although the aggregator will not know the value of the data, it is necessary to ensure the (semantic) validity of the data contributed by users. In this work, we design a privacy-preserving protocol for an aggregator to compute corrected aggregated statistics over users' data that can both preserve user's privacy and verify the semantic validity of the data. We evaluated our protocol on real-world dataset and demonstrated the efficiency of our protocol.	aggregate data;communications protocol;crowdsourcing;cryptography;data aggregation;encryption;internet privacy;requirement;spectral leakage	Junze Han;Taeho Jung;Xiang-Yang Li;Lili Du	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)	10.1109/MSN.2016.034	encryption;computer network;news aggregator;crowdsources;statistics;semantics;computer science;computer security	DB	-40.0192657310872	62.97881755953538	172690

To achieve a high degree of confidence in an implementation, as with any software, ideally one requires both: (i) a formal specification that has been subjected to verification, and (it) tool support to generate an implementation from the verified specification. The formal specification and verification of security protocols has attracted considerable attention, with corresponding advances. However, the state of the art in the generation of implementations has not progressed beyond relatively simple protocols. This paper presents a case study on the implementation of a deterministically fair non-repudiation protocol. Such protocols are among the most complex of security protocols. Sub-protocols are typically required to guarantee timely termination. A trusted third party must be involved to guarantee fairness. Finally, to satisfy requirements such as non-repudiable audit, significant infrastructure support is needed. The case study demonstrates an improved approach to protocol implementation.

Most existing solutions place restrictions on adversarial behavior in order to enable communication-efficient privacy-preserving information sharing. These restrictions substantially underestimate the capabilities of adversaries in reality, and do not always suffice for real systems. We consider a threat space containing more powerful adversaries, including not only semi-honest but also malicious ones, and analyze the tradeoff between privacy protection and communication complexity in information sharing. In particular, we use Kolmogorov complexity to derive lower bounds on the communication complexity required to defend against various kinds of adversaries.	autonomous robot;communication complexity;database;entity;kolmogorov complexity;malware;privacy;semiconductor industry	Nan Zhang	2007	2007 IEEE Intelligence and Security Informatics	10.1109/ISI.2007.379487	computer science;cryptographic protocol;internet security;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-39.579118146650394	69.42434191228209	173396

In this paper, we focus on a famous and widely used e-commerce application: auctions, and propose their deployment over ad hoc networks. We prove that such a novel mobile commerce application presents significant advantages with regard to conventional auction models. For the proposed auction model, we have particularly focused on crucial requirements generated by the ad hoc context. Actually, we have identified and then provided security and fairness requirements. Security is provided through threshold cryptography mechanisms, whereas fairness is provided on the basis of rounds duration calculation. Finally, a simulation model of our auctions scheme shows that the theoretical fair round duration can be optimized according to the number of bidders.

1a6bcc7fd09d0e8834f3b2d8bab1712cea540c04	a survey on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (cp-abe) approaches to data security on mobile devices and its application to iot		The growth in Cloud Computing and the ubiquity of Mobile devices to access Cloud services has generated a new paradigm, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). While the benefits of storing and accessing data in the Cloud are well documented there are concerns relating to the security of such data through data corruption, theft, exploitation or deletion. Innovative encryption schemes have been developed to address the challenges of data protection in the Cloud and having greater control over who should be accessing what data, one of which is Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). ABE is a type of role-based access control encryption solution which allows data owners and data consumers or users to encrypt and decrypt based on their personal attributes (e.g. department, location, gender, role). A number of ABE schemes have been developed over the years but ABE in MCC has established its own paradigm driven by a) the use of mobile devices to access private data hosted in the Cloud and b) the physical limitations of the mobile device to perform complex computation in support of encryption and decryption in ABE. ABE in MCC is an evolving research field but given the breadth and strength of interest at time of writing it is timely to perform a survey. Due to the sheer volume of research, the survey has focused on one aspect of ABE Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption in line with its prominence in ABE in MCC research to date. Further, given the significant developments and interest in IoT, the survey has since been extended to assess whether the research into mobile devices has been translated to the application of attribute-based encryption in IoT where the challenges to support complex computation and data transmission are potentially more complex given the much greater heterogeneity and resource restrictions of IoT devices.

P3P provides mechanisms for web site owners to express their privacy policies in a standard format that a user can programmatically check against her privacy preferences to decide whether to release her data to the web site. We discuss architectural alternatives for implementing P3P and present a server-centric implementation that reuses database querying technology, as opposed to the prevailing client-centric implementations based on specialized e ngines. Not only does the proposed implementation have qualitative advantages, our experiments indicate that it performs significantly better than the sole public-domain client-centric implementation and that the latency introduced by preference matching is small enough for realworld deployments of P3P.	experiment;p3p;personally identifiable information;privacy policy;server (computing)	Rakesh Agrawal;Jerry Kiernan;Ramakrishnan Srikant;Yirong Xu	2003		10.1109/ICDE.2003.1260824	information privacy;computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy;world wide web;search engine	DB	-43.08739704727135	60.752971376173626	173568

Key escrow helps, but favors disclosures. Schemes for recoverable encryption keys through noised secret sharing alleviate the dilemma. Key owner escrows a specifically encrypted backup. The recovery needs a large cloud. Cloud cost, money trail should rarefy illegal attempts. We now propose noised secret sharing schemes supporting discounts. The recovery request with discount code lowers the recovery complexity, easily by orders of magnitude. A smaller cloud may suffice for the same recovery timing. Alternatively, same cloud may provide faster recovery etc. Our schemes appear useful for users attracted to Big Data, but afraid of possibly humongous consequences of the key loss or data disclosure.	ada;backup;big data;cloud computing;computable function;confidentiality;cryptography;encryption;key escrow;langrisser schwarz;lecture notes in computer science;money;outsourcing;schedule (computer science);secret sharing;springer (tank);symposium on operating systems principles	Sushil Jajodia;Witold Litwin;Thomas J.

Most of packets transferred from node to node do not include sender’s IP address  and these packets are transmitted through dynamic routing carried out by intermediate hosts. In addition this may be temporary  since dynamic routing is renewed (updated) periodically so it is impossible to know which host transfers packet for the first  and which the designated recipient host is. Therefore basically it provides anonymity. However when contents upload and download  is made between user and provider information on both sides is exposed and this attenuates the possibility mentioned first.  In order to settle this problem this study calculates packet distribution within the whole network of Query and Query Hit,  which is different from downloading cached information to protect identity of user and provider, manipulates QueryHit on the  basis of the calculation and transfers contents after caching them. This provides secured anonymity to the intermediate node  performing Proxy role between user and provider.  	information retrieval;zipf's law	Byung Ryong Kim;Ki-Chang Kim	2006		10.1007/3-540-33880-2_13	computer science;theoretical computer science;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-46.529918699343575	70.80413013295689	174212

In order to address this problem, the dynamic and double encryption system based on two-dimensional image is presented, which combined the identification authentication with file encryption. Our approach is that, in the identification authentication, the system used the way of image authentication which generated on the base of combination of Hmac One Time Password (HOTP) algorithm and current system time in the mobile phone; in the file encryption, the system adopted the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the encryption algorithm based on time. The experiment results show that the system augments the attack-resistant potential and decreases the mistaken rate utilizing the strong robustness of changeable and limited box. At the same time, the encryption efficiency has been more improved.	block cipher mode of operation;encryption software;fiducial marker;hmac-based one-time password algorithm;hash-based message authentication code;mobile phone;system time	Jiujun Cheng;Fan Zhang;Kuifei Yu;Jian Ma	2009	2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security	10.1109/CIS.2009.65	multiple encryption;watermarking attack;h.235;disk encryption theory;40-bit encryption;plaintext-aware encryption;disk encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;cryptography;authentication;link encryption;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;disk encryption hardware;deterministic encryption;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;three-pass protocol;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption	EDA	-45.12306123589869	73.2045734492893	174216

There are two security issues when the nodes providing the index service are compromised by adversaries. First, the adversaries may delete the indexes or stop the program of indexing service, making the affected documents disappear in the search infrastructure. Second, the adversaries may leak the locations of the storage nodes hosting certain documents, making those nodes the target of DOS attacks. We propose a protocol called SCUBE which addresses these attacks by using secret-sharing based threshold cryptography and the concept of virtual addresses. Our results show that SCUBE performs appreciably well under different attack scenarios and incurs nominal overhead. A working prototype of SCUBE has also been implemented and tested on the Planetlab testbed.	cryptography;dos;denial-of-service attack;distributed hash table;file server;indexing and abstracting service;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;planetlab;prototype;relocation (computing);secret sharing;server (computing);testbed	Souvik Ray;Zhao Zhang	2007	2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317808	protocol;computer science;peer-to-peer;cryptographic protocol;internet privacy;secret sharing;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Security	-47.12168161020239	70.64057378576153	174247

The aim is to take advantage from the power of storage and processing offered by such technology. However, in order to preserve data privacy, it is crucial that all data must be encrypted before being outsourced into the cloud. Moreover, authorized users should be able to recover their outsourced data. This process can be complicated due to the fact that data are encrypted. The traditional information retrieval systems only work over data in the clear. Therefore, dedicated information retrieval systems were developed to deal with the encrypted cloud data. Several kinds of search over cloud data have been proposed in the literature such as Boolean search, multi-keyword ranked search and fuzzy search. However, the semantic search is little addressed in the literature. In this paper, we propose an approach called SSE-S that take into account the semantic search in the cloud by using Wikipedia ontology to understand the meaning of documents and queries with maintaining the security and the privacy issues.	approximate string matching;authorization;boolean algebra;cloud computing;encryption;experiment;information privacy;information retrieval;outsourcing;plaintext;relevance;semantic search;streaming simd extensions;tf–idf;wikipedia	Fateh Boucenna;Omar Nouali;Samir Kechid	2016		10.5220/0005858302350242	semantic computing;semantic search;computer science;concept search;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Security	-40.042460074863904	66.9597102686768	174397

Unfortunately, it also comes with the problem of efficiently finding any particular ballot so that it can be audited. Previous work on ballot-based auditing has required modifying the ballots to add a serial number which could be used for indexing. We describe a method for using scales and ballot weight to quickly index into a stack of ballots. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method may be a practical alternative that is compatible with existing hardware.	baseline (configuration management);database audit;end-to-end principle;experiment;extreme value theory;ibm notes;jones calculus;leader election;printer (computing);software deployment	Cynthia Sturton;David A.

The premise of ROKs is that the key is destroyed by the process of reading it, thus preventing subsequent accesses. While the idea and the applications are well-understood, the consensus among cryptographers is that ROKs cannot be produced by algorithmic processes alone. Rather, a trusted hardware mechanism is needed to support the destruction of the key. In this work, we propose one such approach for using a hardware design to generate ROKs. Our approach is an application of physically unclonable functions (PUFs). PUFs use the intrinsic differences in hardware behavior to produce a random function that is unique to that hardware instance. Our design consists of incorporating the PUF in a feedback loop to make reading the key multiple times physically impossible.	feedback;hardware restriction;list of cryptographers	Michael S.

However, existing techniques adopt an indexing- or clustering- based approach, and work well for fixed-schema data, with low dimensionality. Nevertheless, certain applications require privacy-preserving publishing of transaction data (or basket data), which involves hundreds or even thousands of dimensions, rendering existing methods unusable. We propose a novel anonymization method for sparse high-dimensional data. We employ a particular representation that captures the correlation in the underlying data, and facilitates the formation of anonymized groups with low information loss. We propose an efficient anonymization algorithm based on this representation. We show experimentally, using real-life datasets, that our method clearly outperforms existing state-of-the-art in terms of both data utility and computational overhead.	algorithm;data (computing);data anonymization;database;dynamic data;experiment;netflix prize;overhead (computing);real life;sparse matrix;transaction data;usability	Gabriel Ghinita;Yufei Tao;Panos Kalnis	2008	2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering	10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497480	data structure;information privacy;relational database;computer science;data mining;database;information retrieval	DB	-39.90846137323691	64.06302377031155	174915

A main research direction is built around the k-anonymity property. Several shortcomings of the k-anonymity model have been fixed by new privacy models such as p-sensitive k-anonymity, l-diversity, (α, k)-anonymity, and t-closeness. In this paper we introduce the EnhancedPKClustering algorithm for generating p-sensitive kanonymous microdata based on frequency distribution of sensitive attribute values. The p-sensitive k-anonymity model and its enhancement, extended psensitive k-anonymity, are described, their properties are presented, and two diversity measures are introduced. Our experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm improves several cost measures over existing algorithms.	avg;algorithm;centrality;experiment;information privacy;microdata (html)	Traian Marius Truta;Alina Campan;Paul Meyer	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-75248-6_9	information privacy;computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy;privacy;computer security	DB	-40.16895710395195	63.607262743638906	175032
d5a4e31beeb2159f58581b46f340a26aa1065528	sport: sharing proofs of retrievability across tenants		Proofs of Retrievability (POR) are cryptographic proofs which provide assurance to a single tenant (who creates tags using his secret material) that his files can be retrieved in their entirety. However, POR schemes completely ignore storage-efficiency concepts, such as multi-tenancy and data deduplication, which are being widely utilized by existing cloud storage providers. Namely, in deduplicated storage systems, existing POR schemes would incur an additional overhead for storing tenants’ tags which grows linearly with the number of users deduplicating the same file. This overhead clearly reduces the (economic) incentives of cloud providers to integrate existing POR/PDP solutions in their offerings. In this paper, we propose a novel storage-efficient POR, dubbed SPORT, which transparently supports multi-tenancy and data deduplication. More specifically, SPORT enables tenants to securely share the same POR tags in order to verify the integrity of their deduplicated files. By doing so, SPORT considerably reduces the storage overhead borne by cloud providers when storing the tags of different tenants deduplicating the same content. We show that SPORT resists against malicious tenants/cloud providers (and against collusion among a subset of the tenants and the cloud). Finally, we implement a prototype based on SPORT, and evaluate its performance in a realistic cloud setting. Our evaluation results show that our proposal incurs tolerable computational overhead on the tenants and the cloud provider.	antivirus software;baillie–psw primality test;bilinear filtering;cloud computing;cloud storage;computable function;computational diffie–hellman assumption;computer data storage;data deduplication;differentiated services;diffie–hellman problem;formal verification;functional requirement;malware;multitenancy;overhead (computing);prototype;provable security;public-key cryptography;random oracle;retrievability;scheme;shattered world;stepping level;universal instantiation	Frederik Armknecht;Jens-Matthias Bohli;David Froelicher;Ghassan O.

Attribute Authorities (AA) bind the characteristics of an entity (called attributes) to that entity by signing the appropriate AC. Therefore, ACs can be used for controlling access to system resources and employing role-based authorization and access controls policies accordingly. Although ACs are widely used and standardized, to the best of our knowledge, no mobile infrastructure or service currently utilizes them. In this paper, we first examine how basic Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can be incorporated into mobile networks and especially the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). As a case study, we then experiment with ACs in the GPRS network, using a prototype implementation. In particular, we investigate and measure the performance in terms of service and transfer times when ACs are introduced in the mobile environment. Our measurements show that ACs technology not only is feasible to implement in present and future mobile networks, but at the same time can deliver flexible and relatively fast services to the subscribers, without compromising security.	access control;authorization;certificate authority;prototype;public key certificate;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;terms of service;x.509	Georgios Kambourakis;Angelos N.

The goal of the paper is to propose a first framework in which various kinds of e-money systems can be uniformly represented and their security properties can be evaluated and compared. We introduce two kinds of e-money system models; a note-type e-money system model and a balance-type e-money system model. We show that any balance-type e-money system with efficient data transmission cannot be simulated by any note-type e-money system. This implies that balance-type e-money systems are strictly faster in data communication. Then, we show that a forged monetary value can be detected in some note-type e-money systems, while it cannot be detected in any balance-type e-money systems with efficient data communication. This implies that note-type e-money systems seem to be more secure.	access control;biometrics;c date and time functions;ecash;finite-state machine;money;password	Shunsuke Inenaga;Kenichirou Oyama;Hiroto Yasuura	2009	2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)	10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393854	smart card;communications protocol;systems modeling;electronic money;computer science;information security;mathematical model;data mining;internet privacy;hafnium;computer security;data transmission	DB	-40.093411549526486	71.86016062906084	175659

We propose the CRYPTOPAGE architecture which implements memory encryption, memory integrity protection checking and information leakage protection together with a low performance penalty (3% slowdown on average) by combining the Counter Mode of operation, local authentication values and Merkle trees.

Many people have studied this problem, not only for the fundamental property of this, but also because there is a practical issue where the volume of data is so huge that it is impractical for users to download the whole data and search on it. One common solution is to build an inverted index using a special algorithm and support searchable algorithm on the encrypted data, but this causes another problem: the privacy will be leaked to the data owner when the owner and user are not the same person. In this paper, we design a novel scheme to solve this problem. We provide stronger privacy protection for users when they search on the data, and the scheme can protect the privacy of the inverted index table and content of data. Besides, the data owner cannot get any information ...	encryption	Huaiyu Zheng;Baojia Zhang	2017	IJWMC	10.1504/IJWMC.2017.10009077	inverted index;encryption;internet privacy;outsourcing;computer security;cloud computing;computer science;download	Crypto	-41.297808035809766	66.39043183484753	175793
d3e26f5200a847ffb33614f42cf64c3a7999d591	efficient privacy-preserving decentralized abe supporting expressive access structures		Decentralized multi-authority attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been adopted to protect outsourced data. However, there are some security issues. Firstly, the user's attributes information is leaked to the authorities and secondly, the access structure being sent along with ciphertext violates its privacy. To address these issues, an efficient decentralized attribute-based encryption scheme with features of privacy preservation and expressive access structures is proposed. The proposed scheme cannot only prevent user's attributes information leakage, but it also provides a hidden, flexible and expressive structure realizable by Linear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSSS). Moreover, we prove the proposed scheme to be secure against Chosen-Ciphertexts Attacks (CCA) under the standard Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In addition, proposed scheme performs efficiently in comparison to existing schemes shown by theoretical and experimental analysis.	access structure;attribute-based encryption;bilinear transform;ciphertext;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman problem;information leakage;oblivious transfer;overhead (computing);privacy;requirement;secret sharing;spectral leakage	Liangxuan Zhang;Hui Li;Yinghui Zhang;Fawad Khan	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116436	encryption;ciphertext;big data;information leakage;computer security;logic gate;secret sharing;distributed computing;server;computer science;access structure	Security	-41.77520429510628	68.44059637045699	175865

The truly revolutionary aspect of Turtle rests in its novel way of dealing with trust issues: while existing peer-to-peer architectures with similar aims attempt to build trust relationships on top of the basic, trust-agnostic, peer-topeer overlay, Turtle takes the opposite approach, and builds its overlay on top of pre-existent trust relationships among its users. This allows both data sender and receiver anonymity, while also protecting each and every intermediate relay in the data query path. Furthermore, its unique trust model allows Turtle to withstand most of the denial of service attacks that plague other peer-to-peer data sharing networks.	capacitor plague;denial-of-service attack;hop-by-hop transport;information sensitivity;peer-to-peer;privacy policy;relay;virtual circuit	Bogdan C.

However, Chen et al.’s scheme has some weaknesses. In Chen et al.’s scheme, an attacker can track a user by a linkability attack or an off-line identity guessing attack. Chen et al.’s scheme is also vulnerable to an off-line password guessing attack and an undetectable on-line password guessing attack when user’s smart card is stolen. In server side, Chen et al.’s scheme needs large computational load to authentication a legal user or reject an illegal user. To remedy the weaknesses in Chen et al.’s scheme, we propose an improved smart card based password authentication scheme. Our analysis shows that the improved scheme can overcome the weaknesses in Chen et al.’s scheme.	authentication;entity–relationship model;information system;muscle weakness;online and offline;password cracking;radiology information systems;server (computer);server (computing);server-side;smart card;stolen product;gender identity disorder	Tianjie Cao;Jingxuan Zhai	2012	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-012-9912-5	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-44.37634566422599	64.65133531508809	176150

Since most of the parties exchange sensitive data among them by using cloud computing, data protection is very important for data confidentiality. Ciphertext policy attributes-based encryption (CP-ABE) is one of the ABE schemes, which performs an access control of security mechanisms for data protection in cloud storage. In CP-ABE, each user has a set of attributes and data encryption is associated with an access policy. The secret key of a user and the ciphertext are dependent upon attributes. A user is able to decrypt a ciphertext if and only if his attributes satisfy the access structure in the ciphertext. The practical applications of CP-ABE have still requirements for attributes policy management and user revocation. This paper proposed an important issue of policy revocation in CP-ABE scheme. In this paper, sensitive parts of personal health records (PHRs) are encrypted with the help of CP-ABE. In addition, policy revocation is considered to add in CP-ABE and generates a new secret key for authorized users. In proposed attributes based encryption scheme, PHRs owner changes attributes policy to update authorized user lists. When policy revocation occurs in proposed PHRs sharing system, a trusted authority (TA) calculates a partial secret token key according to a policy updating level and then issues new or updated secret keys for new policy. Proposed scheme emphasizes on key management, policy management and user revocation. It provides a full control on data owner according to a policy updating level what he chooses. It helps both PHRs owner and users for flexible policy revocation in CP-ABE without time consuming.
