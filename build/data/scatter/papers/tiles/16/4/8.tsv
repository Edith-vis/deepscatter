c576fcf45d631b72bb394cb2ed8ee37f52e9bc25	application of information technology for visualizing and optimizing construction project schedule		Recently, various information technologies such as VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) are being used for visualizing construction information. Specially, BIM (Building Information Modelling) is a representative tool for IT application in construction industry. Generally, BIM uses VR and nD CAD system to visualize construction schedule data. This study develops a methodology and system to apply BIM functions using 4D CAD simulation technique for risk analysis and schedule progress monitoring in the construction industry.	augmented reality;bim;building information modeling;computer-aided design;information model;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimizing compiler;simulation;virtual reality	Hyeon-Seung Kim;So-Yong Moon;Hyoun-Seok Moon;Leen-Seok Kang	2013		10.5220/0004565303290332	data mining;computer science;information technology;schedule (project management)	EDA	-56.96805774478099	7.319045093456706	43417
4d527270405029608e65d49bd8db2cfa6f6ca331	surfing the net for software engineering notes		Interest in autonomous systems is clearly on the rise. Between the use of combat drones, Amazon’s planned drone delivery system, and Google’s self-driving automobile, it seems like there’s at least one article on autonomous systems in the news every day. Obviously, these systems are highly dependent on the software that controls them. So what do software engineers need to know about software development for autonomous systems? This month’s column will explore that question. The software engineering challenges presented by autonomous vehicles and robots are complex and very interesting. The problem space typically includes aspects of real-time systems as well as high-reliability and perhaps safetycritical issues. The vehicle or robot must be capable of sensing the system around it and modifying its behavior based on the environment. In order to obtain the information about the environment, the software must interface with sensor hardware. In order to control movement of the vehicle or robot, the software must also interface with the platform hardware. These hardware interfaces are usually characterized by some rather strict real-time requirements, making the sensorto-control loop a very demanding software engineering problem. The interfaces themselves may be unusual depending upon the interface standards (if any) used by the sensor and platform motion hardware. In addition to the real-time aspects of autonomous systems, the very nature of the world in which these systems operate poses significant systems engineering problems that usually become software engineering problems. A simple example of this is an autonomous all-terrain vehicle sensing a rock ahead of it and maneuvering around the stone without encountering some other obstacle. It seems simple, but how does the vehicle distinguish between a rock and debris such as a tumbleweed? There is no need to avoid the tumbleweed, but striking the rock could damage the vehicle. And if the decision is made to avoid, how does the vehicle choose the best avoidance path? These are very complex logic problems with several possible courses of action that must be processed within a very short decision window. There is considerable research into the software engineering of autonomous systems and much of that research is published on the web. We’ll visit some sites that discuss some advanced software engineering techniques that you can use for autonomous systems software development and check out some sites that you can use to get started in autonomous systems software engineering.	.net framework;autonomous car;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);blog;bluetooth;control system;documentation;download;drag and drop;electrical connector;irobot create;integrated development environment;javadoc;kinect;lego mindstorms;microsoft robotics developer studio;microsoft visual studio;need to know;problem domain;programmer;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;robot operating system;screenshot;sensor;software engineering notes;software development;software engineer;systems engineering;visual programming language;web page;wiki	Mark Doernhoefer	2014	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/2674632.2674634		SE	-53.608751961910556	6.760485797922482	43527

Thus, information systems need to work appropriately anywhere at any time for everybody. Conventional information systems engineering tends to engineer systems from the viewpoint of systems functionality. However, the diversity of the usage context requires fundamental change compared to our current thinking on information sys- tems; from the functionality the systems provide to the goals the systems should achieve. The intentional approach embraces the goals and related aspects of the information systems. This chapter presents a method for capturing, structuring and reconciling diverse goals of multiple stakeholders. The heart of the method lies in the hierarchical structuring of goals by goal lattice based on the formal concept analysis, a semantic extension of the lattice theory. We illustrate the effective- ness of the presented method through application to the self-checkout systems for large-scale supermarkets.

As a consequence, trust has become a hot topic in the field of computer science. Many attempts to formalize concepts like trust and reputation have been carried out in the literature, most remarkably the one by Herzig et al. However, Herzig et al. focus on describing a conceptual framework but do not provide any concrete instantiation of it, thereby not showing any evidence about the effectiveness of their approach. This paper fills the gap by presenting such an instantiation based on agent technologies. Although our instantiation targets a Wikipedia-related scenario and exploits the Jason and CArtAgO frameworks, the methodology we present is general and can be applied to different scenarios and agent technologies.	computer science;jason;software agent;test case;universal instantiation;wikipedia;world wide web	Juri Luca De Coi;Laurent Vercouter	2011	2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WI-IAT.2011.103	the internet;reputation;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;graphical user interface;internet privacy;electronic publishing;trustworthy computing;law;world wide web;computational trust	AI	-48.39172425097273	11.974821747198417	43975

Situational method engineering allows defining new methods constructed on the fly following the situation at hand. However, in the reviewed literature, the situation is not always described and there is no proposed approach to handle the specific context of method components. This paper provides a detailed vision of context and a process for contextualizing methods in the IS domain.

14678b3e80a8f32404b4432b9320c37515a6016e	integration of systems engineering approach in product-lifecycle-management by means of a mechatronic system		To achieve the full potential of PLM in Systems Engineering tools especially in view of the system’s complexity in industries such as the consumer industry a clear understanding of how best to use such systems is important to product development activities. Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how to design and manage complex engineering systems over their life cycles. Issues such as reliability, logistics, coordination of different teams (requirements management), evaluation measurements, and other disciplines become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems Engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods and tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as control engineering, industrial engineering, organizational studies, and project management. Systems Engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole. After a short introduction, this paper, which is based on the results of the accomplished descriptive study and literature survey of the Design Research Methodology according to Blessing and Chakrabarti, presents a generic integrated approach of System Driven Product Development (SDPD) and demonstrates the general requirements of a generic integrated approach during the Engineering Design of Systems. The second section presents a new approach of Systems Engineering, which is based on SDPD and will explain the different phases and sub-phases of the developed approach. By means of designing an electric skateboard the different phases of the developed generic integrated approach will be demonstrated and presented. Section three will discuss the results of the Prescriptive Study and address the most important issues. In general, this paper presents the Prescriptive Phase of the Design Research Methodology.	mechatronics;systems engineering	Vahid Salehi;Lukas Burseg;Kristin Paetzold;Abdo Chahin;Jihad Taha;Thomas Rieger	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-49103-5_18	system of systems engineering;system integration	SE	-62.7132626648384	11.460879631723591	44130

However, unexpected events from the business environment and delay in activities can cause temporal exceptions in these workflows. Predicting temporal exceptions is a complex task since a workflow can be implemented with various types of control flow patterns. In this paper, we describe a critical path based approach for predicting temporal exceptions in concurrent workflows which are required to share limited resources. Our approach allows predicting temporal exceptions in multiple attempts while workflows are being executed.	business ecosystem;control flow;critical path method;risk management	Iok-Fai Leong;Yain-Whar Si;Simon Fong;Robert P.

Function structures, design grammars and bills of materials are common examples. However, there is a lack of clarity regarding distinctions and similarities between different kinds of structure and systematic ways to articulate them. This paper brings together research on product structuring and shape computation to inform the specification of principles for the definition of design structures. The principles draw together findings reported in the computational geometry and product definition literature with research from a range of companies and industry sectors that encompasses enterprise and process structures. The potential value of the principles to computer-integrated manufacturing and through-life support is demonstrated through application to four case studies.

Service workflows can encompass hundreds of services around a single process. These services are geographically spread and cross organizational boundaries. This raises the need for coordination, such as assigning tasks, synchronizing production schedules, between companies collaborating through services. We present a fully decentralized coordination mechanism that, using the local knowledge available at each company participating in the supply chain, allows the enactment of robust processes. We evaluate our solution through simulations and show that it can create robust service compositions.		Mário Henrique C.

The proposed environment is used to synthesize operating procedures in different hierarchical levels including process operation and production chain levels. The concept of operation control is illustrated where process constraints and control rules are classified and synthesized in generic form and plant specific form.

In this case, the Public Service Company of Colorado asked me to work on a project team formed to improve the availability of a coal-fired steam generator at an electric power plant. Plant personnel had been trying unsuccessfully for several years to reduce system downtime. I recognized that the plant could make immediate improvements by reducing the duration of breakdowns rather than their frequency. The company initially estimated the payoff for these improvements at $544,000 annually, but has since revised it upward, and it may be as high as $2 million annually. The insights that produced these process improvements were possible because of the hands-on approach to problem solving taught at Colorado School of Mines.

Like any BPMS, Caterpillar supports the creation of instances of a process model (captured in the Business Process Model and Notation – BPMN) and allows users to track the state of process instances and to execute tasks thereof. The specificity of Caterpillar is that the state of each process instance is maintained on the Ethereum blockchain, and the workflow routing is performed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler. The compiler supports a wide array of BPMN constructs, including user, script and service tasks, parallel and exclusive gateways, subprocesses, multi-instance activities and event handlers.

These concepts are supported by a collaboration platform – a result of the EU FP6 project MAPPER. The design approach and the supporting collaboration platform have been applied in the USB2 OTG PHY IP core design that required collaboration among two dispersed SMEs. Mixed-signal USB design challenges, distributed design flow, requirements for enhanced EDA support, and selected design tasks enabled by the collaboration platform have been discussed. Finally, advantages and constraints of the design approach have been pointed to.

Lion's share of process mining research has been focusing on process discovery (creating process models from raw data) and replay techniques to check conformance and analyze bottlenecks. These techniques have helped organizations to address compliance and performance problems. However, for a more refined analysis, it is essential to correlate different process characteristics. For example, do deviations from the normative process cause additional delays and costs? Are rejected cases handled differently in the initial phases of the process? What is the influence of a doctor's experience on treatment process? These and other questions may involve process characteristics related to different perspectives (control-flow, data-flow, time, organization, cost, compliance, etc.). Specific questions (e.g., predicting the remaining processing time) have been investigated before, but a generic approach was missing thus far. The proposed framework unifies a number of approaches for correlation analysis proposed in literature, proposing a general solution that can perform those analyses and many more. The approach has been implemented in ProM and combines process and data mining techniques. In this paper, we also demonstrate the applicability using a case study conducted with the UWV (Employee Insurance Agency), one of the largest “administrative factories” in The Netherlands. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We define CA as a process that verifies the identity of an information systems user continuously for the entire duration of an authorized session. While organizations can, in theory, strengthen the security of their financial information systems through CA, several challenges need to be addressed in designing a CA architecture. A primary challenge involves the constantly changing user profiles in globally networked business environments. Profile content may include user knowledge and characteristics, access location, job characteristics, and transaction attributes. We propose swarm intelligence, which has the capacity to handle complex profile changes, as a technology for implementing CA in a dynamic, distributed network environment where user profiles are constantly changing. The paper explores model implementation challenges and discusses opportunities for future research.	authentication;authorization;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;differential signaling;holism;holographic principle;information system;multitier architecture;region of interest;simulation;swarm intelligence;user profile	Thomas G.

38eef92e9ed96720a8fb057ef9fcb825a0afdb59	graphical modeling of security arguments: current state and future directions		Identifying threats and risks to complex systems often requires some form of brainstorming. In addition, eliciting security requirements involves making traceable decisions about which risks to mitigate and how. The complexity and dynamics of modern socio-technical systems mean that their security cannot be formally proven. Instead, some researchers have turned to modeling the claims underpinning a risk assessment and the arguments which support security decisions. As a result, several argumentation-based risk analysis and security requirements elicitation frameworks have been proposed. These draw upon existing research in decision making and requirements engineering. Some provide tools to graphically model the underlying argumentation structures, with varying degrees of granularity and formalism. In this paper, we compare these approaches, discuss their applicability and suggest avenues for future research. We find that the core of existing security argumentation frameworks are the links between threats, risks, mitigations and system components. Graphs - a natural representation for these links - are used by many graphical security argumentation tools. But, in order to be human-readable, the graphical models of these graphs need to be both scalable and easy to understand. Therefore, in order to facilitate adoption, both the creation and exploration of these graphs need to be streamlined.

This paper describes a logic-based approach to analysing SC operation dynamics, named SCOlog. SC operation is modelled in a declarative fashion and it is simulated following rule-based execution semantics. This approach facilitates the automated explanation of simulated SC operational behaviours and performance. The automated explanation support provided by SCOlog is found to improve the understanding of the domain for non-SCM experts. Furthermore, SCOlog allows for maintainability and reusability.	artificial intelligence;business process;complex dynamics;computer performance;declarative programming;graphical user interface;haven (graph theory);logic programming;p5 (microarchitecture);programming language;requirement;simulation;stochastic process;synergy;usability	Areti Manataki;Yun-Heh Chen-Burger;Michael Rovatsos	2014	Expert Syst.

In this context, a new requirements model is proposed in the context of the innovative framework called Virtual Factory Framework. Using this approach in factory planning it is expected to improve the ability to generate better and more sustainable solutions over the entire factory life-cycle. This paper underlines the use of the life cycle paradigm in order to enable the future factory planning approaches.	enterprise life cycle;holism;interdependence;new product development;next-generation network;programming paradigm;requirement;scalability	Roberto da Piedade Francisco;João Bastos;Américo Lopes Azevedo	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14341-0_26	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;operations management	Robotics	-58.383457950472675	13.575345705728498	45307

But, in almost, all workflow management systems the role concept is determined once at the introduction of a workflow application and is not reevaluated to observe how successfully certain processes are performed by the authorized agents. This paper describes an approach which evaluates whether agents assigned to a process are working successfully and feed this information back for future agent assignments promising best business benefit for the enterprise. The approach is called Agent Performance Evaluation (APE) and is based on data mining technique combined with post processing technique.	authorization;data mining;management system;performance evaluation	Stefan Jablonski;Ramzan Talib	2009	2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops	10.1145/1838002.1838055	workflow;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;business process management;operations management;event-driven process chain;workflow management system;workflow engine;workflow technology	DB	-53.27413961709868	15.189901034962528	45452

In so doing, the appropriate specification of Web services, as the basis for discovery and configuration, becomes a critical success factor. This paper analyses the UDDI specification framework, which is part of the emerging Web service architecture, and proposes a variety of improvements referring both to the provided information and the appropriate formal notations. This leads to a more sophisticated specification framework that is called WS-Specification and provides information referring to different perspectives on Web services. It considers Web service acquisition, architecture, security, performance, conceptual concepts and processes, interface definitions, assertions, and method coordination. WS-Specification thereby maintains backward-compatibility to UDDI and is ordered using a thematic grouping that consists of white, yellow, blue, and green pages.	backward compatibility;component-based software engineering;computer-aided software engineering;documentation;fifth generation computer;interoperability;next-generation network;process (computing);service discovery;specification language;web services discovery;web service	Sven Overhage;Peter Thomas	2002		10.1007/3-540-36560-5_8	web service;web application security;web development;web modeling;web standards;computer science;ws-policy;data mining;ws-addressing;database;ws-i basic profile;world wide web;universal description discovery and integration	Web+IR	-48.87189337299943	17.409338058231118	45465

The network of interrelationships and information flows among the agents is often neglected when designing information systems. Common procedures and automatic data exchanges can enhance collaboration as well as improve IT alignment with business needs across multiple organizations in the supply chain. This article proposes an Enterprise Architecture methodological approach for designing an integrated modular Forest Products Supply Chain Management System. Indi- vidual system requirements and data flows are driven from the Process Architecture Framework. Results of its application to the forest production, wood logistics and plant supply processes within Portuguese pulpwood, bio- mass and lumber-based supply chains are presented. Results show that this ap- proach can effectively specify individual systems requirements driven from the processes representations built in collaboration with the agents. It further shows that a data service-oriented architecture can be derived, ensuring business information integrity and systems integration.	enterprise architecture;management system	A. F.

This poses a need to understand the characteristics required for manufacturing systems to handle customisation. In this study, 3D printing technology is assessed as an enabler for customisation. Additionally, the requirements of manufacturing systems with respect to configuration and control co-ordination are explored. A demonstrator is implemented to integrate 3D printing with conventional manufacturing, using an agent based distributed control system that co-ordinates the customisation of products and the order management.	3d printing;personalization	Rengarajan Srinivasan;Vaggelis Giannikas;Duncan C.

The underlying delivery platform is commonly referred to as the Internet of Services and will certainly have to deal with a great variety and amount of information about services along several service information dimensions. As soon as brokerage, discovery, or community feedback parts are decentralized, there emerge a number of service information challenges (modeling the information in a holistic way, documentation, interlinkage, tool interoperability, distributed querying, inconsistent information, and cooperation of different stakeholders). In this paper, we propose to counter such service information challenges by two artifacts. First, we contribute a Service Ontology based on a sound and rigid foundational ontology. The Service Ontology provides a holistic and consistent way of capturing service information. We apply the recommendations of the W3C Semantic Web Activity whose recent standardization has already opened new possibilities for tool interoperability, interlinkage of information, and distributed querying on the web. However, building and prescribing an ontology in standardized languages is not enough to address all service information challenges. Therefore, as a second contribution, we provide a method around the ontology including a governance framework, guidelines for applying the W3C Semantic Web recommendations, a lifecycle-spanning tool chain, and different levels of applicability. We label our method Semantic Business Web approach, since we build on W3C Semantic Web standards, use and extend them in the Business Web setting. Both artifacts are constructed in an interdisciplinary way by experts participating in the German lighthouse project THESEUS/TEXO. The project’s scenario also serves as a proof of concept evaluation of the artifacts.	alien shooter;artifact (software development);documentation;file spanning;holism;internet protocol suite;interoperability;semantic web;toolchain;value network;www;web standards	Daniel Oberle;Nadeem Bhatti;Saartje Brockmans;Michael Niemann;Christian Janiesch	2009	Business & Information Systems Engineering	10.1007/s12599-009-0069-9	upper ontology;web service;bibliographic ontology;web standards;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;service delivery framework;semantic web;social semantic web;data mining;semantic web stack;database;proof of concept;world wide web;owl-s	Web+IR	-54.620367307217634	15.271345408843084	47658

This paper presents a STEP-NC compliant controller based on Real-time Ethernet technologies, which consists of functional modules such as General Interpreter, Machining Manager, Tool Path Generation, Machine Tool Model, Simulation and Real-Time Ethernet Interface. The proposed controller is implemented for circuit board milling. In the controller, STEP-NC is utilised as the data format, as well as a part of the controller's software structure. The late binding together with object oriented polymorphism and iteration, which can accomplish general functions, is used in developing the interpreter. This, together with the Reflection mechanism, also realises the general function of creating and modifying some of the STEP data. This controller is then tested on a circuit board milling machine, with ISO 14649 files generated by a CAM module developed in association with this work, in which some AP210 entities are added to represent circuits’ geometry and translated to machining features in the STEP-NC format. Moreover, machining a single feature with multi tools is discussed and the concept of final features is adopted; all contribute to some effective milling strategies.	numerical analysis;real-time clock	Ke Wang;Riliang Liu;Xun Xu;Chenrui Zhang;Lin Yang	2012	Int.

Diagrams have many benefits and are sufficient for many situations. But as the number of diagrams and their types grows, they overlap and evolve, then it becomes hard to maintain a collection of interrelated diagrams, even with the help of a common repository. Besides the very nature of enterprise architecting requires a lot of matrices (goals-processes, capabilities-processes, processes - applications). The paper presents the multi-representation approach for enterprise architecture model development and maintenance.

The issue of business rules for enterprise information systems has recently received considerable attention. However, as yet little research has been reported on a systematic approach to business rules management. This paper proposes a business rules management model. In this model, business rules are supported by three types of independent information system components: system setting, database, and procedural module. A business rule can be formalized into one or more elementary rule, and a formalized elementary rule is associated with one and only one information system component. Business rules, system components, and their interconnected relationships can be organized into an XML enabled repository for the system development, customization, and maintenance. An example of artifact of business rules management system can be found in an apartment rental management system. This example is used to illustrate the concept of business rules management.

The information system software industry still has few guidelines of business rules definitions for software customization (Jones et al., 2008). Software maintenance still consumes a large proportion of system costs in response business rule changes (Grubb & Takang, 2003). Our literature review presented in the next section suggests that the existing business rule research frameworks fail to address two correlated critical aspects of business rule management for enterprise information systems. First, there is a lack of models that describe the unambiguous direct association that can be used to facilitate tracing from a business rule to its support information system components or from an information system component back to its supported business rule. In this study, the explicit form of the association between the business rules and the information system components is called end-to-end mapping. Indeed, without the end-to-end mapping between the business rules and the information system components for an enterprise information system, business rule management remains to be artistic. Second, there is a lack of business rule formalization methods that fully support end-to-end mapping relationships between business rules and information systems components. Indeed, any business rule model makes little contribution to business rule management unless it implements the relationships between business rules and information system components. This paper addresses these issues by answering three closely related research questions. First, what are the explicit relationships between business rules and enterprise information system components for system management? Second, how can business rules be formalized as an instrument for implementing end-to-end mapping relationships between business rules and enterprise information system components? Third, how can business rule management be implemented through development of a business rule repository that regulates formalized business rules and their relationships with system components for the enterprise information system? This paper gives the emphasis on the relationships between business rules and their supporting information system, and presents a business rules management model that can be used for enterprise information systems development, customization, and maintenance. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second section reviews related work and describes the classification of business rules based on the enterprise information system components. The third section discusses business rules formalization, the central issue of business rules management. The fourth section presents the implementation scheme of a business rules management system through a real-world case. The final section summarizes this study.

Such an evolutionary advance has been facilitated by various applications that are heavily relying on multi-touch gestures. In addition, picture gesture authentication has been recently introduced as an alternative login experience to text-based password on such devices. In particular, the new Microsoft Windows 8TM operating system adopts such an alternative authentication to complement traditional text-based authentication. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of picture gesture authentication on more than 10,000 picture passwords collected from over 800 subjects through online user studies. Based on the findings of our user studies, we also propose a novel attack framework that is capable of cracking passwords on previously unseen pictures in a picture gesture authentication system. Our approach is based on the concept of selection function that models users’ password selection processes. Our evaluation results show the proposed approach could crack a considerable portion of collected picture passwords under different settings.	authentication;login;microsoft windows;multi-touch;operating system;password cracking;text-based (computing);usability testing	Ziming Zhao;Gail-Joon Ahn;Jeong-Jin Seo;Hongxin Hu	2013			cognitive password;password policy;challenge–response authentication;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-51.602898457299524	6.1280039699027755	48062

This paper describes the development and experiences of teaching five semesters of a specialized design course for a computer engineering program taught in the junior year. The course includes topics in software design patterns, multi-threaded applications, rudimentary user-interface design, embedded programming including sensor building and processing, and Zigbee-based wireless communications. The course is 2 semester credits (1-2-3), and includes a comprehensive project that requires students to build a tangible game or a game-like entertainment system. One key component of the course is the use of an open-source hardware platform called Arduino. The results are that students enjoy the course and are able to build integrated systems that incorporate design patterns, multithreading, embedded programming and wireless communication in an effective manner within one semester.	arduino;capstone (cryptography);computer engineering;embedded system;experience;integrated development environment;lotus 1-2-3;multithreading (computer architecture);open-source hardware;open-source software;software design pattern;systems design;thread (computing);user interface design	Imran A.

Nonetheless, in the Collaborative Research Centre 653 ‘Gentelligent Components in their Lifecycle—Utilisation of Inheritable Component Information in Production Engineering’ they will soon be a reality. Transferring characteristics that are similar to those found in nature to industrial production will lead to a paradigm shift in the development and manufacturing of prospective components. This paper presents the techniques and methods that enable this new approach in production engineering by transferring biological principles from the field of genetics into the manufacturing environment.	compiler;computer monitor;industrial engineering;new product development;programming paradigm;prospective search	Berend Denkena;Helge Henning;Leif-Erik Lorenzen	2010	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-009-0191-z	industrial production;paradigm shift;systems engineering;engineering;product lifecycle;industrial engineering;production engineering;manufacturing engineering;mechanical engineering	SE	-58.12753138872484	8.476474997359041	49015

In particular, we discuss the case of ARNEIS, an “intelligent” web-based repository of software solutions, that enables software houses to upload a description of their software solutions for business automation, and small-to-medium sized enterprises to find software products or services supporting their activities. To this purpose, as argued in the paper, a particularly meaningful field is Customer Relationship Management, that is thus exploited as a test bed domain. The functionality of ARNEIS is based on an ontological representation of the domain knowledge, which represents the shared conceptual vocabulary to express software descriptions and technological requirements. In this paper we describe our proposal for the management of a user-friendly interaction enabling software houses to upload the semantic representation of the description of their offers. The approach we propose within the ARNEIS scenario represents an example of a more general solution to face the issue of how to build formal representations of resources in an ontology-based IR system.	customer relationship management;requirement;software house;testbed;upload;usability;vocabulary;web application	Anna Goy;Diego Magro	2011			user interface design;user;user experience design;user modeling;interactive systems engineering;human–computer interaction;user journey;computer science;knowledge management;user requirements document;semantic web;ontology;semantic web stack;post-wimp;interactivity;user interface;world wide web;interaction technique	HCI	-48.81534712037761	15.329861508879505	49088

Firstly, a configuration model is constructed and translated into CSP model. Secondly, in the stage of interactive configuration, customer configured more important issue earlier than other issues. The check configuration process has to reduce the variant space provided by the CSP model with regard to the outcome of the previous configuration. As a result, customer demands with consistency and reduced configuration structure are achieved. Finally, under the optimization conditions of customer wish requirement, the reduced configuration structure is optimized to gain final BOM of the configured product.	browser object model;communicating sequential processes;data model;knowledge-based configuration;mathematical optimization;non-functional requirement	Junsheng Kuang;Pingyu Jiang	2008	2008 12th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design	10.1109/CSCWD.2008.4536955	configuration management;voice of the customer;data modeling;design methods;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;knowledge engineering;configuration item;product design;customer satisfaction;constraint satisfaction problem;physical configuration audit	Robotics	-58.412826178710404	11.475767444340066	49095

This chapter presents the descriptive part of the Dynamic Engineering Design Process (DEDP) modeling framework developed in the PSI1 project. The project aims to build a software tool to assist managers to analyze and enhance the productivity of the DEDPs through process simulations. The framework incorporates the models of teams and actors, tasks and activities as well as design artifacts as the major interrelated parts. DEDPs are modeled as weakly defined flows of tasks and atomic activities which may only “become apparent” at run time because of several presented dynamic factors. The processes are self-formed through the mechanisms of collaboration in the dynamic team of actors. These mechanisms are based on contracting negotiations. DEDP productivity is assessed by the Units of Welfare collected by the multi-agent system which models the design team. The models of the framework are formalized in the family of PSI ontologies.	agent-based model;engineering design process;experiment;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;ontology (information science);programming tool;prototype;psi;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;software prototyping;testbed	Vadim Ermolayev;Eyck Jentzsch;Oleg Karsaev;Natalya Keberle;Wolf-Ekkehard Matzke;Vladimir Samoilov;Richard Sohnius	2005		10.1007/11916291_12	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;operations management	SE	-52.844519739388595	14.901278949756446	50992

Moreover, it is often carried out through argumentative discourses between the stakeholders involved. This paper exploits and elaborates on the synergy that occurs between the decision making and knowledge management processes in such contexts. The proposed multidisciplinary approach is supported by a web-based software tool. Being based on a well-defined ontology model, our approach facilitates decision makers in achieving a common understanding, while also enhancing collaboration and exploitation of organizational knowledge resources. Strategy development is the particular knowledge domain considered in this paper to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed tool.		Christina E. Evangelou;Nikos I.

fcf47ebca2e102b5a0265870f987abcfd5cf65b6	towards an ontology for simulation systems engineering	dseep;simulation systems engineering;flugdynamik und simulation;ontology	Although modeling and simulation and systems engineering are distinct fields, the increasing complexity of the systems of interest lead us to two emerging disciplines, namely simulation systems engineering and simulation-based systems engineering. This paper is about simulation systems engineering which is simulation enhanced by systems engineering. On one hand, it can be perceived as a natural step in the evolution of the discipline of simulation, on the other hand, the concepts of simulation systems engineering, the tools and the methodologies, the form and the content of work products, the types of data stores and the information flows currently show a great variety. Notwithstanding, simulation systems engineering requires a shared conceptualization for coordination, cooperation and integration. There have been previous efforts that contributed to the creation of a common vocabulary. Extending them, this paper proposes to develop an ontology for simulation systems engineering, which will specify not only a common but also an explicit vocabulary. The simulation systems engineering process captured in an ontology is envisioned to help creating a common understanding about the concepts of simulation systems engineering and streamlining information exchange within and among simulation systems engineering activities.	simulation;systems engineering	Umut Durak;Tuncer Ören	2016			method engineering;simulation;enterprise systems engineering;mechatronics;information engineering;system of systems;system of systems engineering;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;systems simulation;requirements engineering;systems development life cycle;engineering mathematics;systems design	DB	-61.25143769070462	16.335249075841062	51261

However, there are several challenges faced by educators trying to integrate system-level concepts into embedded systems curricula. Four such challenges include: the breadth of the embedded systems field limits opportunities for system-level content; lack of adequate laboratory platforms addressing system-level alternatives; limited student exposure to diverse software tools; and assessment associated with system-level activities. Each of the challenges is described in detail and suggestions for overcoming them are offered.	embedded system;systems concepts	Kenneth G.

ef56bfccf21d6b6cb23083a2e640a0414f53730d	modeling cloud saas with soa and mda		Cloud computing, a more recent computing paradigm, has evolved from a variety of legacy technologies that include Service oriented Architecture (SOA) and Web services besides several others. The software services in a cloud must be developed based on the service-oriented approach, in order to derive their full potential and benefits. Since, SOA inherently nurtures interoperability; it will enhance the integration and interaction among the cloud software services. Also, leveraging the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach to develop individual cloud software services will result in services that are more robust, flexible and agile in the wake of ever changing technologies. This paper is an attempt by the authors to lay emphasis on the convergence of Cloud computing, SOA and MDA in development of optimum business solutions.	agile software development;cloud computing;computation;interoperability;legacy system;model-driven architecture;programming paradigm;service-orientation;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;software as a service;web service	Ritu Sharma;Manu Sood;Divya Sharma	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22709-7_50	computer science;systems engineering;control engineering;software;architecture;agile software development;web service;cloud computing;interoperability;service-oriented architecture;software as a service	SE	-58.61646175556705	17.537880976893607	51535
e93f60da31a6a4a68fa9a82fe39e8e29c89ae065	distributed it for integration and communication of engineering information for collaborative building design	th building construction	In recent years, the rapid development of new information technologies has significantly impacted on the product development process as strategic means to gain competitive advantage in a global market. In the engineering domain, powerful computer-based tools such as Computer Aided Design systems enable engineers to perform various design tasks and realise product concepts in the early phase of the product development process. However, the increasing complexity of modern products as well as the globalization of product development further necessitate distributed and collaborative design environments. This is where different computer systems and dispersed specialists in similar or different disciplines need to collaboratively be involved in shared design activities. Therefore, the integration and communication of engineering information are two of the most key technical factors in ensuring successful collaboration.#N##N#The current application of information technology in supporting collaboration during the design process is limited to either a document-based or a common format-based exchange level. These methods provide relatively simple forms of collaboration compared with desired distributed and collaborative design environments that can deliver more effective ways of collaboration. #N##N#The work detailed in this research investigates the advantages of using modern distributed information technologies alongside a suitable framework and a product model to support multi-disciplinary collaborative design. The work also involves exploring other important issues related to real-time collaborative design environments. These are design transaction management, access control, communication, and version management.#N##N#The research work employs modern technology and distributed computing to enhance the processes of collaborative building design. The research proposes a framework and a product model to extend the functionalities of stand-alone and single-user design systems to facilitate synchronous collaborative design where distributed designers can work concurrently on a centralised shared model and carry out all necessary communication and data exchanges electronically. The implemented framework proposes a data transaction management approach that ensures efficient concurrent access to the model data and maintains data consistency. The framework also employs software agents to automatically access and operate on the information exchanged among the collaborators. The proposed product model in this work extends an adopted model to support access right control and version management. The work is implemented in an experimental software as a client-server model. .Net technology is used for implementing the framework and the product model and virtual reality technology is used to allow for intuitive interaction with the system. #N##N#The research concludes that the utilisation of the modern distributed technologies can effectively induce change in the design process toward a more collaborative and concurrent design. As demonstrated within this work, these technologies with a suitable system design can meet the main requirements of a real-time collaborative building design system.

Typically, a buying agent’s decision involves a large variety of constraints that may involve attributes of separate items as well as attributes of different, multiple items. In this paper we present Ibundler, an agent-based service offered to buying agents to help them determine the optimal bundle of received offers based on their constraints and preferences. In this way, buying agents are relieved with the burden of solving too hard a problem (the problem can be proved to be NP) and concentrate on strategic issues. IBundler is intended as a negotiation service for buying agents and as a winner determination service for reverse combinatorial auctions with side constraints. To the best of our knowledge this is the first agent service for such type of complex negotiation scenarios.	agent-based model;decision support system;intelligent agent;np (complexity);problem solving;procurement;software deployment;solver	Juan A.

The goals of restructuring the ECE Electronics curriculum are as follows: a) train and prepare students to design and analyze complex electronic systems first at the subsystem and system level before teaching and learning electronics at the component level; and b) strengthen the infrastructure for the system integration learning experience with other courses such as power electronics through the use of integrated projects developed for the Electronics curriculum. To realize these goals, the curriculum of Electronics I and Electronics II are redesigned. Electronics I is designed to focus on the design and analysis of electronic circuits, devices, and processes at the system and subsystem level. Electronics II is designed to focus on the study, operation, and analysis of electronic circuits, devices, and processes at the component level. Centralized projects are selected as platforms to allow students to develop the skills in designing and analyzing electronic systems. The students' performance and survey show that the Electronics curriculum restructure has a positive impact on students' learning.	centralized computing;computer engineering;electrical engineering;electronic circuit;emoticon;power electronics;system integration	Qing Zheng;Pengtao Lin;Fong Mak;Ramakrishnan Sundaram;Lin Zhao	2013	2013 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2013.6685002	engineering;electrical engineering;computer engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	-54.900960555363085	4.431725277642284	52444

However, the alignment of their respective deployment mechanisms is still not obvious. An analysis of the Innovation and Knowledge Life Cycles shows that the Knowledge Life Cycle can be deployed (partially) at each step of the Innovation Life Cycle. This implies that different, specific knowledge management tools could be used to increase innovation. Two knowledge management tools are considered in this paper: roadmaps and conceptual frameworks. A methodology is proposed for using roadmaps and conceptual frameworks within the context of integrated knowledge networks for improving efficient innovation. These two approaches aim to ease the knowledge structuring and identification in order to facilitate innovation. Two knowledge management examples in the financial services highlight how these tools contribute to the increased efficiency of the innovation process, leading to a more mature innovation deployment.	capability maturity model;entity;informatics;information system;knowledge integration;knowledge management;plan;software deployment;synergy;usability	Nicolas Perry;Wilhelm Uys	2010	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2010.031933	innovation;knowledge base;knowledge integration;innovation management;knowledge economy;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;knowledge engineering;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain	HCI	-62.45167711518324	13.035466003790832	52606

Many companies are seeking a new methodology that can effectively reduce human resource, development time and cost. In this paper, we propose an enterprise model-based software development and application framework using the XML Schema hierarchical tree. The feature of inheritance in the XML Schema language allows us to define the class about an enterprise model. With a prototype of Enterprise Model Framework (EMF) that can manage the class and instance from a web server, software developers can rapidly construct a new information system. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed methodology, this research implements an EMF-based electronic document management system. The results of this paper have five benefits of software development mode using the XML Schema hierarchical tree: (1) the XML Schema specification can simultaneously define an enterprise model and the structure of an XML document; (2) increase the effectiveness of developing application systems; (3) promote more integration in different systems; (4) operate non-structure datum with an enterprise; (5) various resources with an enterprise can be made to easily utilise, access and manage.	enterprise modelling;xml schema	Ruey-Shun Chen;Bieng-Hwa Chen;Ming-Hsien Chen;Chan-Chine Chang	2003	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2003.000341	xml validation;xml encryption;xml;enterprise application integration;enterprise software;relax ng;enterprise modelling;xml schema;streaming xml;computer science;document type definition;xs3p;document definition markup language;document structure description;xml framework;data mining;xml schema;database;document schema definition languages;xml signature;enterprise integration;world wide web;xml schema editor;efficient xml interchange;enterprise information system	Web+IR	-51.151460109444635	16.049006351520543	52825

In Quebec, the e-Government has reached its four phase of development that is the phase of integration necessitating an essential two-level transformation at the front and back offices. At the front-office, the transformation deals with the integration of services offered to citizens, and in the back-office it aims to migrate from systems developed in silos to interoperable and interconnected systems. To achieve this integration, there is a need to redesign business processes to offer integrated services. For this purpose, a modeling of the business processes according to international norms and standards to provide interoperability and interconnectivity is hence necessary. This paper presents a new business process modeling approach. It is based on Business Process Mapping (BPMapping) and the UN/CEFACT Modeling Methodology (UMM). The BPMapping provides an overall view of the business processes showing their inputs, outputs and interdependencies. The details of these business processes are described using UMM and different levels of decomposition. Each level provides diagrams and forms to describe the business and functional requirements and information exchanged between process partners. The approach is applied to the modeling of the Integrated Records Management (IRM) process of the Quebec Government. The results show that the proposed approach identifies, models and documents business processes according to international norms and standards while providing an overall structural and dynamic view of the business process.	business process;e-government;process modeling	Hafedh Chourabi;Faouzi Bouslama;Sehl Mellouli	2008			business model;business analysis;business transformation;business domain;business requirements;business process reengineering;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;operations management;process modeling;business process model and notation;process management;business system planning;business process;process mining;business process discovery;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	Robotics	-58.31921248616534	15.169648232264509	53073

Integrative BPM research has been mainly focusing on the conversion of workflow notations into enacted application procedures, and less effort has been invested in enhancing the connectivity between design level, non-workflow business process models and related enactment systems such as: ERP, SCM and CRM. This type of integration is useful at several stages of an IT system lifecycle, from design and implementation through change management, upgrades and rollout. The paper presents an integration method that utilizes SOA for connecting business process models with corresponding enterprise software systems. The method is then demonstrated through an Oracle E-Business Suite procurement process and its ERP transactions.	business process;customer relationship management;erp;enterprise software;login;middleware;process modeling;procurement;service-oriented architecture;software deployment;software system;system lifecycle	Avi Wasser;Maya Lincoln	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-05290-3_29	business rule management system;enterprise application integration;enterprise software;systems engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;function model;process modeling;business process model and notation;process management;business;business process;event-driven process chain;process mining;enterprise integration;business process discovery;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;system integration;business architecture	SE	-58.02642608966384	16.250191584334196	53145
85a4c3c6040b23ef1057298e82196d637d3227d6	a novel means of generating assembly sequences using the connector concept	generic algorithm;product model;assembly planning;creative thinking	Assembly planning attempts to arrange product assembly sequences on the basis of the input of product description, similar assembly plans and assembly constraints. Assembly planning is frequently viewed as a creative thinking process, which requires extensive assembly planning experience. Assembly product modeling with mechanical connection functions has increasingly focused on assembly sequence planning. When considering the connection functions, the relationships between assembled components can act as a foundation for assembly clustering. Despite the merits of assembly sequence planning in lieu of considering connection functions, previous investigations have focused primarily on product representation with the connector concept. However, to our knowledge, generation of the assembly sequence on the basis of the connector concept has not been previously discussed. In this study, we present a novel means of generating assembly sequences on the basis of the connector concept. The proposed method initially defines different types of connectors and representation schemes. Through the definition and representation scheme, an assembly product can be decomposed into a set of connector-based assembly elements. The connector-based assembly elements then serve as input for an assembly sequence generation algorithm, which is connector-based, to generate an assembly sequence. The final output is a connector-based assembly sequence graph, resembling an assembly precedence diagram. In addition, this graph can act as the input for any line balance method when designing work elements for each assembly workstation.		Hwia-En Tseng;Rong-Kwei Li	1999	J.

37eec71c25a2519c380344bd135002e27db1c1ac	engineering automated negotiations		Resumen. To make automated negotiation widely used in real scenarios, it is necessary to develop advanced software systems that are able to carry out such negotiation in those scenarios. However, although much work has been done in automated negotiation, most of these efforts have been focused on the development of negotiation protocols and strategies and only a few are centred on software frameworks for automated negotiation. We are concerned with the engineering aspect of automated negotiation. Specifically, we detail a software framework to develop automated negotiations of service level agreements. Unlike other proposals, we provide a detailed description of elements for full decision-making support including evaluating offers, strategy selection, building a market and opponents model, and creating counterproposals.	service-level agreement;software framework;software system	Manuel Resinas;Pablo Fernandez;Rafael Corchuelo	2006			software framework;systems engineering;software system;negotiation;service level;computer science	SE	-56.7118611084336	14.857310983463332	53487

Furthermore, the requirements of a disassembly system are determined by the disassembly object, by the process as well as by the disassembly system itself. As a result of the high labor costs in industrial countries and the huge amount of used goods, an automated disassembly is favored for the industrial disassembly. New methods for the programming of industrial robots have to be developed because the costs for a programming of small lot sizes are a key factor of the economic efficiency of small and medium sized enterprises (SME). In this paper an off-line programming environment for programming of industrial robots in the field of automated disassembly is presented. The exemplary implementation is realized at a pilot disassembly system, which was built up at the Institut fur Werkzeugmaschinen und Fabrikbetrieb (IWF) of the Technische Universitat Berlin.	admissible numbering;industrial robot	Eckart Uhlmann;Thomas Friedrich;Nayim Bayat	2008	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-008-0081-9	simulation;engineering;operations management;industrial engineering;economic efficiency;mechanical engineering	Robotics	-59.99680662728768	7.982998554621189	53500

This paper defines information systems architecture by creating a descriptive framework from disciplines quite independent of information systems, then by analogy specifies information systems architecture based upon the neutral, objective framework. Also, some preliminary conclusions about the implications of the resultant descriptive framework are drawn. The discussion is limited to architecture and does not include a strategic planning methodology.	enterprise architecture;information system;systems architecture	John A.

9f83894d96c4e356b2bc81af0af9497ffc9b0ad9	a meta-heuristic approach for dynamic process planning in reconfigurable manufacturing systems		Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS) is a paradigm to flexibly deal with frequent changing demand and technologies. With the advancement of technology and more and more sensors and machines are connected, the world quickly enter the era of Internet of Things (IoT), which provides infrastructure for RMS. However existing studies lack a formalism that provides a framework for the development of RMS, from modeling, design to implementation. In particular, an important issue is design of dynamic process planner for RMS. This paper focuses on the development of a dynamic process planning method for the development of RMS. Modeling and managing RMS in manufacturing sector are challenging issues due to the complex workflows in the system. Recent progress in artificial intelligence and bio-inspired optimization technology provides a solid background to develop a framework to provide dynamic process planning for RMS in IoT-enabled manufacturing environment. In this paper, we propose a process planning method based on multi-agent systems (MAS) using Petri Nets to specify the workflows and capabilities of resources in the system and develop a solution algorithm based on a meta-heuristic method to solve the process planning problem based on discrete Particle swarm optimization (DPSO) approach The proposed method is illustrated by a several examples.	algorithm;british informatics olympiad;entity;heuristic;internet of things;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;particle swarm optimization;petri net;programming paradigm;progress in artificial intelligence;semantics (computer science);sensor	Fu-Shiung Hsieh	2017	2017 18th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT)	10.1109/PDCAT.2017.00035	progress in artificial intelligence;petri net;distributed computing;formalism (philosophy);heuristic;computer science;workflow;internet of things;particle swarm optimization	Robotics	-50.8226165067018	13.571218029203749	53909

Joints within the physical structure of an assembly are inevitable because of the limitations of component geometries and the associated, required engineering properties. Consequently, a framework is needed that can capture and propagate assembly design and joint information in a robust assembly model throughout the entire product development processes. The framework and model are based on an understanding of the morphological characteristics of an assembly and its different physical effects. The morphological characteristics are consequences of the principal physical processes and of the design intentions. Therefore, the morphological characteristics should be carefully represented while considering the geometry and topology of assembly joints. In this research, assembly joint topology is defined by a mereotopology, which is a region-based theory for the parts and associated concepts. This formal ontology can differentiate often ambiguous assembly and joining relations. Furthermore, the mereotopological definitions for assembly joints are implemented in Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules and Web Ontology Language triples. This process provides universality to the mereotopological definitions. Two geometrically and topologically similar joint pairs are presented to describe how the assembly joints can be defined in mereotopology and be transformed into SWRL rules. Web3D is also employed to support network-enabled sharing of assembly geometry. Finally, the proposed modeling framework is demonstrated using a real fixture assembly. This case study demonstrates the usability of the proposed framework for network-based design collaboration.		Kyoung-Yun Kim;Seongah Chin;Ohbyung Kwon;R.

770f4881da0063069ac7c76d6089d84e119760e4	modeling crisis management process from goals to scenarios		Process manager plays the central role in crisis management. In order to capture the intentions of the process manager, the process should be specified at a strategic level. In order to analyze how these intentions are fulfilled during the process execution, the process should be specified at an operational level. Whereas the variety of techniques for goal modeling and process modeling is presented in the market, possibility to design a process seamlessly, from intentions (process goals) to executable scenarios, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce an approach for modeling and simulating a crisis management process from goals to scenarios. We consider an example of flood management process specified for floods on Oka River in the Moscow region in Russia. In order to specify the intentions behind the flood management process, we use MAP formalism. For representing the process at the operational level, we use Statecharts formalism. To align the strategic and operation process levels, we translate the MAP model of flood management process to statecharts. We simulate the flood management process, showing how the process goals defined on the strategic level can be achieved by various scenarios executed in the operational level.	align (company);executable;goal modeling;information system;process modeling;recommender system;scenario planning;semantics (computer science);simulation	Elena Kushnareva;Irina Rychkova;Rébecca Deneckère;Bénédicte Le Grand	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-42887-1_5	systems engineering	AI	-54.52209893525789	18.07240382604867	53972

In particular, time is a significant factor for business process simulation to acquire the customers' satisfaction. It's a challenging task to complete a business process promptly. In this paper, we proposed a process model named M1 by using the BPMN approach on Bizagi simulator to show the business process steps of a tool manufacturing company then we modified M1 and proposed a new process model M2 in order to reduce the working hours that we had by following the processing steps in model M1.	business process model and notation;process modeling;simulation	Noreen Maryam;Shoab Ahmed Khan	2017	2017 IEEE 8th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)	10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249028	process management;human–computer interaction;business process;business process model and notation;computer science;solid modeling;manufacturing;unified modeling language	Robotics	-56.521381046944995	17.238343829529068	54741

The development of computational agents with unified data structures and software protocols contributes to the establishment of a new way of working in collaborative design, which is increasingly becoming an international practice. In this paper, based on the analysis of the dynamic nature of collaborative design process, a new framework for collaborative design is described. This framework adopts an agent-based approach and relocates designers, managers, systems, and the supporting agents in a unified knowledge representation scheme for product design. In order to model the constantly evolving design process and the rationales resulted from design collaboration, a Collaborative Product Data Model (CPDM) and a constraint-based Collaborative Design Process Model (CDPM) are proposed to facilitate the management and coordination of the collaborative design process as well as design knowledge management. A prototype system of the proposed framework is implemented and its feasibility is evaluated using a real design scenario whose objective is designing a set of dining table and chairs. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The generic e-Business Model Ontology (a rigorous definition of the e-business issues and their interdependencies in a company’s business model), which we outline in this paper is the foundation for the development of various useful tools for e-business management and IS Requirements Engineering. The e-Business Model Ontology is based on an extensive literature review and describes the logic of a “business system” for creating value in the Internet era. It is composed of four main pillars, which are product innovation, infrastructure management, customer relationship and financials. These elements are then further decomposed.

c1fc692f3e8e39d94dcbf9eff255b5e3905e6e39	a conceptual framework for social business process management		Abstract Over the recent years, Business Process Management (BPM) paradigm has become more socially driven. The socialization of processes has become an unavoidable way to realize flexible processes by including means to improve collaboration, knowledge sharing and collective decisions. However, the majority of current proposed approaches are limited to the exploitation of social technologies (social networks, blogs, wiki...), without providing a coherent conceptual and reusable framework, independent from those technologies. This paper defines precisely the social dimension to be taken into account in BPM and recommends a set of models to structure the design and development of Social BPM. In addition, a social ontology has been developed with Protege 5.0 and rules for inferring knowledge and queries for exploiting it have been implemented with SWRL and SPARQL.	business process	Hanane Ariouat;Chihab Hanachi;Eric Andonoff;Frédérick Bénaben	2017		10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.151	protégé;data mining;social business;management science;conceptual framework;business process management;sparql;computer science;social network;knowledge management;socialization;knowledge sharing	DB	-60.88482297529032	16.08806711940969	55000

SWfMS execute workflows by providing process management, provenance data and distributed execution on clusters and clouds. However, the support for dynamic changes in workflows is still an open, yet important, problem. For example, when the program associated to an activity of the workflow is taking more time than expected to produce results or if the results do not comply with some quality criteria, the scientist may want to try an alternative algorithm implementation. However, scientists may not want to re-execute the entire workflow for each change they make in the workflow structure. Alternatively, changing the structure of the workflow dynamically (i.e. change the programs associated with workflow activities) can improve the workflow execution without restarting the execution. In this paper, we propose DynAdapt, a dynamic approach that allows scientist to perform structural changes of the workflow specification at runtime. We evaluated DynAdapt using SciPhy, a large-scale bioinformatics workflow, and results show up to 40% of execution improvement.	algorithm;bioinformatics;management system;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Igor Dos Santos;Jonas Dias;Daniel de Oliveira;Eduardo S.

3085c77cc502728611e3a0a78fc3b87315a8006e	application of optimization in the early stages of product development, using a small uav case study		Innovative product development involves a lot of tools, methods, and approaches to create a better product faster and satisfying customer’s need. Two wide spread approaches are Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). However, there are not many software tools, combining methodologies PLM MBSE; one can mention LMS System Synthesis software, now is actively developing. It is used to create system models which include functional models able to describe system behavior in multiphysics domain. Therefore, when the system model of a product is multidisciplinary it’s not obvious what the parameters values describe the optimal state of the system. For these reasons, it is vital to apply multidisciplinary optimization techniques with the specific tools to calculate appropriate parameters of the developed system in the early stages of product development. This research is devoted to different optimization tools application, such as pSeven and Optimus Noesis, to the numerical models constituting digital twin for a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The results of this research, specifically formulation of the optimization problems, detailed numerical models and the calculations results, are presented in this paper. The main idea is that optimization should be applied not as additional tool for separate numerical models, but one has to apply it as a powerful means along with PLM and MBSE tools in order to ensure that the product will meet all requirements and reduce time-to-market.

To display a web document or program message or to display a user interface in an appropriate, locale and culture specific translated form, is an important and complex task in the I18N & L10N or Globalization process. In L10N we need to address various locale and cultural aspects, for examples, Naming, formats of date and time, number, icons, symbols and colors etc including legal aspects for proper customization of a product. Language localization denotes the process of translating a product into different languages. Software localization addresses the messages that a program of an Enterprise Information System (EIS) presents to a user need to be translated into various languages. This is very important in the Internationalization & Localization process for addressing language and locale specific various must-do issues as an aid to an easier faster and more meaningful translation process for an EIS web content and answers of the web applications in an EIS. The approach presented here relies on a 3-Layered XML Schematic scheme. By using the CLM, while internationalizing a product, we can do localization easily even without having much linguistic resources on a source human language. The work of this paper is a significant step forward toward globalizing the information system of an enterprise at lower cost for higher gain. A next generation EIS would provide such challenging features of dynamically localized presentation layer with this CLM.	channel length modulation;color;compiler;computation;computational linguistics;enterprise information system;information needs;internationalization and localization;language localisation;markup language;modal logic;next-generation network;schematic;universal networking language;user interface;web application;web content;web page;wordnet;xml;xml schema	Goutam Kumar Saha	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-75902-9_60	enterprise architecture framework;functional software architecture;enterprise system;enterprise application integration;enterprise software;computer science;knowledge management;three schema approach;architecture domain;applications architecture;enterprise architecture management;database;enterprise architecture;view model;world wide web;xml schema editor;information architecture;enterprise information security architecture;enterprise information system	Web+IR	-49.099146448699074	17.84740321047862	57058

There are advantages to this model such as its iterative approach, which grants real-time results to stakeholders. Also, when using this model, requirements and solutions evolve through the collaboration of high performance teams. From an ontological approach ARQUETIPOS is composed of five components: The Framework for Capability, the Content of the Architecture, the Implementation Method, the Maturity Assessment Model of Organizational Systems and the Meta-model Repository. This paper aims to test the implementation of ARQUETIPOS in the education and productive sector through the use of agile principles and prototyping and simulation techniques. The techniques or strategies used to implement this meta-model are varied, in this case the training service was used. This strategy allowed the main actors in this paper (Academia and companies) to model their organizational processes through the creation of prototypes with Lego. In consequence, that let them to get better services and products aligned with their business strategy.	agile software development;capability maturity model;enterprise architecture;iterative method;metamodeling;real-time clock;requirement;simulation;strategic management;the open group architecture framework	Ana Milena Páez Quintero;Ricardo Llamosa-Villalba;Edgar Sneyder García Morantes	2015	JSW	10.17706/jsw.10.3.366-373	knowledge management;database	SE	-58.34043872604612	15.630706396146705	57317

On the one hand, large amounts of data coming from low-level field and automation systems need to be interpreted, aggregated, and made available to the business information systems to inform local decisions within power generation companies and operators; on the other hand, this vertical integration needs to be complemented by and connected to a horizontal integration capability which links the internal information and process models of different players in the market in (soft) real time, to inform and enable cross-enterprise coordination and optimization. In this paper, we introduce an integration architecture that supports and combines vertical as well as horizontal integration, and methods to improve interoperability and increase automation of cross enterprise business processes in the energy domain. We support vertical integration by means of a novel decentral information aggregation and routing platform to manage large-scale data intensive systems. Horizontal integration is enabled by a peer-to-peer content (document) repository which is used to coordinate and integrate local processes in a cross-organizational fashion, thus allowing, e.g., reliable and timely provision of electricity outage reports and preparation of coordinated action plans. We evaluate important properties of these methods and report experimental results.	abstract summary;business logic;business process;centralized computing;computer simulation;dna integration;data sources;data aggregation;data-intensive computing;declarative programming;downtime;end system;high- and low-level;indexes;information systems;interface device component;interoperability;management information system;mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;model-driven engineering;model-driven integration;peer-to-peer;point of view (computer hardware company);power architecture;publish–subscribe pattern;reliability engineering;routing;run-time infrastructure (simulation);single point of failure;sysop;vendor lock-in;notification	Christoph Gerdes;Udo Bartlang;Jörg P.

To this end, traditional recommender systems use Web Usage Mining (WUM) techniques in order to automatically extract knowledge from Web usage data. Thanks to WUM techniques we are able to classify users and adaptively provide useful recommendations. The drawback of a user classification approach is that it makes the system prone to privacy breaches.Our contribution here is πSUGGEST, a privacy enhanced recommender system that allows for creating serendipity recommendations without breaching users privacy.

ea59964d46513ee06bddbfc813da719d000dc112	web engineering		Process mining aims to discover, monitor and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from event logs abundantly available in today’s information systems. Although process mining has been applied in hundreds of organizations and process mining techniques have been embedded in a variety of commercial tools, to date these techniques have rarely been used for analyzing web services. One of the obvious reasons is that cross-organizational event data cannot be shared easily. However, (1) messages exchanged between services tend to be structured, (2) service-orientation continues to be the predominant implementation paradigm, and (3) the most substantial efficiency gains can often only be achieved across different organizations. Hence, there are many possible applications for service mining, i.e., applying process mining techniques to services. If messages are recorded, then one can discover a process describing interactions between services. If, in addition, descriptive or normative models are available, one can use process mining to check conformance and highlight performance problems. This extended abstract aims to provide pointers to ongoing work on service mining and lists some of the main challenges in this emerging field. 1 From Process Mining to Service Mining Process mining is an enabling technology for service mining. Process mining can be used to discover processes from raw event data, check the conformance of observed and modeled behavior, enhance models by improving or extending them with knowledge extracted from event logs [2]. The uptake of process mining is not only illustrated by the growing number of papers, but also by commercial analysis tools providing process mining capabilities, cf. Disco (Fluxicon), Perceptive Process Mining (Perceptive Software, before Futura Reflect and BPMone by Pallas Athena), ARIS Process Performance Manager (Software AG), ProcessAnalyzer (QPR), Interstage Process Discovery (Fujitsu), Discovery Analyst (StereoLOGIC), and XMAnalyzer (XMPro). Web services have become one of the main paradigms for architecting and implementing business collaborations within and across organizational boundaries F. Daniel, P. Dolog, and Q. Li (Eds.): ICWE 2013, LNCS 7977, pp. 1–4, 2013. c © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013 2 W.M.P. van der Aalst [10,20]. The functionality provided by many of today’s business applications is encapsulated within web services, i.e., software components described at a semantic level, which can be invoked by application programs or by other services through a stack of Internet standards including HTTP, XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI [10,20]. Once deployed, web services provided by various organizations can be inter-connected in order to implement business collaborations, leading to composite web services. In the context of web services, typically all kinds of events are being recorded. It is possible to record events related to activities inside services or interactions between services (e.g., messages) [6,8,9]. The autonomous nature of services and the fact that they are loosely coupled makes it important to monitor and analyze their behavior. In this paper, we will refer to this as service mining. Starting point for process mining is an event log. Each event in such a log refers to an activity (i.e., a well-defined step in some process) and is related to a particular case (i.e., a process instance). The events belonging to a case are ordered and describe one “run” of the process. Event logs may store additional information about events. In fact, whenever possible, process mining techniques use supplementary information such as the resource (i.e., person, device, or software component) executing or initiating the activity, the timestamp of the event, and other data attributes (e.g., the size of an order). As mentioned before, three types of process mining can be distinguished: (1) process discovery, (2) conformance checking, and (3) model enhancement. See [2] for an introduction to the corresponding techniques. The correlation of messages is a particular challenge for service mining [3]. Process models always describe the behavior of cases, also referred to as process instances. Without correlating messages, it is impossible to discover causalities. Another challenge is to use additional information provided by such messages. In case of asynchronous messages with sender and receiver information we can exploit knowledge about distributed processes, e.g., choices need to be communicated. For example, service x cannot expect the service y to take action because x did not send a message to y. Thus far, these insights are not used in process discovery [16]. 2 Related Work on Service Mining In this section, we provide some pointers to papers on services mining and related topics. Given space restrictions, we do not aim to be complete. For additional references we refer the interested reader to [3]. In [9] a concrete application of process mining to web services is described. IBM’s WebSphere product is used as a reference system and its CEI (Common Event Infrastructure) logs are analyzed using ProM. An approach to check the conformance of web services was described in [6]. The paper includes a description of various experiments using Oracle BPEL. The token-based replay techniques presented in [18] were used to measure conformance. Challenges in Service Mining 3 In [8] an LTL-based approach to check conformance was proposed. This approach uses a graphical declarative language to describe the normative behavior of services. Rather than modeling a detailed process, this approach allows for checking graphically specified constraints such as “a payment should always be confirmed”. The topic of event correlation has been investigated in the context of system specification, system development, and services analysis. In [7] and [11] various interaction and correlation patterns are described. In [17] a technique is presented for correlating messages with the goal to visualize the execution of web services. In [16] so-called operating guidelines are exploited for conformance checking. Dustdar et al. [12,14] proposed techniques for services interaction mining, i.e., applying process mining techniques to the analysis of service interactions. Nezhad et al. [15] developed techniques for event correlation and process discovery from web service interaction logs. The authors introduce the notion of a “process view” which is the result of a particular event correlation. However, they argue that correlation is subjective and that multiple views are possible. A collection of process views is called the “process space”. In [19], Simmonds et al. propose a technique for the run-time monitoring of web service conversations. The authors monitor conversations between partners at runtime as a means of checking behavioral correctness of the entire web service system. This is related to the earlier work on conformance checking [4,6,18] mentioned before. Within the ACSI project the focus is on many-to-many relationships between instances. So-called “proclets” [5] are used to model artifact centric models. A conformance checking approach for such models is presented in [13] and implemented in ProM. In [1] the topic of “cross-organizational mining” was introduced. Here the goal is not to analyze interacting services but to compare services that are variants of one another. Cross-organizational mining can be used for benchmarking and reference modeling. Acknowledgements.

In our proposed approach, we focus on the organizational and business activity modeling and we concentrate on documents that represent the information of enterprises in the form of unstructured and semi-structured documents. The compilation of documents mirrors implicitly or explicitly the structure of enterprises, the interrelationship of business processes, and activities and tasks within processes. The documents represent, at the same time, the system roles along with tasks and activities. Our modeling approach concentrates on the co-existence and co-operation of documents and activities of business. The Story Algebra, or more generally the process algebra approach provides a formal framework that promises a formal describing method for modeling precisely the event triggered processes coupled with data in document format within an Enterprise Architecture Framework.

To support users having different perspectives on these processes and related data, a PAIS should provide personalized views on process models. Existing PAISs, however, do not provide mechanisms for creating or even changing such process views. Especially, changing process models is a frequent use case in PAISs due to changing needs or unplanned situations. While process views have been used as abstractions for visualizing large process models, no work exists on how to change process models based on respective views. This paper presents an approach for changing large process models through updates of corresponding process views, while ensuring up-to-dateness and consistency of all other process views on the process model changed. Respective update operations can be applied to a process view and corresponding changes be correctly propagated to the underlying process model. Furthermore, all other views related to this process model are then migrated to the new version of the process model as well. Overall, our view framework enables domain experts to evolve large process models over time based on appropriate model abstractions.	business process;client–server model;database schema;experiment;holism;information system;personalization;process modeling;server (computing);software propagation;subject-matter expert	Jens Kolb;Klaus Kammerer;Manfred Reichert	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34321-6_32	computer science;knowledge management;data mining	SE	-54.41983865387818	18.05705084391268	58021

The lack of a common agreed upon definition of the term makes it difficult to understand and classify services as well as distinguish them from non-service concepts. In this paper, we do not propose a new definition of service but a model of services that helps in analysing the concept. The model is based on three perspectives: service as a means for co-creation of value, service as a means for abstraction, and service as a means for providing restricted access to resources.	natural language	Maria Bergholtz;Paul Johannesson;Birger Andersson	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24606-7_38	service catalog;service;service product management;application service provider;differentiated service;computer science;knowledge management;conceptual model;service delivery framework;service-oriented modeling;service design;data mining;database;service discovery;service desk;data as a service;world wide web;information system;service system	Web+IR	-48.47675461458202	16.150210952272435	58096

The ACE-IDS is a combination of commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) and custom built hardware and software components interfaced with existing FAA and National Weather Service (NWS) systems. The ACE-IDS includes a set of networked workstations capable of displaying selected subsets of data from 10,000 predefined screens and extends the capability of the current Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS). These screen displays are populated in real time using data from a variety of FAA and NWS systems such as the ASOS, the Automation of Field Operations and Service (AFOS), and the Flight Data Input/Output (FDIO) systems.

In particular, this affects the engineering of those interactive systems that involve the cooperation of agents and (human) actors, such as Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) or Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) applications. In this context, the coordination model promoted by the adopted MAS infrastructure strongly condition the design, development and exploitation of available services. In this work we address the integration of services for email, file transfer and web browsing in the context of the TuCSoN agent coordination infrastructure. After discussing how these can be engineered upon the TuCSoN model, we show how the coordination services natively provided by the infrastructure can be exploited to face issues related to service composition and orchestration.	computer-supported cooperative work;email;file transfer;management system;multi-agent system;service composability principle;systems engineering	Enrico Denti;Alessandro Ricci;Rossella Rubino	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-25946-6_15	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management	AI	-50.84064865415105	15.000329720024512	58258

The nature of both CSCW and distribution are compared by using a common framework. In this discussion, control emerges as the major problem in supporting CSCW systems. It is argued that existing approaches to control in distributed systems are inadequate given the rich patterns of cooperation found in CSCW. A number of recommendations are made for improving distributed support for CSCW.	computer-supported cooperative work;distributed computing	Tom Rodden;Gordon S.

[14] This paper actually inherits that and uses G.A. to decided optimal Zigbee topology which explains in section 4.2. The related test and evaluation results in section 4.3 explain how to deploy an optimal Zigbee parking topology in the case campus. To Use Zigbee techniques as a back bone to develop ubiquitous applications has been warming up while current I.T. evolution moving from electrification to mobilization. However, most successful business cases still rely on mobile tools, such as PDA, WIFI, and GPS, to realize the concept of ubiquitous. The main challenges ahead for making real U-applications on the market are not only the definitions of zigbee specifications and protocols, but the related optimal database build-up and topology design methods. This paper aims to explore the necessary considerations between the gaps within ubiquitous information systems analysis and zigbee devices layout design using GA approach which could direct the right path for database arrangement. This follows the system development life cycle (SDLC) to identify a zigbee wireless network's optimal topology, data flows, and related database design. The case study was undertaken within Hsing-Wu college campus. This ensures the scenario based experiment design could be practical for the further applications. The main objectives are to build up a U-campus prototype to allow teachers and students getting more interactively information being everywhere. This system could benefit users to find services without asking. The research results reveal that using zigbee to build up U-campus parking applications are less manpower, capital assets, build-up time than the fixed intranet services. The scenario-based planning, analysis, design and test are realistic for students to realize how to implement an I.T. system in practice. The zigbee geometric placements are testing by three approaches, star, mesh and snowflakes which show the flexibility of zigbee wireless network.	database design;design of experiments;global positioning system;information system;interactivity;intranet;personal digital assistant;prototype;software development process;software release life cycle;synchronous data link control;systems development life cycle;uptime	Chia-Ping Huang;Ta-Tung Chen	2010	2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580855	embedded system;neurfon;computer science;wireless network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-60.77925232246644	9.374322561112773	58573

In this research, various concepts of adaptive business networks are explored at four levels: organisation, strategy, business process and technology. The focus of the research is to define the proper definition of ABNs and investigate how they can ensure that companies synchronise their strategies with the rapid changes in the business environment through the use of information systems. Through a review of the literature, we identify problems, issues and requirements that ABNs are typically faced with. In order to address the problems, conceptual frameworks are proposed based on the identified requirements. To realise the conceptual frameworks, architectures are proposed using social networking and other technologies.	australian bibliographic network;business process;information system;requirement;turbulence	Bali Zeng;Ching-Shen Dong;Ananth Srinivasan	2010	2012 6th International Conference on New Trends in Information Science, Service Science and Data Mining (ISSDM2012)	10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642341	knowledge management;management science;business process modeling;social network	DB	-58.76875803138822	16.183373954860684	58860

Our hypothesis is that we need to integrate plan generation, plan analysis and plan adaptation within a wholesome framework that allow a seamless integration of planning and plan execution activities, i.e. that the architectural focus should move away from planning towards so-called plan management. We present, in this paper, a software framework for plan management, which is based on a novel plan representation. This representation has been designed so that the actual context of the execution is available at all times: what the robot is doing and-more importantly-why it is doing it. Our plan manager implementation is available as open source, and has already been used on three different live systems, on which it demonstrated its capabilities.

This paper focuses on modeling the interarrival time (IAT) of entities, i.e. the time between the arrival of consecutive entities. Accurately modeling entity arrival is crucial as it influences process performance metrics such as the average waiting time. In this respect, the analysis of event logs can be useful. Given the limited process mining support for this BPS modeling task, the contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, an IAT input model taxonomy for process mining is introduced, describing event log use depending on process and event log characteristics. Secondly, ARPRA is introduced and operationalized for gamma distributed IATs. This novel approach to mine an IAT input model is the first to explicitly integrate the notion of queues. ARPRA is shown to significantly outperform a benchmark approach which ignores queue formation.

Due to the complexity of addressing an all-inclusive problem, the decision is usually entrusted to the manufacturing engineers for which products that have producible features easily and simple geometries are desirable, even if sacrificing the component performances. However, today, Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes offer a wide degree of design freedom that allows overcoming the traditional manufacturing limitations.

Workflow based approach is particularly interesting for public administrations, which traditionally tend to have hierarchic streamlined processes. We present a model for interworkflow complex service execution where control and coordination is performed by a supervisor workflow hub. 1 Workflow Tools in a Cross-Agency Process Workflow Management Systems (WFMS) provide mechanisms to define businesses processes and to automate their execution in a way that isolates the business logic and the integration of different systems. In the past, WFMS have focused on homogeneous and centralised environment within the boundary of a single organisation. However, in newly created Internet paradigms such as B2B E-commerce or Egovernment, WFMS should support collaboration between different organisations. The challenge is therefore, to create new models for interaction of heterogeneous systems where internal workflow process details are abstract for other organisations and where enactment of different WF is performed in a co-ordinated way. Therefore, we will use interworkflow definition given in [1] to describe a tool that takes care of coordination of each workflow among different organisations. On the other hand, a new concept closely related to enterprise application integration (EAI), has been built: BPI, Business Process Integration. BPI usually appears with another common acronym: BPM, Business Process Management, defined as: “The concept of shepherding work items through a multi-step process. The items are identified and tracked as they move through each step, with either specified people or applications processing the information. The process flow is determined by process logic and the applications (or processes) themselves play virtually no role in determining where the messages are sent.” [2]. Our interworkflow model combines the best of a workflow tool with a powerful integration platform where CORBA and XML are the technological pillars under which the current model rests. The FORO Connector Architecture [3] defines a standard architecture for connecting the FORO Workflow Engine with external applications and legacy systems. These external applications will be invoked through common application drivers called connectors. The FORO Connector Architecture represents the implementation of the Interface 3 suggested by the Workflow Management Coalition [4] and [5]. The workflow interoperability standards define the mechanism that workflow product vendors are required to implement in order that a workflow engine makes IMPULSE: Interworkflow Model for e-Government 473 requests to another workflow engine to effect the selection, instantiation and enactment of known process definition by that other engine. The requested workflow engine should also be able to receive back status information and the results of the enactment of the process definition. As far as possible this is to be done in a way that is “transparent to the user”. Workflow enactment services provides the runtime environment in which process instantiation and activation occurs utilising one or more workflow management engines, responsible for interpreting and activating part, or all, of the process definition and interacting with the external resources necessary to process the various activities. Therefore, in our approach we distinguish the external resources such as humans or other software tools invoked to perform particular tasks from enactment services that are used to address other workflow engines. Improving Public services (IMPULSE) is an IST programme project where two different workflow engines (Staffware and Foro-wf) are used in order to implement and validate this approach. The project will provide workflow enactment services and some of the external resources involved in sub-agencies will, in their turn, be implemented as other workflow enactment services (WES nesting). 2 e-Government: Transactions across Different Systems The term E-Government, according to definition of World Bank [6] refers to the use by government agencies of information technologies (such as Wide Area Networks, the Internet, and mobile computing) that have the ability to transform relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government. Naturally, this interaction is implemented through web sites, but less obvious is the actual stage of e-government background implementation: the actual integration and transaction of procedures. Therefore, some definitions of e-government are more restrictive, focusing on different stages, and making it the public sector equivalent of e-commerce. In this paper we will limit our scope to what in [7] was described as Stage 2: Enabling inter-organizational and public access to information. A number of governmental services is listed as promising candidates to be implemented as E-government services where workflow based integration forms the heart of back office system: − claims processing and management; − bid and proposal routing and tracking; − handling of customer service and complaints; − grant and scholarship award, approval, and processing; and − human resource recruitment and hiring. Any of above services contains processes that can be spread over various information systems, moreover they can be spread over various workflow systems. This type of services, which have been described in IMPULSE user scenarios [8] as “complex services”, usually include several already available “simple” processes, which reside on the local (single agency managed) workflow (WF) or GroupWare (GW) systems. On the other hand, any service or sub-service of different governmental agencies that contains same variables (such as “change address” service), we defined as the “common services”. 474 Aljosa Pasic, Sara Diez, and Jose Antonio Espinosa From the implementation point of view any service that requires the two or more WF and/or GW to be linked together, it is necessary to: • Deal with the existing implementation problems where a physical boundary exists (Workflow and/or Groupware servers are not at the same site). • Deal with the logical and organisational differences. The end-to-end view describes the possible obstacles and differences that might exist between departments or organisations and offers an approach for dealing with them. Furthermore, in our project each single agency WF/GW administration is responsible for publishing and maintaining its own service catalogue (with processes that have been solicited by interworkflow service model), depending on the policies and resources at its disposal. Global management and responsibilities of the IMPULSE interworkflow system, as well as responsibility for the design of the complex service, have also been left out of the scope of this project. Finally, in figure 1, we present an excerpt from one of user cases in the project. The service “Apply for individual benefits” from Canary Island Government, spreads over three agencies and connects to Staffware and Foro-wf workflow management systems. Fig. 1. A part of the complex service implemented with IMPULSE interworkflow tool 3 Interworkflow Modelling Interworkflow process editor that we use is actually enhanced designer tool from one of the WFMS. The main difference is that sub-process, such as Registry office conIMPULSE: Interworkflow Model for e-Government 475 nection in the figure 1, can be inserted and defined as the external process that starts and ends with invocation of connector to an agency based workflow. In [9] the modelling focuses on three main points: 1) start and end of work linkage; 2) structures for controlling the workflow and 3) exchanged data. Another model of coordination module between different WFMS is presented in [15] and has been named workflow mediation. However cooperative interworkflow models are more suitable for virtual enterprise and similar applications while public administrations are characterised by hierarchic structure of streamlined procedures. In the line with so called “one-stop-shop” idea, we propose supervising interworkflow hub, which will act as a control and co-ordination tier between single window for citizens or companies and separate agency managed workflow and groupware tools. Furthermore, control layer of this hub will also take care of connection, data translation and high level role mapping, while co-ordination layer is implemented by the existing workflow engine (with minimum modifications). This brings obvious investment savings. IMPULSE model is presented in the figure 2. Fig. 2. IMPULSE model for interworkflow control and coordination in e-government applications In our example from figure 1, we are making multiple data exchanges: data (citizen data request) is sent from the interworkflow to the WFMS1, from where it goes to the checking procedure that can take place in the same agency. In parallel, registry with previous applications is checked by IMPULSE interworkflow, which for this case acts as WFMS2. Except for execution of this task, IMPULSE is also responsible for running control agent that periodically checks control status and output data (if any) from the WFMS1. Finally, when both IMPULSE (WFMS1) and WFMS2 finished their sub-process, the first one will perform conditional step and will eventually pass the work to the WFMS3 (Social services). Therefore, we are combining co-operative and hand-over types of linking.

Globalised economies, competitive, volatile and complex business environments have gradually transformed modern manufacturing processes into highly distributed but interconnected networks of entities, which divide their responsibilities and core competencies to sustain and evolve. To achieve these ends, collaboration among networks of intelligent and autonomous entities must be effectively engineered and augmented. In view of that need, a formalism of the collaborative control theory (CCT) is developed in this article, based on the state-of-the-art advances in its design principles, supported by collaborative e-Work and their roles in engineering augmentation of collaboration. Several specific examples of e-Manufacturing systems (e-Factories) are used to elaborate further the mechanics of the developed formalism. The goal is to provide a framew...

Once such a production system has been built, it is very time and cost demanding  to adapt it to new changes in the manufacturing process. On the contrary, the market competition and customer needs impose  new requirements on the production systems. There are increasing demands for shorter production times, higher flexibility,  reconfigurability and optimal utilization of production facilities. Such demands can be met only by distributed production  systems (DPS) with a decentralized organization.  	control system;distributed manufacturing;integration platform;verification and validation	Martin Kardos;Ulrich Nickel	2003		10.1007/3-540-36498-6_30	computer architecture;real-time computing;high-level verification;programming language	OS	-54.385828399864145	11.776755388528771	59793

You may or may not be able to find the right location. Many simulation engineers are missing the map that is detailed enough to give them the correct locations for the work elements. They are missing an important tool called work measurement to generate appropriate manufacturing data. With such a tool, they can do their simulation studies with accuracy and confidence.

Finding a solution from scratch to deal with changes in HMS is not an appropriate approach as it may lead to chaos at the shop floor. The objective of this paper is to propose a viable design methodology to achieve effective reconfiguration in HMS based on the cooperation of holons. We formulate and study a holarchy reconfiguration problem and define an impact function to characterize the impact of resource failures on different holons in a holarchy. A collaborative reconfiguration algorithmbased on the impact function is proposed to effectively reconfigure the systems to achieve minimal cost solutions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Later the distinct subsystems are made to interface with one another and an overall system is achieved. The purpose of the present paper is to point out the availability of methods for effecting the partition in optimal or approximately optimal ways. Clustering algorithms for the specific case of information systems are obtained and exemplified.	cluster analysis;information system;systems design	Larry E. Stanfel	1983	Inf. Process.

The configuration process is often completed by multi-stakeholders collaboratively. However, current configuration methods do not provide means to coordinate concurrent decision making. In this paper, we present a framework that describes the collaborative configuration process of Service-oriented Product lines based on fuzzy quality requirements. First, the configuration objective is obtained based on an improved fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making method. Then, the corresponding multi-objective evolutionary approaches are presented for product configuration and business process configuration that satisfy both functional and non-functional preferences and constraints, respectively.	algorithm;business process;knowledge-based configuration;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;requirement;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture	Hongxia Zhang;Rongheng Lin;Hua Zou;Fangchun Yang;Yao Zhao	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing	10.1109/SCC.2013.23	reliability engineering;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management	Robotics	-51.15406748073423	12.537078150968938	60745

To promote good IT decision making, an enterprise architecture framework needs to explicate what kind of analyses it supports. Since creating enterprise architecture models is expensive and without intrinsic value, it is desirable to only create enterprise architecture models based on metamodels that support well-defined analyses. This paper suggests a metamodel derived specifically with a set of theory-based system quality analyses in mind. The ISO 9126-based theory behind the system quality analysis is introduced in the shape of an extended influence diagram. Finally, an example illustrates that our theory-based metamodel does support system quality analysis.	enterprise architecture framework;influence diagram;metamodeling	Per Närman;Pontus Johnson;Lars Nordström	2007	11th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference (EDOC 2007)	10.1109/EDOC.2007.39	enterprise architecture framework;functional software architecture;reference architecture;the open group architecture framework;rm-odp;information technology management;enterprise systems engineering;influence diagram;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;architecture domain;software engineering;enterprise architecture management;formal specification;database;solution architecture;enterprise architecture;enterprise integration;view model;management;software quality;enterprise information security architecture;enterprise information system;data architecture;business architecture;enterprise life cycle;technology	SE	-59.449279008093164	16.29361187767429	60846

In this paper we introduce a structured approach to solve the complex interoperability issues of connected systems and sub-systems based on experiences from the healthcare enterprise, where formerly rather closed systems were successfully migrated towards more open system. This approach combines well-established use case methodologies from the software development domain with benefits of the concept of integration profiles which can be found in the healthcare domain. The combination of the two methods is demonstrated by developing an integration profile for an application example from the Smart Grid domain; the virtual power plant operation use case. Using the presented method, a step-by-step guideline for implementers could be created. The profiling methodology seems to be an appropriate method to approach complex interoperability issues of Energy Systems and may be expanded to other fields.	closed system;interoperability;software development	Matthias Frohner;Marion Gottschalk;Gerald Franzl;Richard Pasteka;Mathias Uslar;Stefan Sauermann	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2017.8340674	real-time computing;systems engineering;software development;software;smart grid;interoperability;profiling (computer programming);engineering;guideline;open system (systems theory);virtual power plant	Robotics	-61.91507588670706	15.664921424096525	60898

Our target audience is manufacturing and industrial engineers who are new to simulation. Simulation has become a popular tool for engineers in making both strategic and tactical decisions. Typically, busy engineers in plants relied on corporate resources such as mainframes, general purpose simulation languages, and operations research specialists for their simulation requirements. Breakthroughs in powerful microcomputers, menu-driven simulation packages, and graphical animation provide major opportunities for busy plant engineers to use simulation for factory planning. However, there are some tough challenges for engineers who wish to succeed with simulation.	simulation	Kerim Tumay	1989		10.1109/WSC.1989.718765	anime;job shop scheduling;packaging and labeling;throughput;simulation;computer science;engineering;gpss;discrete event simulation;programming language;computational model;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	-57.65849157893801	7.0844369685392605	60969
26b1f2d32bde129a4b03351a214a9e4005a6a9cd	enabling cross-site interactions in social networks		Online social networks is one of the major technological phenomena on the Web 2.0. Hundreds of millions of people are posting articles, photos, and videos on their profiles and interacting with other people, but the sharing and interaction are limited within a same social network site. Although users can share some contents in a social network site with people outside of the social network site using a secret address of content, appropriate access control mechanisms are still not supported. To overcome this limitation, we propose a cross-site interaction framework x-mngr, allowing users to interact with users in other social network sites, with a cross-site access control policy, which enables users to specify policies that allow/deny access to their shared contents across social network sites. We also propose a partial mapping approach based on a supervised learning mechanism to map user’s identities across social network sites. We implemented our proposed framework through a photo album sharing application that shares user’s photos between Facebook and MySpace based on the cross-site access control policy that is defined by the content owner. Furthermore, we provide mechanisms to enable users to fuse user-mapping decisions that are provided by their friends or others in the social network. We implemented our framework and through extensive experimentation we prove the accuracy and precision of our proposed mechanisms.	access control;control system;cross-site cooking;cross-site scripting;fuzzy logic;interaction;ontology (information science);semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;social network;supervised learning;web 2.0;world wide web	Mohamed Shehab;Moonam Ko;Hakim Touati	2012	Social Network Analysis and Mining	10.1007/s13278-012-0051-2	engineering;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-49.77340394012626	5.6439102641794285	61055

Consequently, a common business process is often captured in multiple models that overlap in content due to serving different purposes. Business process management aims at flexible adaptation to changing business needs. Hence, changes of business processes occur frequently and have to be incorporated in the respective process models. Once a process model is changed, related process models have to be updated accordingly, despite the fact that those process models may only be loosely coupled. In this article, we introduce an approach that supports change propagation between related process models. Given a change in one process model, we leverage the behavioural abstraction of behavioural profiles for corresponding activities in order to determine a change region in another model. Our approach is able to cope with changes in pairs of models that are not related by hierarchical refinement and show behavioural inconsistencies. We evaluate the applicability of our approach with two real-world process model collections. To this end, we either deduce change operations from different model revisions or rely on synthetic change operations.	business process;business requirements;information system;loose coupling;process modeling;refinement (computing);software propagation;synthetic intelligence	Matthias Weidlich;Jan Mendling;Mathias Weske	2012	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/j.jss.2012.02.044	simulation;engineering;artifact-centric business process model;management science	SE	-55.40160719250659	18.19560222028206	61243

The architecture of the MIS meets the needs of low coupling between the partners' Information System components and the need of agility for such a platform. It is based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) principles that are combined to the Complex Event Processing (CEP) principles. This should leads on the one hand to an easier orchestration, choreography and real-time monitoring of the workflows' activities, on the other hand to assume on-the-fly automated agility of the crisis response (considering agility as the ability of the processes to remain consistent with the response to the crisis).	event-driven programming	Anne-Marie Barthe-Delanoë;Sabine Carbonnel;Frédérick Bénaben;Hervé Pingaud	2014	IJISCRAM	10.4018/ijiscram.2014040104	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;complex event processing;service-oriented architecture;adaptation	AI	-52.88999914857157	15.724443328662867	61457

This model considers the temporal and synchronism aspects involved in the allocation process. To attend to this purpose a framework was developed with a CIMOSA compliant architecture. To support the framework four agents where defined: the  Domain Process Agents  (DPA), the  Business Process Agents  (BPA), the  Enterprise Activity Agents  (EAA) and the  Functional Entity Agents  (FEA). Planning networks are used as a strategy to manage the scheduling process complexity. The main contributions of this work are: (i) a user-independent framework allowing to manage the intrinsic scheduling complexity, (ii) a strategy for resource planning allocation based on a multi-agent paradigm including a major complexity element: the real-time disturbances, (iii) the use of multi-agent architecture to support this strategy. The agents' interaction is obtained using the contract net algorithm and market-oriented programming.	autonomic computing	Ricardo Melo Bastos;Flávio Moreira Oliveira;José Palazzo Moreira de Oliveira	2005	Expert Syst.

Superior design-supplier-manufacturing decisions are critical to the survival of enterprises that seek to compete in this environment. A novel evolutionary decision support framework (coevolutionary virtual design environment) particularly suited to distributed network-enabled organizations is introduced. In this framework an electronic interchange of design, supplier, and manufacturing information facilitates concurrent, network distributed decision-making based on evolutionary computation. The approach utilizes distributed evolutionary agents and mobile agents as principal entities that support a network-efficient exploration of planning alternatives in which successive populations systematically select planning alternatives that reduce cost and increase throughput.	decision support system;entity;evolutionary computation;mobile agent;population;throughput	Raj Subbu;Arthur C.

8f205e958fe41abdbf214132b5072e951218fbb8	discovering bpmn models with sub-processes and multi-instance markers	会议论文	Massive event logs are produced in information systems, which record executions of business processes in organizations. Various techniques are proposed to discover process models reflecting real-life behaviors from these logs. However, the discovered models are mostly in Petri nets rather than BPMN models, the current industrial process modeling standard. Conforti et al. and Weber et al. propose techniques that discover BPMN models with subprocesses, multi-instance, etc. However, these techniques are made for event logs with special attributes, e.g., containing attributes about primary and foreign keys, which may not commonly appear in event logs. For example, logs from the OA (office automation) systems of CMCC (China Mobile Communications Corporation) do not contain such data. To solve this issue, this paper proposes two techniques that can discover BPMN models with sub-processes and multiinstance markers with event logs containing less event attributes. One of our techniques only requires four event attributes: case id, task name, start time and end time. Experimental evaluations with both real-life logs and synthetic logs show that our techniques can indeed discover process models with sub-process and multi-instance markers from logs with less event attributes, and are more accurate and less complex than those derived with flat process model discovery techniques.	business process model and notation;complexity;experiment;foreign key;information system;petri net;process modeling;real life;recursion;synthetic intelligence	Yuquan Wang;Lijie Wen;Zhiqiang Yan;Bo Sun;Jianmin Wang	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-26148-5_11	computer science;data science;data mining;world wide web	SE	-52.941246433814825	17.41530159834142	62234

On the other hand, companies feel the need to focus their core competencies and are downloading product development tasks to their suppliers. As a result, related manufacturing enterprises are closely joined together through, e.g., virtual enterprises, using advanced information and communication technologies. Sharing and exchange of information and knowledge among related enterprises becomes more and more important. This paper presents our agent-based approach to organise enterprise’s activities and those of its customers, suppliers and partners into an open dynamic environment via networks to facilitate the sharing and exchange of information and knowledge related to customer requirements, products, production, and services, etc. A hybrid agent-based architecture is proposed, main features of this architecture are described and a prototype implementation is presented.	agent-based model;customer relationship management;download;new product development;prototype;requirement	Weiming Shen;Douglas H.

The main problem is that the great diversity of the potential product range may make it impracticable to provide conventional  support documentation for all versions offered. In this paper we explore some approaches of web-based information systems  to support post-sales services in a customised manufacturing context. The major objective is to integrate various new technologies  of Internet, Database and Expert Systems, such as JavaServer Page and Servlet Technology, JDBC, and Model-Based Methods, to  supply on-line maintenance and diagnostic support to field service engineers.

For long-term archiving and for CAD data exchange, we make a pipe-design file using ISO10303 AP227, where the pipe-design file has information on the location and orientation of piping components. We created a catalogue database for the templates of every piping component in the ship-CAD using ISO15926 and we built a shape database for the shape of each component and specification files from a model of a commercial shipbuilding CAD system. We refer to these entities as pipe DESIGN file, CATALOGUE Library, SHAPE DB, and SPEC file, and together they comprise a """"Neutral Model"""". In this situation, the neutral model is distributed in remote locations and local systems, as noted above. As such, it is difficult to check the archived status of specific piping components. Therefore, visualization of the neutral model is mandatory to check the archived status of the pipe model.

The work described in the present paper originates from the intuition that business process modelling, service design and reputation system modelling share many needs, aims and problems: to represent a variety of entities involved in the related domains, to improve services/business in order to meet the users need, moreover they all involve stakeholders with very different background and skills, a problem known as socio-technical mismatch. The objective and the contribution of the analysis presented in this paper is to gather feedback on the proposed modelling language from the end-users (requirements engineers and domain experts) while applying it to a complex case study.

An object oriented concept is used to represent a ship model. Two types of object are introduced: one is a part object which states the geometrical properties and attributes of the object, the other is a connection object which states the connection between part objects A and B. The function of cutting a designed structure into small pieces and assembling these pieces into a large module are described. The system is called SODAS, System of Design and Assembly for Shipbuilding.

A process-oriented workflow system model which can support workflow configuration, process control, task assignment, task submitting and approval, and cooperative work is presented. The model is a hierachical architecture that consists of three layers, i.e. database layer, workflow engine layer, and user interface layer. It is based on Browser/Server architecture which can provide multi-user, distributed and access control properties. The workflow engine is based on XPDL and relational database technologies and can support cooperative work, branch selection and workflow configuration. The model is implemented on Windows .NET platform, and is applied in an international enterprise project management system. The application results demonstrate that this workflow system model can satisfy the requirement of cooperative project management.	.net framework;access control;automatic control;business process;computer multitasking;microsoft windows;multi-user;relational database;user interface;workflow engine;xpdl	Yi Chen;Jile Xin	2010	The 2010 14th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design	10.1109/CSCWD.2010.5471976	project management;workflow;xpdl;relational database;computer science;knowledge management;operating system;workflow management coalition;automatic control;process control;database;windows workflow foundation;user interface;management;workflow management system;workflow engine;workflow technology	DB	-50.9733797879429	17.363648121829353	63170

Business rules are the instrument chosen to help business and IT to collaborate. In this paper, we propose the utilization of simulation models to model and simulate strategic business rules that are then disaggregated at different levels of an SOA architecture. Our proposal is aimed to help find a good configuration for strategic business objectives and IT parameters. The paper includes a case study where a simulation model is built to help business decision-making in a context where finding a good configuration for different business parameters and performance is too complex to analyze by trial and error.	business process;co-ment;electronic billing;mathematical optimization;outsourcing;real life;rejection sampling;service-level agreement;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;simulation	Elena Orta;Mercedes Ruiz;Miguel Toro	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04280-5_28	business rule management system;business transformation;business logic;semantics of business vocabulary and business rules;business domain;systems engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;operations management;business case;process modeling;business process model and notation;business system planning;business;business process;business process discovery;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	AI	-56.63530107155416	14.850325485369096	63877

Therefore the development of control system software that can accommodate the required changes to the control logic as oil fields mature is equally challenging. In this paper, we present a novel, extensible stratified multi-agent system that facilitates multi-objective control across multiple decision layers at oil and gas production platforms. Using a case study, we demonstrate that the stratified multi-agent system can perform better than the control of today and support fields with very complex configurations.	control system;feedback;high- and low-level;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;requirement;simulation;siri	Lars Lindegaard Mikkelsen;Bo Nørregaard Jørgensen	2012		10.1145/2401603.2401685	control engineering;simulation;engineering;operations management	AI	-54.02657872514488	11.26186378973807	64196

It also explains why previous contributions about versions of BPs are incomplete, and need to be revisited. Then, the paper presents a meta-model for BP versions, which combines five perspectives -the functional, process, informational, organizational and operation perspectives- for BP modelling, and which allows a comprehensive description of versionalized BPs.	business process	Mohamed Amine Chaâbane;Eric Andonoff;Rafik Bouaziz;Lotfi Bouzguenda	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03973-7_2	computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;database;business process model and notation;process management;business process;business process discovery;business rule;business process modeling	Robotics	-59.91530247741734	17.501802378965934	64387

Supply chains are dynamic due to frequent changes in suppliers, customers, and products. However, information systems for supply chains are not flexible enough to adapt to the changes, requiring high cost and time for re-implementation and re-customization. This paper suggests a flexible agent system for supply chains that can adapt to the changes in transactions introduced by new products or new trading partners. The flexible agent system consists of an interpretable conversation policy model, a procedure for exchanging new conversation policies, and a mechanism for actual transactions with newly acquired conversation policies. By using the flexible agent system, formation of supply chains becomes more robust to the dynamic changes. To show how the approach can be realized, a PC supply chain application is illustrated with a prototype agent platform.		Hyung Jun Ahn;Habin Lee;Sung Joo Park	2003	Expert Syst.

52a6e132f3a63ccc49f48e2a7276230bbe66a32a	model-driven risk analysis of evolving critical infrastructures		The protection and security of critical infrastructures are important parts of Homeland Defense. Adequate means for analyzing the security risks of such infrastructures is a prerequisite for properly understanding the security needs and for maintaining appropriate incident preparedness. Risk management is coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk, and includes the identification, analysis and mitigation of unacceptable risks. For critical infrastructures consisting of interdependent systems, risk analysis and mitigation is challenging because the overall risk picture may be strongly affected by changes in only a few of the systems. In order to continuously manage risks and maintain an adequate level of protection, there is a need to continuously maintain the validity of risk models while systems change and evolve. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting an approach to model-driven security risk analysis of changing and evolving systems. The approach is a tool-supported method with techniques and modeling support for traceability of system changes to risk models, as well as the explicit modeling of the impact of changes on the current risk picture.

In Concurrent Engineering, several designers (participants) aim at designing a system (artifact), given requirements. Conflict Management in Concurrent Engineering is a complex task in which it is difficult to identify conflicts and to solve them. Reuse of generic components is generally considered as a good help to guide complex task modeling. An overview of our study to define a library of generic components to guide conflict management modeling is presented below. Conflict management methods, proposed in the literature, are classified and associated to each concurrent engineering subtask. This classification provides help to index these methods, considered as generic components in a library.	requirement	Nada Matta;Olivier Corby	2000		10.1007/978-3-642-56980-7_7	computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;management science	SE	-60.83236278324957	13.251782875745727	65684

Developing advanced architectures may prove essential for achieving emerging research, business, and social goals. Indeed, the profoundly changed landscape suggests that a new paradigm may be needed, an inter-enterprise architectonic (I-EA) informing architectures capable of integrating all key components and processes in an increasingly interconnected environment. To meet this challenge, a systems architectonic is outlined that is based on the trichotomic category theory of Charles S. Peirce. Trikonic Inter-Enterprise Architectonic involves a pragmatic approach to the observation and manipulation of diagrams as models of enterprise and inter-enterprise processes.	category theory;diagram;enterprise architecture;programming paradigm	Gary Richmond	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73681-3_2	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management science;enterprise architecture;information architecture;category theory	DB	-60.6969010547293	15.04800885199394	66047

3f98b49095815866fef2c6286b420fc27ae322bb	intelligent virtual manufacturing cell formation in cloud-based design and manufacturing		Abstract Cloud-based design and manufacturing ( CBDM ) can presumably stimulate greater intelligence in cloud-based models. This paper assumes that cloud-based design for cellular manufacturing can be referred to as a multiscale, uncertain, and dynamic service-oriented network where a set of CAD parts, modelled by set of features, can be manufactured in intelligent virtual manufacturing cells under certain constraints. Using the concepts of the holon and the attractor, integrating the uncertainty in the modelling of part design and part–manufacturing network, an approach to address intelligent virtual manufacturing cell formation in CBDM is proposed. The powerful role of the CAD features is exploited to organize and integrate part design and part–manufacturing engineering knowledge. Intelligent manufacturing features, modelled as fuzzy agents, are recognized in CAD part models and the distributed capabilities of machines in cloud manufacturing are evaluated through mobile intelligent agents. Then, intelligent virtual manufacturing cells, with holonic structure, emerge from the interactions of fuzzy machine holon agents and fuzzy part holon agents with holon agent attractors. The concepts of the holon and the attractor allow multi-scale cell formation with holonic structure: “intelligent virtual manufacturing cells within an intelligent virtual manufacturing cell” . These fuzzy cell holons overcome the distinction continuous–discontinuous of traditional cell design formation problem.	cloud-based design and manufacturing	Egon Ostrosi;Alain-Jérôme Fougères	2018	Eng.

It then investigates CBR-based product negotiation. This paper thus gives insight into how to use CBR in e-commerce and how to improve the understanding of CBR with its applications in ecommerce from a logical viewpoint.	case-based reasoning;e-commerce;logical data model;refinement (computing)	Zhaohao Sun;Gavin R.

We consider that the use of the Enterprise Architecture (EA) concept for organizing these technologies into a framework would allow us to achieve a better ICT - business alignment. This article presents a process model for the ICT Management that is oriented to medium and small enterprises. The main difference between the proposed model and the others found in domain's literature is that our model places EA concept at the center of the organization of ICT management activities. It provides a better definition, organization and comprehension of the essential business activities. Consequently, our model would facilitate the restructuring of organizational units responsible for the ICT management. The described model is used in several Venezuelan enterprises as a referential framework in order to improve their current ICT management processes. This experience would serve to refine and optimize its application in other Latin-American enterprises.	enterprise architecture;organizing (structure);process modeling	Jonás A.

By analyzing the conflicting or cooperative relationships among the process requirements, the reasoning scheme for inferring the relationships between the requirements and information, and the feedback control mechanism are developed. Using the proposed method, three reorganization activities, reorganizing the constraints, reorganizing the process, and reorganizing the structure of a designer’s preference, can be carried out to transfer the balance point of the development process from one point to another or be optimized at the initial place. The case study shows that the macro-feedback and micro-feedback modeling of a product development process based on information feedback and requirement cooperation is an important method to realize lifecycle design, optimize the whole development process and product performance, capture the designer’s preferences, and satisfy the process requirements.	feedback;material flow;motion capture;multistage amplifier;new product development;process modeling;quality function deployment;requirement	Hong-Zhong Huang;Ying-Kui Gu	2006	Concurrent Engineering: R&A	10.1177/1063293X06066195	reliability engineering;design process;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;operations management;software engineering;process modeling	SE	-60.84013057304829	12.410035977055578	66640
0c721c544260c43dd79c8efb1d48402662e03dd6	identification of influential nodes in multi-layer mapping service network for high-end manufacturing equipment		The identification of influential nodes is a vital step in the study of complex network. Its research could optimize the use of limited resources on ensuring the more efficient spread of information. However, the existing ranking methods to identify influential nodes pose challenges for multi-layer network. They also have little consideration about node functionality. Thus, in this paper, combined with the constructed multi-layer mapping service network of high-end manufacturing equipment in product service system (PSS) field, a novel and comprehensive identification method is proposed to find the influential functions, influential structures and influential services. It provides a guidance for service designers to ensure the availability of influential functions with the effective control on influential services. This method defines the influential nodes as the set of core nodes, inner-relational key nodes, mapping-relational key nodes and community leader nodes where the core nodes are determined based on the proposed quantitative CF-BOM (Cost-Failure BOM) and S-BOM (Service BOM). The developed multi-centrality correlation (MUCC) method that combines the advantages of different centralities, reveals the inner-relational key nodes. The community leader nodes are found based on the detected influential communities. Finally, a simplified multi-layer mapping service network from high-end CNC honing machine is studied to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.	biological anthropology;browser object model;centrality;complex network;layer (electronics);physical symbol system;web mapping	Fengtian Chang;Guanghui Zhou;Changle Tian;Chao Zhang;Chuang Wang	2018	2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control (ICNSC)	10.1109/ICNSC.2018.8361319	complex network;control engineering;product-service system;ranking;distributed computing;computer science	Mobile	-61.598130415232376	9.870948898866233	66676

However, there are no recent studies that cover the existent interoperability alternatives in the model-driven domain nor is there a common interoperability framework. This paper confronts this situation through a systematic analysis of recent interoperability approaches that provide relevant features for MDD processes. From this analysis, a general interoperability framework is depicted, which is complemented with our contributions to solve specific interoperability issues. Therefore, we present those aspects that are already covered by existent proposals as well as those pending subjects that, from our point of view, are future challenges in order to achieve a suitable interoperability framework for MDD approaches.	capability maturity model;domain-specific modeling;emergence;general-purpose markup language;general-purpose modeling;interoperability;metamodeling;model-driven architecture;model-driven engineering;modeling language;pivot table;point of view (computer hardware company);redundancy (engineering);relevance;semantic heterogeneity;semantic mapper;systematic review	Giovanni Giachetti;Francisco Valverde;Beatriz Marín	2012	2012 Sixth International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS)	10.1109/RCIS.2012.6240445	semantic interoperability;interoperability;systematic review;computer science;systems engineering;software engineering;data mining;database;open system;cross-domain interoperability	DB	-58.038178507370645	18.221500505733413	66681

The demonstration system is targeted at a broadly useful class of machined prismatic parts which includes sculpted exterior pro les and features requiring four and ve axis indexing for manufacture. The approach introduces a set of process plan templates which are schemas for a family of process plans embodying a variety of xturing strategies. The knowledge built into the process plan templates can adapt existing part hole features to be used for xturing, can modify the workpiece to enable xturing, and can create custom xturing components for stages of the process plan. The process plan template system automatically transforms a given part design into a complete process plan. The user can provide optional guidance for this transformation and also can edit the resulting process plan to further extend the usefulness of this approach through customization. Domain knowledge in the process plan then automatically generates CNC code for a target machining center. This research is implemented as an experimental subsystem within our Alpha 1 modeling and manufacturing testbed environment, and has been used to design and manufacture working components for outside client applications.

Previously we proposed an approach for effectively constructing synchronized collaborative design environment based on heterogeneous CAD systems. In this paper, we extend the synchronized collaborative design environment that we have developed to a Web services based platform for exchange of procedural CAD models between heterogeneous CAD systems. First, the real-time exchange of a single operation is extended to the exchange of the complete procedural CAD model between heterogeneous CAD systems. Furthermore, Web services technology is adopted to encapsulate the procedural CAD model exchange functions, which are then released on the Internet as a standard interface and can be used by remote developers in their windows applications, Web applications, and so on. Finally, a Web service for exchange of procedural CAD models between SolidWorks and Autodesk Mechanical Desktop is realized.

69b70e9293317a148825b3c0dfb75868e6814bd3	holistic design of collaborative networks of design engineering organizations		The paper presents a visual knowledge-based approach for designing collaborative networks of engineering design organizations. The novelty of this holistic approach lies in integrated modelling of business, engineering, and learning processes. Distributed design tasks are easier coordinated due to explicit representation of management procedures as visual knowledge models of design flows and workflows. Furthermore, these visual models enable definition of design task patterns that can support design innovation management and learning across distributed teams. Proliferation of this approach in engineering communities is conditioned by availability of appropriate open platforms enabling distributed collaborative design and continuous learning processes in a frame of a collaborative engineering network.	collaborative network;holism	Adam Pawlak;Håvard D.

This paper describes from theory how designers should reason about functions when designing. This paper introduces the link model, showing how functions and properties link the product and its use, to the perceived value of the product. The important and useful distinction between functions and properties is made along with the distinction between “wirk functions,” which is what the product does when operating, and “use functions,” which is what the product is used for. The paper makes a novel contribution beyond previous literature, showing that not only is a product's behavior or mode of action designed but also the use activity of the end user. Based on the theoretical perspective unfolded, the authors offer nine mind-sets for both design practitioners and researchers to consider when reasoning about functions.	engineering design process;interpretation (logic);mind;new product development	Thomas J.

They are often used in supply chains as a support for decision-making and seem especially helpful to test and analyze different control design alternatives. However, the lack of evaluation methods of MAS is a major disincentive to their use in such real world applications. In this paper, a MAS evaluation method is first presented. It focuses on communication as it is one of the most important functional characteristics of distributed systems in general and MAS in particular. Then three multiagent models representing different supply chain control architectures (distributed, centralized and mixed) are presented, evaluated and compared according to the advanced method. Experimentation is carried out with reference to a test-case supply chain network in the domain of furniture manufacturing.	agent-based model;centralized computing;complex systems;distributed computing;graph theory;stemming;supply chain network	Faten Ben Hmida;Wided Lejouad Chaari;Rémy Dupas;Anne Seguy	2014	2014 IEEE 26th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence	10.1109/ICTAI.2014.68	planning;service management;knowledge management;graph theory;evaluation;supply chain;scientific control;measurement	Robotics	-53.92424892410128	9.74584086600804	67483

The data models differ in details and their scopes are different, making it difficult to compare and evaluate them. While the importance of using commonly agreed standard data models has widely been accepted, the diversity of the models hinders companies from choosing between them when implementing e.g. data warehouses. In many cases this leads to implementing in-house, non-standard models. In this paper, criteria for evaluating and comparing data models are introduced. Five data models developed by international or national organizations are introduced and compared, based on the criteria.	information management;personal knowledge base	Pekka Siltanen;Antti Pärnänen	2006			systems engineering;engineering;data mining;database	DB	-59.42159876086828	13.983737322873433	68244

b15d75e8eff30492d73437c61d28fddf2827a3b8	rapid hardware and software reconfiguration in a robotic workcell		In an increasingly competitive manufacturing industry it is becoming ever more important to rapidly react to changes in market demands. In order to satisfy these requirements, it is crucial that automated manufacturing processes are flexible and can be adapted to new production requirements quickly. In this paper we present a novel automatically reconfigurable robot workcell that addresses the issues of flexible manufacturing. The proposed workcell is reconfigurable in terms of hardware and software. The hardware elements of the workcell, both those selected off-the-shelf and those developed specifically for the system, allow for fast cell setup and reconfiguration, while the software aims to provide a modular, robot-independent, ROS-based programming environment. While the proposed workcell is being developed in such a way as to address the needs of production-oriented SMEs where batch sizes are relatively small, it will also be of interest to enterprises with larger production lines since it additionally targets high performance in terms of speed, interoperability of robotic elements, and ease of use.	application programming interface;component-based software engineering;flexible-fuel vehicle;high- and low-level;integrated development environment;interoperability;modular programming;real-time clock;real-time transcription;reconfigurability;requirement;robot operating system;robot control;server (computing);software system;systems architecture;time server;usability;visual programming language	Timotej Gaspar;Barry Ridge;Robert Bevec;Martin Bem;Igor Kovac;Ales Ude;Ziga Gosar	2017	2017 18th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)	10.1109/ICAR.2017.8023523	control reconfiguration;interoperability;software;real-time computing;computer hardware;usability;workcell;modular design;new production;manufacturing;engineering	Robotics	-54.73825800923796	11.053833689859147	68839

Many information systems record executed process instances in the event log, a very rich source of information for several process management tasks, like process mining and trace comparison. In this paper, we present a framework, able to convert activities in the event log into higher level concepts, at different levels of abstraction, on the basis of domain knowledge. Our abstraction mechanism manages non trivial situations, such as interleaved activities or delays between two activities that abstract to the same concept.Abstracted traces can then be provided as an input to an intelligent system, meant to implement a variety of process management tasks, significantly enhancing the quality and the usefulness of its output.In particular, in the paper we demonstrate how trace abstraction can impact on the quality of process discovery, showing that it is possible to obtain more readable and understandable process models.We also prove, through our experimental results, the impact of our approach on the capability of trace comparison and clustering (realized by means of a metric able to take into account abstraction phase penalties) to highlight (in)correct behaviors, abstracting from details.

The old mechanistic operations management solutions are becoming obsolete and advanced decision support is increasingly needed to realize efficient and effective management of complex SCs. The objective of this research is to contribute to the understanding of how Agent Based Modeling (ABM) can advance decision making and to discuss why ABM should be regarded as method to realize Information Fusion (IF). In this research work an agent based model of SCM has been implemented in a simulation platform to provide an approach for evaluation of decision and management alternatives. Research shows that this kind of decision support system is based on IF, since it collects and fuses information from different sources into a situation image that provides effective support for human decision making		Per Hilletofth;Lauri Lättilä;Olli-Pekka Hilmola	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-01665-3_68	decision support system;decision engineering;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;supply chain;business decision mapping	Robotics	-62.40134089535688	10.58662428573095	69400
35e93c9ce542ecdce369f0cfec437c515ed3c558	disaster management simulation and research integration's virtual test bed proposal for the chilean national research center for integrated natural disaster management (cigiden)		The Chilean National Research Center for Integrated Natural Disaster Management, CIGIDEN, was created in 2011 to develop, integrate, and transfer scientific knowledge to reduce the social consequences of extreme natural events. As one of its transfer products, CIGIDEN created a Disaster Management Simulation Lab (DMSLab) to deliver a practical training solution for disaster management. We propose a Virtual Test Bed to support the DMSLab by providing a simulation based, multi-disciplinary risk analysis platform. It will strengthen CIGIDEN's transfer and research integration capabilities, offering the tools and methodologies already being developed by the Center for emergency-based decision-making, optimization through simulation and humanitarian aid. A case study of a virtual disaster scenario developed with the Chilean National Emergency Office (ONEMI) is presented, to illustrate how the Virtual Test Bed can support research application in real scenarios.	mathematical model;mathematical optimization;program optimization;simulation	Andrea Vásquez;Luis F.

The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm unifies dis parate, heterogeneous technologies. It resurrects legacy technology silos with a Service 'face-lift' while maintaining their autonomy. Somewhat in its infancy as standards and methodologies are evaluated and adopted, the differences between theory and praxis of SOA remain to be fully de termined, predominately due to the size and complexity of the conundrum it addresses.	altran praxis;autonomy;legacy system;limbo;programming paradigm;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture	Ed Young	2009	IJWP	10.4018/jwp.2009070102	enterprise architecture framework;reference architecture;simulation;computer science;applications architecture;software engineering;service-oriented architecture;service;solution architecture;architecture framework;law;data architecture	SE	-57.52240468743667	16.147836661250135	70119

When manufacturing customized products it is often necessary to also develop corresponding customized manufacturing tooling. There is a need to support concurrent development of new product variants along with their manufacturing toolsets. The communication between design engineers and manufacturing engineers is hence a key issue that if solved would enable design engineers to foresee how changes in product design affect tooling design and vice versa.To understand the correlation between the design of a product and its corresponding manufacturing tools, access to design rationale of the product and the developed tooling is required. Design rationale provides an explanation of why an artifact is designed in the way it is, including statements (textual, numerical or geometrical), argumentations, and decisions. Since design rationale is composed of information scattered all across the company's repositories in different formats (e.g. in type of a geometry, picture, table, and textual document), representing the design rationale is a challenge for many enterprises. In this paper a method is introduced that enables capture, structure and access to design rationale across product design and tooling design. The system enables representing design rationale in formats such as CAD models, spreadsheets, textual formats, and web pages. The method has been examined by developing a prototype system tested in a case company which develops and manufactures customized car accessories, such as roof racks and bike carriers, for different car models. The company develops and manufactures the products as well as the required tooling equipment. The prototype system includes different software commonly used by engineers during designing a product, for the purpose of making it applicable for other companies.	design rationale	Morteza Poorkiany;Joel Johansson;Fredrik Elgh	2016	Advanced Engineering Informatics	10.1016/j.aei.2016.06.004	build to order;idef6;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;software engineering;design review;design education;product design;design technology;design for manufacturability;management;design rationale;manufacturing engineering;product engineering;mechanical engineering	EDA	-58.82033171454259	11.136771112433403	70210

Such an evolving environment contributes to both the process and the system complexity which cannot be handled by the traditional architectures. The constant pressure of requirements for more data, more collaboration and more flexibility motivates us to discuss about the concept of Next Generation EIS (NG EIS) which is federated, omnipresent, model-driven, open, reconfigurable and aware. All these properties imply that the future enterprise system is inherently interoperable. This position paper presents the discussion that spans several research challenges of future interoperable enterprise systems, specialized from the existing general research priorities and directions of IFAC Technical Committee 5.3, namely: context-aware systems, semantic interoperability, cyber-physical systems, cloud-based systems and interoperability assessment.	cloud computing;context-aware pervasive systems;cyber-physical system;enterprise information system;enterprise system;model-driven architecture;next-generation network;requirement;semantic interoperability	Hervé Panetto;Milan Zdravkovic;Ricardo Jardim-Gonçalves;David Romero;Joe Cecil;István Mezgár	2016	Computers in Industry	10.1016/j.compind.2015.08.001	enterprise architecture framework;semantic interoperability;interoperability;enterprise system;enterprise application integration;enterprise systems engineering;enterprise software;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;architecture domain;database;enterprise architecture;enterprise integration;cyber-physical system;cross-domain interoperability;world wide web;enterprise planning system;enterprise information system;enterprise life cycle	OS	-58.7217205906476	17.729738957799192	70326

Beginning with an analysis of the relationships between the 3PL and supply chain members, the authors suggest that only when the 3PL reengineers its logistics business process to accommodate the customer could it maximize the value of the customer. Finally, five intelligent agents, order management agent, logistics process reengineering agent, resource scheduling agent, dynamic union management agent and simulating and evaluating agent are designed to form an e-commerce based 3PL system which, with the collaboration of the five agents, could construct a virtual private logistics teamwork suitable for a certain customer’s need and furthermore, realize the win–win between the customer and the logistics service vendor. q 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	business process;code refactoring;e-commerce;intelligent agent;logistics;management agent;order management system;scheduling (computing);simulation	Wang Ying;Sang Dayong	2005	Expert Syst.

It presents many open roads for research, even if leading to much dispersion and fuzziness due to the different views and subjects involved. On the path to build a conceptual, structured framework that incorporates the related topics of requirements engineering, enterprise architecture and strategy alignment, our literature search uncovered three main themes: the business model artifact, strategy and goal modelling, and enterprise modelling. Following, the research problem and its related research questions, which answers will give origin to artifacts, through design science (working on existing knowledge) and action research (working in live projects), were laid out. Initial steps in our incremental research approach, with a perspective on the requirements engineering and business model topics, and the development of a new method around an existing solution for the generation of logical architectures, have been well received by the research community. Current and future work in our plan will deepen and extend our research, further grounding the business model artifact and the strategy and goal modelling issues, while approaching the enterprise modelling, framework structuring and tools support.	categorization;enterprise architecture;enterprise modelling;goal modeling;information systems;requirement;requirements engineering;sms language;strategic management	Carlos E.

04768708f36f80c381304fc6f966fd5d4bb08e5f	an analysis of enterprise architecture frameworks from a coherent enterprise description viewpoint		Enterprise architecture (EA) is present at every company; however, just few organizations have their architecture formalized and manage it to meet their strategic goals. EA creates opportunity for an effective interaction between business and ITC world. Moreover, EA serves as the blueprint for a company and the process which defines it. This paper formulates problem with current approach describing an enterprise and shows that service orientation is a key to coherent enterprise architecture description. We briefly discuss enterprise architecture cohesion and propose method how to measure the level of cohesion within enterprise architecture layers. Main contribution of this paper consists in a comparison and analysis of the chosen frameworks (ArchiMate, Zachman, TOGAF, and DoDAF) based on cohesion viewpoint. Conclusions made by authors could serve as guidance for particular framework extension with the aim to gain coherent enterprise description.	coherent;enterprise architecture;viewpoint	Vladimir Selcan;Alena Buchalcevová	2012		10.1007/978-1-4614-7540-8_40	enterprise architecture framework;functional software architecture;rm-odp;enterprise systems engineering;nist enterprise architecture model;enterprise modelling;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;architecture domain;applications architecture;integrated enterprise modeling;software engineering;enterprise architecture management;solution architecture;enterprise architecture;enterprise integration;view model;enterprise information security architecture;enterprise information system;business architecture	DB	-58.8348495671855	16.5545069954447	70507

When business processes are automated using Web-based workflow systems (WWS), process evolutions and changes need to be reflected in these implemented systems. Evolutions in business processes essentially mean altering process elements - actions, participants, object, and rules. In a process, elements are interlinked and woven together to achieve business objectives of an organization. Thus, a change in one element creates propagating impact on the other elements that are linked to it. Therefore, it is critical to understand constraints, associations and dependencies (CAD) among process elements for effective management of process evolution in WWS. Previous studies on CAD among process elements mostly focus on (at most) one or two process elements at a time. This paper brings together these isolated works into a single CAD model of process elements. Cohesive and complete nature of this model, lays the foundation to effective management of process evolution in WWS.	business process;computer-aided design;evolution	Jeewani Anupama Ginige;Athula Ginige;Uma Sirinivasan	2007	6th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS 2007)	10.1109/ICIS.2007.72	computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;database;business process model and notation;process management;business process;business process discovery;business process modeling	DB	-55.90995133478905	17.817929802498846	70950

First, the authors identify problems in the traditional metal stamping part and die development processes and outline the need for performance of concurrent stamping part design in order to achieve cost effectiveness that accommodates the concept of concurrent engineering. Based on feature-based modelling, a systematic method has been proposed to qualitatively analyse stamping costs through the design stages according to part information availability. The direct relationship existing between part features and cost factors is analysed in detail. Through feature-based qualitative cost analysis, the designer can identify the part attributes that significantly increase the die construction cost and redesign such parts as early in the process as possible. In addition, an algorithmic method is presented to estimate the stamping die cost quantitatively when the stamping ...		Dunbing Tang;Walter Eversheim;Günther Schuh	2004	Int. J.

Building ontologies as knowledge representation models with respect to technological systems information is increasingly seen as a key to enable interoperability between software agents and people on the Web or through to network connections. This work presents a first step for the development of an ontological model for technological systems structure representation composed by physical artifacts. The goal of the work is twofold. First, the structure of these systems is described. Besides, a model to adapt the known Bill of Materials (BOM) to the needs of distribution companies focused not only on selling physical artifacts but also to correctly configure a technological system is presented. Finally, our approach proposes a mereotopological relationships set to model the interactions between the parts that make up the structure.	ontology (information science)	Liudmila Reyes-Alvarez;Jaime Fernández;Luis J.

This paper presents a novel methodology called Design Scenarios (DSs) intended for use in conceptual design of buildings. DS enables multidisciplinary design teams to streamline the requirements definition, alternative generation, analysis, and decision-making processes by providing a methodology for building and managing requirements driven design spaces with parametric Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools. DS consists of four interdependent models: (1) Requirements Model – stakeholders and designers explicitly define and prioritize context specific design requirements; (2) Scenarios Model (SM) – designers formally transform these requirements into actions necessary to achieve them, and determine the geometric and material parameters, interrelationships, and potential conflicts; (3) Parametric Process Model (PPM) – CAD experts build and represent the technical implementation of a SM in a parametric model to enable design teams to manage and communicate its CAD models; (4) Alternative Analysis Model – analyze and visually report performance back to the designers and stakeholders. This paper motivates the need for the DS methodology thorough an industry case study, and establishes points of departure for the methodology through literature review. Next, the paper details the elements and methods in the methodology, describes its implementation into a software prototype, provides an illustrative example to explain, and an industry test case to validate how DS can potentially enable multidisciplinary teams to generate and communicate larger and better performing design spaces more efficiently than with traditional methods. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

e91dd92ca1d54453b42424deae23bb95fc7b308b	agent-based semantic business process management methodology		Business complexity is growing exponentially and current business process management (BPM) systems that depend on static process definitions are becoming inadequate to adept complex and dynamic nature of this new business environment. Multi agent and semantic technologies based solutions are natural candidates for a solution towards more flexible ways of working, shortening organizational reaction times and fully embracing business unpredictability. This paper presents an agent based semantic business process management methodology that aims at the integration of business process management lifecycle and agent oriented software engineering methodologies. Specifically, the proposed methodology enables the intelligent agent based self-adaptation of business processes via goal and semantic technologies based enhancement of processes specifications.	business process	Hüseyin Kir;Nadia Erdogan	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39324-7_13	semantic data model;systems engineering;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;process modeling;business process model and notation;process management;information management;business process;process mining;business relationship management;business process discovery;business rule;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	DB	-58.223475012677056	16.699437541639444	72314

One is the development of the processes needed to meet the requirements for the product, the other is the setup of a control system enabling the hardware to perform these processes. Typically the larger amount of the available resources is needed for the setup of hardware and implementation of the required control mechanism, leaving only limited resources for the process development. Especially for small scale and prototype production with a high rate of changes, this is why fully automated solutions don't pay off and manual or partial manually assembly is preferred [1]. This paper introduces an approach how to separate the implementation effort of the hardware specific tasks from the process definition, allowing a fast and easy setup for new automation systems, due to simultaneous development and a high rate of reuse of previous	automation;control system;list of version control software;microsoft outlook for mac;prototype;requirement;software framework;software system	Christian Brecher;Martin Freundt;Daniel Schöllhorn	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-11598-1_31	real-time computing;computer science;systems engineering;operations management	OS	-54.60480956223449	11.559601222010693	72593

During the early 90’s, workflow technologies were the only ones to offer a transversal integration capacity to the enterprise applications. However, the formalisms developed for workflow specifications were almost systematically activity oriented. Consequently, the resulting process definitions have the advantage to be easily transformable in executable code but the disadvantage of being prescriptive and rigid. Recent works underline the needs in term of flexible and adaptive workflows, whose execution can evolve according to situations that cannot always be prescribed. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for an intention driven modeling of flexible workflow applications. The purpose of the underlying modeling formalism is to define an integration/orchestration for islands of business process chunks. The modeling framework offers the ability to represent in the same business process definition the well-structured process chunks as well as the ill-structured or ad hoc ones.	business process;enterprise modelling;enterprise software;executable;hoc (programming language);information system;map;orchestration (computing);process modeling;semantics (computer science);simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Selmin Nurcan;Marc-Henri Edme	2005	Software Process: Improvement and Practice	10.1002/spip.240	workflow;xpdl;enterprise modelling;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;software engineering;process modeling;data mining;conceptual framework;business process model and notation;business process;event-driven process chain;process mining;business process discovery;management;business rule;business process modeling;workflow management system;workflow engine;workflow technology	HCI	-56.23667896963554	17.537953759526516	72778

For years, much emphasis has been focused on the concurrent design and manufacturing, and other integrated production activities. However, the distributed production scheduling, a post-design procedure playing a very crucial role in the whole process of production, has not received sufficient attention. Comparing with traditional single-factory or single-jobshop scheduling, the distributed scheduling is uneasy to manage and the information exchange between different scheduling participants is much more complex. This paper reports a web-based system to enable production scheduling for the distributed manufacturing environment with the utilization of the latest Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) technology. A Genetic Algorithm (GA), which involves once gene crossover and twice gene mutation, is adopted as the scheduling kernel to make distributed scheduling optimization. The entire webbased scheduling system includes three layers, i.e., stand-alone application module, scheduling agent module, and e-scheduling module. They are implemented using Java Application and Applet Language. With such a system in place, every manufacturing participant is no longer an isolated production element and the information among the participants can be shared and exchanged in real time. Furthermore, contingencies in any factory such as machine breakdown or design modification can be handled in real time.	applet;authorization;cer computer;distributed manufacturing;genetic algorithm;information exchange;internet;java;mathematical optimization;prototype;scheduling (computing);software release life cycle;www;web application;world wide web	H.

10007c677c62dfa1f2975c4180a0351b078ffd0d	data exchange format requirements and analysis collaboration in pcb design		The design of a printed circuit board (PCB) is an example of the variety of technologies that have to be combined in a single physical output. Thus the need for collaboration between engineering teams, each of which with their own expertise (e.g. electrical, mechanical, testing and manufacturing) is of paramount importance. This imposes the need to share the electrical design and the PCB layout among different expertise teams that participate in a common electronic product development. The effective collaboration between the various teams can bring tremendous gains during the development phase as well as during the production phase, by increasing product performance and avoiding production issues. However these teams often face the problem that each of these teams are using different tools that do not enable sharing PCB layout data. An overview of the advances in this field is presented in this paper. In the context of a real electronic product manufacturer, this paper presents the PCB data exchange requirements and the analysis of how existing Electronic Computer-Aided Design (ECAD) file formats meet those same requirements. A reflection is made about the challenges that latest developments face. Lastly, future research perspectives are drawn.	binary file;cdh1 gene;cdh1 wt allele;computer peripherals;computer-aided design;electronic design automation;engineering;isoproterenol;new product development;numerous;printed circuit board device component;printing;requirement;format;teams	Rui Abrantes;António M.

809313b857c089f3b2814eee49f21ea777d58f94	electronic participation		E-participation projects are complex socio-technical constructs integrating different concepts such as participation techniques, stakeholders, objectives, information artefacts, and technical facilities. To conceptualise comprehensive solutions of e-participation projects in a holistic way – i.e. comprehensively integrating the different concepts forming an e-participation project–, enterprise architecture frameworks are increasingly studied. Effective use of enterprise architecture frameworks demands a comprehensive conceptualisation of e-participation projects, which should embark on a common metamodel. In this paper, we study existing conceptual models structuring the e-participation domain and metamodels of enterprise architecture frameworks. From the insights of the comparative analysis, the e-participation metamodel is developed using design science research. The metamodel provides the conceptualisation and taxonomy for an e-participation reference framework to develop comprehensive architectures in e-participation projects. It is presented in a UML 2.0 diagram and involves six viewpoints: Participation Scope, Participant Viewpoint, Participation Viewpoint, Data & Information Viewpoint, E-participation Viewpoint, and Implementation & Governance Viewpoint.	diagram;enterprise architecture framework;holism;metamodeling;qualitative comparative analysis;sociotechnical system;unified modeling language;viewpoint	Efthimios Tambouris;Maria A.

This collaborative research programme aimed at implementing statistical methods, so as to improve business decisions focusing on capacity planning for information technology. The current paper presents the specification, and experimentation of a method dedicated to managing the need to integrate rigorously complex contextualisation factors, when developing statistical-based Decision Support Systems (DSS). The key challenge is to increase the end-user acceptance and success rate for DSS developments. To ensure the successful integration of DSS within the user environment, the paper formalises a so-called ‘Contextualisation process’, integrated within a larger decision-aid development framework. This Contextualisation process is specified with three methodological components, respectively ‘Qualitative Contextualisation’, ‘Statistical Modelling and Formalisation’ and ‘User Integration’. This approach is applied by STMicroelectronics, to a case study focusing on a project of change management for the infrastructure of the Information System. Based on the demonstration of the case study results, the added-value of the Contextualisation process are discussed and further perspectives for applied research in DSS are drawn.	change management (engineering);coefficient;data mining;data science;generic programming;high- and low-level;information system;relevance;semiconductor;software deployment;statistical model;switch statement;user interface;wafer (electronics);word lists by frequency	Michel Lutz;Xavier Boucher	2017	Journal of Decision Systems	10.1080/12460125.2016.1232533	decision support system;computer science;artificial intelligence;operations management;data mining;management science;information system	HCI	-59.062597673848344	12.746053790382527	75248

Emphasis is placed on the need for on-going research efforts in providing information for critical evaluation of design alternatives. The various system development stages are outlined, and results from a recent design exercise are illustrated. 1. I N T R O D U C Y I O N Roll forming is a high volume manufacturing process in which flat strip or sheet is progressively shaped, as it passes between a series of mating rotating rolls operating in tandem, into sections which are used, for example, as cladding and decking, as structural members, in the transportation industry, in appliances and for various other applications. Although this forming process has been put into practice decades ago, little research work has been conducted to understand its theoretical basis. Traditional design of roll former toolage not only calls for laborious drafting and hand calculations to ensure geometric accuracy, but also is extremely errorprone due to the tedious procedures involved and the lack of a scientific basis for examining possible design options. As a result, lengthy trials are often required with subsequent costly toolage modifications before full production can commence. With the advent of computing technology and computer-aided design techniques, development of CAD packages for roll forming based on some geometric considerations and primitive design rules has commenced since the early seventies [ 1-4]. However, while these CAD packages offer a dramatic labour/time saving in design costs, the designer's creativity and ingenuity could not be fully instigated without the provision of design aids, which utilize sound scientific principles instead of traditional 'rules of thumb,' for the evaluation of the relative merits of design alternatives. Only recently have improved design rules based on research and development (R&D) results been incorporated into CAD systems for roll forming design [5-8]. Realizing that a successful CAD/CAM system for roll forming would require both sound programming methodology and active research efforts, a programme was initiated at Lysaght's Research and Technology Centre (RTC) a few years ago to develop a CAD/CAM system for the design of roll former toolage, in which design aids based on the R&D studies carried out in parallel with the system development would be provided [9]. To date a CAD/CAM system known as 'CADROF' (an acronym for Computer-Aided Design for Roll Forming) has been completed with enhancements regularly implemented to incorporate our latest R&D findings. This paper discusses the planning and co-ordination of the various system development stages and their interactions with the R&D programme. Results from a recent design exercise are given as an illustration.	cladding (fiber optics);computer-aided design;interaction;software development process	W. Y. D.

e83cc5195cff5b358fa8ae6a3fcc938acc9aefd0	business process modeling languages: a comparative framework		Underlying any Business Process Management (BPM) project is the need to represent business processes, using an appropriate language. In this paper, based on a thorough review of the relevant literature, we made a comparative analysis of five business process modeling languages, widely used in the context of BPM projects. The main objective is to understand the strengths and major limitations of each one, in order to draw a comparative perspective between them. For this purpose, we have created a comparative framework in which each one of the languages are characterized regarding a number of relevant criteria. Finally, a prototype specifically developed to support this framework, is presented. The purpose of this prototype is to assist users in choosing a suitable business process modeling language, according to their specific needs.	beam propagation method;business process modeling language;electronic product code;idef;prototype;qualitative comparative analysis;rapid application development;requirement;unified modeling language;webplatform	José Luís Pereira;Diogo Silva	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-31232-3_58	natural language processing;systems engineering;artifact-centric business process model;process modeling;business process model and notation;process management;modeling language;business process discovery;business rule;business process modeling;business architecture	SE	-60.01629607480649	17.429199486452536	75535

Compliance is achieved through defining and implementing so-called controls in the organizations' business processes. Organizations that build their systems based on the process-driven SOA paradigm realize business processes through orchestration of services to handle the different process activities. We propose an approach for monitoring compliance in SOA systems — we represent a service invocation as an event, enabling us to map business process activities into trails of events that make up compliant processes. The event trails guide the creation of rules, which are leveraged by complex event processing techniques to monitor processes for compliance. A case study from the telecommunications sector demonstrates how we achieve compliance detection.

One of the main characteristics of manufacturing systems domain is, in fact, the variety of configurations that manufacturing systems can assume and this may prevent the possibility to easily adapt and reconfigure the control solution for advanced manufacturing systems. To this end, the paper presents a proposal on how to cope with this issue, coming from a collaborative project, where important European universities and companies are involved. The proposal is based on a structured modeling (i.e. ontology) of manufacturing systems. The paper proposes a practical example of the modeling, envisioning how this can be then exploited within the proposed architecture that defines a new concept of the Manufacturing Execution System of manufacturing equipment.	logistics;manufacturing execution system	Luca Fumagalli;Simone Pala;Marco Garetti;Elisa Negri	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-44739-0_24	manufacturing execution system;integrated computer-aided manufacturing;process development execution system;systems engineering;engineering;operations management;computer-integrated manufacturing;idef0;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	-55.54761186617203	11.774903616296799	75708

Various situations such as loss of phone, passing on to family members or friends require us to consider continuous modes of passive authentication. This paper explores how typing heat maps can improve user authentication for touch enabled devices. By revisiting the traditional typing digraph intervals, normally associated with typing biometric user authentication, this research investigates the strength of various features for user identification on smartphones. Considering the different methods of typing on a portable small device as opposed to the mechanical keyboard or pressure sensitive tablets, this research takes the touch screen data to present a new set of features which can be used as a passive mode of continuous authentication. Given the continuous use of the device by the owner, a multilayer perceptron neural network is believed to be a plausible and viable approach for this task, which is also understudied for smartphones. The findings in this research highlight the strength of various touch related features in typing signatures.	antivirus software;artificial neural network;authentication;biometrics;directed graph;heat map;keyboard technology;multilayer perceptron;sensor;smartphone;touchscreen;type signature	Frankie Inguanez;S Farzad Ahmadi	2016	2016 IEEE 6th International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Berlin (ICCE-Berlin)	10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2016.7684753	embedded system;engineering;internet privacy;computer security	HCI	-51.20334457797672	6.541271467628001	75896

Design of such SoCs relies on multi-team, multi-site cooperation and data exchange. The data exchange, made possible though descriptions based on The SPIRIT Consortium's IP-XACT#8482; specification and the automation for its processing, forms the basis of the approach. Initially, the specification focused at IP reuse; this has now been extended to SoC subsystem exchange. This paper also describes state-of-the-art subsystem design automation and improvement opportunities, based on a close collaboration between NXP Semiconductors and Mentor Graphics.

There is a growing need to develop methods that can increase adaptability and flexibility in dynamic and collaborative job-shop assembly floors. Based on our previous work on an assembly planning framework using Function Blocks (FBs), a novel approach to assembly planning and control is developed, which enables adaptive decision making besides effective plan execution.

Typical problems include legacy re-engineering, systems integration/interoperability, and the architecting of the enterprise. At the heart of all these problems is enterprise modeling. Many enterprise modeling approaches have been proposed in the literature with some based on ontology. Few however adopt a foundational ontology to underpin a range of enterprise models in a consistent and coherent manner. Fewer still take data-driven re-engineering as their natural starting point for modeling. This is the approach taken by Business Object Reference Ontology (BORO). It has two closely intertwined components: a foundational ontology and a re-engineering methodology. These were originally developed for the re-engineering of enterprise systems and subsequently evolved into approaches to enterprise architecture and systems integration. Together these components are used to system...		Sergio de Cesare;Christopher Partridge	2016	J.

Their definitions are still in flux and it is necessary to define their connections. Thus, firstly, we will introduce more closely some definitions where we will show that, if the Virtual manufacturing concepts originate from machining operations and evolve in this manufacturing area, lots of applications exist in different fields such as casting, forging, sheet metalworking and robotics (mechanisms). From the recent projects in Europe or in USA, we notice that the human perception or the simulation of mannequin is more and more needed in both fields. In this context, we have isolated some applications as ergonomic studies, assembly and maintenance simulation, design or training where the virtual reality tools can be applied. Thus, we find out a family of applications where the virtual reality tools give the engineers the main role in the optimization process. We will illustrate our paper by several examples where virtual reality interfaces are used and combined with optimization tools such as multi-agent systems.	human factors and ergonomics;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;robotics;simulation;virtual reality	Fouad Bennis;Damien Chablat;Philippe Dépincé	2005	CoRR		simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;product lifecycle;instructional simulation;virtual reality;perception;manufacturing engineering	Visualization	-57.62076281568695	9.078530073477108	76673

The model, called Process-oriented Event Model (PoEM), provides a formal approach to model real-world entities and their interrelationships, and specifies the process of moving from data streams to event detection to event-based goal planning. The model links event detection to states, actions, and roles, enabling event notification, filtering, context awareness and escalation. PoEM defines event and non-event concepts and combines information from them to build an event processing workflow. Usage of the PoEM model is illustrated in case studies from the oil and gas industry and maritime piracy events.	application domain;complex event processing;content-control software;context awareness;entity;event (computing);privilege escalation	Om Prasad Patri;Vikrambhai S.

Although many approaches exist in favour of software engineering and knowledge engineering, building an XBRL taxonomy is not about creating a software product or a knowledge-based system. It is creating a standardised taxonomy for a particular domain in order to enable standardised exchange of business reports. Nevertheless experiences learned from software and knowledge engineering areas are very useful for what can be called XBRL taxonomy engineering. On the other hand a clear parallel with the ontology engineering appears treating XBRL taxonomies as ontologies. The ontology development process could resemble in many aspects the way that XBRL taxonomies are created. The development process models presented in the literature are either project or software driven. Hence it is difficult to apply them as a generic and formal taxonomy development process model. This paper presents an approach to define a taxonomy development process model. The definition of the model is preceded with the status quo analysis of the existing development models known from software engineering and ontology engineering domains. The model definition itself is also based on empirical analysis of taxonomy development projects.	computer security;experience;knowledge engineering;knowledge-based systems;ontology (information science);ontology engineering;process modeling;software engineering;taxonomy (general)	Maciej Piechocki;Carsten Felden	2007			knowledge management;data mining	SE	-62.05229594851643	16.4476425102933	76871

This methodology is a part of the WebMachining system, which is based on the Electronic-Manufacturing concept. The WebMachining virtual company encompasses three distributed manufacturing systems, all of them located in different cities in Brazil, i.e. Flexible Manufacturing Cell (FMC) at Graco/UnB (Brasilia), FMS at SOCIESC (Joinville), and Lathe at UFSC (Florianopolis). The proposed methodology includes planning, scheduling, control, and remote manufacturing of parts. The user (customer) uses the manufacturing services based on the SOA (Service Oriented Application) provided by the WebMachining virtual company through the Internet, in order to execute operations and processes to design and manufacture the parts. The proposed methodology integrates engineering and manufacturing management through an ERP software that will preview which of the three systems will produce the ordered part, and this decision is based on parameters related to each of the three systems. After the decision, the ERP system will generate the production schedule. Also in this work the implementation aspects of a Web-based shop floor controller for the FMC at Graco/UnB are presented. The FMC consists of a Romi Galaxy 15M turning center, an ASEA IRB6 robot manipulator, a Mitutoyo LSM-6100 laser micrometer, an AGV, and a pallet to store the blank and finished parts. The functional model, which depicts the modules and their relationships in the Web-based shop floor controller, serves as a basic model to implement the real system. After that, the proposed implementation architecture based on the object oriented technology is presented.	automated planning and scheduling;cell (microprocessor);distributed manufacturing;erp;enterprise resource planning;flight management system;function model;internet;scheduling (computing);service-oriented architecture;web application;world wide web	Alberto J.

Towards this end, a flexible knowledge management system for systematic development, deployment and management of multiple product families is critical. In this paper we propose a methodology to (1) capture and reorganize component design information as a graph called network bill of material (NBOM) to facilitate design information management for a family of products and (2) represent and store design information using ontologies that promote sharing and reuse of components for platform-based product realization. In the proposed methodology, the components and products of the product family are represented as a complete lattice structure using formal concept analysis (FCA). The NBOM and component designs are represented using Web ontology language (OWL). An example of one-time-use cameras is presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology.	aggregate data;browsing;crystal structure;data structure;formal concept analysis;gadget (computer science);information management;information system;knowledge management;knowledge representation and reasoning;ontology (information science);software deployment;software system;web ontology language	Jyotirmaya Nanda;Henri J.

Herein, new concepts of a knowledge mesh (KM) and an agent mesh (AM) are proposed along with a new KM-based approach to complicated-knowledge representation. KM is the representation of such complicated macroknowledge as an advanced manufacturing mode, focusing on knowledge about the structure, functions, and information flows of an advanced manufacturing system. The multiple set, KM, and the mapping relationships between both, are then formally defined. The union, intersection, and minus operations on the multiple sets are proposed, and their properties proved. Then, the perfectness of a KM, the redundancy set between the two KMs, and the multiple redundancy set on the redundancy set are defined. Three examples are provided to illustrate the concepts of the KM, multiple set, multiple redundancy set, and logical operations. On the basis of the above, the KM-based inference engine is presented. In logical operations on KMs, each KM is taken as an operand. A new KM obtained by operations on KM multiple sets can be mapped into an AM for automatic reconfiguration of complex software systems. Finally, the combination of two real management modes is exemplified for the effective application of the new KM-based method to the self-reconfiguration of complex systems. It is worth mentioning that KM multiple sets can also be taken as a new formal representation of software systems if their corresponding AMs are the real software systems.	artificial neural network;complex systems;component-based software engineering;description logic;download;inference engine;intelligent agent;knowledge management;knowledge representation and reasoning;logical connective;one-to-many (data model);one-to-one (data model);operand;preprocessor;semantic network;set theory;software system;xojo	Hong-Sen Yan	2006	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2006.2	kolmogorov structure function;software architecture;knowledge base;information flow;index term;formal verification;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;knowledge engineering;data mining;formal specification;database;mathematics;algorithm;software system	Robotics	-56.93251355738805	11.739717375626993	77382

This model has been implemented in Java language in order to allow for the development of a Web-based decision support system that can perform the coordination strategies, simulated in this article in a real logistics chain. This article, after introducing the main concepts related to the adoption of coordination mechanisms within a supply chain, the main issues of agent-oriented technology, and a brief review of the related literature, presents the structure of the proposed model and the static and dynamic behaviors of the decision-making agents. The design issues of specific coordination models, the negotiation mechanisms introduced, and their proper tuning are then discussed.

Some researchers contend that the integration of construction knowledge and experience at the early design phase would improve the overall project performance. Domination of tacit knowledge during design phase of building projects is the major source of knowledge flow problems between involved professionals. Therefore, this study intends to explicate the required mechanical and electrical knowledge which has to be considered during the conceptual design phase of a green building project. To fulfil this goal, a case study has been conducted to specify the entity of the required mechanical and electrical knowledge. The primary method for the data collection here is observation. Furthermore, this study employs the triangulation method in order to validate the collected data. The results contain the required mechanical and electrical knowledge which has to be considered during the conceptual design phase of a green building project.

Case-based reasoning implementations as currently constructed tend to fall into three categories, characterized by implementation constraints: task-based(task constraints alone), enterprise(integrating databases), and web-based(integrating web representations). These implementation types represent the possible targets in constructing corporate memory systems, and it is important to understand the strengths of each, how they are built, and how one may be constructed by transforming another. This paper describes a framework that relates the three types of CBR implementation, discusses their typical strengths and weaknesses, and describes practical strategies for building corporate CBR memories to meet new requirements by transforming and synthesizing existing resources.	case-based reasoning;categorization;database;library (computing);memory management;requirement;web application;xml	Arijit Sengupta;David C.

Today, barcode continues to be the main identification technology for precast construction applications. In this research, we investigate the data-driven mechanisms and benefits of utilizing RFID in knowledge-based precast construction supply chains. With computer-aided self-learning capability, we simulate three models for manual-, barcode-, and RFID-enabled precast construction supply chain. The results of 100 precast wall-panel construction in a two-echelon precast construction supply chain reveal that the knowledge-based RFID system could generate 62.0% saving of operational costs, which is 29.0% higher than that of a barcode-based system. As a result, the computer-aided adaptive learning mechanism based on RFID is verifiable to improve the overall operational performance by reducing lead time, operational errors, and costs. Due to the lack of existing literature of data technology utilization in the precast construction industry, our findings in this research could improve the decision making regarding technology selection, as well as help with the operationalization of RFID and transformation to intelligent precast construction management in big data environment.

The analysis of such logs can provide meaningful knowledge for organizations to improve the quality of their services as well as their efficiency. The prediction of activity durations, based on historic data from execution logs, allows the creation of feasible plans for business processes. However, a problem arises when there are discrepancies between execution logs and the actual execution. When event logs are partially human-generated there is an underlying uncertainty related to the time at which events (recorded by means of user interaction) are logged. If not taken into account, this uncertainty can lead to wrong predictions of activity durations. In this paper, we focus on creating assumptions to estimate activity durations and analyse their impact in the stochastic characterization. A partially human-generated logistics database is used as example.		Rodrigo M. T. Gonçalves;Rui Jorge Almeida;João Miguel da Costa Sousa;Remco M.

The primary drivers are efficiency and quality increase through automation, facilitation of better business processes and improved decision making. Many problems and issues relating to the design, development, integration, evolution and maintenance of ISs in large-scale and complex plants have become apparent which are not adequately addressed by the traditional Process Monitoring and Control (PM&C) systems. Model-Integrated Computing (MIC) offers a feasible approach towards providing cost-effective development, integration, evolution and maintenance of ISs through the extensive use of plant models. This paper describes an application of MIC in providing a problem-solving environment and decision support tool in the context of discrete manufacturing operations at Saturn. The Saturn Site Production Flow (SSPF) system is a client-server application, designed to provide consistent and pertinent information, analysis and decision support services that are needed for informed decision making.	discrete manufacturing;information system;throughput	Amit Misra;Gabor Karsai;Janos Sztipanovits;Ákos Lédeczi;Michael Moore;Earl Long	1997		10.1109/ECBS.1997.581859	embedded system;systems analysis;simulation;systems modeling;cost-effectiveness analysis;decision support system;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;operating system;business process;data analysis;management;information system;client–server model	Robotics	-62.23193638221367	10.433130007041754	78993

This is expensive for both customers and device suppliers. To overcome this situation, device functionalities needs to be adapted or extended on demand according to the changing market requirements, even if the devices have already been delivered to customers. In this work, an app-based approach is proposed and evaluated to serve that purpose. This approach is adapted from the smart device industry and it is used to provide software-based functionalities for field devices as an enabling technology in the context of reconfigurable manufacturing systems. This paper describes the essential elements of such an approach with a practical perspective.	algorithm;real-time transcription;reconfigurability;reconfigurable computing;requirement;smart device;software distribution	Syed Shiraz Gilani;Tim Tack;Holger Flatt;Jürgen Jasperneite	2014	Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Emerging Technology and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2014.7005091	embedded system;computer science;engineering;automation;control theory;manufacturing engineering;computer engineering;actuator	EDA	-55.35554798288714	10.451538984746001	79306

Some reasons are the ever more complex and dynamic business environment as well as the organic nature of business processes. Taking a risk perspective on the business process management (BPM) lifecycle has thus been recognized as an essential research stream. Despite profound knowledge on risk-aware BPM with a focus on process design, existing approaches for realtime risk monitoring treat instances as isolated when detecting risks. They do not propagate risk information to other instances in order to support early risk detection. To address this gap, we propose an approach for predictive risk monitoring (PRISM). This approach automatically propagates risk information, which has been detected via risk sensors, across similar running instances of the same process in real-time. We demonstrate PRISM’s capability of predictive risk monitoring by applying it in the context of a real-world scenario.	algorithm;beam propagation method;belief propagation;business process;information system;prism (surveillance program);real-time clock;robustness testing;sensor;similarity measure;snapshot (computer storage);software propagation;systems engineering	Raffaele Conforti;Sven Fink;Jonas Manderscheid;Maximilian Röglinger	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-45348-4_22	computer science;knowledge management;operations management;management science	ML	-54.89041493868806	17.612113711343245	81659

bc6b8215d4b1fbbeca1b4d0cbda0e09565d78bf5	a modular design method for scenario embedded product		A product with a long-life, such as a plant or ship, must be adaptable to future technology changes, regulations, and environmental changes. This paper proposes a design method for a future scenario embedded product to enhance a product’s adaptability to various changes during its lifetime. The design method derives a modular structure between platform modules as constant sub-system and option modules as replacement sub-system. The modular structure is calculated based on a future scenario model represented by a network between events and versions, and a product represented model between components and interfaces. A prototype system is developed and a laptop computer is designed as an example. The design results indicate that the sequence of the scenario’s events and branches is important for the scenario-embedded modular structure.	embedded system;futures studies;laptop;modular design;prototype	Tsuyoshi Koga;Hideshi Aoki;Kazuhiro Aoyama	2010		10.1007/978-0-85729-024-3_20	systems engineering	Embedded	-55.03243753818232	10.764319938069628	81816

Managing product-related information grows ever more difficult because increasing product customisation adds to the amount and variety of product-related information, and increasingly complex supply networks complicate the integration of product information databases. A potential solution for the problems of item-level information management is moving to product centric information management, namely centralising the information to individual products and accessing the relevant information directly through them. This paper presents an approach and a system for managing item-level information. The system is based on software agents, peer-to-peer information sharing, and a coding scheme that utilises the already allocated domain names of the Internet. Applications of the system to tracking and logistics control are reviewed.	database;information management;information system;internet;logistics;peer-to-peer;personalization;software agent	Mikko Kärkkäinen;Timo Ala-Risku;Kary Främling	2002			executive information system;information technology management;knowledge management;management information systems;database;business;structure of management information;information management;automated information system;world wide web;information architecture;information system	DB	-48.633082588620915	9.289229172629202	82275

In the proposed system, the user is asked to draw her PIN on the touch screen instead of typing it on a keypad. Consequently, DRAW-A-PIN could offer better security by utilizing drawing traits or behavioral biometrics as an additional authentication factor beyond just the secrecy of the PIN. In addition, DRAW-A-PIN inherently provides acceptability and usability by leveraging user familiarity with PINs. To evaluate the security and usability of the approach, DRAW-A-PIN was implemented on Android phones and 3203 legitimate finger-drawn PINs and 4655 forgery samples were collected through an extensive and unsupervised field experiment over 10 consecutive days. Experimental results show that DRAW-A-PIN achieves an equal error rate of 4.84% in a scenario where the attacker already knows the PIN by shoulder surfing. Finally, results from a user study based on the System Usability Scale questionnaire confirm that DRAW-A-PIN is highly usable. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

092bf5050c27805bf2704613fbefed5627e51071	a content-incentive-usability framework for corporate portal design		The knowledge based theory of the firm argues that firms obtain competitive advantage by creating, storing and applying knowledge (Jayatilaka, Schwarz, & Hirschheim, 2003). According to Grant and Baden-Fuller (1995), a firm’s ability to leverage knowledge held by members in the organization is dependent on first, the ability of the firm to create an infrastructure to access this knowledge, transfer it and make it available to others. A second determinant is the extent to which the knowledge that is captured matches with the product domain of the firm. Enterprise Information Portals have emerged as gateways to streamline information access in firms (Kim, Chaudhury, & Rao, 2002). The first service they provide is access to transactions with the various information sources scattered across the enterprise, such as structured databases, e-mail servers and document repositories. A second service is access to data and knowledge from both internal and external information sources, such as the World Wide Web (WWW). Finally, these portals allow users to interact with other users to perform activities that require team collaborations. The discussion above indicates that a knowledge portal (KP) is a significant component of an enterprise information portal, and can contribute to a firm’s competitive advantage. In this work, we present a multidimensional framework we term the content-incentive-usability (CIU) framework for KPs to analyze the challenges in building and utilizing KPs. the cIu frAmeWorK		Akhilesh Bajaj	2007			competitive advantage;knowledge management;usability;knowledge-based theory of the firm;information access;data access;unstructured data;computer science;enterprise portal;server	Web+IR	-48.79000642629196	8.394247924143691	82763

Neverless, both of the domains have still problems to resolve: Knowledge Management has to handle the problems of human resistance to capitalize knowledge. Workflow Management has to deal with changes in the process model and in process instances. Especially, in a knowledge intensive dynamic process environment, it is primordial to understand and to satisfy these two requirements to guarantee the user acceptance. In this article, we characterize and present PIFA – an analyze method to capture the requirements of both domains. We will also illustrate how PIFA can help to design a knowledge management system based on the analysis results to support workflow and information management. Our PIFA-approach is especially applicable on knowledge intensive dynamic processes. Therefore, the process level helps capturing requirements for the process flow, the information level helps capturing the information flow to improve the information sharing within a process and between processes and the functionality level guarantees that the involved actor have an immediate surplus value and will accept the changes caused to the defined process flow and the higher information capitalization. Therefore, PIFA combines the process' actions with the knowledge capitalization and the surplus value.	information flow (information theory);information management;inverted-f antenna;knowledge management;management system;process modeling;requirement	Hendrik Busch;Mickael Gardoni;Michel Tollenaere	2006			computer science;knowledge management;management science;knowledge value chain	AI	-61.47283792285305	13.195998951844297	83125

Product knowledge is the combination of product specific information, such as functionality, colour and product variants, and the corresponding product model. The model provides understanding of the product structure, rules, constraints and assembly-specific information in relation to the product model. In the design and modeling of assembly processes, features form the foundation for analysis and knowledge acquisition of the product. This knowledge includes geometric and non-geometric information. In the present paper, an approach is proposed to share platform independent product-process knowledge between the assembly process and system design and even with the simulation environment.	constraint (mathematics);information;knowledge acquisition;process ontology;simulation;systems design	Minna Lanz;F.

49d8c6729b5a98f70f86192e0112cfd5b50bf815	hierarchical frequent sequence mining algorithm for the analysis of alarm cascades in chemical processes		Faults and malfunctions on complex chemical production systems generate alarm cascades that hinder the work of the operators and make fault diagnosis a complex and challenging task. The core concept of our work is the incorporation of the hierarchical structure of the technology in a multi-temporal sequence mining algorithm to group the large number of variables. The spreading of the effect of malfunctions over the plant is thoroughly traceable on the higher levels of the hierarchy, while the critical elements of the spillover effect can be detected on the lower levels. Confidence-based goal-oriented measures have been proposed to describe the orientation of fault propagation providing a good insight into the causality on a local level of the process, while the network-based representation yields a global view of causal connections. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is presented in terms of the analysis of the alarm and event-log database of an industrial delayed-coker plant, where the complexity of the problem and the size of the event-log database requires a hierarchical constraint-based representation.	algorithm;causality;doppler effect;knowledge spillover;sequential pattern mining;software propagation;traceability	Gyula Dorgo;Kristof Varga;János Abonyi	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2868415	operator (computer programming);alarm;spillover effect;hierarchy;alarm management;causality;algorithm;computer science;fault detection and isolation;chemical process	DB	-56.091375392646924	11.866918928776412	84722

This paper focuses on ergonomics field studies of air traffic control activities, and more specifically on the analyses of communication within teams of controllers. We show how operators use spontaneously the natural redundancy and diversity of human communication (multimodality, addressing features,...), so as to successfully maintain mutual awareness. This is the key for reliable cooperation, for the sake of global system dependability that rests on mechanisms such as error detection, recovery, and prevention (by anticipation and regulation). This study helps in providing specifications for the design of systems efficiently supporting both human cooperation and human ability to contribute to dependability. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this paper, we discuss how the vehicle manufacturers need to adjust their methods and tools to handle the increasing complexity. The key issue is the system integration aspect, which calls for increasing systems engineering capabilities. 1. Automotive electronics The automotive industry is currently going through a dramatic increase of electronic equipment for on-board vehicle control. Until quite recently, the electrical system in a vehicle was mostly concerned with lights, starter motors, windshield wipers, and the like. In modern cars, tens of electronic control units (ECUs) implement sophisticated real-time control functionality. The ECUs are placed as closely as possible to the parts they control, and are connected to each other via distribution networks. To handle the added complexity, the industry must find new development methods, and in particular the requirements capturing and system analysis must be adapted. The role of the automotive manufacturer is increasingly becoming that of a system integrator working closely with suppliers that take a large responsibility for the subsystems. This change in focus leads to a need for new ways of organizing the development work, and new ways of exchanging information about the product. The key capability is that of systems engineering, which ensures that a holistic perspective of the product is preserved, thereby guaranteeing those requirements that are of greatest importance to the users. Also, the whole life cycle of the product is taken into account, including production and after market requirements and processes. The electronic system in a vehicle is closely connected to the vehicle itself, and the requirements on the complete vehicle are reflected in the electronic architecture. The mission of the vehicle is to transport passengers and goods efficiently. This means that factors such as cost, safety, weight, availability, environmental impact, comfort, and information handling are of key importance. The electronic architecture plays an important role in fulfilling all these requirements, through e.g. ABS brakes, engine management, climate control, and instrumentation. There is a trend to replace or enhance traditional mechanical solutions with electronics. This includes safety systems, such as stability control, but also fundamental vehicle functionality such as brakes and steering, where electronics can provide increased functionality and at the same time reduce cost and weight. However, new electronic systems, such as fault-tolerant buses, are likely to be needed to reach sufficient safety levels for these crucial functions. Another area where large changes are anticipated is in information to the driver and passengers. This includes both navigation systems, Internet access, fleet management for trucks and buses, entertainment for the passengers, etc., and will affect the technology used in the electronic systems since current networks have insufficient bandwidth. Most likely, fibre optical solutions will be required to reach speeds in the Mbit range. This kind of equipment also puts different requirements on the flexibility, since the owner might wish to upgrade the vehicle by putting in e.g. new audio or video equipment after the vehicle is delivered. 2. System integration In the automotive industry, there is little doubt that the electronics growth will continue, and to remain competitive it is crucial to master the new technology. At the same time, the cost pressure does not allow the vehicle manufacturers to develop their own solutions to all functionality. There is a long tradition in the industry to work with suppliers, and a number of suppliers exist that deliver similar systems to all vehicle manufacturers. The role of the vehicle manufacturer is then to specify the subsystems to be purchased, and integrate them in the vehicle. So far, the suppliers have mostly developed isolated subsystems, e.g. consisting of an ECU, its software, and possibly mechanical parts, too. However, in the future it is expected that the number of ECUs will not grow drastically, simply because it becomes too expensive and heavy to have separate hardware for each functionality, and the available Methods and Tools for Systems Engineering of Automotive Electronic Architectures Jakob Axelsson Volvo Technological Development Corp. SE-412 88 Göteborg, SWEDEN E-mail: jakob.axelsson@vtd.volvo.se space in the vehicle is also limited. Therefore, ways must be found to integrate software modules that participate in the implementation of different functionality in the same ECU. The software modules may be delivered by different suppliers, and the integration must ensure the integrity and performance of all the functions despite the sharing of hardware resources. This is a particular challenge when it comes to safety-critical functionality, and the requirements on the software modules are thus not limited to their functional interface, but touches their overall behaviour. In a sense, the automotive software modules are a kind of intellectual property (IP), similar to the behavioural IP modules that are used for designing systems on chip, and that can be traded between different system integrators. The differences lay mainly in the distributed nature of the automotive systems, and in their close integration with the vehicle itself. To handle development which relies heavily on the use of IP, it is necessary to have a generic software architecture similar to the one in Figure 1 which determines how the IPs are interfacing to each other, and how resources are shared between them. The functional layer is likely to be specified by the vehicle manufacturer, since it defines the functionality of the vehicle. This specification is partitioned into software modules that are allocated to different ECUs. The software is developed by the suppliers, and the ECU hardware by, possibly, other suppliers. The vehicle manufacturer integrates the software modules, and to facilitate the integration, a standardized support layer is used, which hides the details of the hardware from the software modules, and defines interfaces for inter-module communication. The communication works equally well internally in an ECU and externally, over the network, and it is the role of the vehicle manufacturer to maintain the signal information. The hardware layer is mostly built from standard components. 3. Systems engineering methods & tools To turn into efficient system integrators, it is clear that the vehicle manufacturers must become better at specifying the functionality of the system, and at making trade-offs in order to find the best system architecture to suit the needs expressed in the requirements. This challenge is met by improving the systems engineering (SE) capability, since SE addresses exactly these issues. It also improves the perspective of the system life-cycle, and covers many aspects of the system simultaneously, since the electronics are so tightly integrated with the rest of the vehicle. SE is very much an organizational issue, since it relies on the discipline and maturity of the engineers performing the work. However, once the organization is ready, tools may be introduced to support different activities. One of the crucial issues is to handle all the information related to the system, and in order to maintain a holistic view of the product and its supporting processes, a common repository in the form of a product data management system is necessary, to which different tools can be interfaced in order to assist the developers. Figure 2 shows the overall organization of the systems engineering tools. It is our belief that the only realistic candidate for such a common information repository is object-oriented models, since they are based on natural concepts that are present in both hardware and software, as well as in other domains. Standards like UML are a reasonable basis, but new ways of using them must be found in order to cover the needs of systems engineering rather than software engineering, for which the notion was originally developed. This includes in particular quantitative analysis of e.g. the continuous behaviour of physical components, or the system cost. Among the tools that are needed in the system-level activities are: • Simulation to get an early functional validation. • Analysis to estimate cost, resource utilization, response times, fault-tolerance, etc. • Synthesis to automatically perform certain design activities, e.g. software code generation. • Requirements handling to ensure that the requirements are consistent and that solutions are traceable. • Configuration management to make sure that the repository remains consistent and up to date. In the future, one can also imagine the inclusion of more advanced synthesis tools, that perform automatic partitioning or even automatic derivation of the overall system architecture. Since these are mainly optimization problems, good analysis models is the enabling factor to automation. Figure 1. A layered view on the implementation of an automotive function.

Within such STS, interactive systems are omnipresent allowing operators to interact with the underlying system. Such interactive systems must be both usable (i.e. enabling users to perform their tasks efficiently and effectively while ensuring a certain level of operator satisfaction) and resilient to adverse events including software malfunctions (e.g. automation degradation) as well as interaction related problems (e.g. human errors or interactive system failures). Current techniques, methods and tools do not allow to model STSs as a whole and thus to analyze both usability and resilience properties. This paper proposes a multi-models based approach for the modelling and the analysis of partly-autonomous interactive systems for assessing their resilience and usability. The approach integrates 3 modelling techniques: Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) (focused on organizational functions), Human-centered Assessment and Modelling to Support Task Engineering for Resilient Systems (HAMSTERS) (centered on human goals and activities) and Interactive Cooperative Objects (ICO) (dedicated to the modelling of interactive systems). The principles of the multi-models approach is illustrated on an example for carefully showing the extensions proposed to the selected modelling techniques and how they integrate together. A case study dealing with aircraft route change due to bad weather conditions demonstrates the scalability and benefits of the approach.	atm turbo;autonomous robot;concept map;elegant degradation;glass cockpit;interaction;interactivity;multi-model database;resonance;scalability;sociotechnical system;usability;visual artifact;workstation	Martina Ragosta;Célia Martinie;Philippe A.

Unfortunately, PLM systems dedicated to support design activities are not efficient as it might be expected. DPs are changing, emergent and non deterministic whereas PLM systems based on workflow technology don’t support process flexibility. So, needs in terms of flexibility are necessary to facilitate the coupling with the environment reality. Furthermore, service oriented approaches (SOA) ensure a certain flexibility and adaptability of composed solutions. Systems based on SOA have the ability to inherently being evolvable. This paper proposes an SOA based approach to deal with DP flexibility in PLM systems. To achieve this flexibility, the proposed approach contains three stages. In this paper we focus on the first stage “identification”.	application posture;business requirements;deterministic algorithm;emergence;ibm basic programming support;poor posture;service-oriented architecture;triune continuum paradigm	Safa Hachani;Lilia Gzara;Hervé Verjus	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19170-1_7	design process;systems engineering;engineering;business process;manufacturing engineering	EDA	-54.582825277645306	12.59540284565825	86845

Existing approaches lack intelligence and individuation when providing a knowledge retrieval service via rules and cases. In this paper, we propose a framework of an active knowledge service based on collaborative intent capture to assist product conceptual design. First, a collaborative intent capture model is constructed through the study of the expression and capture of collaborative intent; second, a framework and a process of active knowledge push based on collaborative intent capture are designed after analyzing the method of knowledge resources acquisition based on the constraint satisfaction theory. Finally, match algorithms for text content are studied. Based on the above research achievements, a prototype system of a collaborative design and active knowledge service platform (C-AKSP) has been developed for providing a knowledge service and assisting product conceptual design. An example, the conceptual design of a machine tool spindle system, is used to validate the proposed theories for the model, the framework and the algorithm. As a result, C-AKSP can provide a superior knowledge service that meets the designer's knowledge needs.		Yuanhao Xu;Guofu Yin;Yong Nie;Zhengwei He;Xiaolin Dai	2013	J.

Students are involved with computers throughout the program to familiarize them with CAD software and applications such as detailing, GD & T, general tolerancing, wire frame, surfacing, solid modeling with parametric technology and Rapid Prototyping. Computer-aided engineering software for mold design and mechanical applications are also used. Student solid models are processed and created on our Rapid Prototyping equipment. Tool design is critical to the manufacturing industry. Tooling is the foundation for product design and the manufacturing industry. Students learn to design and detail basic tooling requirements for the manufacture of products. Consideration for safety of the design and manufacturing processes are also emphasized. Students also gain an understanding of the related areas of mathematics, materials and machining. Converting an abstract idea into a working design is the job of the drafter and tool designer. The drafter/designer may be involved in drawing one of many parts of a complete assembly, then designing the tooling-jigs, fixtures, gauges, dies, injection molds and special machines-to produce one or all of those parts. For the drafter/tool designer, creativity and attention to detail are essential in production of such diverse products as automotive and aircraft components, consumer products, medical products, electronics, food processing and special machinery. Graduates of the program find immediate employment as computer-aided tool detailers, product drafters, entry-level tool designers, CAD operators and other technical-related positions. Many students choose to continue into B.

Existing systems that support 3D virtual environments focus typically on specific tasks and have a supporting structure, which is closely tight to the application. As a consequence, a change in the application usually means a change in the supporting structure too, making it difficult and expensive to develop new or to extend/change existing VE applications. Thus, solutions that can decrease the development time of 3D virtual environments are most welcome. This paper introduces a novel approach for building and extending virtual environments. An XML-based mark up language, VEML, is presented, which describes simulations through the concept of atomic simulation. VEML can be used to create and/or to extend highly dynamic 3D virtual environments, such as marketing campaigns for virtual shopping mall, customized training environments, etc.	computer simulation;e-commerce;online shopping;virtual reality;web application;xml	Azzedine Boukerche;Diego Daniel Duarte;Regina Borges de Araujo	2004	Eighth IEEE International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real-Time Applications	10.1109/DS-RT.2004.40	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;instructional simulation;multimedia	Visualization	-51.40856199553115	10.401979081421707	87364

(decentralized monitoring of cross-organizational service choreographies)		Cross-organizational service-based processes are increasingly adopted by different companies when they can not achieve goals on their own. The dynamic nature of these processes poses various challenges to their successful execution. In order to guarantee that all involved partners are informed about errors that may happen in the collaboration, it is necessary to monitor the execution process by continuously observing and checking message exchanges during runtime. This allows a global process tracking and evaluation of process metrics. Complex event processing can address this concern by analyzing and evaluating message exchange events, to the aim of checking if the actual behavior of the interacting entities effectively adheres to the modeled business constraints. In this thesis, we present an approach for decentralized monitoring of cross-organizational choreographies. We define a hierarchical propagation model for exchanging external notifications between the collaborating parties. We also propose a runtime event-based approach to deal with the problem of monitoring conformance of interaction sequences. Our approach allows for an automatic and optimized generation of rules. After parsing the choreography graph into a hierarchy of canonical blocks, tagging each event by its block ascendancy, an optimized set of monitoring queries is generated. We evaluate the concepts based on a scenario showing how much the number of queries can be significantly reduced.	ascendancy;complex event processing;conformance testing;entity;interaction;parsing;software propagation;tag (metadata)	Aymen Baouab	2013				AI	-52.711163798530166	17.0587344885502	88109

A hybrid simulation-based production planning architecture consisting of system dynamics (SD) components at the higher decision level and discrete event simulation (DES) components at the lower decision level is presented. The need for the two types of simulation has been justified. The architecture consists of four modules: Enterprise-level decision maker, SD model of enterprise, Shop-level decision maker and DES model of shop. The decision makers select the optimal set of control parameters based on the estimated behavior of the system. These control parameters are used by the SD and DES models to determine the best plan based on the actual behavior of the system. High Level Architecture has been employed to interface SD and DES simulation models.

In the past, the simulation modeler was given a facility layout drawn with a CAD system. Using this layout as a reference, the modeler built a simulation model and created a partial or complete animation layout. This was very time consuming, redundant, and sometimes technically impossible. Recent advances in hardware, operating systems, and simulation software technologies now provide opportunities for significant productivity and quality improvements in utilizing CAD drawings as backgrounds or icons for animation of simulation models. Modelers can not only drastically y reduce the time to create animations but also reduce the time to incorporate frequent layout changes into a simulation model during the design phase of a project. This paper describes the process of integrating simulation models with CAD generated facility layouts and highlights the implementation issues such as file formats, scaling, model resolution, and dynamic depiction.	computer simulation;computer-aided design;image scaling;operating system;simulation software	Ken Tumay	1992		10.1145/167293.167805	quality management;simulation;human–computer interaction;simulation software;computer science;systems engineering;technical report;computer aided design;simulation modeling;world wide web;computer engineering	EDA	-56.370775594099065	7.14743990315429	88400

e51a1a142c8baafa532f793de40911ab304b901c	discovering high-level performance models for ticket resolution processes		Predicting run-time performances is a hot issue in ticket resolution processes. Recent efforts to take account for the sequence of resolution steps, suggest that predictive Process Mining (PM) techniques could be applied in this field, if suitably adapted to the peculiarities of ticket systems. In particular, the performances of a ticket instance usually depend on which kinds of experts worked on it (more than on the mere sequence of resolution tasks), while relevant information about ticket cases is stored in the form of text fields, which are usually disregarded by PM approaches. Instead of relying on a-priori experts groups, we devise an ad-hoc method for clustering experts according to their real working patterns, based on log data. Regarding the discovered groups as abstractions for log events, we also perform a predictive clustering of ticket cases, while using context data as input attributes for splitting the tickets. In this way, different (context-dependent) execution scenarios are recognized for the process, and equipped with more accurate performance predictors. The approach was validated on a real application scenario, where it showed better results than state-of-the-art solutions.

The goal of this approach is to enable the seamless interaction and exchange of information between knowledge-oriented representations as provided by enterprise modeling on the one hand and methods for analyzing data on the other hand. For the realization of the approach we revert to techniques of metamodeling. These permit to describe the necessary extensions of enterprise modeling methods and implement them as IT-based tools using metamodeling platforms. For evaluating the feasibility of our approach we describe a generic implementation using the ADOxx metamodeling platform and the R toolkit. In addition, we discuss the application to a use case from the area of business process improvement and the according implementation within the ADOxx-based RUPERT tool.

Given the decreasing cost and the increasing capability of DSP starter kits (DSKs) and evaluation modules (EVMs), these projects are being used by greater numbers of educators as a valuable pedagogical tool. To help keep the cost relatively low, most DSKs and EVMs are designed to work with audio input and output signals. Digital input/output pins are sometimes available, but the ability to control a number of electrical loads totaling several hundred watts easily does not readily exist. Yet DSP control of significant electrical loads can add depth and interest to many student projects. The paper discusses the design, construction, and use of a very compact, dual-tone multiple-frequency (DTMF) based decoder and power switching device. These devices have been successfully used by a number of undergraduate and graduate students to allow their DSP algorithms to control their world.	algorithm;dsp starter kit;digital signal processor;dual-tone multi-frequency signaling;input/output;real-time clock;real-time computing;switch;watts humphrey	Thad B.

7fcce6c7bdf1750ed1e31b0871e21973410ee051	using actor network to enhance maritime system design		Designing a cooperative system in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) is a description-oriented approach. Maritime engineer emphasizes that such an approach is inadequate to convey ‘how to solve problems’ although it can describe ‘what the problems are’. An approach called the Knowledge Transfer Technique (KTT) has recently been developed with the purpose of bridging the distance between the ‘how’ and the ‘what’ for the maritime engineering community. This article applies KTT to a maritime example in which a CSCW researcher and a maritime engineer cooperate to produce a system framework involving humans and their activities in machinery processes for designing cooperative systems. It highlights the CSCW designer to communicate better with the engineer. In turn, KTT has the potential to aid engineers in understanding how they can effectively implement engineering design in creating products to be used in cooperative material environments.

b685ccc1676cbb129ea48566be58227050a2034b	modeling dynamic aspects of sensitive business processes for knowledge localization		This paper introduces BPM4KIa generic Business Process Meta-Model for Knowledge Identification, which encompasses a clear and semantically rich definition of Sensitive Business Processes (SBPs). This meta-model is well founded on «core» domain ontologies. It covers all aspects of business process modeling and knowledge management: the functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge perspectives. The aim of BPM4KI is to develop a rich and expressive graphical representation of SBPs in order to identify and localize the crucial knowledge that is mobilized and created by these processes. In this research work, we focus more specifically on the description of the « Functional Perspective», which represents the core dimension in SBP modeling, exploring the collaboration, interaction and knowledge aspects. Besides, we evaluate the relevance of some proposed concepts through a real SBP scenario from medical domain in the context of the organization of protection of the motor disabled people of Sfax-Tunisia (ASHMS). © 2017 The Authors.

This paper describes an Internet-based directory service for e-markets that aims to facilitate online buyers by making the process of finding an e-market easier and less time-consuming. This service, termed e-Market Metadata (eMaM) directory service, is based on a metadata repository of e-markets’ descriptions. These descriptions store a number of e-market characteristics according to the ‘Dublin Core for E-Markets’ (DC-EM) metadata model. In particular, this paper introduces metadata models and describes the DC-EM metadata model. Then, it presents the specification and implementation of the eMaM service using the Unified Modelling Language (UML). Finally, a pilot usage of the implemented eMaM service that examines 120 B2B and B2C e-markets for various business sectors is discussed.	business continuity;directory service;dublin core;e-commerce;electronic markets;internet;metadata modeling;metadata repository;unified modeling language	Nikos Manouselis;Constantina Costopoulou	2005	Inf.

0e2eaa91c3fc6dab1e4b5d1ff9f6b549eca50d65	die crack failure mechanism investigations depending on the time of failure		The quality and reliability concern of the die crack failure mechanism needs to be addressed at each step of the supply chain, from the wafer supplier, semiconductor fabrication, package assembly, Tier1 manufacturer assembly, to the end customer application. Finding the critical factors of a die crack is crucial for the root cause investigation, allowing the implementation of accurate corrective actions. The various analytical methods that can be employed are numerous, from standard FA techniques (mainly SAM & fractography) to advanced techniques like TherMoire Analysis or Finite Element Simulation. Application-level analysis, problem solving and continuous improvement methodologies are also key success factors for such problems: Fault Tree Analysis and Ishikawa diagram will enable complete process assessment, including package and die integrity, assembly process, Surface-mount technology (SMT) process, and stress condition at the end customer application. This paper first introduces the different and complementary FA techniques, then presents three case studies that illustrate the difficulty to identify the cause of such die cracks, as a function of the time of failure.	die (integrated circuit);failure cause;semiconductor device fabrication;simulation	Thomas Zirilli	2015	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2015.06.148	reliability engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;forensic engineering;engineering drawing	Arch	-60.904475034205085	10.704474554751854	89869

ee9fd07a9e0a478b3f5f96ac2b76033234010a8e	applying chatbots to the internet of things: opportunities and architectural elements		Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as a significant technology in shaping the future by connecting physical devices or things with the web. It also presents various opportunities for the intersection of other technological trends which can allow it to become even more intelligent and efficient. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Intelligent Conversational Software Agents or Chatbots with IoT. Prior literature has covered various applications, features, underlying technologies and known challenges of IoT. On the other hand, Chatbots are a relatively new concept, being widely adopted due to significant progress in the development of platforms and frameworks. The novelty of this paper lies in the specific integration of Chatbots in the IoT scenario. We analyzed the shortcomings of existing IoT systems and put forward ways to tackle them by incorporating chatbots. A general architecture is proposed for implementing such a system, as well as platforms and frameworks – both commercial and open source – which allow for the implementation of such systems. Identification of the newer challenges and possible future research directions with this new integration have also been addressed.

Consider for example Material Requirements Planning (MRP), which is mainly driven by the Bill-Of-Material (BOM). For information-intensive products such as insurance, loans, permits, and many other services, the relationship with the supporting workflow process is often neglected. Typically, the workflow processes are designed without careful consideration of structure and characteristics of the product. In this paper, we present a method for designing efficient and effective workflows based on the products generated by the process rather than subjective interpretations of managers, consultants, and IT experts.	algorithm;browser object model;business process;cardinality (data modeling);conformance testing;data element;data model;erp;enterprise resource planning;formal language;heuristic;hoc (programming language);media redundancy protocol;requirement;social security	Wil M.

The relationship of actual process flow and the elements of SPN is studied. This model is on flow described based on SPN, and also established by use case diagram and sequence diagram of UML to compensate for the lack of SPN. Finally, a prototype system is developed based on the model built by this article combining with the actual process situation of an enterprise.	prototype;sequence diagram;stochastic petri net;substitution-permutation network;theory;unified modeling language;use case diagram	Yingying Su;Tianbiao Yu;Junming Hou;Shuang Liang;Wanshan Wang	2008	2008 12th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design	10.1109/CSCWD.2008.4537056	unified modeling language;stochastic petri net;computer science;knowledge management;software engineering;automatic control;workflow management system;workflow engine;workflow technology	Robotics	-56.27753323521628	13.162891752886006	90429
a7768a97c70e36d372dc43457df0f12216763042	methods for the domain-spanning conceptual design		"""The development of self-optimizing systems is a highly interdisciplinary task, as several domains are involved. Existing design methodologies do not adress this issue, as they focus on the respective domain; a holistic domain-spanning consideration of the system occurs – if at all – only rudimentally. The partial solutions developed by the respective domains may be optimal from the point of view of this domain. However, it does not automatically mean, that the sum of the optimal domain-specific solutions forms the best possible overall solution: """"the whole is more than the sum of its parts"""". This especially holds true for the early design phase, the conceptual design. Its result is the so-called principle solution, which is further refined in the domain-specific design and development. Thus, a great need for methods arises which support the domain-spanning conceptual design for self-optimizing systems in a holistic manner. In this chapter we will introduce such methods. In particular, we will explain the specification technique for the domain-spanning description of the principle solution of a self-optimizing system. Furthermore, methods are explained which support the creation of the principle solution. This includes a method to ensure the consistency of application scenarios, a method for the design of the system of objectives, which is crucial for a self-optimizing system, as well as a method for the re-use of proven solutions for recurring problems (solution patterns). Finally, some analysis methods are explained that are performed on the specification of the principle solution. These are: the early analysis of the reliability and the analysis of the economic efficiency. The development of self-optimizing systems is structured into the domainspanning conceptual design and the domain-specific design and development as explained in Chap. 3. During the conceptual design, experts from the domains of mechanical, electrical/electronic, control and software engineering work together and develop the principle solution.

We outline the concept of exposing data sources as services and discuss the critical integration aspects that need to be addressed including data access, data transformation, and integration into an over arching enterprise security scheme.

d1633803321671a6c3a6cd77f7f3aec18493e2b2	automatic integration of inter-enterprise processes with hierarchical broker framework.		In recent years, the manufacturing technologies are more and more complex. Almost all production processes need cooperation among multiple enterprises. It is true that today’s manufacturing process is a complex workflow forming a supply chain. Each enterprise provides their services to accomplish professional processes. With the growth of Internet usage, there are more and more services able to be processed on the web. Web-service is one of the applications on Internet and it can help enterprises cooperate with one another in their services easily. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Broker Framework to provide an advanced broker function for enterprises’ cooperation. In this framework, we can classify all services to keep searching easier, to present the relations between two enterprises more flexibly, to match buyers and sellers more precisely, and to cut down broker’s loading. On the ride of an enterprise client, we do not have to modify any existing enterprise architecture. Beside, we will also design an adapter to connect the broker server and the existing enterprises. By these designs, we try to find an automatic way to integrate these enterprise processes to improve efficiency and reduce their transaction overheads.	business process;enterprise architecture;internet;operating system;server (computing);web service	Shun-Fa Chang;Li-Chen Fu;Ming-Yu Tsai	2004			knowledge management;data mining;computer science	DB	-51.860491096556494	13.023031969898128	91101

Achievement of a specific surface roughness is the main goal because it is a well-known index of product quality and a technical requirement for mechanical products. The system integrates four modules: data acquisition, surface roughness monitoring, cutting tool monitoring, and intelligent process planning. Values of the cutting parameters for a peripheral milling process are estimated a priori, and by using a Genetic Algorithm, the optimal cutting parameters are determined. In intelligent process planning module, a Markov decision process is implemented to compute an optimal machining policy. Based on this policy, the system generates recommendations that optimize the operating costs.	control system;peripheral	Antonio J.

The Ontology-Based Information Integration (OBII) approach has been proposed to address the integration issue within such environments. However, knowledge changes management and analysis (KCMA) process within the environment are not covered within the OBII approach. While the traditional ontology change management approach has been investigated to the general problem, it remains unclear how to use the available solutions within MDEng context. In this paper, we extend the OBII approach to enable the KCMA process.

WSQM focuses on the classification and definition of quality factors and activities of associates conceptually. As the coverage of Web services expands and implementation cases of them increase, the importance of the method which applies the quality model to real world practically grows up to make it easy communicating the information of quality of Web services. This research report presents the method describing the quality factors of Web services and SOA normally and quantitatively. For this, we adopt the standard XML schema as the framework for describing Web services quality. This report provides briefly the WSQM which is basis of WSQDL (Web Services Quality Description Language) and explains the considerations, the concept of quality chain, the overall structure of WSQDL, and items of WSQDL. The followings are the summary of the report.

The OPC UA is a successor of the classic OPC - a common communication standard used in industrial systems. Its object oriented architecture allows flexible flow of information and easy data exchange between Control Systems (CS) and Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP). Despite of increasing usage of OPC UA, it has not been applied in such systems yet. In this paper, authors introduce adaptation of the OPC UA as a solution for real-time management of large amount of data coming from public transportation system and discuss potential and limitations of proposed model.	data structure;erp;enterprise resource planning;object linking and embedding;open platform communications;real-time transcription;user agent	Aldona Maka;Rafal Cupek;Jakub Rosner	2011	2011 UKSim 5th European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation	10.1109/EMS.2011.84	real-time computing;simulation;systems engineering;engineering;opc data access	Embedded	-54.426039293962894	14.948982130015407	91494

At the moment the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is being hyped but has also gained some importance. Implementing SOA can have many implications for an enterprise, depending on how visionary the implemented architecture is.

The notion of a transaction originated in the seventies and has evolved over time to cater to complex business applications that are distributed, heterogeneous, and loosely coupled. The literature on transaction models is extensive and most of them illustrate the ideas with case studies on different applications. Since the applications are different, it is diffcult to understand the limitations of the models for the general case. However, such an understanding is essential in order to develop a new transaction model that caters to the changing business requirements. This motivated us to investigate the evolution of existing transaction models and to analyze their shortcomings using a case study, Vehicle Registration system. A taxonomy of the various transaction models based on conceptual evolution has also been presented. Further, the suitability of SOA to large scale e-governance applications and the need for developing better SOA Governance transaction frameworks have been demonstrated.	business requirements;e-governance;evolution;loose coupling;requirement;soa governance;service-oriented architecture;taxonomy (general)	Kanchana Rajaram;Chitra Babu	2010	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/1764810.1764830	simulation;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;theoretical computer science;software engineering;online transaction processing;finite-state machine;programming language;software maintenance	DB	-59.34693530922615	17.271126788658112	92164

In order to improve the telemedicine quality of service, a robust wireless connection between medical devices and telecommunication network is required. Unfortunately, many medical devices were developed without possibility to connect with telecommunication infrastructure. Due to this condition, a wireless medical interface has been developed. The interface has been implemented based on the advantages of ZigBee and Bluetooth technology. A new protocol has also been developed to enable robust communication between medical devices and telecommunication infrastructure. The interface has been tested to transfer the medical data from vital sign medical devices to a data processing system through wireless network. Measurement result shows that the interface is able to be used in transferring medical data from multi medical devices within range of 10 m with some interference sources.	bluetooth;interference (communication);quality of service;telecommunications network	Indra H.

This paper identifies and defines fundamental systems thinking principles that should be present in a business process design methodology. The research is based on the understanding that complex business processes are formed from organized business patterns, and that the appropriate systems thinking principles enable the industrial engineer to capture these patterns and design business processes to reflect real world behaviour. Doing so enables the formulation of a well structured business process design specification.	business process;industrial engineering;requirement	Antonie van Rensburg	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management	10.1109/IEEM.2011.6118208	business analysis;business transformation;complex systems;business domain;economics;business requirements;systems engineering;engineering;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;function model;process modeling;management science;business process model and notation;process management;business system planning;business process;process mining;business process discovery;management;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	SE	-55.636302622742036	18.13209433815221	92329

Due to the inherent complexity of this task, which for example includes the consideration of complex constraints or the automatic completion of partial configurations, various Artificial Intelligence techniques have been explored in the last decades to tackle such configuration problems. Most of the existing approaches adopt a single-site, centralized approach. In modern supply chain settings, however, the components of a customizable product may themselves be configurable, thus requiring a multisite, distributed approach. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of modeling and solving such distributed configuration problems and propose an approach based on Distributed Constraint Satisfaction. In particular, we advocate the use of Generative Constraint Satisfaction for knowledge modeling and show in an experimental evaluation that the use of generic constraints is particularly advantageous also in the distributed problem solving phase.	artificial intelligence;centralized computing;complexity;constraint (mathematics);constraint satisfaction;distributed algorithm;distributed constraint optimization;knowledge modeling;problem solving	Dietmar Jannach;Markus Zanker	2013	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2011.236	unified modeling language;supply chain management;constraint satisfaction;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;constraint satisfaction dual problem;constraint satisfaction problem	AI	-56.31537792171481	12.01235405913812	92587

One of these, remote service developments are responding to changing and growing needs of customers to improve the return on assets of the systems. We have approached the needs for remote services in robot automation by setting up a pilot system to support setup and maintenance of sensor based robot systems by a remote calibration service. The main focus has been in user interface design, to support local field personnel as well as remotely located technology specialists.

This system provides online access to quality, inventory, and cycle-time measurements, as well as linked analysis tools that provide real-time decision support. Production workers, managers, and engineers can access these tools through the Nortel intranet using Netscape. Inexpensive access to current factory information eliminated the costly delays formerly experienced gathering, analyzing, and transferring data. The OR specialists developed and implemented the network and decision-support system in less than one year. This marked a major shift from traditional shop-floor systems deployment within Nortel and within the industry in general and demonstrates an opportunity for OR to assume a leadership role in systems implementation in manufacturing operations.	definition	Paul A.

Establishing an organizational structure that specifies how agents in the system should work together helps multi- agent systems achieve effective coordination. Among other things, an organizational structure specifies agent decisionmaking frameworks. A decision- making framework identifies the locus of decision- making control for a given goal and the authority of decision- makers to assign subtasks in order to achieve that goal. Agents may participate in different decision- making frameworks for each goal they pursue. Agents who implement the capability of Adaptive Decision- Making Frameworks (ADMF) are able to dynamically modify their decision- making frameworks at run- time to best meet the needs of their current situation. Through ADMF, agents are able to reorganize decision- making groups by dynamically changing (1) who makes the decisions for a particular goal and (2) who must carry out these decisions. This paper presents experiments exploring the following hypothesis: Multi- agent systems that implement ADMF can perform better and more robustly across run- time changes in situation than systems that maintain static decision- making frameworks. Experimental results show that no one decision- making framework performs best across various situations that may be faced at run- time. Further experiments show that the implementation of ADMF in multi- agent systems can improve system performance across changing situations. These experimental results clearly motivate the implementation of Adaptive Decision- Making Frameworks in multi- agent systems.	experiment;locus	K. Suzanne Barber;Cheryl E.

The issues and requirements, related to the development of knowledge intensive support framework and system for module-based robot family design, are also addressed. The developed web-based prototype system can provide support for robot/family customization design over the Internet. Finally, the design cases are provided.	robot	Xuan F.

Despite intensive research on integration issues in Information Systems research, companies nowadays still encounter considerable challenges in integration projects. The question for the reasons still engages researchers and practitioners. The paper at hand investigates current integration problems by deriving a framework for integration problems from literature research and applying it for the analysis of concrete cases from business practice. The examples are described in detail in explorative case studies examining three integration projects from different industries and with different objectives. From the comparison of theoretically derived and practically proven integration problems, the paper identifies integration problems that have been insufficiently addressed so far and discusses open challenges of integration in the Information Systems discipline.	information system	Alexander Schmidt;Boris Otto;Hubert Österle	2010	Electronic Markets	10.1007/s12525-010-0037-8	computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;data mining;management science;information management;management;information system	ECom	-62.137391432409636	16.676504396509777	93725

An insulating envelope is a configuration of a set of rectangular panels that respects a set of limitations. Due to the number of façades to be renovated and the number of possible configurations for a single façade, the envelope configuration is both a mass customization problem as well as a combinatorial one. The paper then introduces a decision support system based on the framework of constraint satisfaction, as it fits neatly the constrained nature of the problem. Two configuration tasks have been identified as prerequisite to envelopes configurations: (1) the configuration of a questionnaire for information inputs and (2) the configuration of a constraint satisfaction problem for each one of the façades to be renovated. The system architecture promotes maintenance, modularity and efficiency as different configuration tasks are divided into web-services. Conception and implementation of the massive building thermal renovation are then supported.	constraint satisfaction problem;decision support system;fits;systems architecture;web service	Andrés Felipe Barco;Élise Vareilles;Paul Gaborit;Michel Aldanondo	2016	Journal of Intelligent Information Systems	10.1007/s10844-016-0431-6	simulation	Robotics	-57.532155554766106	12.473311042671101	93802

Laboratory teaching activities of digital communications courses benefit very much from utilizing a hardware testbed, since it greatly facilitates the understanding of very important effects introduced by real-world transceivers. We overcome the main drawback of communications hardware, i.e. the cumbersome low-level programming interfaces provided by hardware manufacturers, by introducing a distributed multilayer software architecture. This architecture provides different abstraction levels to access hardware testbeds, releasing students from the low-level interaction with the hardware. Also, the distributed nature of this architecture results in a high flexibility of operation. This way, students can focus on learning communications topics without devoting any time to low-level programming, that is usually out of the scope of digital communications courses. Thanks to testbed-assisted learning, they are able to perform illustrative experiments to understand digital communications concepts The authors are with the Department of Electronics and Systems, University of A Coruña, Spain.

The objective of this particular programme is to investigate how design, analysis, enhancement and implementation of critical business processes in a manufacturing and service network can be realised using one single simulation/application framework. The overall architecture of the framework outlines how commercial simulation packages and web-service based business process application components would have to be connected through a commercial application framework to achieve maximum leverage and re-usability of the applications involved. In the pilot phase of this programme, research issues were also addressed with regard to mechanisms for interoperation between commercial simulation packages, symbiotic interaction between simulation-based decision support components and physical systems, and simulation speed-up through multi-objective optimal computing budget allocation techniques on a grid infrastructure.	a* search algorithm;application framework;business models for open-source software;business process;component-based software engineering;decision support system;interoperation;optimal computing budget allocation;simulation;usability;web service	Peter Lendermann;Malcolm Yoke-Hean Low;Boon-Ping Gan;Nirupam Julka;Lai Peng Chan;Loo Hay Lee;Simon J.

To resolve this issue we propose the use of the COIN platform, which allows exposure, combination and integration of Web Services to support these aspects in different business sectors. Suitable COIN collaboration and interoperability services were selected based on the requirements analysis performed with Donnelly Tanker Management, our industrial partner in Cyprus. These services adhere to requirements of the shipping sector, such as negotiation of voyage terms, trusted information sharing, document management and user management. Using COIN, a web-based enterprise system was created that supported two case studies. Useful results were obtained by marine experts, which revealed the positive impact of the platform in managing and reducing the time to execute these processes.	enterprise interoperability;enterprise system;integrated project support environment;requirement;requirements analysis;ti-92 series;web application;web service	Achilleas Achilleos;Georgia M.

b543d9751b9cf5eb60fbc9b7b92648abd72de379	registration approaches for augmented reality - a crucial aspect for successful industrial application	industrial application;augmented reality	In the past years, a variety of Augmented Reality (AR)-based applications were created, aiming to support industrial processes. Although these first demonstrator applications or prototypes cover all parts of the industrial product process design, planning and production, service and maintenance only a few of them actually turned into established and applied solutions. Reasons for this lack of acceptance are amongst others their insufficient usability and accuracy. One crucial step in the accuracy chain for an Augmented Reality system is the registration of real and virtual world. This paper presents different approaches for industrial registration, which are being investigated in the context of an Augmented Reality based factory planning application. The resulting toolbox promises to be helpful and valuable for general application in industrial AR. To support the choice for an optimal registration method for a given scenario, the toolbox is currently being evaluated according to usability and accuracy criteria. The current state of this evaluation as well as future planned studies are also outlined here.	augmented reality;microsoft outlook for mac;virtual world	Katharina Pentenrieder;Peter Meier	2008			computer vision;augmented reality;simulation;computer science;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-61.11600679238896	10.972089766023913	94392

With the increased complexity, uncertainty and risks in business operations, workflow monitoring is gaining growing attention in business process controlling and supervision. However, monitoring functions provided in traditional workflow systems lack flexibility, and provide little support for managing complex and dynamical changes in business process. In this paper, we propose a novel workflow monitoring approach, in which various intelligent agents work together to perform flexible monitoring tasks in an autonomous and collaborative way. By using customized monitoring plan and proactive monitoring process, the workflow monitoring activities can be executed flexibly and efficiently. The application of intelligent agents for such flexible, adaptive and collaborative workflow monitoring is investigated through an intelligent monitoring system in	autonomous robot;business process;intelligent agent	Minhong Wang;Huaiqing Wang;Dongming Xu	2005	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2004.04.012	workflow;computer science;knowledge management;business process management;artificial intelligence;data mining;business process;event-driven process chain;intelligent agent;workflow management system;workflow engine;business activity monitoring;workflow technology	AI	-53.01040773736502	12.545627390994678	94746

Inparticular we describe a design information system that capturesthree different aspects of design history: exploration of designalternatives, reasons for design decisions and design constraints.These three aspects of design history are basically different and itis appropriate to represent them in different ways. An integrateddesign information system (IDIS) which supports the representation of these different aspects of design history is presented. Three casestudies which have been used to test the system at various stagesduring its development are presented. One of the components of thesystem, which uses the issue based representation, was tested usingan example from process engineering. The example helped us toidentify some of the strengths and weaknesses of that component. Thisevaluation also enabled us to formulate the principle of preservingtemporal integrity. A case study is also presented which tested theability of the system to retrospectively represent design informationthat is currently recorded in a design project. This case study alsohighlighted some of the problems with existing design documentationprocedures. In the final case study the system was used off-line torecord design information as it was generated. These case studiesfound that the system could represent the required information andprovided a methodology and semi-formal representation that helpedthe designers. Due to the success of these trials the system is nowbeing used by a team of researchers in an industrial setting toprovide the next level of testing.		Roger Goodwin;Paul W. H.

572111143554a9bf8bce1b1c2ab0df6e34ef14ce	towards an ontological formalization of technical product for design and manufacturing		Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) deals with information modelling across the entire lifespan of industrial products. The use of computer-based technologies for PLM purposes requires product knowledge to be specified in formal languages, so that the semantics of the modelling elements is explicitly defined in relation to experts’ conceptualisations. Ontologies used in PLM contexts are often developed to satisfy specific application requirements, and the meaning of the employed concepts is left unspecified. In this paper, we present a preliminary ontology focused on the notion of product from the engineering design and manufacturing perspectives. Our aim is to contribute at the development of a comprehensive ontological specification of product knowledge for product lifecycle modelling applications.		Emilio M.

While embedded platforms are an attractive option for this purpose, most freshmen and sophomore engineering students are not equipped with the skills to learn and use the complex tools that are needed to program these platforms. What are necessary are simple, intuitive environments the enable freshmen and sophomore students to experiment with creativity and apply basic engineering concepts. One of the novel tools available is the LEGO Mindstorms NXT that was recently introduced. In this paper, we will examine in depth, the architecture of the LEGO Mindstorms NXT and why it is a capable embedded platform and the graphical software that makes it simple and intuitive to program the LEGO Mindstorms NXT.	embedded system;graphical user interface;lego mindstorms;nxt	Shekhar Sharad	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Microelectronic Systems Education (MSE'07)	10.1109/MSE.2007.57	engineering education;human–computer interaction;computer science;electrical engineering;software engineering;computer engineering	Robotics	-53.85921268991113	4.840236417728131	95440

Most of them developed so far are based on the server-client architecture and provide their services on Web servers. They require special administrative facilities, ask users to upload their data for matching between business needs and seeds, and leave to themselves peer-to-peer communication or negotiation between matched companies. Considering these problems, we have been developing an agent-community-network-based business matching and collaboration support system. Our system requires neither any special administrative facilities nor uploading user data to a special server. It furthermore supports secure peer-to-peer communication between users. It is implemented with multi-agent Kodama framework.	business requirements;client–server model;multi-agent system;peer-to-peer;seeds (cellular automaton);server (computing);software release life cycle;upload;web server;ω-automaton	Tsunenori Mine;Kosaku Kimura;Satoshi Amamiya;Kenichi Takahashi;Makoto Amamiya	2008		10.1145/1402795.1402809	community;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;database;world wide web	DB	-51.812380394155845	12.885666569341778	95616

Although MegaBits share a similar idea from LittleBits, they are equipped with the function of input and output pair assignment by using personal computers or smart phones. Since each module is controlled via a microcontroller to communicate with each other and a main master module, input and output functions can be easily implemented in a single module. Therefore, the combination of these electronic PnP modules can easily achieve simultaneously multiple complex tasks, which current commercially available similar products are not capable to finish. Moreover, the communication among chain connected MegaBits modules can be done in 1ms. This means that the PnP chain connected MegaBits modules can also perform stringent realtime control tasks.	bluetooth;embedded system;input/output;megabit;microcontroller;modular programming;personal computer;plug and play;series and parallel circuits;smartphone;usb	Tsung-Yu Yu;Juing-Huei Su	2015	2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244473	embedded system;electronic engineering;computer hardware;engineering	Robotics	-53.27182859855311	4.224319221466366	95902

This methodology allows for a business process based design that focuses on re-using both existent enterprise services and legacy functionality. The methodology takes a reference architecture into account that describes how composite applications can be structured by means of layers and which analysis and design patterns can be identified and applied on these layers. The presented methodology aligns its phases on the architecture’s single layers and on the dependencies that do exist between the patterns of the single layers. These patterns are described as well.	business process;composite application;data access;design pattern;enterprise architecture framework;enterprise integration;microsoft outlook for mac;reference architecture;research data archiving;sap netweaver;service data objects	Helge Hofmeister;Guido Wirtz	2006			architecture;business process;systems engineering;computer science;software design pattern;reference architecture;legacy system;architecture framework;design methods;composite number	Arch	-56.69619558949212	16.585949270440004	95919

The point of entry of such part numbers into this process is normally via a Bill of Materials, or BOM, sent by a contact manufacturer or supplier. Each line of the BOM provides information about one part such as the supplier part number, the BOM receiver's corresponding internal part number, an unstructured textual part description, the supplier name, etc. However, in a substantial number of cases, the BOM receiver's internal part number is absent. Hence, before this part can be incorporated into the receiver's manufacturing process, it has to be mapped to an internal part (of the BOM receiver) based on the information of the part in the BOM. Historically, this mapping process has been done manually which is a highly time-consuming, labor intensive and error-prone process. This paper describes a system for automating the mapping of BOM part numbers. The system uses a two step modeling and mapping approach. First, the system uses historical BOM data, receiver's part specifications data and receiver's part taxonomic data along with domain knowledge to automatically learn classification models for mapping a given BOM part description to successively lower levels of the receiver's part taxonomy to reduce the set of potential internal parts to which the BOM part could map to. Then, information about various part parameters is extracted from the BOM part description and compared to the specifications data of the potential internal parts to choose the final mapped internal part. Mappings done by the system are very accurate, and the system is currently being deployed within IBM for mapping BOMs received by the corporate procurement/manufacturing divisions.	browser object model;cartography;cognitive dimensions of notations;procurement	Jayant Kalagnanam;Moninder Singh;Sudhir Verma;Michael Patek;Yuk Wah Wong	2004		10.1145/1014052.1016918	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;domain knowledge	Robotics	-58.63913438633273	11.014702090840387	96110

The users’ requirements can be represented as a case in the defined structure which can be reasoned to enable the requirements analysis. Such analysis needs to be enhanced so that personalised information provision can be tackled and modelled. However, there is a lack of suitable modelling methods to achieve this end. This paper presents a new ontological method for capturing individual user’s requirements and transforming the requirements onto personalised information provision specifications. Hence the right information can be provided to the right user for the right purpose. Method: An experiment was conducted based on the qualitative method. A medium size of group of users participated to validate the method and its techniques, i.e. articulates, maps, configures, and learning content. The results were used as the feedback for the improvement. Result: The research work has produced an ontology model with a set of techniques which support the functions for profiling user’s requirements, reasoning requirements patterns, generating workflow from norms, and formulating information provision specifications. Conclusion: The current requirements engineering approaches provide the methodical capability for developing solutions. Our research outcome, i.e. the ontology model with the techniques, can further enhance the RE approaches for modelling the individual user’s needs and discovering the user’s requirements.	application domain;case-based reasoning;embedded system;experiment;knowledge base;knowledge management;map;personalization;requirement;requirements analysis;requirements engineering;user requirements document	Lily Sun;Cleopa John Mushi	2010	Information & Software Technology	10.1016/j.infsof.2010.03.010	knowledge base;requirements management;user modeling;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;user requirements document;requirement;needs analysis;pattern matching;data mining;database;programming language;norm	SE	-49.36513133939564	16.945420049503333	96397
ff796a7973a65862200a55c8d1ad71f2ac0a20b2	model-driven step application protocol extensions combined with feature modeling considering geometrical information		Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) build mechatronic, variant-rich systems using components from several suppliers in industry sectors like automation. The OEMs have to integrate the different components to the overall system based on a virtual layout. For this purpose, the suppliers provide geometrical information via the standardized exchange format STEP. Beyond the geometrical information, the OEMs need additional logical and technical information for the integration task as well as the variant handling. For that reason, STEP provides an extension mechanism for extending and tailoring STEP to project-specific needs. However, extending STEP requires extending several capabilities of all involved tools, which prevents the project-specific utilization of the STEP extensions mechanism. In order to cope with this problem, we presented in previous work a model-driven approach enabling the flexible specification of STEP extensions and particularly the automatic derivation of the required capability extensions for two involved tools. Nevertheless, the OEMs still need to apply several engineering tools from different domains to consider logical as well as geometrical constraints between product variants. In this paper, we hence combine our previous approach with extended feature models that consider conventional logical and particularly geometrical information, thereby enabling a holistic product line engineering for mechatronic systems. By means of an automation production system example, we illustrate how OEMs can orchestrate their overall supply and development processes through the combination of both approaches.	model-driven integration	Thorsten Koch;Jörg Holtmann;Timo Lindemann	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-94764-8_8	automation;original equipment manufacturer;systems engineering;computer science;logical conjunction;model-driven software development;domain engineering;mechatronics;model transformation	Robotics	-57.13428903741868	13.88890405900572	96459

However traditional manufacturing technology is not geared towards high-mix, low-volume manufacturing. Holonic manufacturing systems (HMS) is a new paradigm whose goal is to bridge this divide. HMS offers a migration path so manufacturing enterprises can continuously reconfigure themselves to manufacture a larger variety of products in smaller batch sizes, and do this profitably. Research into holonic manufacturing systems has established that such flexibility can be realized through a dynamically reconfigurable control system. A suitable metaphor for implementing the holonic control system is the emerging IEC function block standard. The paper describes how function blocks can be used to build such holonic control systems.

The paper describes how the well known Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) method of systematic metrics derivation from measurement goals can be extended by applying argument structures. The pr oposed approach is called Goal-Argument-Metric (GAM). The general ideas of GQ M and GAM are briefly introduced and they are followed by the com parison of the two approaches. Next, the Trust-IT framework is describ ed – it is used to develop argument structures in GAM. Then a case study of ap plication of GAM is presented. The case study concerns derivation of me trics and direct measurements with the objective to assess effective ness of Standards Conformity Framework (SCF), which is currently under development. In conclusion, early experience with GAM is presented and more information about on-going research on argument structures is g iven.	ap computer science principles;automated planning and scheduling;conformity;earthbound;gqm;integrated project support environment;iteration;p.i.p.s.;pa-risc;resources, events, agents (accounting model);trust metric;whole earth 'lectronic link	Lukasz Cyra;Janusz Górski	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-85279-7_3	reliability engineering;computer science;systems engineering;data mining	SE	-61.31921412104994	17.903137527310545	96599

The SCA is a product of the American military's SDR acquisition program and has played a large role in SDR development in the military and in the wireless industry. OSSIE was designed for use in wireless communications curricula and research efforts, so it is easy to learn and illustrative of software engineering, programming, and communications engineering concepts important in industrial practice today. OSSIE includes a core framework (i.e., common services enumerated in the SCA). It also includes graphical user interface-oriented tools that are easily learned and free to download and use. The tools auto-generate SCA-specific component source code and supporting files, leaving the developer to provide signal processing functionality. In addition, visualization tools for debugging and a growing library of SDR software components are available. Discussed herein are examples of SDRs designed using OSSIE, including embedded applications. OSSIE enables easy transition from concepts to practice in SDR design for communications engineers who may not have a strong software background.	component-based software engineering;debugging;download;etsi satellite digital radio;embedded system;graphical user interface;open-source software;programming tool;rapid prototyping;signal processing;software communications architecture;software development kit	Carlos Aguayo Gonzalez;Carl B.

84e44b8848717e8f7b6826eba918e1423413731c	computer support in the (re) design of mechanical products	computer support;mechanical products	Concepts are proposed to improve the computer support in the (re)design of mechanical products. These concepts are combined with a proposal for an improved link between CAD and CAPP systems. The concepts resulted from a methodic design approach aiming at the design of a re-design support system. Findings from literature, previously conducted research and an object oriented design approach have been taken into account. The concepts incorporate a mixed top-down/bottom-up design strategy. The multiple views problem arising from the use of design and process planning features is dealt with differently when compared with previously published methods. To solve the multiple views problem it is proposed not only to consider the different form features at component level but to also use abstract features and assembly relations in order to yield manufacturing form features. Prototype implementations are under development to evaluate the concepts presented in this paper.

The procedure model serves the support of the introduction of a WIS into a company or an organization. WISKI (S)PUR offers a framework for the efficient and actual establishment of a company’s specific knowledge information system. Furthermore, a phase model was developed for the introduction of a WIS into a company, as the case may be for the accomplishment of knowledge projects; WISKI (S)PUR is reflected in it. These both models are validated and are verified by knowledge projects in the ISB AG. The introduction of a Skill Matrix was selected as the pilot scheme on the basis of the need in the ISB AG. The generation and utilization of synergies by the implentation and combination of two further completed knowledge projects with the Skill Matrix will be described briefly in this paper.	information system	Roman Povalej;Wolffried Stucky	2005		10.1007/11590019_82	systems modeling;computer science;artificial intelligence;knowledge engineering;operations research;procedural modeling;information system	AI	-62.734269477687874	12.40342670666156	97762

It needs establishing standards and protocols for data exchange between different enterprise systems. Nevertheless, since there is no methodology for collecting data, exchanged information is generally incomplete. Business process modelling aims at specifying object flows and processes inside enterprise levels and among networked enterprises. Enterprisecontrol systems aim at driving and scheduling the manufacturing resources based on information coming from the whole enterprise. However, the increased complexity of these models does not help to ensure coherent relationships between its components. In this paper, the author will analyse how enterprise applications, models and standards used at different levels of the enterprise could be classified to come to a framework of many interoperability types.	business process;coherence (physics);enterprise software;enterprise system;interoperability;process modeling;scheduling (computing)	Hervé Panetto	2007	Int.

The flexibility of telework in both time and location of task execution must make it possible to take advantage of this work organization for company competitiveness. Today, telework is mainly used for isolated tasks and for those with only few cross-references to others. But telework will only achieve its full potential if attention is given to the fact that work in companies is normally co-operative work. For this co-operative work, business process modeling and workflow management is accepted as a supporting methodology. On the one hand this is important for enabling a production company to distribute work to employees who operate within this organizational model, and at the same time, compared with conventional models of organizing work, to increase the productivity of task execution. The increasing effort for co-ordination and monitoring is seen to be the main obstacle of co-operative telework. The use of existing workflow management systems for the support of co-operative telework is currently not possible; there is no tool available with specific co-ordination and planning functionality for this purpose. In this paper, we will define a specific business process model which is oriented for the modeling of decentralized structures especially for telework and the direct support by a  workflow management system  (WFMS). Compared to traditional WFMSs, our system is extended by a module for the planning and monitoring functionality required for monitoring of teleworkers and their time management. The distribution of work is supported by means of a  co-ordinator  as a constituent part of the WFMS. It executes workflows which are provided by a certain method for modeling business processes. This method already considers necessary refinements in passing over business processes to workflows. The models for business processes are supplied by means of a meta-model, which is extended by aspects of telematics. The system is built using Internet technology and uses platform-independent WWW software for the user interface.	telecommuting	Wilhelm Dangelmaier;Stephan Kress;Rüdiger Wenski	1999	Information & Software Technology	10.1016/S0950-5849(98)00067-6	metamodeling;workflow;time management;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;business process management;business process;user interface;management;business process modeling;workflow management system;workflow engine	DB	-55.45025559000591	14.192996621513775	98417

In future factory automation scenarios, mobile robots will play an important role to help customizing the production process, for instance, by transporting semi-products and raw materials to the machines. Therefore it will be important to compare the performance of mobile robots in such future logistics tasks. In this paper we sketch how the novel RoboCup Logistics League with its automated referee and overhead tracking system can be developed into a standard benchmark for logistics application in factory automation scenarios.	automation;cyber-physical system	Tim Niemüller;Daniel Ewert;Sebastian Reuter;Ulrich Karras;Alexander Ferrein;Sabina Jeschke;Gerhard Lakemeyer	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40942-4_28	systems engineering;engineering;software engineering;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	-59.80262268608305	9.6361044044475	98993

Flaws of the available microprocessor devices for fuzzy information processing are indicated and alternative design principles of fuzzy logic control systems based on high-speed spatially distributed wave guide optical structures are considered based on an example of an opto-electronic dephaser. High-speed spatially distributed wave guide optical structures are shown as being advantageous for solving the scientific and engineering problems for developing new design methods of fuzzy logical devices with enhanced technical characteristics for implementation of fuzzy logical control.	control system;fuzzy logic;information processing;logic control;microprocessor;problem domain	Mikhail A.

We often encounter the view, in research as well as industry practice, that an e-business model is similar to a business process model, and so can be specified using UML activity diagrams or Petri nets. In this paper, we explain why this is a misunderstanding. The root cause is that a business model is not about process but about value exchanged between actors. Failure to make this separation of concerns leads to poor business decision-making and inadequate business requirements.	activity diagram;business process;business requirements;electronic business;petri net;process modeling;requirement;separation of concerns;unified modeling language	Jaap Gordijn;Hans Akkermans;Hans van Vliet	2000		10.1007/3-540-45394-6_5	business model;software architecture;business analysis;business transformation;simulation;business domain;activity diagram;business requirements;separation of concerns;computer science;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;software development;software engineering;business case;process modeling;business process model and notation;process management;business process;event-driven process chain;business process discovery;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;petri net;information system;line of business	SE	-56.35402006218706	17.276136961717427	99768

The PF-ISEE is triggered by an activity and starts the Knowledge Transfer Cycle. The Knowledge Transfer Cycle provides six core concepts with methods, tools and templates to create, manipulate, store and retrieve information. Within the Knowledge Transfer Cycle, special methods are applied in the context of knowledge intensive business process activities with a representation model that can be a global, role depended or an application inherited concept representation. The paper introduces the main advantages and challenges of each core concept and explains its position in the Knowledge Transfer Cycle. Furthermore, it is shown how the PF-ISEE can be part of an Enterprise Semantic Web in order to integrate semantic tools and technologies in standard enterprise applications.	business process execution language;enterprise software;enterprise system;information retrieval;information system;international standard serial number;interoperability;knowledge management;knowledge representation and reasoning;knowledge society;owl-s;semantic web;systems management;xml	Jörg Härtwig;Karsten Böhm	2005			semantic interoperability;semantic computing;computer science;knowledge management;semantic web;social semantic web;data mining;semantic web stack;database;business process;management;enterprise life cycle	Web+IR	-55.65799295175199	15.376893606491457	100364

In doing so, complete methods can be tailored to suit concrete project situations. Identifying such situations and selecting appropriate fragments is crucial for a successful method engineering process. In the field of service identification for service-oriented architectures most existing methods follow a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to acknowledge the broad variety of concrete circumstances that form the organizational context. In this paper, we argue that situational method engineering can be used to tailor service identification methods to particular application contexts. As a first step towards this goal, we analyze two explorative case studies and related literature to derive a basic set of relevant context factors. Moreover, the influence of these context factors on the selection and configuration of method fragments is examined. Adapting service identification methods to concrete project situations will improve their applicability and lead to a better service design.	fits;information systems research;information system;method engineering;relevance;requirement;service-oriented architecture;systems theory	René Börner;Matthias Goeken;Thomas Kohlborn;Axel Korthaus	2011	2011 FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN INFORMATION SCIENCE	10.1109/RCIS.2011.6006860	computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;service-oriented architecture;database;management science	SE	-60.60946416460828	16.89988308564795	100703

Thus, existing assembly models and generative design techniques are not adequate to support development of design automation tools for ETO products. ETO companies usually use custom libraries with past case designs that are adjusted to a customer’s requirements. This method is not cost effective and it is prone to human errors. In this work, we present the Automatic Assembly Synthesis Model (AASM), connecting a Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) system and a CAD system to automate routine design tasks for ETO mechanical products.

77494a74925120fc125c86c71364b34311e4a274	connecting databases with process mining: a meta model and toolset		Process Mining techniques require event logs which, in many cases, are obtained from databases. Obtaining these event logs is not a trivial task and requires substantial domain knowledge. In addition, the result is a single view on the database in the form of a specific event log. If we desire to change our view, e.g. to focus on another business process, and generate another event log, it is necessary to go back to the source of data. This paper proposes a meta model to integrate both process and data perspectives, relating one to the other and allowing to generate different views from it at any moment in a highly flexible way. This approach decouples the data extraction from the application of analysis techniques, enabling its use in different contexts.	database;metamodeling;programming tool	Eduardo González López de Murillas;Hajo A.

One notable characteristic of these contributions is that each algorithm was developed with its own input and output structures, user interface, and hardware and software requirements. The result is that many of these contributions are under-utilized because they are cumbersome to use, not integrated with the other airline’s systems, and not connected across all functions of the airline (from planning to operations control). What was needed to make these contributions effective was a scheduling “environment” with a systematic interaction between the human, standardized databases across all functions of the airline, powerful desktop workstations for decision support, a standardized interactive graphical user interface for schedule editing, and the operations research techniques for optimization. This paper reports on the application of the integration of computer science and operations research in a decision support system for airline schedule planning. The application integrates a graphical user interface and the database with the schedule optimization algorithms.	computer science;computer simulation;database;decision support system;desktop computer;genetic algorithm scheduling;graphical user interface;input/output;mathematical optimization;operations research;requirement;scheduling (computing);software requirements;workstation	Dennis F.

The initial version of the specification was produced in June 2000 in parallel with a Reference Implementation. Inevitably, the completion of the RI showed us bugs and inconsistency. Many of these were been removed in the 1.0.1 version of the specification that was released in August 2004, and the 1.0.2 version of the specification that was released in July 2006 (see www.rtsj.org). However, minor releases such as these are limited to issues that can be construed as bug fixes or clarifications. As commercial products have appeared and user experienced has been accrued, some enhancements to the RTSJ have been requested. These enhancement requests form the basis for the scope of JSR 282. This short paper summarizes the progress that has been made.	java community process;real-time transcription;reference implementation	Peter C. Dibble;Andy J.

The transition to a completed integration is neither done nor on the horizon. On the first view, this is somehow astonishing. A closer look at the basic data of Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) and material flow management, for example, shows that there are quite clear similarities in data structures. In principle, bills of materials, operation plans and production orders contain exactly the data, which are useful for the design of material flow networks. Material transformations are represented through operation plans and input/output equations can be derived from bills of materials. And indeed it is possible in practice to generate material flow networks from MRP II data. Therefore, in this paper current approaches for the integration of material flow management systems and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) and control will be presented.	management system;material flow;media redundancy protocol	Claus Rautenstrauch	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-71335-7_27	manufacturing resource planning;material flow;process management;product lifecycle;enterprise resource planning;management system;information system;business;management information systems;data structure	DB	-60.90528203170662	8.648602146435348	101412

One such platform is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) interactive iLab Shared Architecture. This paper presents work undertaken at Makerere University to develop a synchronous sequential logic iLab based on this architecture. The research was carried out by a Graduate researcher, under joint supervision in the confines of the iLab Africa Graduate Fellowship Programme. The research builds on previous work undertaken by the same researcher, in which a combinational digital logic iLab was developed. The sequential logic iLab utilizes the National Instruments Educational Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Suite (NI ELVIS II+) hardware, with its interactive user interface developed using the Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW). The generic platform supports experiments in the fields of counters, shift registers, frequency dividers and digital clocks, with appropriate electronic component selection and configuration. The design methodologies and implementation strategies for each experiment category are presented as well as the respective test runs. The laboratory has been used to support courses in the curricula of the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Computer, Electrical and Telecommunication Engineering Programmes at Makerere University.	elvis;sequential logic	Cosmas Mwikirize	2012	iJOE		clock;embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;operating system;shift register;computer engineering	Robotics	-53.87143776833353	4.4731293079442995	101741

However, exceptional or non-routine tasks require the intervention of domain experts or generation of the situation specific resolution process. This paper assumes that sufficient amount of business process exception handling cases are stored in the process repository. Since the retrieval of the best exception handling process requires good understanding about the exceptional situation, context awareness is an important issue. To facilitate the representation of the exceptional situation and to enable the selection of the best exception handling process, we adopted the 'situation variable' and 'decision variable' construct. A case example for exception handling in the e-commerce delivery process is provided to illustrate how the proposed construct works. We applied the C5.0 algorithm to build the optimum search tree.	business process;c4.5 algorithm;context awareness;curve fitting;decision tree;e-commerce;exception handling;handy board;information gain in decision trees;kullback–leibler divergence;search tree;situation calculus;tree (data structure);tree structure;tree traversal	Jin Gyu Shin;Doug Won Choi	2009			e-commerce;exception handling;computer science;business process management;data mining;database;process management;business process;management	SE	-54.22650527105487	16.98555940368395	101789

So far, redesign has mainly been a human task, which relies on human reasoning and creativity, although various analysis tools can support it by identifying improvement opportunities. This chapter proposes an automated approach for learning from accumulated experience and improving business processes over time. The approach ties together three aspects of business processes: goals, context, and actual paths. It proposes a learning cycle, including a learning phase, where the relevant context is identified and used for making improvements in the process model, and a runtime application phase, where the improved process model is applied at runtime and actual results are stored for the next learning cycle. According to our approach, a goaloriented process model is essential for learning to improve process outcomes.	business process;case-based reasoning;high-level programming language;humans;process modeling;process specification;real life;run time (program lifecycle phase);soft goal	Pnina Soffer;Johny Ghattas;Mor Peleg	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12544-7_13	business model;business analysis;business transformation;business domain;business process reengineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;business administration;business case;process modeling;business process model and notation;process management;business system planning;business process;process mining;business process discovery;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	AI	-56.381785156677836	18.23366760225966	102038
ca39ef184d56f6c871853f6e35ef24c10e9d088b	highly efficient exploration of large design spaces: fractionated satellites as an example of adaptable systems	fractionation;design automation	Abstract The design of systems with complex interdependencies requires evaluation of a vast number of potential designs against performance and cost based metrics. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencyu0027s (DARPAu0027s) System F6 (Future Fast, Flexible, Fractionated, Free-Flying Spacecraft united by Information eXchange) program aims to demonstrate the feasibility of satellite fractionation. In a major departure from traditional “monolithic” satellites, an F6 system is a cluster of heterogeneous, free-flying, wirelessly interconnected modules that evolves over time to provide better robustness to failures and flexibility to changing needs and improving technologies. The cost and value of any individual spacecraft in an F6 system can only be estimated in the context of the whole constellation and its evolution. This creates new challenges in spacecraft design, but also new opportunities. We present the use of ISIu0027s SPIDR (System Platform for Integrated Design in Real-time), an artificial intelligence-based search and optimization engine, in tackling fractionationu0027s vast trade space. Originally developed for design of monolithic spacecraft, here SPIDR is used to design an evolving F6 constellation. We discuss our approach to modeling sharing and evolution in an adaptable space system and present examples of variations in optimal designs as system constraints and optimization metrics vary.

The technology and information platform (TIP) is a three-dimensional architecture framework to effectively cope with the architecture complexity and manage the architectural assets of information system applications in a service-oriented paradigm. This holistic framework comprises the generic architecture stack (GAS), which is made up of a series of architecture layers, and the contextual spectrums, which consist of the process, abstraction, latitude, and maturity (PALM) dimensions. This paper describes the detailed attributes in the four dimensions of the contextual spectrums. The process dimension covers operations, risk, financial, resources, estimation, planning, execution, policies, governance, compliance, organizational politics, etc. The abstraction dimension deals with what, why, who, where, when, which and how (6W+1H). The latitude dimension includes principles, functional, logical, physical, interface, integration & interoperability, access & delivery, security, quality of services, patterns, standards, tools, skills, and so forth. Finally the maturity dimension is about performance, metrics, competitive assessment, scorecards, capacity maturity, benchmarks, service management, productivity, gap analysis, transition, etc	architecture framework;automated planning and scheduling;benchmark (computing);capability maturity model;functional programming;gap analysis;holism;information system;interoperability;programming paradigm;service-oriented infrastructure	Tony Chao Shan;Winnie W.

They enable frictionless sharing of explicit and implicit knowledge. Several applications that implement a support media for team and group collaboration are implemented and already used for a long time. Since some time Peer-to-peer based tools are a serious alternative to those established applications of client/server type. They seem to provide better services at even lower costs. But there are important but commonly not recognized differences between the particular types of P2P applications. This demands for further research, in particular on nontechnical aspects. The paper provides a research frame to enable covering descriptions of P2P tools from different views. The frame includes a data/content, a user/community and a contextual view besides other more common focii. As example Groove.net, a commercially available P2P collaboration tool suite is explained along the research frame. Teams vs. communities are rarely in the focus of P2P research. Even if these parameters seem to be highly relevant in practical use as they separate different classes of P2P systems they are rarely mentioned as distinctive characteristics. The paper uses data from a research survey among teams that use Groove for their teamwork. It shows that not all P2P tools fit to the needs of every size of group. Groove seems to support teams but does not match the demands of communities. As well one can state that communities need their own type of P2P tools for efficient support of the collaboration processes. Therefore the proposed research frame offers valuable pointers to aspects that need to be considered in discussions - in this case it points to the users of the system.	centralized computing;client–server model;data quality;fits;frictionless sharing;hyperlink;numerical stability;peer-to-peer;requirement;server (computing)	Claus Eikemeier;Ulrike Lechner	2004	13th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises	10.1109/ENABL.2004.49	application software;the internet;teamwork;computer science;knowledge management;peer-to-peer;multimedia;law;world wide web;information system;client–server model	Visualization	-49.10687653752447	12.299550826772213	102643

Anticipating this, cloud governance, a step forward from SOA governance, tries to consolidate an environment where collaboration between various enterprises can be easily achieved. Cloud governance lays the groundwork for enabling easy application development and deployment by providing critical services that range from service management to security, monitoring and audit. As means of support for cloud computing, several ontologies have tried to bridge gaps and provide interoperability. None, however, have taken the time to analyze and define aspects that relate to service lifecycle and cloud governance. In this regard, our article proposes an ontology that is meant to complement existing ones.	cloud computing;core ontology;emergence;interaction;interoperability;ontology (information science);requirement;soa governance;semantic interoperability;software deployment	Teodor-Florin Fortis;Victor Ion Munteanu;Viorel Negru	2012	2012 Sixth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2012.138	cloud computing security;knowledge management;database;business;world wide web	HPC	-57.608453990608155	17.9596389295051	103755

As an immediately available solution, the application of reuse techniques is widely recognized. This paper presents a reuse workbench for VHDL designs which covers the three basic requirements of a design with reuse process: availability, ndability, and understandability. The latter is realized by a novel reverse engineering concept for VHDL designs. It is based on the intensive use of hypertext techniques and graphical code representations.	graphical user interface;hypertext;requirement;reverse engineering;systems design;vhdl;workbench	Gunther Lehmann;Klaus D.

Planning is an important method to realize self-optimization, although today hardly used in mechatronics. In this context, planning is understood as search for a feasible sequence of operations which implements the execution of specific job assigned to a system. This search is a complex and time-consuming task. Hence, it is desirable to decompose the planning task into smaller sub problems according to paradigm of divide & conquer and use problem specific solution methods. Unfortunately, possible planning sub problems in mechatronic systems cannot be considered isolated since sub modules influence each other. This paper introduces the application of a multi-agent-planning model based on cooperative objective functions that enable the coordinated solution of sub problems.	air gap (networking);approximation;automated planning and scheduling;computation;cyclic redundancy check;experiment;forward error correction;mathematical optimization;mechatronics;multi-agent system;programming paradigm;requirement	Benjamin Klöpper;Shinichi Honiden;Wilhelm Dangelmaier	2011	Computational Intelligence in Control and Automation (CICA)	10.1109/CICA.2011.5945749	control engineering;simulation;systems engineering;engineering	Robotics	-54.59384843420533	12.188632440251272	104049

This trend is combined with a close integration of system suppliers into the early design process. Establishing a continuous workflow between these partners demands a highly flexible network for conception, design and production. In order to set up this network cooperation between the partners a flexible product data structure through which work packages containing design tasks can be exchanged and executed in different CAx systems has to be available. Supporting the exchange this is to be combined with a suitable communication structure hosted by a communication platform. The paper at hand describes an approach for the exchange of product data, which integrates a structural view to the design process as well as a work package structure represented through XML documents forming a practical product data model. The work packages are formed by predefined data objects representing particular product views which are relevant for the individual design task. This new type of cooperation is show at the example of the German shipbuilding industry and their main system suppliers.		Dieter H.

This framework facilitates knowledge building using statistics based on patient data from multiple sites that satisfy a certain filtering condition, without the need for actual data to leave the participating sites. Our information retrieval and diagnostics supporting tool accommodates heterogeneous data schemas associated with participating sites. It also supports prevention of personally identifiable information leakage and preservation of privacy, which are important security concerns in management of clinical data transactions. Results of experiments conducted on 8 and 16 sites with a small number of patients per site (if any) satisfying specific partial diagnostics criteria are presented. The experiments coupled with restricting a fraction of attributes from sharing statistics as well as applying different constraints on privacy at various sites demonstrate the usefulness of the tool.	clinical decision support system;decision tree;experiment;information leakage;information privacy;information retrieval;personally identifiable information;spectral leakage	George Mathew;Zoran Obradovic	2011	2011 IEEE 1st International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences (ICCABS)	10.1109/ICCABS.2011.5729866	clinical decision support system;computer science;data science;machine learning;decision tree;data mining;database	DB	-48.426834016112814	4.62960759142239	104367

Thus a Configurable Resource-Oriented Service Architecture (CROSA) is proposed to bridge business modeling in build time and services execution in run time seamlessly. Firstly, based on business model analysis, a business meta-model is built to act as a referred model to encapsulate enterprise information resources. Then these resources act as the basic description to generate services by means of service transformation. And WADL and BPEL are involved in this step. Next, referred to Model-View-Controller pattern of software development, IT elements including service, web pages and data sources are mapping to resources oriented service architecture. Lastly, a state space defined by a resource array is built as the control mechanism for services integration so as to build a completed IT system. And a prototype system is implemented to develop data-centre information system for verification. The approach provides a way to realize service cooperation in a more flexibly pattern.	business process execution language;business requirements;data center;information system;metamodeling;model–view–controller;prototype;requirement;resource-oriented architecture;run time (program lifecycle phase);software development;state space;web application description language;web page	Hongming Cai;Lihong Jiang;Fenglin Bu	2012	Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)	10.1109/CSCWD.2012.6221850	differentiated service;computer science;knowledge management;operating system;software engineering;service-oriented architecture;database;semantics;services computing;management;law;information system;business architecture	DB	-51.37141656546279	16.26494481609135	104524

Hereupon, this research proposes an architecture analysis to evaluate the architecture compliance with architecture principles. The proposed analysis, based on ArchiMate consists in the principle formalization where the principle expected impact is recognized. This analysis enables to identify the principle compliant elements in an enterprise architecture description. This analysis has been applied in one of the largest Portuguese insurance companies to analyse the compliance of some specific architectures.

9cf287de3b03161d961cac5f3f7afc8f0634690f	metadatenverwaltung zur qualitätsorientierten informationslogistik in data-warehouse-systemen		The goal of a data warehouse system is to provide a comprehensive overview of the data available in a company, thereby supporting the management decisions. The integration of data coming from heterogeneous sources is one of the key problems in data warehousing. The technical foundations for the integration have been developed in recent years. However, an efficient technical infrastructure is not sufficient to address the following problems. Firstly, the data in the systems involved have different semantics. Secondly, there are different user requirements regarding the quality of data. Existing systems are unable to solve these problems. The present thesis supports the development of data warehouse systems paying special attention to the problems regarding semantics and data quality. The approach is based on the explicit modelling of meta data of data warehouse systems. In particular, the conceptual context, the quality requirements, and the quality characteristics of the individual system components are represented in a formal model. The main contributions of the present thesis are, firstly, an extended meta model of the architecture and processes of a data warehouse system and, secondly, a quality model for the systematic representation of quality requirements and measurements. Furthermore, a classification of quality dimensions and factors is developed that can be used for an extensive quality management in data warehouse systems. The meta data is applied in a model for quality management as well as in a methodology for quality-oriented data integration. The methodology developed in this work uses the meta data by combining different existing approaches to data integration. The results of the present work are validated in various case studies in industrial contexts and in international research projects.	data quality;mathematical model;metamodeling;requirement;user requirements document	Christoph Quix	2003			data mining;quality management;architecture;metamodeling;data integration;metadata;data quality;data warehouse;user requirements document;computer science	DB	-60.152470073913854	16.305315556209436	105218
e50ec20c150aba3b7703a8efc9afd68ad2fa5fb4	cmaps: a chess-based multi-facet password scheme for mobile devices		It has long been recognized, by both security researchers and human–computer interaction researchers, that no silver bullet for authentication exists to achieve security, usability, and memorability. Aiming to achieve the goals, we propose a Multi-fAcet Password Scheme (MAPS) for mobile authentication. MAPS fuses information from multiple facets to form a password, allowing MAPS to enlarge the password space and improve memorability by reducing memory interference, which impairs memory performance according to psychology interference theory. The information fusion in MAPS can increase usability, as fewer input gestures are required for passwords of the same security strength. Based on the idea of MAPS, we implement a Chess-based MAPS (CMAPS) for Android systems. Only two and six gestures are required for CMAPS to generate passwords with better security strength than 4-digit PINs and 8-character alphanumeric passwords, respectively. Our user studies show that CMAPS can achieve high recall rates while exceeding the security strength of standard 8-character alphanumeric passwords used for secure applications.	android;authentication;cmap (font);human–computer interaction;interference (communication);no silver bullet;password;usability	Ye Zhu;Jonathan Gurary;George P.

In this work we present a hierarchical Markov model together with mining techniques to discover the relationship between low-level events and a high-level description of the business process. This can be used to understand how agents perform activities at run-time. In a case study experiment using an agent-based simulation platform (AOR), we show how the proposed approach is able to discover the behaviour of agents in each activity of a business process for which a high-level model is known.	agent-based model;algorithm;business process;high- and low-level;markov chain;markov model;process modeling;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation	Diogo R.

In Germany, the legal framework for such records provide that disclosure of patient health information to physicians of third-party institutions is only allowed in case that it is necessary for the joint treatment of the patient, i.e. in case of a """"treatment connection"""". As a first step, the functionality of a remote-access architecture was proven allowing a one-way connection between the EPR systems of two health institutions in Germany, which jointly treat tumor patients. Besides, a signature system model for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of medical documents was developed and implemented in the existing information system architecture of the University Medical Center of Heidelberg. Especially in Germany, the legal framework for cross-institutional EPRs is very complex and has a considerable influence on the development and implementation of cross-institutional EPRs. However, its introduction is thought to be valuable, since a cross-institutional EPR will improve communication within shared care processes, and thus improve the quality of patient care."""

The focus of this paper is to identify relationships, roles and model types, which are often needed in a specific project context and summarize these similarities by the use of a collaboration ontology providing for Multi-Model logistics. Reference models on the one side and a model to describe the project context on the other side should ensure that all partners retrieve precisely situation-specific selections of the application models which are necessary for their tasks. Furthermore, a pilot scenario is presented, which evaluate this approach on an Azure Cloud collaboration platform. As a result, we obtain an approach, which allows simplified handling and reuse of complex project-, productand collaborationmodels in order to support the collaboration within a virtual Organization in Construction Industry.	agent-based model;cloud collaboration;collaborative software;logistics;microsoft azure;stationary process;virtual organization (grid computing)	Frank Hilbert;Raimar J.

In this article, a web information model based on extensible markup language (XML) is introduced to demonstrate the benefits that such a framework can bring to the road infrastructure data management scene. To build this model, a two-step strategy is identified and described in this article. This includes using novel computer modeling techniques based on the unified modeling language to build conceptual models of XML vocabulary for improved data description. A case study is provided to illustrate the concepts and strategies. This study delves into the application derived from current practices employed by transportation agencies to deal with their road infrastructure data at early stages of the life cycle management processes. The advantages, limitations, and future expectations of the new methodology are discussed. Based on this research, the proposed model can be adapted to different types of civil infrastructure assets, with great potential to improve data integration, accessibility, reusability, and interoperability of several infrastructure management processes. ∗To whom correspondence should be addressed.

New employment models like telework emerged. Telework is the key to a more flexible design of working time and places of work. But telework is not yet as widely spread as it seems to be. What are the barriers of an all-round implementation? In ongoing research projects we find out, that the different working environments in the office and at home are the main problems in the daily practice of teleworkers. That’s why our intention is to develop an easy-to-use environment for teleworkers bundling several applications and services for communication, collaboration and cooperation.	anytime algorithm;service-oriented architecture;telecommuting	Iris Braun;Alexander Schill	2005			enterprise architecture framework;data architecture;web service;reference architecture;applications architecture;service-oriented architecture;solution architecture;engineering;service (systems architecture);systems engineering	HCI	-55.27532282571155	13.973468498327792	107177
52433da4a2bb0e4d060255984caef7fc976bd7d3	declarative process mining with the declare component of prom		Traditional process mining techniques mainly work with procedural modeling languages (like Petri nets) where all possible orderings of events must be specified explicitly. However, using procedural process models for describing processes working in turbulent environments and characterized by a lot of variability (like healthcare processes) is extremely difficult. Indeed, these processes involve several possible execution paths and representing all of them explicitly makes the process models quickly unreadable. Using declarative process models (like Declare) ensures flexibility in the process description. Even processes that work in environments where participants have more autonomy and are, therefore, more unpredictable can be represented as compact sets of rules. In the process mining tool ProM, there are several plug-ins that can be used for different types of analysis based on Declare ranging from the discovery of Declare models, to conformance checking, to the online monitoring of running process instances.	autonomy;conformance testing;declarative programming;heart rate variability;modeling language;petri net;procedural modeling;programmable read-only memory;turbulence	Fabrizio Maria Maggi	2013			conformance checking;procedural modeling;data mining;petri net;ranging;process mining;process modeling;prom;computer science	SE	-53.37102178682768	16.821464160522535	107257

In this paper we propose the use of architecture reconstruction to support system modernization through the identification and reuse of legacy components as services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA).

However, extending the construction project control system to job sites is considered inefficient since construction sites are unconventional practice. Integrating promising information technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, mobile devices-PDA and web portals can help improve the effectiveness and convenience of information flow in construction supply chain control systems. Radio frequency identification is appropriate for various construction applications, and provides cost savings through increased speed and accuracy of data entry. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a RFID-based supply chain management application called the mobile construction RFID-based dynamic supply chain management (M-ConRDSCM) system in construction projects, demonstrating that it responds efficiently and enhances the information flow among offices and sites in a construction supply chain environment. The M-ConRDSCM system is then applied to a selected case study involving a High-Tech factory building in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate the effectiveness of information sharing of project control in the construction phase. The advantage of the M-ConRDSCM system lies not only in improving work efficiency for on-site engineers, but also in providing dynamic operation control and management to enable project participants to control the whole project. Moreover, this study presents a generic system architecture and its implementation.	control system;mobile rfid;mobile device;personal digital assistant;portals;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;real-time data;systems architecture	Lung-Chuang Wang;Yu-Cheng Lin;Pao H.

The use of interactive animations and visualization is combined with structured support for the student programmer to provide an apprentice style learning environment. Three major threads form the backbone of this curriculum. The first is the use of interactive animations and experimentation programs to introduce and illustrate dynamic processes—e.g. algorithm behavior, or changes in data structures over a period of time. The second thread is the use of graphics in student programs, not only as motivation, but also as a visual feedback and debugging tool. The third thread trying all together is the extensive use of model programs, shell drivers, toolkits, and procedures that encapsulate abstractions. These programming tools support the apprentice style of learning and illustrate good software design and practice throughout the curriculum.	algorithm;data structure;debugger;debugging;device driver;graphics;interactive design;internet backbone;list of toolkits;programmer;programming tool;software design	Viera K.

Those systems are either operating or not and even if some of them succeeded, they still need improvement. As optimization and dynamicity are the most lacking aspects, we are interested in setting up an optimized dynamic carpool service. This problem's high complexity constitutes a big handicap through the way to perform efficient process. Consequently, it is here addressed based on a decentralized parallel requests' process and a distributed architecture is adopted. In this context, we propose a subdivision principle in order to decompose the served network and establish a Distributed Dynamic Graph. The latter models the available information about passengers and drivers and helps to establish a distributed parallel process. In addition, the multi-agent concept has been adopted to set up an automated framework where several communicating entities evolve and perform requests' management.	distributed computing;entity;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;subdivision surface	Manel Sghaier;Hayfa Zgaya;Slim Hammadi;Christian Tahon	2011	2011 14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082983	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;distributed computing	HPC	-54.50353922466051	12.455459602606725	109898

In order to realize the share and optimization configuration of different enterprises' design and manufacturing resources, a method of realizing product collaborative development based on grid service is proposed. In the method, the collaboration among enterprises is realized by grid service cell. The grid service cell is an encapsulated service agent which can provide certain design and manufacturing abilities through the network. Enterprises can release their grid service information in the portal and create their grid service cells, and then they become the grid service supplier. The customers use the grid service matching engine to search the suited grid services in the portal and use these services to accomplish the product development. Accordingly the method can realize the optimization configuration of different enterprises' design and manufacturing resources. Therefore, a prototype system of networked collaborative development of aeroengine based on grid service is developed. In the system, an ontology of aeroengine networked collaborative development is proposed, and the models of grid service cell and grid service requirement are built. Aiming at the matching of the grid service, a matching method based on semantic is proposed; a mathematic model for grid service matching is created and the corresponding matching algorithm is presented. Finally, we validated the prototype system with the example of the collaborative development of an aeroengine part.	algorithm;distributed manufacturing;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;new product development;owl-s;prototype;semantic similarity	Yuankun Gui;Rong Mo;Jingling Zhang;Yanwei Zhao	2008	2008 12th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design	10.1109/CSCWD.2008.4537036	semantic grid;computer science;knowledge management;service design;ontology;mathematical model;aerospace;new product development;grid computing	HPC	-50.86451909484499	12.167288815142626	109993
ed1def3a41bfe7c720740be6abd58d0d4af6cb0e	enabling situation awareness with supply chain event management		Abstract Supply chain event management exploits synergies between IT and logistics and refers to the set of methods and technologies used to efficiently integrate events from all actors and processes of the supply chain. In the context of supply chain event management, we examine how events can be used to leverage situation awareness. In our approach, situation awareness is facilitated by providing the capability to detect situations, which are represented as correlations between simple events, complex events and supply chain objects (e.g., suppliers, 3PL companies, retailers and material resources). We introduce a two-phase event correlation method which first correlates simple events into complex events and then events with supply chain objects. We describe how the proposed model has been implemented in a software framework and we conduct evaluation tests to examine its situation detection capabilities.

There are business services and software services, software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and infrastructure-as-a-service. There is also a multitude of definitions of the service concept. In this paper, we propose not a new definition of service but a conceptual model of the service concept that views services as perspectives on the use and offering of resources. The perspectives addressed by the model are: service as a means for abstraction; service as means for providing restricted access to resources; and service as a means for co-creation of value.

The Intel® 8086 is the first x86 microprocessor, it is no longer suitable to introduce students to the modern x86 architecture. A new microprocessor that featured modern architecture design is needed to maintain the competency of university students to keep pace with the fast advancing computer technology. Intel® Galileo is a single board computer board that equipped with Intel® Quark X1000 SoC. We successfully developed new approach for programming the device using assembly language. Supporting lab materials, example codes, macros, and procedures are developed to incorporate the Intel® Galileo board into the laboratory experiments design for microprocessor course. The proposed laboratory experiments allow undergraduate students to learn IA-32 instruction sets and protected mode programming. The results from pre-post-test and quantitative survey shows that Intel® Galileo board is effective to support the learning of the IA-32 assembly language and computer architecture.	amigaone x1000;apple–intel architecture;assembly language;code;computer architecture;experiment;galileo (satellite navigation);ia-32;microprocessor;protected mode;single-board computer;x86	Tan Chee Phang;Shaiful Jahari Bin Hashim;Nurul Adilah bt.

These process parameters can be used in sheet metal manufacturing to control the manufacturing operations. By extracting these process parameters required for manufacturing, CAM program can be generated automatically using the part model and resource information. A Product model is generated in modeling software and converted into STEP file which is used for extracting B-Rep which interned is used to classify and extract feature by using sheet metal feature recognition module. The feature edges are classified as CEEs, IEEs, CIEs and IIEs based on topological properties. Database is created for material properties of the sheet metal and machine tools required to manufacture features in a part model. The extracted feature, feature’s edge information and resource information are then used to compute process parameters and values required to control manufacturing operations. The extracted feature, feature’s edge information, resource information and process parameters are the integral components of the proposed process information model for sheet metal operations.	boundary representation;database;feature recognition;information model;string interning	Ravindra K Gupta;Pothala Sreenu;Alain Bernard;Florent Laroche	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-45937-9_45	engineering;engineering drawing;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	-57.544188621197655	9.60882011793655	111605

503887086e17ff0ed397cd818fea6b45bbe35910	ontologies and reasoning in enterprise service ecosystems		Introduction The use of ontologies to enable, facilitate, and improve different aspects of enterprise systems is alluring, since they are a means for modeling a domain of interest in a flexible and formal way [9]. This in turn opens up automatic reasoning possibilities to infer implicit knowledge or to automate specific business tasks. So far, there has been academic interest and early industrial products, but there are two inhibitors that prevent the widespread usage of ontologies in enterprise systems. First, the actual value proposition of ontologies in enterprise systems remains vague [11, 30]. That means, decision makers often do not have a clear picture of why and when to apply ontologies in enterprise systems. Second, many challenges have to be overcome when using ontologies in enterprise systems. As examples for such challenges, consider the integration of the new technology in existing IT landscapes or the lack of ontology experts. Hence, decision makers often decide against ontologies and in favor of more established technologies. As a response, we provide a rationale for how ontologies can benefit enterprise systems. The rationale provides a qualitative argumentation line for how the technological features of ontologies can be fruitfully combined to achieve business benefits. We carefully identify the challenges of using ontologies in enterprise systems and present two approaches to tackle (i) the challenge of technical integration of ontologies in existing enterprise systems and (ii) the challenge of training existing developers to familiarize them with the new technology. The rationale and the two approaches are summarized in Sect. “Use of Ontologies in Enterprise Systems.” The subsequent section gives a concrete example of the inhibitors and use case for the second approach. Our research brought forth both a pragmatic and an ontological scheme for service description for enterprise ecosystems. Both schemes allow the comprehensive description of services in order to enable communication and trade between ecosystem participants. However, the strengths of the pragmatic scheme are the weaknesses of the ontological scheme since the pragmatic scheme relies on established technologies. As a response, our second approach can be utilized to facilitate the design of both service description schemes. The following section provides an example for the run-time usage of both service description schemes and the first approach. Our research brought forth a novel way for engineering legally compliant services. This contribution relies on a formalized subject matter provided by the two aforementioned service description schemes each contributing unique benefits required for a solution. The coexistence of both schemes is facilitated by our first approach to tackle the challenge of technical integration.	automated reasoning;coexist (image);design rationale;ecosystem;enterprise integration;enterprise system;ontology (information science);scheme;subject matter expert turing test;vagueness	Daniel Oberle	2014	Informatik-Spektrum	10.1007/s00287-014-0785-5	idef5;enterprise software;database;process management;world wide web	Web+IR	-60.27815880162243	18.12202719526268	111760

In order to support fast-paced product development, a major company goal is the reuse of product designs and product descriptions. Due to the product’s complexity, the design of a product not only consists of geometry data but also of valuable engineering knowledge that is created during the various PLM phases. The need to preserve such intellectual capital leads engineering companies to introduce knowledge management and archiving their machine-readable formal representation. However, archived knowledge is in danger of becoming unusable since it is very likely that knowledge semantics and knowledge representation will evolve over long time periods, for example during the 50 operational years of some products. Knowledge evolution and knowledge representation technology changes are crucial issues since a reuse of the archived product information can only be ensured if its rationale and additional knowledge are interpretable with future software and technologies. Therefore, in order to reuse design data fully, knowledge about the design must also be migrated to be interoperable with future design systems and knowledge representation methods. This paper identifies problems, issues, requirements, challenges and solutions that arise while tackling the long-term preservation of engineering knowledge. 1 This paper is based on the paper given by the authors at the 5th International Digital Curation Conference, December 2009; received November 2009, published December 2009.

The steps in assessing foundries and making a final selection are discussed. Also covered are the steps in going from an initial design to production status including establishing appropriate yield targets. Case histories of some actual foundry programs are given to illustrate situations in which positive and less than positive results were achieved. The relationship between wafer sort yield and product reliability is also discussed.		A.

Flexible production strategies and total quality management require efficient design of the process recipes. This paper presents the approach used in Sophist, an adaptive recipe planning system. The system integrates casebased reasoning and a semi-qualitative process model for the design and optimisation of bioprocess recipes. In particular, we introduce a novel revision selection algorithm that improve the system’s adaptivity. The behavior of the planner is exemplified by a batch fermentation planning experiment.	batch processing;bitboys;case-based reasoning;computer;mathematical optimization;norm (social);process modeling;selection algorithm;semiconductor industry	Juho Rousu;Robert J.

This model aims at providing the basis for identifying the processes to be supported by any knowledge management support system (KMSS), for modeling the dynamics of these processes, for developing a framework of a business‐aware approach to KMSS development methodology, and for developing blueprints for information/communication technology (ICT)‐based KMSS. The first layer deals with the organizational knowledge and its characterization in terms of knowledge things. The concept of “K‐manipulating situation” is introduced and used as a conceptual construct for structuring the functional aspects of KMSS. While this construct combines knowledge and its manipulating processes, it also captures the social aspects of them by including the involved actors and their roles. Examples from Matsushita’s “Home Bakery” case study are used to illustrate the application of the reference model.	knowledge management;reference model	El-Sayed Abou-Zeid	2002	J.

In this report, we introduce a decision making methodology which addresses several aspects of the business rules lifecy,!< acquisition, deployment and evolution. We describe a meta-model for representing business rules in terms of an enterprise model, and also a decision support submodel for reasoning about and deriving the rules. The possibility for lifecycIe automated assistance is demonstrated in terms of the automatic extraction of business rules from the decision structure. A system based on the metamodei has been implemented, including the extraction algorithm. This is the final report for Daniela Rosca's PhD fellowship. It describes the work we have done over the past year, current research and the list of publications associated with her thesis topic. 1 Past work on fellowship During the academic year 1995-1996 Ms. R osca's accomplishments were divided among the work on her thesis and professional activities for the scientific community.

As a result, the need of a standard rules definition language is obvious. In this demo paper, the application of a combination of standard business rules languages to develop a business rules management tool, K-Site Rules, is explained. The main goals of this tool are: first, to integrate the development process for business rules in the software development lifecycle and, second, to make this development independent of rule engine products. K-Site Rules does not include its own rule engine implementation but acts as a broker to the preferred rule engine. In this way, business rules can be reused across different rule engines (which can change because of economical issues, performance issues, etc.) and through different projects in the company. The K-Site Rules tool is part of ITECBAN, a project devoted to the definition of a new platform core for banking applications.	business rules engine;credential;internet access;password;ruleml;software development process	José Luis Martínez-Fernández;José Carlos González;Paloma Martínez	2009			business rule management system;business logic;semantics of business vocabulary and business rules;knowledge management;data mining;production rule representation;database;business rule;specification pattern	DB	-50.38579704135958	15.94954331874814	112654

The simulation architecture extends the current hybrid modelling paradigm which integrates agent based (AB) constraints and controls with a discrete event simulation (DES) methodology. This allows for a more expressive, authentic representation of both process flows and agent policies that captures the advantage of system dynamics (SD) modelling by integrating agile controls with response feedback. This approach is inspired by the need to develop an aircrew training pipeline simulation for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) that supports the real needs for strategic manpower planning in a context of policy and requirements change management.

These building blocks cooperate to achieve the overall goal of the process. In many cases dependencies exist between the individual activities, i.e. the execution of one activity depends on another. Knowledge about dependencies is especially important for the management of the process at runtime in cases where problems occur and the process needs to be adapted. In this paper we present and compare two approaches for modeling dependencies as a base for managing adaptations of complex business processes. Based on two use cases from the domain of workflow management and service engineering we illustrate the need for capturing dependencies and derive the requirements for dependency modeling. For dependency modeling we discuss two alternative solutions. One is based on an OWL-DL ontology and the other is based on a meta-model approach. Although many of the requirements of the use cases are similar, we show that there is no single best solution for a dependency model.	business process;domain-specific language;entity;logistics;metamodeling;microsoft outlook for mac;ontology (information science);requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);service-level agreement;web ontology language;xml	Christian Sell;Matthias Winkler;Thomas Springer;Alexander Schill	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10488-6_40	use case;metamodeling;workflow;dependency theory;computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;ontology;process modeling;data mining;business process model and notation;business process;business process modeling	DB	-54.98191716401054	18.05248257496752	113094

At the same time, the class of continuous industrial processes is well-fitted to agent-based control, where the state of the control system is held and processed as a blackboard. A framework is proposed to support such agent-based advanced control systems. The framework is based on the idea of cyclical blackboard broadcasting in order to keep the distributed control system synchronised. The primary component of the framework is the specifically developed networking protocol, based on a real-time architecture adopted from the industrial informatics domain. The approach ensures strict time-determinism of the inter-agent communication, which is required for continuous process control but is not supported in the already existing multi-agent environments.

The approach is based on simulating the design process using a multi-agent system that mimics the behavior of the design team. The system activates the pieces of design knowledge when they become applicable. The use of knowledge by agents is recorded by tracing the steps that the agents have taken during a design project. Many traces are generated by solving a large number of design projects that differ in their requirements. A set of design methodologies is constructed by using clustering techniques to generalize the traces. These methodologies can be used to guide design teams through design projects.	artificial intelligence;cluster analysis;intelligent agent;multi-agent system;requirement;simulation;tracing (software)	Cirrus Shakeri;David C.

1c17a0f5aa3272ba3051eb02171b849845343619	the anatomy of the archimate language	article letter to editor	In current business practice, an integrated approach to business and IT is indispensable. In many enterprises, however, such an integrated view of the entire enterprise is still far from reality. To deal with these challenges, an integrated view of the enterprise is needed, enabling impact/change analysis covering all relevant aspects. This need sparked the development of the ArchiMate language, which was developed with the explicit intention of becoming an open standard, and as such has been designed such that it is extendable while still maintaining a clear and orthogonal structure. This paper is concerned with documenting some of the key design decisions and design principles underlying the ArchiMate language. ArchiMate is designed as an architecture description language (ADL) for enterprise architectures. We will start by discussing the challenges facing the design of an architecture description language. Consequently we discuss the way how the design principles of the ArchiMate language aim to tackle these challenges. We then continue with a discussion of the modelling concepts needed. In this, we make a distinction between concepts needed to model domains in general, the modelling of dynamic systems, and the modelling of enterprise architectures.	archimate;architecture description language;dynamical system;enterprise architecture;extensibility;software documentation	Marc M.

c802865bf9dbd312cbad7531280fe9c87bc004e2	components of a multi-perspective modeling method for designing and managing it security systems		Information technology (IT) security design and management are a major concern and substantial challenge for IT management. Today’s highly complex business and technological environments and the need to effectively communicate and justify IT security requirements and controls demand methodical support. The modeling method presented in this paper addresses this demand. The method is based on the assumption that enriched enterprise models integrating technological, business, organizational and strategic aspects provide an effective foundation for developing and managing IT security systems and facilitating communication and understanding between stakeholders. The proposed modeling method for designing and managing IT security in organizations accounts for different perspectives and is based on multi-perspective enterprise modeling. The core components of the method, based on analysis of requirements at different levels of abstraction, are: modeling language concepts specifically designed to address security issues, process models that guide the use of the resulting language, and a modeling environment. The method facilitates elaborate representations of the various aspects of IT security at different levels of abstraction and covers the entire lifecycle of IT security systems. It not only supports multi-perspective requirement analysis and design but also enables monitoring and analysis of IT security at runtime. The presented artifact is evaluated with recourse to a research method that enables the configuration of multi-criteria justification procedures. A.

However these do not always seem to have used a consistent set of concepts. Objectives: To identify the key characteristics of an SOA as identified from the literature. Method: We report on our experience of undertaking a mapping study (a form of systematic literature review) to identify the different definitions of SOA being used in the literature. Results: We found 921 candidate studies, of which only 98 were explicit about the definitions of SOA that were used. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that a mapping study can be usefully employed to identify inconsistencies and help to create a model of SOA.	book;service-oriented architecture;systematic review	Maria Anjum;David Budgen	2012		10.1049/ic.2012.0008	computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;software engineering;oasis soa reference model	HCI	-61.16769060125242	17.91799954750907	114493

This vision allows better understanding of both: the enterprise dynamics and its internal and external relations. The business modeling is the main technique for aligning the development with the enterprise goals. The Models have a fundamental role in the Business Process specification. For this reason, it is very important to use high quality models in order to improve the performance and evolution of the enterprises. In this paper a Method for Evaluating Business Process Conceptual Models is proposed. This method is aimed at helping the enterprises understand and adapt their business process.	business process;display resolution;enterprise dynamics;interrupt;multi-level governance;process modeling;process specification;service-oriented architecture;software documentation	Narayan C.

With the increase of parts' number and design complexity of ETO product, configuration knowledge including those supporting variant design became more and more. Consequently, reasoning and sharing of knowledge became worse and worse and lead to difficult reasoning and consistency maintenance. Aiming at these problems, a composite method of configuration knowledge expression based on ontology and tabular layouts of article characteristics (TLAC) is proposed. Ontology is used to describe configuration constraint or rules among modules. TLAC is utilized to express the hiberarchy and assemble relations of components in configuration model. This method realizes formalized expression on configuration knowledge of ETO product and facilitates sharing and reuse of domain knowledge. Finally, an example of the rotor of industry turbine was given to verify the effectiveness of the above method.	r. daneel olivaw	Yujun Lu;Chunqing Wang	2008		10.1109/GCC.2008.99	mass production;cognition;shape;mass customization;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;ontology;database;configuration design;product design;domain knowledge	NLP	-57.09646647253597	11.460027932767288	114833

The powers of modern computing system and World Wide Web (WWW) have made it easier for project managers to monitor information in the comfort of their office and home. Internet allows project managers access to information from any location of their choice and thus they could manage their projects without being present on location. Converting and delivering project-based information are necessary in order to make full use of the internet. Earned Value Management (EVM) is one of the many tools that project managers used to track cost growth and project delay. It provides an objective measure of the amount of work that has been accomplished. EVM is often utilized by project managers to track project progress and determine their achievements. Project information could be converted into manageable and easily understood pieces that would form information clusters. The purpose of this paper is to layout a visualized architecture of project performance measurement that integrates earned value analysis and control within a Web-based system which would allow construction personnel to track, modify and update cost and time-based data of project status online.	control system;freedom of information laws by country;information retrieval;internet;www;world wide web	Jui-Sheng Chou;Wai Kiong Chong	2008	2008 IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics	10.1109/RAMECH.2008.4681340	level of effort;basis of estimate;project management;extreme project management;work breakdown structure;earned value management;software project management;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;control system;estimation;pre-construction services;project management 2.0;project management triangle;world wide web;schedule;project planning;project portfolio management	DB	-53.624435187830905	8.508879508781908	115392

Yet, for many occasions of collaboration, we do not often have sufficient information about who will participate, what activities people will carry out, and how the entire workflow will change. Accordingly, the problem of managing flexible workflows has been receiving increasing attention during the last decade. This paper presents a novel approach by which collaborative workflows can be configured independently as needed by participants and managed in an ad-hoc way. Following the emerging paradigm of collective intelligence, the proposed platform, named FlowWiki, provides a set of useful mechanisms to enable dynamic collaborations without requiring prescribed collaboration model. FlowWiki is an extension of conventional wiki system, and it aims for flexibly managing collaborative workflows by allowing on-demand workflow configuration and event-driven interactions.	application programming interface;authorization;collective intelligence;enterprise software;event-driven architecture;event-driven programming;hoc (programming language);hyperlink;interaction;knowledge-based systems;new product development;programming paradigm;rss;scalability;syndicate;web application;wiki	Jae-Yoon Jung;Kwanho Kim;Dongmin Shin;Jonghun Park	2011	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2010.07.015	workflow;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data mining;collective intelligence;world wide web;workflow management system;workflow engine;workflow technology	DB	-50.20483517117399	13.701679031831276	115828

Many existing research focus on creating holistic service oriented engineering process, generating SOA methodologies and frameworks, as well as proposing new service identification methods. Unfortunately, most methods deal with certain business cases and cannot provide universal guidance on service identification. While a few researchers have done surveys on various identification methods, they focus on describing the methods themselves, and the analysis is isolated from either the engineering process or the goals of SOA endeavor. In this paper we present a comprehensive understanding on service identification with software and service engineering process in consideration. We try to answer questions concerning about obtaining a generic service identification method. By examining recent research works we find some shared high-value activities among various methods, which works as a start point to solve the questions we presented. Detailed discussions are studied on these high-value activities. How to apply some frequent used activities under different environments are also covered.	holism;service-oriented architecture	Simin Cai;Yan Liu;Xiaoping Wang	2011	2011 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference	10.1109/APSCC.2011.12	computer simulation;performance engineering;computer science;knowledge management;service delivery framework;service-oriented architecture;service design;database;management science;data as a service;management;law;oasis soa reference model	SE	-61.83513161036646	17.43625539304534	115981

820d48117bfe9727c850a1339dfe700665dac997	driver identification and authentication with active behavior modeling	automobiles;support vector machines;sensors;authentication;insurance;wheels	The legitimate driver of a vehicle traditionally gains authorization to access their vehicle via tokens such as ignition keys, some modern versions of which feature RFID tags. However, this token-based approach is not capable of detecting all instances of vehicle misuse. Technology trends have allowed for affordable and efficient collection of various sensor data in real time from the vehicle, its surroundings, and devices carried by the driver, such as smartphones. In this paper, we propose to use this sensory data to actively identify and authenticate the driver of a vehicle by determining characteristics which uniquely categorize individuals' driving behavior. Our approach is capable of continuously authenticating a driver throughout a driving session, as opposed to alternative approaches which are either performed offline or as a session starts. This means our modeling approach can be used to detect mid-session driving attacks, such as carjacking, which are beyond the scope of alternative driver authentication solutions. A simulated driving environment was used to collect sensory data of driver habits including steering wheel position and pedal pressure. These features are classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm. Our pilot study with 10 human subjects shows that we can use various aspects of how a vehicle is operated to successfully identify a driver under 2.5 minutes with a 95% confidence interval and with at most one false positive per driving day.	algorithm;authentication;authorization;behavior model;categorization;device driver;enhanced entity–relationship model;online and offline;radio-frequency identification;sensor;smartphone;steering wheel;support vector machine;usability testing	Angela Burton;Tapan Parikh;Shannon Mascarenhas;Jue Zhang;Jonathan Voris;Nabi Sertac Artan;Wenjia Li	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM)	10.1109/CNSM.2016.7818453	embedded system;simulation;insurance;computer science;operating system;authentication;computer security	Mobile	-51.22848375785405	6.449792717372703	116257

There is, however, a paucity of critical research assessing the strategic impact of SOA on the competitiveness of organizations. Some research literature in strategic management indicates that firms may gain a competitive advantage in rapidly changing market environments by concentrating on their dynamic capabilities - i.e., product flexibility and agility in organizational transformation in response to rapidly changing market conditions and customer requirements. The intent of this paper is to analyze the conduits through which service-oriented architectures (SOAs) may exert influence on dynamic capabilities within firms. The results could potentially assist in evaluating if and how the adoption of service-oriented architecture may help achieve key dynamic capabilities, giving the enterprise a competitive edge.	business process;programming paradigm;requirement;scientific literature;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;software development process;strategic management	Haresh Luthria;Fethi A.

The strategy is indeed deduced from the enterprise results stored in its databases. The business processes of the enterprise have moreover to be consistent with this strategy. We propose then a rule-based data warehouse design method. The rules target first a data model alignment with respect to the business processes model. The other rules are featured by a data pattern proposing a solution for the data warehouse design in relation to the categorization of the data. The pattern is compliant with the life-cycle of a business process instance. This pattern is moreover relevant for the specification of the queries concerning the data warehouse. This data warehouse design method based on rules is experimented from two epidemiological databases building up for medical research.	business process;categorization;data dependency;data model;database;experiment;logic programming;minimum weight;model-driven engineering;relevance;semiconductor consolidation;smoothing;spreadsheet	Jacques Simonin;Sébastien Bigaret;Julie Gourmelen	2012	2012 Sixth International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS)	10.1109/RCIS.2012.6240442	data modeling;data transformation;dimensional modeling;computer science;artifact-centric business process model;data science;data warehouse;data mining;database;enterprise data management;business intelligence;business process;management;business rule;business process modeling;logical data model;specification pattern;enterprise information integration	DB	-55.54680098723856	16.42471849219892	116803

They are challenged to respond quickly and accurately with bids that are tailored to each customer's specifications. In order to satisfy the current quotation requirements of RP service bureaus and providers, this paper investigates and develops a web-based automated quotation system which can provide instant price quotations for stereolithography (SL) parts. Two quoting approaches which include the rough quotation based on weight and precise quotation based on build-time were proposed to determine the price quotation for SL parts. Furthermore, a Java-enabled solution together with web techniques was employed to develop the on-line price quotation system. Implementation of precise quotation method, as a typical module, was used to demonstrate the development of the system. The system offers a new choice for RP customers to allow them to quote instantly and compare multiple rapid prototyping processes.

B usiness-to-business e-commerce is expanding rapidly, letting manufacturers both broaden their customer base and increase their pool of potential suppliers. However, negotiating supplier contracts for the multiple components that often make up a single product is a complicated process. Because component parts must be assembled and time dependencies often exist among operations , scheduling is a major challenge. Currently, there are no existing mechanisms or frameworks for automated negotiation and contracting among manufacturers , part suppliers, and specialized subcontractors. As the sidebar, """" Related Work on Market-Based Architectures, """" describes, current e-commerce systems typically rely instead on either fixed-price catalogs or auctions. However, such systems focus only on cost, which is just one factor in the complicated buyer-supplier relationship. For meaningful contract negotiations, systems must take into account other key factors, including schedule, quality, delivery performance, and flexibility. 1 The University of Minnesota has developed the Multi-Agent Negotiation Testbed (Magnet) system, 2 which is designed to support multiple agents in negotiating contracts for tasks with temporal and precedence constraints. Magnet has been under development since early 1998. Currently, its distributed market infrastructure is in place, as are the principal elements of its customer agents, which we focus on here. Magnet's customer agents have two key tasks. First, they must determine the specific contents of a Request for Quote (RFQ), which they send out at the start of negotiations to solicit supplier bids. The content of the RFQ determines how much time suppliers have to submit bids, and constrains the start and end times for the tasks. Next, once bids have been received, the customer agents review and"""	e-commerce;request for quotation;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);testbed	John Collins;Corey Bilot;Maria L.

Best practices in software engineering version management, identified by a literature review, are discussed in the context of process modelling. Based on the results, a concept for version management in process modelling is derived. We present both a versioning approach for business process models as well as an XML storage format to serve as a foundation for an implementation of our approach. The versioning concept at hand is based on graph theory and strives to serve as a framework for future model versioning research and implementation in process modelling tools.

Basically, RFID facilitates the control on a wide variety of processes in different stages of the lifecycle of a building, from its conception to its inhabitance. The main objective of this paper is to present a review of RFID applications in the construction industry, pointing out the existing developments, limitations and gaps. The paper presents the establishment of the RFID technology in four main stages of the lifecycle of a facility: planning and design, construction and commission and operation and maintenance. Concerning this last stage, an RFID application aiming to facilitate the identification of pieces of furniture in scanned inhabited environments is presented. Conclusions and future advances are presented at the end of the paper.	radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;type inhabitation	Enrique Valero;Antonio Adán;Carlos Cerrada	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13102-3_32	radio-frequency identification;constructive;human–computer interaction;systems engineering;computer science	HCI	-61.85000373852437	10.943599423972369	117481

d807aa0fee37ad24a4d317e95627e55d21b3e770	small computers (panel discussion): the information gap	information systems;business data processing	The numbers and uses of small computer systems have grown so rapidly over the past decade that we, in the industry, are faced with a serious lack of information about them and now they can or should be used. They are cropping up in different places among business and industry, where computers were never anticipated. Long time, “veteran” segments of industry are using them in ways they never dreamed would be possible. Many laymen heretofore completely unacquainted with the computing process, are now using it in their day-to-day work. Many experienced computer specialists are now using machines in rather “unorthodox” ways.  The results are a good deal of confusion, and a serious void of information about computers and their usability, or lack thereof. This condition is enhanced by the rate at which the industry is growing and the low cost for which systems are selling. Hardware is inexpensive and readily produced. Documentation, on the other hand, is very expensive and time-consuming. The manual that is well-done is almost a sure sign that the product it describes has either become out dated, or was purchased at an exhorbitant price.  The purpose of this panel will be to identify some key aspects of this information gap and, hopefully, to suggest some potential solutions, or trends toward solution, of this problem.	computer;documentation;usability	S.

Despite the fact that the Process Mining Manifesto highlights this topic as a key research challenge, prior research efforts tend to have a proof-of-concept nature. To this end, this dissertation contributes towards fundamentally bridging the gap between these domains by (i) providing the required conceptualization and (ii) developing a set of methods that extract knowledge from event logs to support specific business process simulation modeling tasks.	bridging (networking);business process;conceptualization (information science);simulation	Niels Martin	2018			business process;business process modeling;systems engineering;computer science	ML	-61.4527870150112	16.509423984747894	117748

The novelty of our approach consists of introducing a declarative speci cation layer, which is used for the construction of the desired services according to global constraints guaranteeing executability and other consistency conditions. These constraints are the basis for an on-line veri cation via model checking during the interactive service design process. Important for the success of the method is the high performance and the availability of diagnostic information in the case of failure: Several hundred constraints must be checked in real-time, and the diagnostic information must re ect the responsible constraint violation as concisely as possible, while preserving as much of the structure of the developed service as possible.

1cf322fb863194215569ea37b8cb4f03024f9e1b	the snare language overview		Social network systems identify existing relations between social entities and provide a set of automatic inferences on these relations, promoting better interactions and collaborations between these entities. However, we find that most of existing organizational information systems do not provide, from scratch, social network features, even though they have to manage somehow social entities. The focus on this paper starts from this fact, and proposes the SNARE Language as the conceptual framework for SNARE system, short for “Social Network Analysis and Reengineering Environment”. The SNARE’s purpose is to promote social network capabilities in information systems not designed originally for the effect. Visual models are needed to infer and represent new or established patterns of relations. This paper overviews the SNARE language and shows its applicability through several models regarding the application of the SNARE to the LinkedIn real scenario.	code refactoring;entity;information system;interaction;social network analysis	Alexandre Barão;Alberto Rodrigues da Silva	2010			knowledge management;social network analysis;business process reengineering;scratch;information system;computer science;the conceptual framework;social network	AI	-54.27003358577492	16.018724019484953	117836
bc22de441398d0b79824c4caead84b8780563ad3	methods for implementing compensation strategies in micro production systems supported by a simulation approach		Customers demands for highest product quality and lowest product costs and the use of rapidly changing technologies are the challenges for industrial companies. To cope with these challenges production processes need to be more effective. This also applies to the production of innovative micro products. However, the micro production has so far not adopted the advantages of established organization and quality strategies in production systems. Therefore, this article proposes three compensations methods which integrate quality strategies into a micro production system (MPS) with respect to the special needs of producing micro products. The aim is to balance quality errors against each other throughout the production process. This is illustrated by the example of micro assembly. This example uses a simulation approach to show the integration of the afore mentioned compensation methods in combination with a quality strategy. It allows a dynamic view of the effect of balancing errors during the whole production process.	benchmark (computing);lean integration;organizing (structure);production system (computer science);simulation;software quality assurance;x86 assembly language	Christian Löchte;Jamal Kayasa;Christoph Herrmann;Annika Raatz	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-28163-1_15	control engineering;simulation;engineering;management science	DB	-62.2787948939089	9.561865732210391	118215

In this work, X3D qualities and problems are discussed and correlated with other solutions. In this process it was detected some necessities in current applications and the complexity of X3D to deal with these issues. As an attempt to demonstrate that the complexity of X3D in some aspects may be reduced, the DWeb3D toolkit was built. DWeb3d is a toolkit to help the development of dynamic X3D applications, showing that it is possible to simplify the development process, possibly increasing the access to developers in this area. The toolkit provides tools to deal with publishing, synchronism, interactivity, multiple users management and disk persistence.	interactivity;multi-user;persistence (computer science);x3d	Felipe Quintella;Luciano P.

The integrated information framework (I2F) was established to provide the services and resources necessary to support this interoperability between collaborative enterprise solutions utilized throughout the lifecycle of large scale live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) events. This interoperability allows AF-ICE community members to continue using their existing collaborative systems for local development of work products, while also contributing to the development of work products across organizational boundaries and systems. The I2F provides a focused virtual work environment tying together people and assets necessary to support various MS&A activities and includes an interoperable document management system, a community of practice knowledge sharing capability, adaptive MS&A event management process workflows/descriptions, and an adaptive, knowledge database/repository. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of I2F and its key concepts, an explanation of the concept of operations for distributed document management between collaborative systems, and information regarding the development of the initial operating capabilities realized through the specification of an interoperability services framework that standardizes communication between the I2F and collaborative systems.	anisotropic filtering;authorization;collaborative software;enterprise integration;enterprise system;information framework;interoperability;lvcmos;semiconductor consolidation;simulation;user experience;user interface;virtual work;web services description language;web service	David Green;Joel Dallaire;Corey Westrick	2007	2007 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems	10.1109/CTS.2007.4621772	web service;semantic interoperability;computer science;knowledge management;adaptive system;document management system;database;object-oriented programming;management;law;cross-domain interoperability	HPC	-51.2679654916738	17.107163250570512	118837

21baeaab34a9689fa5c5a10fa47a75cc5ba5135a	designing organizational structures of production systems using a process-oriented approach	production system;organizational structure	This paper discusses a process-oriented approach for designing organizational structures of production systems. Based on a suitable characterization of order related processes on one hand, and the personnel on the other hand, organizational structures with a high performance can be defined. The concept of shaping process-oriented organizational structures is connected to a simulation-aided approach in order to evaluate the dynamic behavior of planned production systems and to perform the planning procedure in a flexible and efficient way. The dynamic analyses are carried out using the simulation tool FEMOS.

Some of these patterns have been used to improve the software components of a service-oriented grid middleware named GRid-based Application Service Provision (GRASP) that the authors have defined, designed and implemented in the frame of a former homonymous European Commission Project (FP5). The main improvement of GRASP due to the application of the BEinGRID design patterns is the support for the creation and life cycle management of Virtual Organisations (VOs). This paper presents the authors’ experience and lessons learnt in adopting the GRASP middleware to set up a Business-to-Business (B2B) federated environment supporting collaboration among enterprises. The concrete case study relates to online gaming applications and the adoption of the software as a service business model to provide gaming applications. In addition, a set of lessons learnt during the analysis of several Business Experiments (BEs) of the BEinGRID project are reported.	component-based software engineering;design pattern;experiment;federated identity;grasp;middleware;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented software engineering;shutdown (computing);software as a service;source	Nicola Capuano;Matteo Gaeta;Sergio Miranda;Francesco Orciuoli;Pierluigi Ritrovato	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87783-7_49	computer science;knowledge management;component-based software engineering;service-oriented architecture;world wide web	SE	-50.58635318380976	14.873177075170087	119590

Design structure matrix (DSM), a structured method which has advantages on representing and analysing interaction relations between system elements (such as development tasks, design parameters, architecture concepts, and organizational teams), is proposed to be suitable means to define, capture and organize and distribute the system level knowledge during the product development process. The captured knowledge through DSM can improve understanding of the design routes and design history by linking designed items to rationales, decisions and assumptions behind them. Meanwhile, the knowledge captured through DSM could assist on predicting changes on existing solutions, reusing of the existing solutions in new projects, and educational process for inexperienced designers. How to capture, trace and manage the design knowledge through DSM is presented in detail, and a DSM-based knowledge management system has been developed.	design structure matrix;experience;interaction;knowledge management;new product development;tracing (software)	Dunbing Tang;Renmiao Zhu;Jicheng Tang;Ronghua Xu;Rui He	2008	2008 12th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design	10.1016/j.aei.2009.08.005	iterative design;single domain;user-centered design;probabilistic design;strategic design;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;product design specification;design review;conceptual design;management system;management science;design structure matrix;electronic system-level design and verification;product design;design technology;management;high-level design;generative design;product engineering	HCI	-60.93005984233459	12.300189366730695	119790

Parts are frequently replaced unnecessarily while others that are much more likely to cause system failures are left untouched. The result is that despite vast sums of money being invested in spares, system availability is still very much a problem. Operations research has the tools that could significantly improve this situation but why are they not being used?

We analyze the problem and present an approach to solve it without compromising any of the two major concerns that are involved: a) a clear semantical definition (design), which also clarifies what has to be implemented to achieve the intended generality of the construct, and b) a comprehensive set of static and dynamic analysis methods (verification of properties of business process models using the construct). We provide a conceptually simple scheme for dynamic OR-join synchronization policies, which can be implemented with low run-time overhead and allows the practitioner to effectively link the design of business process models with OR-joins to an analysis of the intended model properties. The definitions have been experimentally validated by a graph-based simulator.	business process;emoticon;experiment;interpretation (logic);overhead (computing);process modeling;simulation	Egon Börger;Ove Sörensen;Bernhard Thalheim	2009	J.

Conventionally these topics are separately investigated in CAD, CAE and CAM communities. Such explicit separations, however, suffer from some apparent limitations. This article presents an alternative scheme to consider the heterogeneous object design problem in an integrated CAX (CAD/CAE/CAM) framework. The motivation is to design heterogeneous objects which not only look right, but also functionally work right. In addition to the data representation, model constructions and visualizations, other considerations such as data communications to and from CAE/CAM modules, fabrication efficiency in layered manufacturing etc., are also considered. The presented CAX based design method facilitates design tools integration and enhances the interoperability in the entire design process.	computer-aided design;data (computing);download;flash animation;interoperability;linkage (software);x/open	X.

8ae22d44aaf45c93b3f283ed877a2e7764ea2577	an application of blockchain and smart contracts for machine-to-machine communications in cyber-physical production systems		Blockchain, which is a new technology of distributed data storage in the form of a chain of blocks, has become one of the most popular topics in the field of information technology for today. Although the term “blockchain” is often associated with operations in cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, for example), its application is not limited to this area. The algorithm for automatic confirmation of transactions has already been successfully applied in accounting, postal services, and smart devices. Additionally, people can participate in the confirmation of transactions. This article considers the possibility of using the technology in creating distributed networks of industrial equipment, i.e. creation of a backbone network for cyber-physical production systems. The proposed approach is detailed and discussed with the support of relevant use cases. A number of architectures of support networks based on blockchain technology are proposed, the positive and negative aspects of this approach are considered.	algorithm;autonomy;bitcoin;computer data storage;cryptocurrency;distributed manufacturing;fault tolerance;internet backbone;m2m (eclipse);machine to machine;postal;printed circuit board;production system (computer science);prototype;smart contract;smart device	Maxim Ya.

Today, management seeks effective real time reporting on different key parameters such as work-in-process (WIP), cycle time, scrap, and tool up-time in an effort to monitor factory performance so that the business goals are met. The complexity of wafer fabrication (fab) processing, however, has necessitated the need for multiple multi-million dollar Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) systems to be implemented in order to collect real time data. CIM systems deployed in semiconductor manufacturing settings capture real time data about every detail of the factory such as equipment throughputs, WIP, and product and equipment history. Most of the data collected, however, tends to be archived rather than used due to the difficulty of data extraction and presentation. The challenge, therefore, is to transform the massive data in the different CIM databases into meaningful information that is easy to access as well as easy to interpret and manipulate. This paper presents an integrated relational database approach for modeling and collecting semiconductor manufacturing data from multiple database systems and transforming the data into useful reports. A summary of the key reports generated is presented as well. These reports help to monitor factory performance by tracking different key metrics. These reports were implemented in one of Motorola’s wafer fabs and have contributed significantly in improving factory performance.	relational database;semiconductor device fabrication	Russ M.

Existing product configurators are mainly used as sales tools, and fail to account for the requirements of the entire customer order fulfillment process. In this regard, this paper proposes an Integrated Vehicle Configuration System (IVCS) to facilitate customer order processing based on information from multiple domains in a mass customization environment. An IVCS business model is proposed to incorporate the decision factors for configuration design related to different planning stages. The business model is supported by a comprehensive ontology framework, which enhances communications between different stakeholders involved in the order fulfillment process. The configuration approach is based on combinations of selective and generative rules and can be integrated with existing ERP systems. It also provides mechanisms to handle configuration rules that allow users to convert soft preferences into product specifications, bill-of-materials, and, furthermore, into logistics configurations. An example of a computerized configuration system showcases the process from customer engineering to design and production. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed approach is novel in the sense that it is able to represent control-flow with BPMN constructs, but also because it augments the control-flow perspective with an organizational dimension by discovering swimlanes that represent organizational roles in the business process. Additional advantages of the proposed mining approach can be summarized as follows: it provides intuitive and easy-to-use abstraction/specification functionality which makes it applicable to event logs with various complexity levels, it provides instant feedback about the conformance between the input log and the resulting model based on a dedicated fitness metric, it is robust to noise, and it can easily integrate with modeling and other BPM tools with exporting functionality through the XPDL-format. In this way, BPMN Miner will take process mining one step closer to the status of indispensable for business process reengineering as discovered models are immediately available in the preferred language of a majority of practitioners, educators and researchers.	business process model and notation	Jochen De Weerdt;Seppe K.

The approach uses set-based concurrent engineering principles to explore and narrow down a design space towards feasible alternatives. A case including tool accessibility and assembly robustness of an aerospace sub-system platform is used to demonstrate the approach. The assessment activities can be prepared in parallel, and support the concurrency needed, across design and manufacturing, to serve improved process efficiency. Ultimately, the approach may reduce late design modifications thanks to increased reuse of manufacturing knowledge, as well as reduce cost thanks to less physical prototyping and testing.

I t pays particular attention to problems with defining the nature of agents, the technologies that hav e enabled the rapid progress to date, and ways in which work can be consolidated through the developme nt of large-scale applications, and the integration with theoretical foundations.	agent-based model;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;programming paradigm;software deployment;web application	Michael Luck	1999	Knowledge Eng.

It is now widely accepted that humans are vital to efficient and effective operation of manufacturing proce sses. Historically, human resources in most manufacturing environments have been m ismanaged, and while the re has been a virtual proliferation of enabling technologie s to support manufacturing systems, little attention has been paid to integrating humans into such systems. Now that hum ans are be ing re introduced in contemporary manufacturing systems, it is necessary to pay serious attention to th is most vital of all re source s. O ne of the most critical and pre ssing human resource management needs is the training of workers, at all leve ls ( line workers, managers, engineers, etc.) in skills they need to make a manufacturing organization competitive. In spite of th is pressing need relatively little has been done to deve lop generic and fundamental methods for training manufacturing workers. Th is pape r reviews training literature, identifies research de ficiencies, and propose s a framework for training workers in contemporary manufacturing environments.	generic programming;wilhelm pape	Arunkumar Pennathur;Anil Mital;Venkat Rajan;David B.

B2B interactions are carried out by executing collaborative business processes among the parties. In this work we propose B2B collaboration agents for managing B2B interactions that allow organizations to dynamically establish collaborations and execute collaborative processes with their partners. The planning and execution of the actions of the agents that execute collaborative processes are driven by a Petri Net engine embedded in these agents. The role an organization fulfills in a collaborative process is represented by a high-level Petri Net model which is used to drive the behavior of the B2B collaboration agents representing the organization. Moreover, interaction protocols representing collaborative processes are executed by these agents without the need for protocols defined at design-time. Finally, an implementation of the B2B agents is presented.	business process;embedded system;high- and low-level;interaction protocol;internet;petri net;software agent	Edgar Tello-Leal;Omar Chiotti;Pablo David Villarreal	2011			data mining;computer science;process management;business-to-business;software agent	AI	-51.389600001037905	14.901405537505504	122141

One of the objectives of these research projects was to modularize numerical controls and to adjust their functional range to the individual needs of the user. In the DFG-sponsored research project “Minimalsteuerung” (minimal control) the special requirements of large-scale production concerning the functional range of numerical controls were identified. This resulted in a new definition of modularization requirements in excess of the open control architectures of the OSACA and OCEAN projects.

1c341b05bbc6a82ea2f02ebf0cb2b4f0e651eaf4	towards knowledge sharing in disaster management: an agent oriented knowledge analysis framework	oriented;disaster;towards;agent;knowledge;sharing;analysis;management;framework	Disaster Management (DM) is a complex set of interrelated activities. The activities are often knowledge intensive and time sensitive. Sharing the required knowledge timely is critical for DM. In developed countries, for recurring disasters (e.g. floods), there are dedicated document repositories of Disaster Management Plans (DMP) that can be accessed as needs arise. However, accessing the appropriate plan in a timely manner and sharing activities between plans often requires domain knowledge and intimate knowledge of the plans in the first place. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based knowledge analysis method to convert DMPs into a collection of knowledge units that can be stored into a unified repository. The repository of DM actions then enables the mixing and matching knowledge between different plans. The repository is structured as a layered abstraction according to Meta Object Facility (MOF). We use the flood management plans used by SES (State Emergency Service), an authoritative DM agency in NSW (New State Wales) State of Australia to illustrate and give a preliminary validation of the approach. It is illustrated using DMPs along the flood prone Murrumbidgee River in central NSW.	3d acis modeler;accessible surface area;agent-based model;meta-object facility;metamodeling;mixing (mathematics);semiconductor industry	Dedi Iskandar Inan;Ghassan Beydoun;Simon Opper	2016	CoRR		disaster;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;analysis;data mining;knowledge;personal knowledge management;management;operations research;law;world wide web;computer security	AI	-52.10104300129428	9.60791675466951	122494

The data required to support such initiatives comes from several organizations such as insurers, physicians, hospitals, pharmacies and labs each of which gather and maintain data for the purpose of healthcare delivery. Accessing data in this distributed and heterogeneous environment is difficult and has to deal with well-documented issues such as resolving semantic conflicts, multiple query languages etc. Data warehousing and mediator-based architectures are often proposed and used in these settings. In this paper, we focus on mediator-based architectures and the privacy problems that arise in the healthcare context owing to the linkage of information about patients, physicians, and diseases enabled by the mediator. Current proposals for security-conscious mediators do not address inferential disclosure resulting from record linkage. In particular, we study the problem of interval inference, a specific kind of disclosure that arises when participants are able to compute tight bounds on sensitive values of other participants, based on the aggregate information published by the mediator. We illustrate our approach with a real world example and propose an """"audit and aggregate"""" methodology that chooses the optimal level of aggregation of the data taking into account both the risk of disclosure as well as the utility of the released data to legitimate users."""	aggregate data;inferential programming;interval arithmetic;linkage (software);query language	Claus Boyens;Ramayya Krishnan;Rema Padman	2004	37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

908575a90ee3a36bbaee3a99fd526999412998b7	a requirement-driven approach to the design and evolution of data warehouses	dw;etl;conceptual design;multidimensional design;article	Designing data warehouse (DW) systems in highly dynamic enterprise environments is not an easy task. At each moment, the multidimensional (MD) schema needs to satisfy the set of information requirements posed by the business users. At the same time, the diversity and heterogeneity of the data sources need to be considered in order to properly retrieve needed data. Frequent arrival of new business needs requires that the system is adaptable to changes. To cope with such an inevitable complexity (both at the beginning of the design process and when potential evolution events occur), in this paper we present a semi-automatic method called ORE, for creating DW designs in an iterative fashion based on a given set of information requirements. Requirements are first considered separately. For each requirement, ORE expects the set of possible MD interpretations of the source data needed for that requirement (in a form similar to an MD schema). Incrementally, ORE builds the unified MD schema that satisfies the entire set of requirements and meet some predefined quality objectives. We have implemented ORE and performed a number of experiments to study our approach. We have also conducted a limited-scale case study to investigate its usefulness to designers. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Polygraph tests are invasive and require elongated time and human expertise, which is subject to bias and error. In this paper, we analyze thermal and visual clues of deception using a dataset collected from 30 subjects and multiple scenarios. We analyze expressions and other visual features and provide the first comparison between thermal facial regions to identify areas with higher capability of indicating deceit. Our experimental results show that our non-contact feature fusion model outperforms traditional physiological measurements, paving the road for non-invasive deception detection methodologies.	exponent bias	Mohamed Abouelenien;Rada Mihalcea;Mihai Burzo	2016		10.1145/2910674.2910682	thermal;speech recognition;visual system;computer science;multimodal interaction;computer security	AI	-51.05401401921293	6.848766487942727	123112

In order to identify service-oriented system evolution taxonomy, it is suggested to build on complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory that interprets phenomenon of evolution and emergence of new properties. This required a survey of service-oriented system design and development techniques and principles, and their mapping to CAS evolutionary principles. Based on this analysis, the paper identifies four major categories of service-oriented system evolution: a) service structural properties, e.g., flexibility of service, loose coupling, re-usability, etc.; b) enterprise enabling factors, e.g., enterprise architecture, organisation structure and management style; c) evolution dynamics, e.g., interactions within the enterprise and with users, prototyping, iterative and incremental development in SOA realisation, etc.; d) controlling factors, e.g., continuous reflection, learning and adjustment supported by formalised standards in SOA programming, SOA quality attributes and SOA governance techniques. This led to deriving a process model utilising these four categories to enable service-oriented system evolution. Metrics are suggested to benchmark system structural properties and controlling factors, including SOA flexibility, SOA quality attributes and SOA governance to ensure sustainable evolution and avoiding disordered results in response to change.	complex adaptive system;service-oriented device architecture;systems theory	Ghada Alaa	2011	Int.

A drawing represented an agreement between the two functions and was developed through personal contact between the designer who conceived of the design and the mechanic who produced it. However, as products became increasingly complex, more people got involved in the process; as a result, communication was more difficult. For example, the development of communications satellites from design to manufacturing requires several hundred engineering and manufacturing personnel. Thus, it is impossible for engineers to visit each site (assembly or shop) individually to discuss the design intent. An additional problem arises with the specialization of functions. To establish a communication channel between design and manufacturing, computer-aided engineering is being incorporated into the spacecraft industry. The simplest definition of CAE is the use of computers to translate a product's specific requirements into the design and manufacture of the final product. CAE plays a key role in areas such as design, drafting, analysis, documentation, numerically controlled programming, tooling, fabrication, assembly, quality control, and testing. In the context of this article, CAE means computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing. Describing the function of a communications satellite will help explain the use of CAE in the spacecraft industry. A communications satellite, in essence, is a radio relay in the sky. Signals are relayed to the satellite from antennas on earth, and the satellite amplifies the signals and sends them back. To perform these functions, a satellite requires the following subsystems (Figure 1):	assembly language;channel (communications);communications satellite;computer;computer-aided design;documentation;numerical analysis;partial template specialization;relay;requirement;semiconductor device fabrication;technical drawing;x/open	Kamal N.

f305f2243f8166e73f3f219c573facb7ee83a0ad	construct the activity policies of collaborative product design using the maturity level 2 of cmmi		For a company to survive in present day manufacturing industry, short production time, a low production cost and superior product quality are the necessities. A modern approach for industrial product development is necessary in order to accommodate this quickly changing manufacturing environment. The collaborative approach is suitable for developing new products and satisfies the essential needs in modern environment. For the sake of the collaborative approach could be successfully applied, the outlines of the practical policies of collaborative product design (CPD) should be proposed. Hence, in this paper, the project lifecycle of seven phases of CPD are described with waterfall model, and the contents of the seven phases of collaborative product design are offered based on the concept of work breakdown structure. Thereupon, the specific practices of the maturity level 2 of Capability Maturity Model (CMM) are used to construct activity management system that could support collaborative product design and development. Finally, some sample practical suggests of collaborative product design are provided for an organization to consider when implementing the CPD. In short, the research has successfully established the lifecycle of collaborative product design system and the management function of each phase through the essence of work breakdown structure and process flow diagram. Also, proper key practices of CCMI have been applied to establish the practical policies of collaborative product design.	capability maturity model integration	Kuen Horng Lu;Ya Wen Hsiao;Chang Chih Chen	2005	IJEBM		systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;operations management;product lifecycle;product design specification;design review;product and manufacturing information;product management;product design;new product development;product engineering	HCI	-61.73606233221248	10.417581301010866	125239

Herein, we cast the truck dispatching task in a decision-making framework for determining solutions and helping a dispatcher to make decisions. In this paper, we apply the discrete-event formalism to investigate the dispatching of a large truck fleet. For this purpose, we examine the capabilities and limitations of two distinct theories: discrete-event system (DES) and vector discrete-event system (VDES). Despite their differences, both theories can be used to model the logical structure of the dispatching process. These theories also provide techniques for implementing specifications and representing solutions in a compact manner. The results of this paper demonstrate that current procedures and tools available for DES allow a broader range of techniques to be applied, thus increasing the likelihood of finding a suitable solution.

b9a6f6c9aa2fd202a337d0033d4ec2a31dc8da5c	flexible artifact-driven automation of product design processes		Automated support of business processes by information systems can be seen as state-of-the-art for many domains, such as production planning or customer relationship management. A myriad of approaches to the automation of business processes in these domains has been proposed. However, these approaches are not suited for highly creative processes, as they are observed in the field of innovative product design. These processes require a high degree of flexibility of the process implementation. In this paper, we focus on product design processes and propose a methodology for the implementation of supporting workflows. In order to cope with the imposed flexibility requirements, we follow an artifact-centric approach. Based on high-level process models, object life-cycle models are derived. Those are manually enriched and used for automatic generation of an executable workflow model. We also present an implementation of our approach.	automation;business process;coloured petri net;control flow;customer relationship management;data dependency;executable;high- and low-level;information system;modeling perspective;requirement;single-instance storage	Ole Eckermann;Matthias Weidlich	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21759-3_8	computer-automated design;process automation system;product design specification;process management;product design;totally integrated automation;manufacturing engineering	AI	-56.184767689718896	18.212376614998703	125406

That is why the demand was formulated for a method that enables introducing new features in software systems without any modification in program code. An adaptive ERP system cannot handle business processes and data flow as disjoint components. Therefore the proposed solution is bifocal: an adaptive ERP system with highly integrated data flow and document management. In this article design and programming challenges are shown that had to be met during the development, focusing on topics of effective data storage and queries, workflow control structures and workflow evaluation techniques, document representation and the connection of workflow and data flow.	business process;competitive programming;computer data storage;control flow;dataflow;erp;enterprise resource planning;graphical user interface;software system	Bálint Molnár;Zsigmond Máriás	2015	2015 12th International Joint Conference on e-Business and Telecommunications (ICETE)	10.5220/0005545601600167	data flow diagram;workflow;xpdl;computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;function model;document management system;process modeling;database;business process model and notation;process management;enterprise data management;business process;event-driven process chain;process mining;business process discovery;business rule;business process modeling;workflow management system;workflow engine;business activity monitoring;workflow technology	SE	-55.89595664117694	17.727301983359016	125730

In the manufacturing industry, especially at the early phase of product development, this technology has become essential for enabling designers, process planning engineers, and production personnel to work on a consistent set of product information that is primarily CAD models. This article presents a three-tier client/server structure on which a tool is built to visualize CAD-neutral formats. This tool allows users to gather CAD models from local disks, WWW servers, and others on the company's Intranet, and then assemble and display them on the local screen. Through this facility, users can modify and save a CAD model into a database so that all project participants can work on the same set of information. The tool is platform independent with superior local 3D manipulation capabilities and supports DXF, OBJ, and VRML formats.		Harvey Jiang;John P. T.

It enables the production of suitable scheduling plans, considering shared resources between several different products, through several manufacturing environments including networked ones. High levels of uncertainty characterize networked manufacturing environments. Processes have specific and complex requirements and management requisites, along with diversified objectives, which are dynamic and often conflicting. Dynamic adaptation and a real-time response for manufacturing scheduling is still possible and is critical in this new manufacturing environments, which have a flexible nature, where disturbances on working conditions occur on a continuous and even unexpected basis. Therefore, scheduling systems should have the ability of automatically and intelligently maintain a real-time adaptation and optimization of orders production, to effectively and efficiently adapt these manufacturing environments to the inherent dynamic of markets. In this paper a collaborative framework for supporting dynamic scheduling in networked manufacturing environments is proposed, based on a hyper-organization model and on hyper-heuristics, in order to obtain feasible and robust scheduling plans.	scheduling (computing)	Maria Leonilde R.

Such projects are characterized by tens of thousands of tasks, which are consequently burdensome and difficult to plan manually. This is true to the point that in many shipyards only a low level of detail is used and poor planning is generally performed. The proposed approach is called computer-aided activity planning (CAAP), and an application in the yachting industry is shown to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, the so-called outfitting planning problem is faced. The CAAP system, taking into account the available shipyard resources and the knowledge on the building rules is able to automatically define, sequence, and schedule the activities of the whole outfitting process acting as a ‘‘planning configurator’’. Moreover, it allows the industry-specific knowledge to be stored, maintained and shared within the (extended) organization. Owing to these ‘‘building blocks’’, plans can be defined accurately and in a shorter time starting from pre-defined templates, with particular impact on lead times whenever variations to complex projects are needed. Finally, to verify the actual capabilities of the approach, the CAAP was implemented within a prototypical software called NautiCAAP. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, organizations, and especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), are often reluctant to invest in DES projects. The lack of flexibility, high cost of developing and maintaining DES models, the high volume of data that these need in order to provide valid results and the difficulty in embedding them in real time problems, are some of the problems that deter organizations from adopting DES based solutions. DREAM is an FP7 project with the aim to develop an Open Source (OS) platform, which will confront the above issues. The DREAM architecture consists of three cloud enabled modules, a semantic free Simulation Engine (SE), a Knowledge Extraction (KE) tool and a customizable web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI). We present how these components cooperate and how an advanced user can manipulate them to develop tailored solutions for companies.	graphical user interface;knowledge engineering;open-source software;operating system;operations research;real-time computing;simulation;web application	Cathal Heavey;Georgios Dagkakis;Panagiotis Barlas;Ioannis Papagiannopoulos;Sebastian Robin;Marco Mariani;Jerome Perrin	2014	Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference 2014		simulation;computer science;engineering;database;world wide web	Embedded	-54.05493798002747	12.875854012227975	126867

These efforts have resulted in limited success, due to the fact that it lacks a systematic approach and platform in deploying the right prognostics tools for the right applications. This paper introduces a methodology for designing a reconfigurable prognostics platform (RPP) which can be easily and effectively used to assess and predict the performance of machine tools. RPP can be installed on the equipment and it has the prognostic capabilities to convert the data into performance-related information. The equipment performance information can then be integrated into the enterprise asset management system for maintenance decision making through the Internet. Two industrial cases are used to validate the effectiveness of applying the RPP for different prognostic applications as well as the reconfigurable capabilities of the proposed RPP. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Italian government has started a project to define the risk map of Italian cultural heritage (MARIS). Starting from this real example we describe an example of cooperative and mobile information system devoted to acquire data about cultural heritages in an electronic way through a set of cooperative processes. In this paper we show features of such information system and we analyze in a critical way the main challenges that both information system and middleware designers have to face in order to realize the example we show. Moreover we present an attempt to characterize the elaboration capability of devices of an information system, by means of a dynamic definition, with the goal to evaluate which processes can be hosted in devices within a distributed and mobile environment.	business process;computer-aided software engineering;data acquisition;emitter-coupled logic;information system;middleware	Andrea Maurino;Stefano Modafferi	2003		10.1109/WISEW.2003.1286804	risk analysis;computer science;knowledge management;cultural heritage;operating system;middleware;database;mobile computing;world wide web;information system	ML	-48.61312687748312	12.60699701579557	127566

Since each partner has its own internal processes with different control flow structures and message interfaces, the real challenge lies in verifying the correctness of process collaboration, and reconciling conflicts in an automated manner to make collaboration successful. The purpose of business process adaptation is to mediate the communication between independent processes to overcome their mismatches and incompatibilities. The goal of this article is to develop and compare efficient approaches of optimal adapter (i.e. one that minimizes the number of messages to be adapted) creation for multiple interacting processes under both synchronous and asynchronous communication. We start with an analysis of interactions of each message pair, and show how to identify incompatible cases and their adaptation elements for both types of communication. Then, we show how to extend this analysis into more general cases involving M messages and N processes (M, N > 2). Further, we present optimal adapter creation algorithms for both scenarios based on our analysis technique. The algorithms were implemented in a Java-based prototype system, and results of two experiments are reported. We compare and discuss the insights gained about adapter creation in these two scenarios.	algorithm;asynchronous i/o;business process;control flow;correctness (computer science);e-commerce;experiment;interaction;java;prototype;seamless3d;supply chain network;verification and validation	Zhe Shan;Akhil Kumar	2012	ACM Trans.

A service license describes the terms and conditions that permit the use of and access to a service, in a machine interpretable way, which services can understand. The distribution of services spanning across organizational boundaries raises problems related to intellectual value that are less explored in service-oriented research. Being a way to manage the rights between service consumers and service providers, licenses become significant in services. As the nature of services differs significantly from traditional software and components, services prevent the direct adoption of software and component licenses. The concept of preserving certain rights of owner and presenting certain rights to consumer, addressed by service licensing, is incipient in the field of service-oriented computing. We propose a formalization of licensing clauses for an unambiguous definition of a service license. We extend the Open Digital Rights Language to implement the clauses of service licensing, in a machine interpretable way. We illustrate the concepts of service licensing based on a case study of service license compliance verification in a real world scenario.	conceptualization (information science);file spanning;service-orientation;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented infrastructure	G.

The importance of well-informed network participants has led to the concept of network participant informedness which is derived from existing theories and concepts for firm informedness. It is possible to support and develop well-informed network participants through a specialised IT-based active information provisioning service.

A major challenge is handling dynamic changes in QoS constraints of the clients and/or changes in QoS properties of the resources. This paper presents a negotiation-based adaptive view coordination approach to address such run-time changes. The three key ideas are as follows. a) A negotiation-based reasoning model for adapting view maintenance policies to meet changes in QoS needs and context constraints. b) A dynamic software architecture of the collaborating information resources supporting the client task of maintaining a specific view. c) Coordination mechanisms in the architecture that realize negotiated changes in the policies for view maintenance. The paper describes an initial prototype of the support system for the supply-chain task domain.	autonomous robot;case-based reasoning;correctness (computer science);emoticon;experiment;information management;information system;mission critical;prototype;quality of service;software architecture	Prasanta K.

Moreover, the PMF supports the documentation of the business process implementation. Main issues when migrating processes are the identification of the process environment (i.e. software packages, files, system settings) and the recreation of this environment. Existing migration tools mainly focus on entire systems or operate on a low level that is difficult to maintain. Main concepts of the PMF are the static and dynamic extraction of process information, monitoring of the process execution, and the usage of a process context model to describe the process environment. The application of the PMF will be demonstrated in the context of a civil engineering business process and an e-Science workflow. Using the PMF it is shown that maintainability, flexibility, shareability, and preservability of business processes is improved by deploying them in dedicated systems, and a comprehensive documentation about the process environment can be provided.	archive;bit-level parallelism;business process;common desktop environment;e-science;environment variable;high-level programming language;process migration;software documentation;virtual machine	Johannes Binder;Stephan Strodl;Andreas Rauber	2014	2014 IEEE 18th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops and Demonstrations	10.1109/EDOCW.2014.66	business domain;business requirements;documentation;computer science;systems engineering;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;function model;operating system;software engineering;process modeling;database;business process model and notation;process management;business process;event-driven process chain;process mining;programming language;business process discovery;business rule;business process modeling;business activity monitoring	DB	-52.12432832223047	17.572003801961866	129025

Components  supply and as well production systems and networks are too often optimized for the operation at high degrees of utilization  without explicitly supporting flexibility. Increasingly, production strategies like Build-to-Order (BtO) are applied to enhance  the flexibility of the production networks in automotive industries. Customize-to-Order (CtO) is a promising approach to avoid  the efforts for coordination and control that result out of BtO. Research and development to bring CtO to life by means of  its process and technology enablers is done in the EU-funded project ACDC. ACDC develops a highly dynamic and robust supply  loop concept, which is superior to the conventional hierarchic system in reactivity, reliability and costs while maintaining  the 100 % guarantee of delivery. For the proof-of-concept a characteristic next generation automotive modular system is being  developed, which merges different technologies, mechanics and electronics, into high quality modules to reduce part-count  and cost, i.e. first cost, cost for stocks and stocks itself, and to achieve a customer-neutral component/supply concept.

2c5a4b13426becb0b2b60d7aadb21bd89adfe441	a simulation-based approach for an effective amhs design in a legacy semiconductor manufacturing facility		This paper addresses the design of an Automated Material Handling System (AMHS) for wafer lots in the photolithography workshop of a 200mm wafer manufacturing facility (fab) that was not initially built to have such a system. Lots transportation has to be performed using an Overhead Hoist Transport (OHT) system that was already chosen to transport reticles in the workshop. The main objective is to propose a decision support tool to characterize the AMHS elements including lot handling, transportation as well as the storage space design. A simulation-based approach is proposed to evaluate different scenarios and propose an effective AMHS design. Experimental results based on real instances confirm the capability of the proposed AMHS design to support the workshop activity.	decision support system;features new to windows 8;heuristic;javascript syntax;material handling;semiconductor device fabrication;semiconductor fabrication plant;simulation;wafer (electronics)	Ali Ben-Salem;Claude Yugma;Emmanuel Troncet;Jacques Pinaton	2017	2017 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)	10.1109/WSC.2017.8248073	systems engineering;computer science;manufacturing engineering;wafer;decision support system;semiconductor device fabrication	Robotics	-59.52303072706706	8.85797046986206	129545

Universities need to co-operate and aggregate their learning resources and core competencies to reduce costs, and to be able to rapidly respond to changing conditions on an emerging international education market. It is argued that service-oriented computing offers appropriate computational constructs enabling inter-operation of today’s heterogeneous university infrastructures to agile networks of collaborating applications. For a case study about virtual mobility of students, in the sense that students can custom-design their curriculum by combining e-learning offers from different providers, a service component architecture (SCA) is proposed. SCA is a novel engineering model created by an on-going industry-led standardisation consortium aiming to facilitate the development of coarse-grained service-oriented applications. The work builds on the outcome of a European project, CUBER, in which a personalised curriculum builder was produced, but offered no possibility to execute cross-institutional study programmes based on automated processes.	aggregate data;agile software development;application domain;component-based software engineering;federated identity;firewall (computing);gene regulatory network;interaction;interoperability;legacy system;loose coupling;null function;service component architecture;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented infrastructure;service-oriented software engineering;web service;while;xml	Bernd J.

One way of performing biometric computer authentication is to use behavioral tendencies associated with how a user interacts with the computer. However, behavioral biometric authentication accuracy rates are worse than more traditional authentication methods. This article presents a behavioral biometric system that fuses user data from keyboard, mouse, and Graphical User Interface (GUI) interactions. Combining the modalities results in a more accurate authentication decision based on a broader view of the user’s computer activity while requiring less user interaction to train the system than previous work. Testing over 31 users shows that fusion techniques significantly improve behavioral biometric authentication accuracy over single modalities on their own. Between the two fusion techniques presented, feature fusion and an ensemble based classification method, the ensemble method performs the best with a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 2.10% and a False Rejection Rate (FRR) 2.24%.	authentication;biometrics;common access card;graphical user interface;interaction;modal logic;password;rejection sampling	Kyle O.

62af703679ed651730d4c77381418f3b2b8aaed8	a method for identifying unobvious requirements in globally distributed software projects		We present a method and an assisting toolset to identify unobvious requirements in globally distributed projects. We demonstrate use of social software principles and technologies in distributed and collaborative requirements elicitation with a purpose to detect unobvious requirements. In our experience, stakeholders are rarely clear on their requirements. During requirements elicitation workshops (that involve face-to-face communications), they are not able to visualize all the pertinent scenarios. They can typically articulate ‘first-order’ scenarios resulting out of direct interactions (among stakeholders and between stakeholders and proposed systems), but they find ‘second-order’ scenarios that result out of multiple stimuli hard to detect a-priori. We refer to such ‘hard to detect’ requirements as the ‘unobvious’ ones. In globally distributed situations, this challenge becomes even more pronounced due to lack of frequent and informal communications that allow iterative refinements of stakeholder inputs. We describe an approach that addresses this problem. Our approach includes identification of representative roles and construction of method chunks that include a step-by-step guidance for roles to practice the method chunks relevant to them. Towards this purpose, we have developed a web 2.0 based toolset that presents the method chunks to appropriate roles, synchronizes activities performed by the roles by providing relevant notifications and automates some of the activities recommended in the method. Web2.0 has been chosen as a platform to deliver our method in the light of architecture of participation that it offers. The identification of unobvious requirements has been demonstrated through the results of a case study in Insurance domain.	acceptance testing;context-sensitive help;distributed computing;experiment;folksonomy;interaction;iterative method;ontology (information science);real life;relevance;requirement;requirements elicitation;semantic web;web 2.0	Smita Ghaisas	2009			systems engineering;engineering	SE	-62.35388165244262	17.233962011427575	130496

For this purpose, we have reviewed the most relevant contributions in this field over the last 10 years have been considered. After analyzing these research contributions, we defined a scenario composed by a number of punctual but relevant contributions and a number of methodological approaches coping with the requirements definitions for such systems. Finally, on the basis of this scenario, a Wish List of desirable features of a hypothetical approach has been defined and compared against the current situation.

While the number of VL studies are rising, possible interactions between these VLs have not been studied yet. The aim of this study is to create a framework in order to gather all VLs in a common base by building interactions between VLs via a multi-agent system (MAS) approach. Cloud-Based Integrated Virtual Laboratories (CIVIL) model has been proposed as a conceptual framework of collaborative networks of a cloud system with the help of MAS. The boundaries of the integrated problem are determined and schematized within the scope of conceptual modeling.

With so many components we need a reliable system that detects the possible changes in the system and alerts the engineering team. In this paper we describe the mechanism that we invented for recovering the representative metrics and detecting the change in their behavior. We show that this mechanism is able to detect the possible problems in time by describing some incident cases.	anomaly detection;computation;impression (online media);online advertising;real-time bidding;sensor	Bowen Zhou;Shahriar Shariat	2016	CoRR		simulation;artificial intelligence;internet privacy	ML	-50.82041577931263	4.523574926937934	130949

But it is a challenge to develop such large-scale collaborative application using traditional method starting from scratch, since many application collaboration technologies should be solved, such as application collaboration relationship management and customization, collaboration application execution scheduling, and so on. Cloud and PaaS (Platform as a Service) service model provide a new opportunity for this problem solution. So, a method of trading process construction based on PaaS (Platform as a Service) platform supporting applications collaboration is proposed. Both ISV and ecommerce operator can construct collaborative applications easily. This method contains two aspects: one is the application collaboration semantic meta-model, the other is the method of trading process construction. The application collaboration semantic meta-model is used to be a container in e-commerce PaaS to specify each kind of E-commerce application attributes and relationships between one application and the others. Based on the application collaboration semantic meta-model, PaaS platform can automatically construct a whole customized e-commerce collaboration application according to e-commerce operators' requirements. This method is based on HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planning theory. In the end, through cases analysis, the proposed PaaS platform and method is proved to construct a variety of collaboration applications easily based on the application collaboration semantic meta-model.	cloud computing;customer relationship management;e-commerce payment system;electronic billing;hierarchical task network;hierarchical temporal memory;independent software vendor;logistics;metamodeling;platform as a service;portals;requirement;scheduling (computing);software as a service	Zongshui Xiao;Wenbin Zhang;Qingzhong Li;Lei Liu;Li-zhen Cui	2015	2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on e-Business Engineering	10.1109/ICEBE.2015.45	planning;logistics;cloud computing;computer science;knowledge management;database;semantics;management;world wide web;collaboration	Robotics	-50.64032958416672	12.76665083031831	131373

This program is an industry-led, international R&D program, established in 1995, to develop the next generation of manufacturing and processing technologies. Recognizing that these technologies will be expensive to produce, and that no single firm has all the expertise needed, companies and research institutions from Australia, Canada, the European Union (EU), Japan, Switzerland, and the United States have undertaken cooperative technology development to share costs, risks, and expertise. Over 250 companies and over 200 research institutions are currently active across an array of almost 20 active IMS projects. Due to the fact that each geographical region funds its own IMS research, the same project has different names in different regions. This article deals with the first project in construction automation and robotics. The EU part of the project is called FutureHome, and the Japanese part is designated IF7. The FutureHome-IF7 project consortium is formed by leading construction companies and R&D centers from the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Japan. This article presents the main results of the FutureHome project (1998-2001) in the area of modular house building, with an emphasis on the design and assembly stages. The main objective of the FutureHome project is the development of an integrated construction automation (ICA) concept and associated technologies during all stages of the house-building construction process, from architect’s desk to site robots, including modular design of buildings, keeping in mind their robotic erection automatic planning and realtime replanning of the offsite prefabrication, transportation, and onsite assembly onsite automatic and robotic transportation, manipulation, and assembly of the buildings’ prefabricated parts. Today, house-building methods are based on manual techniques that are slow, expensive, and noncoordinated. Each building continues to be unique in architecture and construction sense. Even though the investigation to develop new construction techniques has been important during the past years [3]-[5], there is still a long distance between the construction industry and other industries, such as the automobile industry. It is difficult to imagine houses being produced in the same manner as cars, but, at the same time, it is not possible to construct houses as was done 80 years ago [6].	assembly language;automation;control theory;global variable;independent computing architecture;modular design;next-generation network;robot;robotics;switzerland;xfig	Carlos Balaguer;Mohamed Abderrahim;Jose M.

The standardization of device-level network technology, and the gradual appearance of network capable welding devices, means that users and integrators are facing the challenge of using networks for the first time, or of choosing one among multiple kinds of networks. A survey of network technologies currently being used for welding products is presented. Two formal welding standards efforts, one by the American Welding Society (AWS) A9 Committee and one by the Open DeviceNet Vendor Association (ODVA), are described. An effort by the Robotics Industries Association (RIA) in sponsoring general purpose network standards for robots is described. Examples of non-standard uses of device-level networks in welding products are given. The AWS A9 committee can gather experts to express the needs of vendors, integrators, and users, and if appropriate develop standards that will reduce the number of diverging choices to be made. This paper should be useful to users and integrators of weld cells to evaluate the different network technologies available for implementing welding systems. It may also help device developers make decisions about which technology to adopt, or it may suggest new welding areas where networks can be employed. The goal of standards efforts is to make a common communications solution available for new products and new systems, allowing vendors to provide compatible component products to integrate. Standards can also ease the burden of system developers who currently spend significant effort designing custom protocols or point-topoint interfaces.	amazon web services;american and british english spelling differences;devicenet;point-to-point construction;rich internet application;robot welding;robotics;semiconductor industry	William G.

Process knowledge concerns both the type of activities chosen to fulfil a certain goal and the skills and experience of users in executing specific tasks. This knowledge is exploited by recommendation tools to support the design and enactment of current and future process instances. Design/methodology/approach – The literature about traditional BPM is analysed to highlight the limitations of traditional BPM regarding management of ad hoc and semi-structured processes. Having identified this gap, an innovative BPM framework based on social tagging is proposed to address these limitations. This model is exemplified in a real case scenario and evaluated through the implementation of a prototype and a case study in real world non-profit organisation.

d96725c2a2b91ad8fb64f4e2705d547b9def4139	service networks modelling: an soa & bpm standpoint		Services are quintessential in the current economical landscape. Enterprises and businesses at large rely on the consumption and providing of services to ensure their operations and to realize their business offers. That is, nowadays businesses all over the world are interconnected with each other by complex service-centric webs called service networks. The ubiquity and pervasiveness of service networks call for models, methods, mechanisms and tools to understand them and harness their potential. This paper investigates the modelling of the service networks with a focus on business relationships and exchanges of software services among the involved parties. The contribution of this work is threefold. Firstly, we provide an overview of what service networks modelling can offer in combination with Business Process Management (BPM) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technologies. Secondly, we propose a formalism to model service networks that depicts them as aggregations of participants – e.g. enterprises or individuals – that offer, request, consume and provide services to each other. With the goal of providing a foundation for the alignment between service networkand business process models, we finally map the constructs of our service networks modelling formalism to the ones of the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN).	beam propagation method;business process model and notation;change management (engineering);cube;digital media;mathematical optimization;process modeling;relevance;semantics (computer science);service-oriented architecture;stemming	Olha Danylevych;Dimka Karastoyanova;Frank Leymann	2010	J.

Tools are required to be integrated and not intrusive with respect to users’ activities, in order to provide effective support to workers for the development of joint projects. In this paper we present the enhancement of a knowledge-based collaborative system by means of a Semantic Wiki, which is a wiki exploiting ontologies to create machine-processable annotation of documents. Moreover, we present a simple tool to edit personal ontologies, that can be shared with other team or organization members.	knowledge management;ontology (information science);spontaneous order;wiki	Flavio De Paoli;Marco Loregian	2007			personal wiki;knowledge management;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-49.889328413958964	12.880384674556414	132971

And though the need for well-established engineering approaches for building and evaluating  such intelligent systems has emerged, currently no widely accepted methodology exists, mainly due to lack of consensus on  relevant definitions and scope of applicability. Even existing well-tested evaluation methodologies applied in traditional  software engineering, prove inadequate to address the unpredictable emerging factors of the behavior of intelligent components.  The following chapter aims to present such a unified and integrated methodology for a specific category of MAS. It takes all  constraints and issues into account and denotes the way knowledge extracted with the use of Data mining (DM) techniques can  be used for the formulation initially, and the improvement, in the long run, of agent reasoning and MAS performance. The coupling  of DM and Agent Technology (AT) principles, proposed within the context of this chapter is therefore expected to provide to  the reader an efficient gateway for developing and evaluating highly reconfigurable software approaches that incorporate domain  knowledge and provide sophisticated Decision Making capabilities. The main objectives of this chapter could be summarized  into the following: a) introduce Agent Technology (AT) as a successful paradigm for building Data Mining (DM)-enriched applications,  b) provide a methodology for (re)evaluating the performance of such DM-enriched Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), c) Introduce Agent  Academy II, an Agent-Oriented Software Engineering framework for building MAS that incorporate knowledge model extracted by  the use of (classical and novel) DM techniques and d) denote the benefits of the proposed approach through a real-world demonstrator.  This chapter provides a link between DM and AT and explains how these technologies can efficiently cooperate with each other.  The exploitation of useful knowledge extracted by the use of DM may considerably improve agent infrastructures, while also  increasing reusability and minimizing customization costs. The synergy between DM and AT is ultimately expected to provide  MAS with higher levels of autonomy, adaptability and accuracy and, hence, intelligence.  	data mining	Christos Dimou;Andreas L.

It particularly, focuses on workflow processes of organizations where actors are organized by teams. In such a system, participants must interact with each other, coordinate, exchange informations, cooperate and synchronize their work. To do that, it is essential to define firstly, the way of dispatching individual and collective parts of work to all participants in the system. We describe some static and dynamic aspects of the system and we propose a simple algorithm for managing human resources at the runtime of the process. The algorithm aims to balance the workload between human actors in the system, it is based on a workload criteria computed according to the activities durations.	algorithm;blocking (computing);collective intelligence;load balancing (computing);metamodeling;scheduling (computing);visual artifact	Saïda Boukhedouma;Zaia Alimazighi	2008			knowledge management;workload;xpdl;workflow management system;computer science;workflow engine;simple algorithm;workflow technology;workflow;human resources	HCI	-52.416990170893904	14.71483500606953	133244

Thus, there is a need for an integrated, adaptive, flexible enterprise information architecture that enforces knowledge sharing and meta-knowledge management in an organisation. This study proposes an enterprise information architecture model for business and technology framework that includes a meta-knowledge-modelling level to enable knowledge sharing besides data and information sharing through organisational information systems. Further, the model is illustrated through two applications of meta-knowledge management systems through the use of object-oriented paradigm.	enterprise architecture;information architecture;knowledge management	Rashmi Malhotra	2010	IJDATS	10.1504/IJDATS.2010.037475	enterprise architecture framework;information technology architecture;enterprise systems engineering;decision support system;nist enterprise architecture model;information governance;computer science;knowledge management;architecture domain;applications architecture;enterprise architecture management;data mining;solution architecture;enterprise architecture;information management;view model;information architecture;information system;enterprise information security architecture;enterprise information system;data architecture;business architecture;enterprise life cycle	DB	-58.2583109079902	15.289849449428702	133282

d6e7e550ba03eb0523dcd7bc1c724c392cada06c	an innovative framework of collaborative-based workflow in development chain management	collaboration;workflow;product development	Currently, most product development procedures have been characterized as unnecessarily complicated. To maintain a competitive edge and to simplify the procedures, joint efforts from different functional groups play such crucial role. Specifically, information from marketing, sales, engineering, sourcing, and manufacturing should be cross-referenced. In addition, adopting pre-defined workflows contributes to efficient collection of distributed information. Moreover, unlike traditional workflow, a collaborative-based workflow (CWF) in product development process boasts of complicated workflow forms with manifold views for a workflow execution. Traditional workflow solutions, for instance, can only transmit a workflow form through different actors. Such workflow solutions merely offer modeling approval-based workflow (AWF), such as drawing reviews or absence applications. This paper illustrates the framework of CWF solution and proposes its application in the model workflow of a distributed product development system. This framework includes four interrelated modules. They are KM4, AS API, SmartForm, and Workflow Engine. In addition, four visual assistant modeling tools are introduced and they are Data Designer, AppDefinition, Layout Designer, and CWF Builder. To fulfill the varied business requirements, Data Designer, AppDefinition, and Layout Designer attempt to achieve a dynamic and efficient construction of complicated workflow forms in collaborative workflow solution. Other workflow-related setups, such as defining status diagrams, correspondence persons, and applicatory workflow forms, are accomplished in CWF Builder. The major contribution of this paper lies in the proposing of a framework for CWF and in the introducing of visual tools for CWF modeling. Compared to the traditional hard-coding method, the construction time for CWF system can be reduced significantly with the assistance of modeling tool. Time reduction on developing information systems, in this regard, is a very important issue for most modern industries. The concept in this paper can direct a global enterprise to efficiently construct workflow management system for global collaboration.

Redesigning business processes is an effective way for improvement. However, business process mapping and analysis in healthcare environment has become a complex task. Besides, most healthcare professionals often resist change. To deal with these obstacles, a design pattern useful for modelling and simulation is suggested in this paper. For deriving patterns in this study, current problems focusing on hospital pharmacy management are initially identified through empirical investigation. Then the suitable solutions can be determined based on the literature review. The design pattern is represented through various attributes including pattern name, purpose, description, modelling structure using a modelling language. In addition, more attributes related to simulation modelling are also combined such as control variables and performance measures. Process modellers can rapidly understand the context of problems through design patterns. The proposed patterns can be reused to create a new model and conduct a successful simulation study. This approach can be a valuable tool to redesign healthcare systems.	business process;control variable (programming);modeling language;simulation;software design pattern	Wirachchaya Chanpuypetch;Duangpun Kritchanchai	2017		10.7148/2017-0222	hospital pharmacy;emergency medicine;design pattern;medicine	SE	-61.262300585243565	17.075629625942092	134261

The orientation on the technical content of a reference model can increase the efficiency of processes in business engineering projects. Despite this, the use of reference models in the field of business engineering has not established itself in practice. This is due to the particular field of conflict between research and practice, in which reference modeling is at home. Thus, there is still a deficit in knowledge about the use and problems inherent in the implementation of reference models despite the array of theoretical concepts. Accordingly, in the past years the supply-sided development of reference models predominant in the science world has distanced itself from their demand-sided use in business and administration. The article at hand analyses this problem and presents an integrative approach to the computer-aided management of reference models. The task to be mastered using the proposed approach will be conceptually concretized with an framework and prototypically implemented in the form of a reference model management system.	business engineering;design rationale;information model;information system;modeling language;prototype;reference model	Oliver Thomas;August-Wilhelm Scheer	2006	Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)	10.1109/HICSS.2006.489	process design;reference model;information model;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;software engineering;knowledge engineering;management system;prototype;management science;context model;management;business process modeling;information system	SE	-61.53287785982247	14.245314943394943	134412

Without a coordinator, manager or a facilitator, potential conflicts may become obstacles during runtime. In addition, a lack of an efficiently coordinated communication would result in the duplication of efforts. Without a well-coordination mechanism, it will be chaotic to involve different functional agents in a Multi-Agent Manufacturing System (MAMS). The operations of multiple agents need to be coordinated because of the inter-dependency that exists between the actions of these agents and the need to resolve run-time conflicts that may occur during evaluation or negotiation. Hence, an efficient coordination mechanism is crucial for a distributed manufacturing system for performing activities in a shared environment. In this paper, a centralised coordination method for manufacturing services based on priorities and conflict resolution is presented, and a coordinated system to resolve conflicts during runtime has also been developed.	multi-agent system	M.

In a large-scaled VE environment, system modules represent independent business units  with conflicting and competing resource requirements, and may possess localised information relevant to their tasks. To recognise  this independence, we treat the modules as agents, ascribing each of them autonomy to decide how to deploy resources under  their control in service of their interests. To explore the use of market mechanism for the coordination of distributed planning  module in VE circumstances, we have developed a prototype environment for specifying and simulating computational markets  with multi-commodity situations. It has been confirmed that the proposed algorithm successfully calculates Pareto optimal  solutions in the VE resource problem by comparing an analytic approach.

The conceptual development of a Management Information System to support decision making on construction projects across all management levels within the owner and the contractor organizations is introduced. The system is designed as a distributed information and service platform. The backbone of the system is a layered ontology framework. Along with the information system, a novel approach to process and multi-model driven construction management is developed that allows for sharing distributed, yet interrelated, engineering and management application models in so called multi-models. A major challenge of the system is the management of the information and model logistics as well as the interdependencies among the application models. In order to support the retrieval of information from different project phases, domains and organizations and their combination in coherent multimodels, an ontology framework is developed. It defines the overall information space of the application models describing the application models content and their links in multi-models as well as the collaboration processes within the virtual organization of the project. The proposed system represents a paradigm shift. The information space is no longer productmodel-centric. Central to the model-based information space is the process model that interrelates application model views contained in multi-models required for specific planning, production and analysis tasks. The activities are considered the enabler to semi-automatically combine dedicated information pieces of existing application models in new multi-models. Therefore we have identified the instantiation of activities and their combination to valid process chains to be the bottleneck to make the process and multi-model driven construction management efficient. As a consequence, we develop a new process and multi-model generation method, which is based on process modules formalized in description logics. The process modules combine distinct methods of Reference Process Modelling and Business Process Objects. In the generated processes, related application models, and populated multi-models are hierarchically structured (1) to support the utilization of project information by different actors of the hierarchical project organization and (2) to handle engineering and management knowledge and decisions piecewise during process generation in accordance to the hierarchy levels of the involved decision makers, thereby reducing the overall complexity of decision making. The paper discusses: (1) the main components of the system for interlinking and sharing models and information, (2) the ontology-based multi-model framework and the basics for the hierarchical structuring of the models, and (3) the generation of integrated process models. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The framework focuses on multiperspective semantics, qualitative and artifactual spatial abstractions, and industrial conformance and interoperability within the context of the industry foundation classes. The framework provides qualitative and cognitively adequate representational mechanisms, and the formal interpretation of the structural form of indoor spaces that are not directly provided by conventional computer-aided design based or quantitative models of space. We illustrate the manner in which these representations directly provide the spatial abstractions that are needed to enable the implementation of intelligent analytical capabilities in design assistance tools. We introduce the framework, and also provide detailed use cases that illustrate the usability of the framework and the manner of its utilization within architectural design assistance systems.	data access;multimodal interaction	Carl P.

The reference architecture of SOA system is usually layered: business process layer, service layer, and computing resource layer. In the architecture, there are so many subsystems to affect system performance, moreover they relate with each other. As a result, in the respect of overall performance, it is usually meaningless to measure each subsystem’s performance separately. In SOA system, the performance of the business process layer with which users keep in contact depends on the summation of the performance of the other lower layers. Therefore, measuring performance of the business layer includes indirect measurement of the other SOA system layers. We devised a business-centric SOA test framework in which activities and control primitives in business process managers are simulated to invoke commands or services in a test scenario. That is, in the test framework, a real business process scenario can be replaced to a mimicked business process test scenario, which is executed in a test proxy based on event mechanism. In this paper, we present the concept of BPA (Business Process Activity) simulation, 2-layered test suites model, and reference architecture.	business logic;business process;executable;oracle bpa suite;reference architecture;scenario testing;service layer;service-oriented architecture;simulation;test automation;test case;test suite	Youngkon Lee	2009	2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC	10.1109/NCM.2009.338	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;artifact-centric business process model;operating system;service-oriented architecture;process control;database;business process modeling;oasis soa reference model	SE	-52.35380186680544	16.458711953993312	136770

As well as the enterprises in any other kinds of industries, business process management (BPM) can be a source of core competency for the enterprises in KIBS industry. However, most of the business processes in KIBS are human processes which are collaborative, innovative, and dynamic, which cannot be supported well by current BPM technologies. Human interaction management (HIM) has emerged as an alternative theory to deal with human processes in KIBS. But, the current ways of process modeling and management in HIM have a problem of complexity, especially in terms of realizing its principle of 'supportive activity management'. This research adopts fact-oriented ontological approach to address this problem. Based on fact-oriented approach, human-friendly condition modeling and state management during supportive activity management can be achieved.	process modeling	Jeongsoo Lee;Janghyeok Yoon;Wonchul Seo;Kwangsoo Kim;Cheol-Han Kim	2011	Expert Syst.

Given the increasing significance of business modelling in IS development, patterns have the potential of providing a viable solution for promoting reusability of recurrent generalized models in the very early stages of development. As a statement of researchin-progress this paper focuses on business process patterns and proposes an initial methodological framework for the discovery and reuse of business process patterns within the IS development lifecycle. The framework borrows ideas from the domain engineering literature and proposes the use of semantics to drive both the discovery of patterns as well as their reuse.	business process;domain engineering;information system;process patterns	Laden Aldin;Sergio de Cesare;Mark Lycett	2009			business domain;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;data mining;business process model and notation;process management;business process;business process discovery;business rule;business process modeling;business activity monitoring	SE	-59.549163004569735	17.237456070273815	137926

This paper proposed a hierarchical colored Petri net (HCPN) for modeling the industrial design collaborative system workflow, which aims to provide a valid workflow model for the process management of the industrial design collaborative system. First, it is built the top-level workflow CPN model from product planning, markets research, product design, and product evaluation to prototype production, then the model is extended layer by layer to build the subnet model by the model refinement method. In the model, the activity of the workflow and the activity execution results are represented by the transitions (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$T$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and places (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$S$ </tex-math></inline-formula>), respectively. The running state of the whole workflow is represented by the distribution of the token in the places. The token’ color sets expresses the real-time discrete state. By use of the function of token coloring places (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$S$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and the token’ color sets of HCPN, this paper extracts the common characteristics of process knowledge, including markets research results, design ideas, conceptual sketches, design schemes, human resources, and tacit creative knowledge, then uses the what, when, where, who, and how method to build knowledge information units for specific design event. Thus, realizes the industrial design process knowledge base construction and knowledge acquisition, which provides the necessary information and knowledge resources for the design reuse, flexibility management, and intelligent manufacturing of subsequent products."""	coloured petri net;graph coloring;industry 4.0;knowledge acquisition;knowledge base;personalization;prototype;real-time clock;refinement (computing);subnetwork	Shuxing Du;Peng Wu;Guoying Wu;Chensong Yao;Likun Zhang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2809439	task analysis;systems engineering;knowledge base;petri net;computer science;standardization;distributed computing;knowledge acquisition;product design;workflow;product planning	EDA	-61.20680726156763	12.603960432454993	138202

As business processes, we consider data-intensive applications which need to move huge data files from server to server. By using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) in our application, we enable clearly and hierarchically represented business processes. Such modeled processes can automatically be executed in a distributed environment with the Jadex open source middleware. Furthermore, the process execution is monitored with declarative rules, also implemented with Jadex. The demonstration shows the start of BPMNmodeled processes and their execution monitoring through logs and rules.	business process model and notation;data-intensive computing;middleware;open-source software;server (computing)	Lothar Hotz;Stephanie von Riegen;Alexander Pokahr;Lars Braubach;Torsten Schwinghammer	2012			business process model and notation;business process;database;middleware;distributed computing environment;computer science;data file	SE	-52.12596658794935	17.334017068156456	138303

Large-scale software development efforts often involve a wide variety of complex interactions between the various designers and stakeholders. Capturing these main activities allows us to trace back major decisions made throughout the activity and determine the motivations for those decisions. Moreover, the resulting model may be used to investigate the effects of small changes in the requirements or options and conduct sensitivity analysis. In addition, our approach includes logic engines and knowledge bases that can run interactively during the design process and assist the designers by providing them with the appropriate information.

A three-schema-architecture for design of servicebase-management-systems according to the ANSI/SPARC-model for database design is proposed in this paper. The conceptual schema of the proposed architecture decribes the servicebase, what provides a consistent overview and simplifies the localization of services. The external schema is used to provide a consistent access to the servicebase by customers. The internal schema provides the concept of independence of implementation and execution of services. The architecture aims at offering a platform where service-vendors and servicecustomers have the chance to trade services with access and usage independence as well as implementation and execution independence based on a comprehensive and clear conception and architecture.	conceptual schema;database design;holism;sparc;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;three-schema approach	Matthias Fischer;Marco Link;Erich Ortner;Nicole Zeise	2010			element management system;systems management;program management;information technology infrastructure library;service product management;data management;computerized maintenance management system;risk management information systems;network management application;information management;application lifecycle management;management process;incident management	DB	-58.631783205715266	14.585745530550398	139546
bbbec53cd2fa75420e8b5318e14ff72510cadd3a	viable systems model based information flows		In information systems engineering it is important to ensure that all essential information flows are properly identified and supported. Usually the set of relevant information flows is detected using such knowledge acquisition techniques as interviews and document analysis. Since nowadays flexibility, adaptability, and agility are important features of enterprises for their operational strength in a highly turbulent environment, the research question arises whether there is a generic set of requirements that have to be met by information systems to obtain and sustain above mentioned enterprise features. To answer this question, Viable Systems Model (VSM) is experimentally used as a basis for identification of a set of information flows, which should be present in VSM complying enterprises. Specific constructs presented in the enterprise architecture description language are proposed for consistent integration of detected flows into enterprise information systems.	viable system model	Marite Kirikova;Mara Pudane	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-01863-8_11	systems engineering;viable system model;computer science	Robotics	-60.26212158185632	16.936235934945163	139635

In particular, data centers are now playing a much more important role in the modern society, where the information is available all the time and everywhere. In this context, the aim of this paper is to study energy efficiency issues within data centers from the Information System perspective. The proposed approach integrates the application and infrastructure capabilities, in which the enactment of adaptation mechanisms is aligned with the business process. Based on both energy and quality dimensions of service-based applications, a model-based approach supports the formulation of new constrained optimization problem that takes into consideration over-constrained solutions where the goal is to obtain the better trade-off between energy and quality requirements. These ideas are combined within a framework where time-based analysis allow the identification of potential system threats and drive the selection of adaptation actions improving overall energy and quality requirements, represented by indicators satisfaction. In addition, the framework includes an evolution mechanism that is able to evaluate past decisions feedback in order to adjust the model according to the current underlying environment. Finally, the benefits of the approach are analyzed in an experimental setting.	business process;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);data center;feedback;information system;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;requirement;threat (computer)	Alexandre Mello Ferreira;Barbara Pernici	2014	Computing	10.1007/s00607-014-0405-x	green computing;simulation;knowledge management;management science	Web+IR	-52.74962264918888	8.95462010311886	139826

In the news provider problem, a system continuously generates service instances (e.g.the news of a online newspaper) which should meet the requirements of a market of readers/agents which are supposed unknown. The only way for the system to know the evaluation of a service instance, i.e. a newspaper instance, is the feedback obtained after delivering it to the reader. In a dynamical environment the domain of the service offered is changing and the readers/agents are changing their preferences over the time. The proposed algorithm for newpapers production employs typical genetic operators in order to optimize the product delivered and to adapt it to the environment feedback and domain evolution.

This data is a national asset. In this study, we elaborate on this emerging open government movement, together with the underlying data transparency to drive novel business models which utilize these assets under a functioning platform called Open Government Data as a Service (GoDaaS). These business models actively engage civic-minded programmers in developing sustainable applications, contextualizing and utilizing the government open data resources. This leads to an expansive government marketplace, with many civic-minded developers might be new to doing business with the federal or state government. By means of a consultation service prototype, we provide development advices for programmers on how to work out the specific details of their applications business model. Having the business models in focus, this study also proposes a novel abstraction unit called Gov.

However, it has been found that the current traditional phase-based approach towards the development of SOA-based applications, contrarily, lacks agility, which mitigates against the needed ability to quickly respond to changes in business processes. Therefore, here, we suggest an agile approach to implement a flexible SOA. This paper, based on our industrial experience and case studies, presents the agile service-oriented process (ASOP) that had been constructed by using the agile software solution framework (ASSF), agile toolkit (ATK), situational method engineering (SME) and agile adoption and improvement model (AAIM) for the development of one of our industry (case study) service-oriented e-health project.	agile software development;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture	Asif Gill;Brian Henderson-Sellers	2007			method engineering;agile unified process;agile usability engineering;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;software engineering;service-oriented architecture;agile software development;empirical process	Robotics	-58.687118312020566	18.101722160965394	141011

Previously, some definitions about collaborative and concurrent engineering and present concepts like extended and/or virtual enterprise, digital mock-up, virtual prototype and virtual factory are reviewed. The product data model as a key element for the product development process is analyzed. The different views of this model are placed according to the fields where they apply. The importance of product model quality in the current status of data exchange standards is highlighted, with particular attention to ISO 10303 (STEP) new developments. Current state-of-art on data quality models, and product data quality recommendations such as VDA 4955/2 and SASIG PDQ, are also revised. Finally, our own product data quality model is presented. This comprises three points of view or levels: morphological, syntactic and semantic. Hence, it provides a tool for a better understanding of product data quality that helps find solutions that avoid the interoperability problem. Throughout the paper, references to the automotive industry will be used to illustrate concepts. Front-page photo: The left image represents an automotive radiator model simplified for FEM analysis.

While the latter only combines the data production and data analysis phases, DOP8 also integrates the analysis operators life cycle. In this cycle, data life cycle and operators life cycle processing meet in the data analysis step. This paper also presents a reification of DOP8 in a new computing platform: UnderTracks. The latter provides a flexibility on storing and sharing data, operators and analysis processes. Undertracks is compared with three types of platform 'Storage platform', 'Analysis platform' and 'Storage and Analysis platform'. Several real TEL analysis scenarios are present into the platform, (1) to test Undertracks flexibility on storing data and operators and (2) to test Undertracks flexibility on designing analysis processes.	data mining;reification (knowledge representation);the european library	Nadine Mandran;Michael Ortega-Binderberger;Vanda Luengo;Denis Bouhineau	2015		10.1145/2723576.2723580	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;operations management	HPC	-56.17921077768345	14.059874927414361	141047

However, the establishment of an adaptive enterprise architecture capability requires defining the enterprise context before actually commissioning any enterprise architecture or adaptation work. This paper presents the adaptive enterprise service system (AESS) model based on the “Design Science” research method and “Theory Triangulation” approach. The AESS integrates the enterprise context perspectives from three well-known theories of agility, (agent) system, and service science. The AESS model, as a part of the large adaptive enterprise architecture toolkit, defines a modern enterprise as an adaptive enterprise service system. The adaptive enterprise service system is a multi-agent system of service systems that exhibits agility and focuses on the emerging service-centric view as opposed to a traditional product-centric view. The service-centric view of an enterprise is critical for establishing the adaptive enterprise architecture capability for handling complex enterprise transformations.	enterprise architecture;enterprise integration;multi-agent system;theory	Asif Gill	2013			enterprise architecture framework;functional software architecture;enterprise systems engineering;enterprise software;nist enterprise architecture model;enterprise modelling;systems engineering;knowledge management;architecture domain;operations management;integrated enterprise modeling;enterprise architecture management;service;solution architecture;enterprise architecture;business;enterprise integration;view model;purdue enterprise reference architecture;enterprise planning system;enterprise information security architecture;enterprise information system;business architecture;enterprise life cycle	OS	-58.68525618154123	16.936823814379142	141563

The most deployed systems are Product Data Management tools. By deploying such systems they try to formalize complex behaviour of the company. But PLM systems did not solve complexity and new gaps must be managed. At this point, it may be interesting to investigate new ways to overpass the new complexity gap. On another hand Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and every other Visualization and Interaction technologies are investigating more intuitive modality to interact with information, but these technologies remain quite unused for PDM applications. This paper proposes the Model Driven Engineering horizontal transformation approach to provide a systematic way to explore Virtual Reality opportunities within the PDM scope.	experiment;model-driven engineering	Frédéric Noël;Mohd Azwan Azli	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-41501-2_57	simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	DB	-58.828347912733015	13.633293163431988	141801

These include a comparison between the Management Information Base (MIB) for management systems and the Directory Information Base (DIB) for the Directory services, a specification of how certain management information is incorporated into the underlying data model of the Directory and an information exchange model for ensuring information accessibility to management activities. Some interesting beriefits can be realized through integrating the X.500 Directory into management systems.

Traditional mass production approaches cannot meet market demands for speed, cost, and quality, but most importantly the added customer requirement for additional flexibility in product offerings. At the same time, research in solid modeling techniques conducted during the last two decades has provided a new technology generation in Computer-Aided-Design (CAD). This technology generation, commonly referred to as the “third-generation” is characterized as parametric CAD. Solid models can be created in such a way that the model creation operations can be re-executed with new values for the defining parameters of the associated geometric features. This allows updating of the solid model to new customizable configurations. Drawings, tool-paths, and other documents can be associated to these models to provide a semiautomatic method for parametrically modifying all the models and documents associated with a given product. This seems to be a technology that could facilitate the need in industry for mass customization.		Jordan J.

5df28efade801dfd0aafa38d4c64a0e789bd4e87	evaluation of motion-based touch-typing biometrics for online banking		This paper presents a bimodal scheme - the mechanism which exploits the way the user enters her 8-digit PIN/password and the phone-movements while doing so, for user authentication in mobile banking/financial applications (apps). The scheme authenticates the user based on the timing differences of the entered strokes. Additionally, it provides an enhanced security by adding an unobservable layer based on the phone-movements. The scheme is assumed to be highly secure as mimicking the invisible touch-timings and the phone-movements could be extremely difficult. Our analysis is based on 2850 samples collected from 95 users through a 3-day unsupervised field experiment and using 3 multi-class classifiers. Random Forest (RF) classifier out-performed other two classifiers and provided a True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of 96%.	authentication;behavioral pattern;biometrics;central processing unit;mobile banking;online banking;overhead (computing);password;performance evaluation;personal identification number;radio frequency;random forest;server (computing);touch typing;usability	Attaullah Buriro;Sandeep Gupta;Bruno Crispo	2017	2017 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)		computer science;artificial intelligence;mobile banking;typing;password;pattern recognition;random forest;feature extraction;authentication;biometrics;field experiment	Mobile	-51.26673282643765	6.345027726108253	142349

This paper explores the development of an automatic model centric version control approach for managing the evolution of chemical models and to support model reuse. Unlike traditional versioning which is text-based, the basis of versioning in the proposed approach is based on structural changes of the chemical models. An implemented prototype tool incorporating the proposed approach and the use of an example XML-based representation of chemical models was used to illustrate the associated concepts. Some results associated with a case study are presented. Given that chemical modelling tools like HYSYS has just delivered an XML infrastructure that aims to support collaborative engineering, this proposed technique is timely and relevant. The benefit of the approach is that it provides a way of automatic storage and retrieval of the chemical models as well as the management of the different versions of the model as it evolves, thus allowing chemical process engineers to concentrate on the modelling and simulation.	portable document format;process modeling;prototype;simulation;text-based (computing);version control;xml	Chiou Peng Lam;Huaizhong Li;Dong Xu	2007	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2007.01.010	xml;computer science;revision control;systems engineering;structural change;process modeling;data mining;management science	SE	-56.28821522540086	13.18128717059317	142990

This improvement can only be achieved with the support of comprehensive systems that fully monitor business processes. We propose an occurrence - based approach to business process monitoring that provides a holistic perspective of system dynamics, lending support to evolution aspects. More specifically, we present a three-dimensional artifact, called Occurrence, in which structure, behavior, and guidance are considered simultaneously. Based on this, we define more complex structures, namely Occurrence Base and Occurrence Management System, which serve as scaffolding to develop business process monitoring systems. We also present a specific occurrence-based design strategy that, using an MDE approach, has been applied by our research group for the development of successful monitoring applications.	business process;communications protocol;control system;entity;error-tolerant design;evolution;holism;internet of things;malware;management system;model-driven engineering;persistence (computer science);protocol versioning;system dynamics;visual artifact	Eladio Domínguez;Beatriz Pérez;Angel Luis Rubio;María Antonia Zapata;Juan Lavilla;Alberto Allué	2014	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2013.166	computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;data mining;database;health;management science;business process model and notation;process management;business process;process mining;business process discovery;business rule;business process modeling;business activity monitoring	DB	-55.82795228909697	16.532385580754983	143808

This  paper proposes to adopt a version-based approach to support these dynamic evolutions of business processes (BP). Adopting  this approach permits to keep chronological BP changes since several instances of a same business process can own different  schemas, each one representing a possible schema for the considered business process. Consequently, this approach is very  suitable to deal with long-term business process evolution since it does not necessarily impose the adaptation and migration  of running BP instances according to a new business process schema. The paper contribution is first a meta-model for designing  versions of business processes considering the three dimensions of BP which are the informational, organizational and process  dimensions. The paper also introduces a taxonomy of operations for business process version management.  	business process	Mohamed Amine Chaâbane;Eric Andonoff;Lotfi Bouzguenda;Rafik Bouaziz	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-05197-5_5	metamodeling;three-dimensional space;business analysis;business domain;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;process modeling;management science;business process model and notation;process management;business process;business process discovery;management;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business architecture	Vision	-58.132302249606816	15.309635304899238	144040

c6ca6a6ae538288d026739ea895a047a229131e5	business process modeling languages supporting collaborative networks	universiteitsbibliotheek	Formalizing the definition of Business Processes (BPs) performed within each enterprise is fundamental for effective deployment of their competencies and capabilities within Collaborative Networks (CN). In our approach, every enterprise in the CN is represented by its set of BPs, so that other enterprises can see and potentially share them when developing integrated BPs. Adoption of a suitable BP modeling language (BPML) is therefore critical for this purpose, while challenging due to the variety of existing tools and standards each with different levels of expressiveness and ambiguities. So far, surveys published on BP modeling approaches have compared several features of the main BP languages and standards. However, these surveys mostly focus on specific standards and tools and not on different categories of BPMLs. Moreover, there are no surveys addressing the need to fulfil CN’s requirements. Therefore, aiming to select the most suitable BPML for the purpose of modelling and representing BPs in CNs, while overviewing the defined BPML categories, the paper introduces a new categorization of the main BPMLs. Furthermore, focusing on enterprise collaboration requirements, a specific set of criteria is introduced for comparing these categories. Finally, different categories of BPMLs are compared, when addressing their suitability to	business process model and notation;business process modeling language;categorization;collaborative network;glonet;owl-s;reference model;requirement;software deployment	Hodjat Soleimani Malekan;Hamideh Afsarmanesh	2013		10.5220/0004420602580266	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;software engineering;data mining;database;management;world wide web	DB	-60.276571166970534	16.89030300198297	144260

Machine learning provides many tools to help with the analysis/understanding of complex data. In this paper we present the application of two types of technique to this domain. First, rule mining techniques to discover relationships between process behaviour and outcomes. Second, a technique presented is one suitable for clustering arbitrary length directed acyclic graphs such as those that represent business process executions. Both cases are presented in the context of a real business process.	business analysis;business process;cluster analysis	Paul N.

fbcc1811fdbc6e8ae321a6ac6902b8c1881ce5f3	calpinator: a configuration tool for building facades		Reducing energy consumption of residential and commercial buildings is a major challenge nowadays. One of the strategies to achieve a significant reduction lies on building renovation. On this regard, a project targeting the industrialization of high performance thermal renovation for apartment buildings is been executed. The renovation is based on an external envelop composed by rectangular wood-made panels that cover the whole building. Two concurrent configuration tasks within the project have been identified: The configuration of each one of the panels w.r.t. to the facade and the configuration of the entire facade using a set of these panels. We focus our efforts on the development of a decision support system for the configuration of panels and facades. In this paper we introduce Calpinator, a Java-based configuration tool which is the heart of the decision support system for the project. The tool uses the notion of Constraint Satisfaction Problems as underlying model and implements a smart greedy-recursive algorithm to find a feasible configuration. In this communication we present the tool’s design, its features and its implemented algorithm. We use a real-world scenario to illustrate the kind of facades the system can deal with.	constraint satisfaction;decision support system;greedy algorithm;java;recursion (computer science)	Andrés Felipe Barco;Élise Vareilles;Michel Aldanondo;Paul Gaborit	2014			architectural engineering;building renovation;energy consumption;decision support system;apartment;constraint satisfaction problem;facade engineering;facade;computer science;java	SE	-57.49175075008346	12.477083770880466	144850

Such information systems are required to support goal achievement at various levels of efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, they have to adhere to well defined operational roles and their performance indicators on one hand and be highly adaptable to changes in the environment on the other. In this research we propose an approach to build an agent-based information system to support different users with specific roles in the business processes by means of interaction between operational and strategic goals. This approach integrates role functionalities and performance control, and captures the knowledge which is often implicitly presented.	agent-based model;business process;heart rate variability;information system	Nora Houari;Behrouz Homayoun Far	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration	10.1109/IRI.2007.4296671	knowledge management;artificial intelligence;adaptive system;performance indicator;management science;business process;management;information system	DB	-53.74012937187423	14.978132756294052	145112

With the addition of requirements, the task of designing authentication schemes for mobile devices becomes more challenging. We propose a Multi-dimensionAl Password Scheme (MAPS) for mobile authentication. MAPS fuses information from multiple dimensions to form a password. This fusion enlarges the password space, improves memorability, and enhances usability by reducing the number of gestures needed for authentication. Based on the idea of MAPS, we implement a Chess-based MAPS (CMAPS) for Android systems. Our user studies show that CMAPS can achieve high recall rates while exceeding the security strength of current mobile authentication schemes and exceeding the requirements of banking.	android;authentication;cmap (font);mobile device;no silver bullet;password;requirement;usability	Jonathan Gurary;Ye Zhu;George P.

While hundreds of network-related new services have been created, the network management functions should have been re-coded to adapt new business rules. In addition, redundant information could be transferred repeatedly to the inter-operating systems because they request similar information. This environment brings unnecessary system development cost, and increases redundancy in the inter-operating functions. To reduce the cost and the redundancy, we propose the service-oriented software framework for network management. In order to do so, we identified common services for network management, made service specifications and service flows, and conducted service realization. Also, we present four types of services as the case studies: authentication service, SMS service, previous alarm inquiry service, and current alarm management service. Furthermore, we implemented the framework in KT to manage IP backbone networks. After adopting the framework, the system’s performance and flexibility were improved, and duplicated functionalities of the systems were reduced.	service-oriented device architecture;software framework	Dongcheul Lee;Byungjoo Park	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17578-7_32	service level requirement;element management system;information technology infrastructure library;service product management;application service provider;differentiated service;systems engineering;service delivery framework;software framework;software development;value-added network;software engineering;service design;middleware;software as a service;service;process management;network management application;business;data as a service;customer service assurance;resource-oriented architecture;software system	Networks	-51.416798241806944	15.84876386080539	145621

Arduino offers an intuitive development environment and multiple hardware and software resources that allow rapid development of microcontroller-based projects. However, due to the vast amount of information available, students were losing the capability to design their own prototypes. We propose a methodology that introduces the study of microcontrollers using Arduino to develop different types of projects and proceeds to study the system architecture to gain control on the device. This methodology has been used in an undergraduate course in microcontrollers and a graduate course in advanced techniques in digital design. The students of the microcontrollers course showed improved design skills and motivation compared to the students from previous versions of the course. With respect to the advanced techniques in digital design course, the students were able to take advantage of Arduino platform to gain a deep understanding of hardware/software co-design of embedded systems.	arduino;microcontroller	Juan Carlos Martínez Santos;Oscar Acevedo Patino;Sonia H.

Efficient inter-organizational business processes in the field of e-commerce require the integration of electronic document interchange and inter-organizational process management. We propose to support inter-organizational business processes by so-called XML nets, a new variant of high-level Petri nets. XML nets are a formal, graphical modeling language that allows to model both the flow of XML documents and the control flow of the underlying business process. XML nets are based on GXSL, a novel graphical XML schema definition language, and its related graphical XML document manipulation language XManiLa. They can be directly executed by a respective workflow engine. Advantage of the formal foundation of XML nets can be taken, e.g., when analyzing a (global) interorganizational workflow model. XML nets support the identification of relevant process fragments and their allocation to the appropriate organizational units. Thus XML nets help to derive an improved, process-oriented organizational structure.	business process;control flow;e-commerce;electronic business;graphical user interface;high- and low-level;inter-process communication;internet;modeling language;organizational behavior;petri net;workflow engine;xml schema	Kirsten Lenz;Andreas Oberweis	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-40022-6_12	xml validation;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;document structure description;xml framework;process modeling;xml schema;database;business process model and notation;process management;business;business process;process mining;ebxml;business process discovery;business rule;xml schema editor;business process modeling;cxml;efficient xml interchange	DB	-55.04961100608414	16.66646689893225	146509

The concept of agent society used in the paper is summarized. The exchange process-based concept of elementary social function is reviewed and a corresponding concept of elementary social mechanism is introduced. Together, these concepts allow for the recursive definition of the concept of functional system, with which one can account for the general functions performed by the core organizational structure of agent societies. Two case studies are developed to illustrate the type of functional modeling of agent societies that is enabled by the concepts introduced in the paper. The first case study concerns the functional analysis of a simple motivating thought experiment. The second concerns the use of agent societies as formal models for natural societies: it sketches the formalization of Pierre Bourdieu’s functional analysis of the reproduction process of contemporary human societies.

Therefore, the superiority of one control over the other is controversial. This paper proposes a novel design discipline for card-based control of production processes, by developing the theory of token transaction systems. The theory shows how the three indices represented in Little’s law are decided by the structure of a production process with control cards and deployment of work-in-process (WIP). That is, the relation of WIP, cycle time and throughput on specific subnetwork of a production process is clarified. We show how Little’s law should be used in the design of card-based production control systems. As an application of the theory, we resolve complicated result of comparison between Kanban and CONWIP. In doing so, this theory does not restrict the target of analysis to serial production lines, but any shaped processes can be analyzed.	control system;kanban (development);software deployment;subnetwork;throughput	Ryo Sato;Yaghoub Khojasteh-Ghamari	2012	J.

Organization in such large-scale systems, becomes therefore a very relevant concept in research on LSMAS, as the mentioned agents are expected to cooperate, compete, and share information, hence improving quality of peoples' life. An example application domain of LSMAS are massive multi-player online games (MMOG), and their specific genre - MMO role-playing games (MMORPG). MMORPGs provide us with the opportunity to study both large-scale virtual interaction of players (agents), and coordination of large-scale distributed artificial intelligence. In this paper, we will present an ontology of organizational concepts, suited for LSMAS development, merged with an ontology containing elements of a specific MMORPG. Combining these two ontologies with a special accent on identifying elements and aspects of organization, will hopefully present us with a basis for LSMAS structures which follow organizational constraints and are suitable for LSMAS development in the MMORPG context.	application domain;distributed artificial intelligence;internet of things;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;metamodeling;multi-agent system;ontology (information science);smart city;testbed	Bogdan Okresa Duric;Markus Schatten	2016	2016 39th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.1109/MIPRO.2016.7522346	games;simulation;computer science;organization;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;machine learning;multi-agent system;multimedia;management	AI	-49.91756887118909	13.376430322871625	147581

Enterprise Systems (ES) played a vital part in standardizing these documents and the business processes involved. However, in a heterogeneous (service oriented) environment it is not necessarily the case that all partners share the same interfaces. Numerous standardization approaches have been proposed for different areas of application that intend to facilitate data exchange. Thus, the mapping of documents is still problematic. Recently, approaches to standardize document design evolved, the Core Component Technical Specification (CCTS) being the most current. However, it is not to assume that all standards and ES will integrate CCTS in the same manner and already deviations can be observed. Adaptations of the underlying meta model are inevitable. Furthermore, the instantiation of the actual documents as well as the management of the numerous components has to be supported by a proper method and tool. The aim of the paper is to present a concept and prototype which allows creating views on business documents to facilitate document design and variant management.	business process;enterprise system;metamodeling;prototype;universal instantiation	Christian Janiesch	2007			knowledge management;business architecture;business process;integrated enterprise modeling;computer science;business process modeling;artifact-centric business process model;standardization;business rule;process modeling	DB	-57.08853510506092	18.181626900817623	148559

This paper describes an undergraduate course designed to introduce students to embedded system design concepts and challenges in an engaging and effective manner. Our course uses a combination of in-depth laboratory assignments and topical lectures to provide a unique hands-on education for students. Laboratory assignments utilize Avnet's ZedBoard platform, a development board built around Xilinx's Zynq-7000 SoC, and require students to solve a variety of embedded system challenges from a range of application domains. Overall, student feedback about the course has been positive.	central processing unit;complex systems;embedded system;hands-on computing;microprocessor development board;population;sensor;system on a chip;systems design;technical documentation	Daniel Roggow;Paul Uhing;Phillip H.

7d00432d106feb929308a404dcc7d99c99a52176	dynamic adaptation of business process based on context changes: a rule-oriented approach		In a dynamic environment, business process needs to be adjusted and evolved in response to the changeable internal policies and external environment. However, it is a time-consuming and laborious way by redesigning process model and executing the process instance. In this paper, we propose a rule-oriented approach to dynamically generate business process according to the current context at runtime. To enable dynamic and context-aware adaptation, the relationship between services and context is described as rules, which are then used to generate the solution with a mapping mechanism. Two algorithms are designed to generate the activity sequence at runtime, which is the solution of process adaptation. In order to achieve the preference selection, a process assessment strategy has been proposed to constrain the generated activity sequence. Simulation experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.	business process	Guangchang Hu;Budan Wu;Junliang Chen	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-06859-6_43	knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process discovery	SE	-54.62950178010741	17.72192008296563	148848

At  supplier’s side, production planning process is intervened between sales and production processes. Past experiences can be  adapted to support production planning activities. Hence, it is crucial to identify knowledge from previously solved cases  on demand and assimilate it. At the Information Systems Institute, various methodologies (e.g., similarity search in product  and process data) are developed to support aforesaid knowledge intensive activities in sheet metal forming. However, these  methodologies are used as stand-alone applications. Therefore, the current contribution introduces an integrated virtual value  creation chain in sheet metal forming which utilizes previously developed methodologies. Also, these methodologies are elaborated  as part of the integrated virtual value creation chain. The developed methodologies are heterogeneous and are coupled through  a shared knowledge base.

ArchiMEO, a formal representation of the ArchiMate framework, was applied to model selected parts of a large Swiss company, including metadata of concrete information objects stored in various applications. The evaluation of our approach clearly gave evidence that linking an enterprise ontology with operational databases is beneficiary: it provides an integrated view and management of enterprise entities spread over various data stores, represented in different ways and levels of granularity. Furthermore, because of its inference capabilities, when used as metadata encoding scheme an enterprise ontology can provide context-sensitive access to relevant information.	amiga rigid disk block;archimate;business object;context-sensitive grammar;context-sensitive help;data store;database;domain-specific language;enterprise architecture;entity;extensibility;information system;line code;ontology (information science);query language;sparql;switzerland;upper ontology	Knut Hinkelmann;Michaela Maise;Barbara Thönssen	2013	Proceedings of the First International Conference on Enterprise Systems: ES 2013	10.1109/ES.2013.6690088	enterprise architecture framework;functional software architecture;enterprise system;enterprise systems engineering;enterprise software;nist enterprise architecture model;computer science;knowledge management;architecture domain;integrated enterprise modeling;enterprise architecture management;data mining;database;enterprise data management;enterprise architecture;enterprise integration;view model;meta data services;enterprise information security architecture;enterprise information system;enterprise information integration;business architecture	DB	-55.030788812467755	16.282664692871784	149285

Thanks to it sharing the conceptualization between users becomes possible, and better decision support facilities can be provided. The Prosecco project is a research and development project aims to address the needs and constraints of small and medium enterprises by designing methods that will significantly improve BPM systems. In this paper we focus on the development of ontology-based mechanisms allowing for creating taxonomies of business logic concepts unifying system objects. Building a taxonomy of business concepts shared by number of SMEs targeted in the project and then turning it into a formalized ontology integrating the software components is a major challenge. The paper demonstrates how this ontology is used to unify vocabulary of business processes and rules. The original contribution of this research discussed in the paper is the design and implementation of the ontology, and the demonstration of its practical use in the system.	beam propagation method;business logic;business process;component-based software engineering;conceptualization (information science);decision support system;dictionary;knowledge management;management information system;taxonomy (general);vocabulary	Grzegorz J.

The current research on quantity calculation based on BIM discusses the cost estimation of the building projects. There are few methods that can query construction quantity during the design process which facilitates the designer to modify the relevant data at any time. In view of the present situation, this paper describes a calculation construction method on Revit platform, which is one of currently the most popular BIM modeling platform. The effectiveness and disadvantages of the approach are analyzed through a practical engineering example. With this method, designers can get real-time quantity in the design process in any time, and the design results can be checked and updated automatically based on statistics result of engineering quantity when necessary.	application programming interface;artificial intelligence;bim;building information modeling;information model;real-time clock;real-time computing;revit	Qin Zhao;Yuchao Li;Xinhong Hei;Xiao Fan Wang	2015	2015 11th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)	10.1109/CIS.2015.122	building information modeling;data modeling;estimation;concrete;solid modeling;computational model	DB	-55.12771925448503	9.171118959995232	149369

dcc003c33f1c945f2e03a543d3842c8e5246745a	reengineering for accessibility: a strategy based on software awareness		Almost a decade after the release of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.0, the low level of accessibility in web sites and web applications is still worrying. A problem that aggravates this situation involves the fact that web accessibility requirements are often addressed when the application is fully developed. Such delayed processing often results in significant rework, increasing costs with new recoding analyzes, which may be totally outside the scope and budget of the project. As we believe that the need for accessibility may vary according to the users and their context, in this article, we approach a strategy to promote web accessibility in legacy systems through the use of software awareness. In this process of reengineering, we deal with the interaction of web accessibility with another nonfunctional requirement: Software Awareness. In this way, we use self-adaptation strategies to provide customized accessibility. As a result of our strategy, we present a hybrid SIG (Softgoal Interdependency Graphs) containing the requirements of accessibility and software awareness, based on the concepts of the NFR Framework, and its application in reengineering a real system based on Android.	acclimatization;android;code refactoring;customize;interdependence;legacy system;non-functional requirement;rework (electronics);software framework;surveillance implementation group;web content accessibility guidelines;web accessibility;web application	Yehya Belhadad;Hervé de Ribaucourt;Julio Cesar Sampaio P.

942bba51d3bf3aaeac1f7d4bf152fe7aa4dddff3	manufacturing human machine interface design using plant models		Abstract   The challenge today to improve SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems is to integrate concepts coming from cognitive science and results from automatic control. Ecological Interface Design proposes an original design methodology to facilitate human operator perception. In this paper, we propose an approach to apply such methodology on manufacturing Discrete Event System design. The methodology is based on plant modelling. This design methodology of plant model is closed to material structure of the plant and associates real time plant evolutions to meaning full information. The methodology is illustrated with an industrial example that shows advantages compared to a “classical” supervisory HMI based on controller inputs/outputs.	user interface	Benoit Rohee;Bernard Riera;Véronique Carré-Ménétrier	2007		10.3182/20070904-3-KR-2922.00037	control engineering;simulation;systems engineering;engineering	HCI	-57.131915674372216	8.558436316956545	149574

Such models are designed to progressively hid irrelevant detail and yet provide sufficient information to be useful for communication, design and documentation. However, developments in computer technology have resulted in a low cost, heterogeneous modular architecture that is difficult to model using current methods. This paper proposes a new generic method of modeling computer technology at a higher level of abstraction than those currently used. Investigations to date indicate that this model is independent of architectural detail and can therefore accommodate changes in technology. This new model is more directly relevant to the cheap, low-cost modular architectures in use today. Furthermore, all work to date has strongly indicated it may be useful as the basis of a new pedagogical framework for teaching not only introductory but also more advanced computer technology.	computer;digital electronics;documentation;high-level programming language;modular programming;relevance;semiconductor;transistor	Stanislaw P.

In this work, an attempt has been made for review on AI applications in Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) and manufacturing. Primarily, uniqueness of present review work addressed by analysis of existing review articles. The review work comprise of three main elements; 1. Feature based design, a primary input for a CAPP system, 2. Expert System (ES) usefulness in Process Planning (PP) and manufacturing and 3. Evolutionary approach applications. The review begins with an overview and the use of AI systems in decision making. Research works exemplified for the past three and half decades (1981–2016) are analyzed in terms of feature based modeling, Standards for Exchange of Product Model data approach, ES in PP, scheduling, manufacturing and miscellaneous applications. Role of Evolutionary Techniques (ET) in intelligent system development, execution of PP activities and manufacturing are described. A statistical analysis on existing review articles, number of publications, domain specific articles and percentage contribution of each area are carried out. Finally, research gaps are identified and the possible future research directions are presented.	artificial intelligence	S. P. Leo Kumar	2017	Eng.

The process planning problem comes out as a rigid hierarchical structure of tasks where the lowest levels are well defined tasks, such as determination of machine and cutting parameters, while the top levels control, coordinate, and manage the entire system. Such a top-down manner of coordination makes it a tightly coupled distributed decision-making situation. The complexity of CIM systems with hierarchical structures grows rapidly with the size of the system making them very expensive. Also, assimilating a large array of knowledge sources to plan the activities is a major hurdle. Cooperative distributed problem-solving (CDPS) is concerned with the cooperative solution of problems by a decentralized group of cooperating intelligent agents. CDPS techniques have good adaptive capability, make the system modular, are faster due to parallel operation of subsystems, possess greater reliability through redundancy, can over-ride limited resources, and can collect knowledge. This paper describes a conceptual framework of applying CDPS to CAPP for general-purpose process modeling. The problem in process planning has been mapped onto a CDPS architecture based on multistage negotiation. The needed agents are defined, and their roles in the architecture and the knowledge that each agent would need are described at the conceptual level.

Necessity to cooperate in the cross-enterprise setting leads to Collaborative Business Processes (CBPs). The difference between CBPs and Business Processes (BPs) is in the decentralized coordination, flexible backward recovery, participants notification about the state, efficient adaptability to changes, presence of multiple information systems, and individual authorization settings. In the paper we consider a specific case of CBPs where multiple collaborating partners use Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system of the same vendor. The vendor can see (e.g., monitor) the changes of data elements, but does not have explicit process awareness in the ERP system to support flow of activities in the crossenterprise setting. The paper also discusses different settings of cross-enterprise CBP and shows simplified enterprise models behind the vendor possibilities to positively impact collaborative processes. The restrictions of the vendor are implicit information flows in BP, diversity of ERP integrations with third party Information Systems (IS), the lack of mechanisms for monitoring BP instances, backward recovery, user notification about the current state and tasks, and inability to make explicit changes in customers’ ISs.	access control;authorization;beam propagation method;business process;erp;enterprise modelling;enterprise resource planning;imperative programming;information system;programming paradigm;real life	Gundars Alksnis;Erika Asnina;Marite Kirikova;Egils Meiers	2015	CSIMQ	10.7250/csimq.2015-2.01	systems engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;operations management;business;business process modeling	Web+IR	-52.76006211996946	14.370869946320772	150596

The special feature of algorithm alterable models as follows: a research work with the model gives new knowledge about the modelling system, that cause a necessity to change the model itself. After changes this cycle is repeated. APL is mostly suitable for a development of the alterable models software. A method of the development is discussed in the paper as well. As an example the paper outlines a modeling of a long-term planning process in a capital construction. A corresponding software - DDS for the planning - is described. The DDS had been implemented in APL 2.0 on a CDC Cyber-172 mainframe in LIIAS USSR. So called, psuedo-parallel executions, combined APL with ALGOL and FORTRAN subsystems, have been developed to improve dynamics characteristics of the DSS software.	algol;apl;algorithm;cdc 6600;cdc cyber;fortran;list of russian it developers;mainframe computer;software development	Alexei L.

The success of a KBS critically depends on the amount of knowledge embedded in the system. Expert knowledge, which results from an individual's extensive problem-solving experience, has been described as unconscious knowledge. Besides shortening development time, properly handled reuse will also improve the reliability since code is executed for longer time and in different contexts. In this paper, We propose a design process suitable for developing product lines for mobile embedded systems with KBS. The process starts in a requirement-capturing phase where the requirements from all products in the line are collected. The contributions of this work with respect to mobile embedded systems are an outline of a development process, focusing on the special considerations that must be taken into account when designing a PLA for the systems.	embedded software;software development	Haeng-Kon Kim	2005		10.1007/11552413_161	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;intelligent agent;new product development	Embedded	-62.72473546012384	13.085243968639775	151069

Process centered BPM provides the capability for business partners to carry out such processes by providing a platform for cross enterprise applications to take part in the process. However, current business processes management systems based on services cannot composite services automatically in order to meet user's requirements and lack the ability of dynamically configuration of services and resources. Roughly, existing methods can be classified into run-time binding based on task decomposition and automatic composition based on bottom-up method, but the former method needs decomposition of complex processes in advance while the later method is more complex. In addition, both methods are not goal-oriented. This paper introduces a stratified grid concept, and based on its characteristics, proposes a goal-oriented business processes management system. The method can search business processes, optimize the composite processes and configure resources in distributed stratified grid environment based on requirements and goals of users. Especially, the method can provide the user best global services and simplify the design of business process.	associative entity;bottom-up parsing;business process;enterprise software;late binding;requirement	Li-zhen Cui;Haiyang Wang	2005	Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design, 2005.	10.1109/CSCWD.2005.194165	process design;application software;business requirements;computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;resource management;software engineering;goal orientation;top-down and bottom-up design;database;business process model and notation;process management;business system planning;business process;process mining;business process discovery;management;business rule;information technology;business process modeling;grid computing;business activity monitoring;collaboration	DB	-52.803950674779266	15.598484873343992	151523

In this project, an agent-based e-engineering services framework for engineering design and optimization is proposed and being developed based on several advanced technologies, such as agents, Internet/Web, workflow and database. This framework aims at providing integrated or individual engineering services over the Internet that benefits small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A software prototype is currently being implemented using intelligent agents to integrate various engineering software tools. Scalability, intelligent load balancing and distributed decision-making are among the main characteristics that are highly expected from this system. A wheel-axle-assembly (part of a bogie system) is chosen as the test part of this prototype system.	engineering design process;program optimization	Qi Hao;Weiming Shen;Seong-Whan Park;Jai-Kyung Lee;Zhan Zhang;Byung-Chun Shin	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24677-0_104	axle;web service;agent architecture;workflow;engineering optimization;the internet;simulation;bogie;search-based software engineering;computer science;systems engineering;artificial intelligence;social software engineering;load balancing;software development;software agent;operating system;database;computer-aided engineering;intelligent agent	DB	-54.06195526994331	12.842159814994218	151623

One common process mining task focuses on conformance checking, comparing discovered or designed process models with actual real-life behavior as captured in event logs in order to assess the “goodness” of the process model. This paper introduces a novel conformance checking method to measure how well a process model performs in terms of precision and generalization with respect to the actual executions of a process as recorded in an event log. Our approach differs from related work in the sense that we apply the concept of so-called weighted artificial negative events toward conformance checking, leading to more robust results, especially when dealing with less complete event logs that only contain a subset of all possible process execution behavior. In addition, our technique offers a novel way to estimate a process model's ability to generalize. Existing literature has focused mainly on the fitness (recall) and precision (appropriateness) of process models, whereas generalization has been much more difficult to estimate. The described algorithms are implemented in a number of ProM plugins, and a Petri net conformance checking tool was developed to inspect process model conformance in a visual manner.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);closing (morphology);conformance testing;experiment;heuristic;model checking;norm (social);petri net;plug-in (computing);precision and recall;process modeling;programmable read-only memory;real life;scalability;suffix tree	Seppe K.

Traditional models of artificial intelligence and mathematics do not allow describing biomechatronic systems being designed on all its levels in one common formal basis, i.e. they do not give connected descriptions of the systems structure, the system as dynamic unit in its environment and the environment construction. To avoid this drawback, the technology of hierarchical and dynamic systems was chosen as a theoretical means for conceptual design and control tasks performing. Furthermore, in comparison with traditional methods the proposed technology gives the description of connected electronic, mechanical, biological, human-machine and computer subsystems of biomechatronic object in common formal basis. Theoretical basis of the coordination technology is briefly considered first. The example of the technology realization in conceptual design of SRS is presented after that in the paper.	biomechatronics	Kastus Miatliuk;Yoon Hyuk Kim	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-01857-7_8	systems engineering	EDA	-56.87251876493187	8.771502846067714	151855
fff17279dd982f49a8b130be6ac327129e6b4a7f	das ascend-modell zur unterstützung kooperativer prozesse	cad;computer supported cooperative work	The ASCEND Designflow Model (ADM) supports the execution of cooperative processes, which we refer to as designflows. The main focus of this model is the combination of activity support and sharing of common data. A prototype implementation of this model was achieved by skillfully integrating technologies from groupware, workflow management, and interaction protocols. Processes in concurrent engineering and design rely on cooperation between the different participants. This cooperation is necessary to establish and coordinate the tasks needed to fulfill the goal of the design process. Those tasks (also called design steps) in which the complete process can be subdivided into rely on the results, states, and progress of concurrent, previous, and future tasks. Typically, it can not be exactly planned beforehand which tasks are necessary, how the tasks depend on each other, and how and when those tasks have to interact. Thus, it is necessary to offer mechanisms to support cooperation in a dynamic fashion and at runtime. This new class of cooperative processes is described and shown by example scenarios. They have have the need for interaction, cooperation, cooperative resource sharing, delegation of activities, structured and less-structured process parts, integration of results from delegated activities, and the coordination of actions in common. From this we derive the requirements of an adequate user assistance, which does not prescribe a single process model but gives the users the freedom to choose from the most suitable service and adapt it to their needs. To find the suitable assistance, different technologies are examined: CSCW, workflow management, CAD frameworks, agent technologies, software engineering process models, and process net planning. Aspects of the examined technologies are combined in the ASCEND Designflow Model. Workflow management aspects are used to offer a structured activity model and automate processes. Constraints are used to allow one to model certain process specific constraints in activities, thus allowing for more flexibility in processes. Primitive activities encapsulate the so called design steps, which encapsulate unstructured work like CAD tool applications or groupware activities. All activities and constraints have access to a common information space. Thus, allowing for system supported common data access and exchange. A high level of cooperation on those data is achieved. In order to enable this (interactive) cooperation, protocol based conversation patterns are established. The adaptability of the conversations also realizes customization to a great variety of cooperative processes. Since the protocols and the data sharing are both supported by ASCEND, the consistent data handling can be ensured within the system. As a conclusion this approach promotes cooperative techniques like awareness and negotiation through the activity model an the shared information space combined with the protocols. This allows cooperation to take place between the actors and entities in the ASCEND Designflow Model.	ascend;collaborative software;computer engineering;computer-aided design;computer-supported cooperative work;data access;entity;function model;global variable;high-level programming language;interaction protocol;process modeling;prototype;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);software agent;software development process;software engineering;v-model	Aiko Frank	2002			engineering;operations management;performance art	HCI	-51.76161197104524	15.060425601148818	151922

Flexible product definition is required together with very short innovation cycle. In order to achieve this, leading companies apply product model based lifecycle management of product information (PLM). In this way, demands for engineering stimulate development of product modeling. Latest developments in paradigm PLM 2.0 represent efforts in research for industrially applicable advanced knowledge based definition of product objects. The authors joined to these efforts by several works during the recent years. In this paper, they introduce one of their latest results. New method is applied for the control of product object definition. A special product model entity is introduced for the control of feature parameter definition. This entity is called as adaptive action and it carries proposed or decided human influence information and connects human request based product model extension by the authors with currently applied product model. Definitions of knowledge in latest professional industrial product models facilitate implementation of the proposed method in the PLM practice.	interaction;new product development;programming paradigm	László Horváth;Imre J.

Examples of such tasks include stairwells, restrooms, mechanical rooms, and kitchens. This type of design is not considered creative, for it consists of a variation of a standard design within a particular context. Rather, it is an example of the “dogwork” involved in realizing initial design conceptions. A major portion of an architectural firm's time and effort is currently expended on the production aspects of design, of translating schematic design into construction documents1.  General Space Planner* (GSP) is an automated design, drafting, and problem solving system recently implemented on Carnegie-Mellon University's IBM 360/67 time-shared computer that begins to explore how arrangement problems and other production aspects of design can be either automated or augmented by the computer. This paper describes the current user interface of the GSP system, its required inputs, modes of interaction, and its outputs, and describes how GSP solves several classes of drafting design problems.	guardian service processor;ibm system/360 model 67;problem solving;schematic;technical drawing;user interface	Charles E.

To date, research efforts are scarce and have a rather conceptual nature. Moreover, publications fail to explicit the complex internal structure of a simulation model. The current paper outlines the general structure of a BPS model. Building on these foundations, modeling tasks for the main components of a BPS model are identified. Moreover, the potential value of process mining and the state of the art in literature are discussed. Consequently, a multitude of promising research challenges are identified. In this sense, the current paper can guide future research on the use of process mining in a BPS context.	business process;simulation	Niels Martin;Benoît Depaire;An Caris	2014	2014 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining (CIDM)	10.1109/CIDM.2014.7008693	probability distribution;logic gate;schedule;computer science;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;process modeling;data mining;business process model and notation;context model;business process;process mining;business process discovery;computational model;business rule;business process modeling;statistics	DB	-54.95796831079204	16.791151401802377	153111

24ac3ec32bed78820a00e90bf69f70d8e39c610d	visual understanding industrial workflows under uncertainty on distributed service oriented architectures	industrial scheduling;computer vision;distributed cameras;service oriented architecture	Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an evolution of distributed computing based on the request/reply design paradigm for synchronous and asynchronous applications. In such architectures, application developers or system integrators can build scenarios by composing one ormore serviceswithout knowing the services’ underlying implementations. In this paper, we adopt a SOA framework for on-line scheduling complex industrial workflows. The proposed SOA consists of three main layers; the input layer, the benchmarking layer, the prediction layer and the scheduler. The main innovation of our SOA architecture is the prediction layer that supports computer vision tools able to visually observe how an industrial workflow is actually executed. This way, we can automatically estimate the actual execution time for a process. In particular a new self-initialized visual tracker algorithm is proposed in this paper to robustly trace workers’ trajectory in a plant via visual observations. Then, part-to-whole curve matching is presented so as to find correspondences among the traced curve and the ideal one and thus improving scheduler efficiency. The input layer interoperably describes industrial operations using the XPDL (an XML-based) format. The benchmarker evaluates much faster than real-time and in an off-line mode how long it takes for an industrial workflow to be executed on a given resource guaranteeing an almost real-time implementation of the video processing algorithms on the plant. The last component of the proposed SOA is the scheduler with the goal to assign the workflows to the available resources. In this paper, a Maximum Benefit First (MBF) scheduler is presented which maximizes the total gain received by the industry when completing execution of all the beneficial operations with minimum violations of their delivery deadlines (that is with the minimum compensations).

For addressing these issues, the application of Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) appears to be a promising approach. SPLE promotes systematic reuse in the development of systems with similar requirements. SPLE promotes reuse by development of comprehensive sets of systems (aka software families) as a whole (domain engineering), and later configuring them according to the functionality requested by the stakeholders (application engineering). Furthermore, the reuse of services that are part of a software product line is enhanced, since each time a member of SPL is instantiated and deployed, services that are used in the instantiated member are reused. The research community have recognized and proposed several promising solutions to the development of service-oriented systems based on the SPLE principles; however, there have been little results that report on concrete tools that automate and thus, reduce the amount of efforts needed for	business process model and notation;cognitive dimensions of notations;critical pair (logic);description logic;domain engineering;emoticon;executable;experiment;feature model;modeling language;ontology (information science);requirement;semantic web;service (systems architecture);service discovery;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented infrastructure;service-oriented software engineering;software as a service;software product line;spl (unix);text-based (computing);web search engine	Marko Boskovic;Dragan Gasevic;Bardia Mohabbati;Mohsen Asadi;Marek Hatala;Nima Kaviani;J.

In order to elevate this object level of integration to the level of knowledge, a new product modeling method is proposed. On the knowledge level of modeling, human makes attempt for model change by launching product objects accompanied with knowledge objects or by launching knowledge objects for generation of new product objects. Requested model changes are coordinated on the basis of human and product aspects. When an attempt gains permission to execute, an adaptive action entity is generated to replace direct human control of creation or modification of product objects. In this paper, current knowledge based features of product modeling systems are characterized. A new knowledge based product definition method by the authors is introduced and its integration with the currently applied object modeling is explained. Following this, the currently applied direct and expert knowledge based product definition methods are compared with the proposed indirect product definition. Finally, consistency and context as two main advantages of the new modeling are introduced and discussed.	entity;knowledge level;knowledge representation and reasoning;problem solving	László Horváth;Imre J.

84cd5a4a7cfaeb4009c6775e04c647450744f1a8	a multi-agent approach for composing negotiation items in a reverse logistic virtual market		In this work a reverse production process is conceived as a service-based manufacturing network (ecosystem), in which the manufacturing companies “play” in the ecosystem by means of market services. One complex problem in a reverse logistic virtual market is the efficient composition and decomposition of the negotiation items. A negotiation item is defined as an item subject to be recycled: used products/scraps/wastes, a sub-part of a used product/scrap/waste, or the materials that are contained in the used product/scrap/waste. In this work we present a Multi-agent approach in order to compose the last two types of negotiation items from an orchestration of negotiation processes among the different stakeholders of the reverse logistic process (i.e. collecting points, recycling plants, disassembly plants, secondary material markets). In this way a call for buying, for example 10 tons of steel, can be handle in the virtual market as a complex process of buying and selling used products/scraps/wastes, or their sub-parts, in order to decompose and pre-process them (by recycling and/or disassembly plants) for extracting the steel contained in those items.

Concept models and semantics are used to align domain specific business processes with executable workflows that are deployed and in production in a multi-cloud environment. The Business Process Management System Paradigm (BPMS) is requesting the functional capabilities of the so-ca lled BPaaS Environments (i) design, (ii) allocation, (iii) execution and (iv) e valuation, which technically compose the CloudSocket Broker platform. This paper i ntroduces first findings of aligning customers’ business needs with BPaaS clo ud offerings using a model-based approach.	align (company);business process;business requirements;executable;management system;value (ethics)	Robert Woitsch;Knut Hinkelmann;Ana Maria Juan Ferrer;Joaquin Iranzo Yuste	2016			business process;process management;computer science;systems engineering	DB	-57.209286723486784	17.258642846153613	153442

We present three novel glyphs for simplifying this process and apply them to visualizing statistics from a multi-million line software project. These glyphs address four important needs in project management: viewing time dependent data; managing large data volumes; dealing with diverse data types; and correspondence of data to real-world concepts.	centralisation;database;entity;firewall (computing);glyph;intranet;java;scheduling (computing);software project management;software visualization;vrml;world wide web	Mei C.

However although these enterprise applications provide increasing amounts of information, they do not support the capture and sharing of multi-perspective knowledge across the participating domains. The aim of this paper is to investigate the capture and sharing of assembly knowledge to support collaboration across the assembly design and assembly process planning domains. In the past there have been some efforts to develop knowledge based systems however these knowledge based systems lack the ability to fully capture and share multi-perspective assembly knowledge. This is because such systems are unable to capture the full meanings and intents of the concepts used to stipulate the assembly knowledge and relationships between these concepts. This paper proposes a mechanism to support capture and sharing of assembly knowledge by using formal ontologies where the latter specify meanings of concepts in computationally interpretable form that consequently provides a base for knowledge sharing. The research concept has been experimentally demonstrated by using a selected set of assembly concepts which have been used to capture and relate assembly design and assembly process planning knowledge.	common logic;ontology (information science)	Muhammad Imran;Robert I.

These kind of artifacts can take advantage of the developments on IoT to deliver smart vessels to improve operation, usability and profitability for shipowners, users and workers. To introduce the different possibilities of IoT in vessels it is needed to start from the initial concept and the initial design. This paper presents some ideas on how to make a ship conceptual design from the very beginning by taking into account the necessities of the different components of a ship in order to be connected in the world of the IoT. For making this design it is necessary to use advanced tools capable of incorporating the latest achievements in the IoT and to manage all this complexity.	computer-aided design;data model;database;identifier;intranet;middleware;multitier architecture;pipeline (computing);robot welding;smart device;software developer;usability	Jesús A.

In this context, Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) is acknowledged as a key area within the EKM field and designated by the research community as a potential solution to carry out the effective capture and reuse of expert knowledge. However, papers on KBE for knowledge sourcing are not abundant in the literature and they are also dispersed. From this perspective, this research is an effort to further consolidate the learning gained on industrial practice on how engineering knowledge can be effectively sourced. This is achieved by realising a research survey, where using the resulting insights KBE practice reaching aerospace engineering offices shall be more efficiently delivered through fast and accurate knowledge extraction and encoding into usable methods and tools. The research findings provided by literature survey confirmed the existence of a research gap on knowledge sourcing; and more precisely they underlined the need for an extended KBE development process which integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and expert intervention to systematically manage the knowledge (using the KM methods and tools) efficiently captured and modelled (employing AI algorithms and expert involvement). Therefore, this paper concludes that there is a need for further research on the knowledge sourcing KBE aspect and presents the integration of KBE systems and AI implementations as a potential solution to develop the extended KBE development process requested by the industry.	engineering design process;knowledge-based engineering	Santiago Quintana-Amate;Pablo Bermell-Garcia;Ashutosh Tiwari	2015	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2015.04.002	knowledge management;knowledge engineering;management science;knowledge extraction;knowledge value chain;domain knowledge	DB	-62.83802073162758	14.410696566501906	154075

In this context, the use of agent ontologies for modelling the realities of both customers and sellers may play an important role. This paper deals with a formal model of agent ontologies, capable of describing the entities involved in the above realities (products, product features, product categories) as well as the behaviour of customers and sellers in performing their activities. Furthermore, we present some techniques that exploit the proposed ontology model for supporting the various B2C e-commerce stages represented in the Consumer Buying Behaviour (CBB) model. Finally, we briefly describe the OBA-B2C multi-agent architecture that implements in a JADE-based environment all the proposed techniques.	agent architecture;agent-based model;artificial neural network;common building block;e-commerce;entity;formal language;jade;machine learning;mathematical induction;multi-agent system;ontology (information science);out-of-band agreement;population;sensor	Domenico Rosaci	2005	J.

Conventional training based approaches expect managers capable of apply their knowledge and experience when they make decisions in designing their business processes. The technology advancement in the past decades has made it possible to provide technological decision-support for both executives and in the trench managers. How one can create technologies that are both generally applicable to a wide range of domains and still powerful enough to provide specific solutions for specific problems has been a challenge for the research community. In our research, we take a simulation based approach to business design and management. In this paper, an enterprise simulation model, called PMT (Process Management Tool), is introduced and a case study of design and management of automotive engineering design processes using PMT was presented. The PMT based case study demonstrated the effectiveness of our simulation based approach and the PMT model by clearly identifying the fragility of product based design processes and the tolerance of function based design processes to overload situations.	simulation	Yoichiro Suzuki;Majid Yahyaei;Yan Jin;Hideo Koyama;Gahee Kang	2012	Advanced Engineering Informatics	10.1016/j.aei.2012.06.002	process design;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;software engineering;management	EDA	-62.1802797174632	10.474768699477803	154669

A component is a reusable element that includes several views including partial models. It is formalized referring to the notion of operations. Four views are delineated in this paper: operating part view, constraints view, topological view and control view. The control model of the workshop is built on these views. The procedure uses these partial models and refers to model transformation to provide an easy way to obtain source code compatible with the IEC 61131-3 standard.

It often interacts with other BPs of the same or other organizations and the software implementing it is rather complex. Two complementary instruments facilitate the design, development, and management of this complex software. The first is the use of standards. In particular, the recent BPEL standard (Business Process Execution Language [5]) provides an XML-based language to describe the operational logic and execution flow of the BP, as well as the interfaces it exposes to other BPs. A BP specification written in BPEL can be automatically compiled into an actual code that implements the BP, and can be executed on a BPEL server. The second instrument is the use of supporting BP management tools for (1) designing the BP BPEL specifications, (2) analyzing the design, (3) monitoring the BPs at run time, and (4) analyzing, posteriorly, the process execution traces (logs). Together they provide an essential infrastructure for companies to design business processes, optimize them, reduce operational costs, and ultimately increase competitiveness.	business process execution language;competitive analysis (online algorithm);compiler;run time (program lifecycle phase);server (computing);tracing (software);xml	Catriel Beeri;Anat Eyal;Tova Milo;Alon Pilberg	2008	SIGMOD Record	10.1145/1374780.1374785	xml;business process execution language;computer science;artifact-centric business process model;data mining;database;business process model and notation;process management;business process;programming language;business rule;world wide web;business process modeling;encryption	SE	-52.25443357289678	17.476077382923567	156380

The main purpose of the approach is to support possibility of SD experts work not only with the knowledge, but also with the knowledge metamodel without knowledge engineers’ participation. The framework combines methods of knowledge elicitation and description well-known in humanities with formal methods for knowledge modeling. The framework includes the set of principles, a model of multidimensional space for visualization of continuing education (LifeLong Learning Space, LLLS), normalized competency metamodel (NCMM), and the process of NCMM tailoring. LLLS is used as domain-specific KAM goals model and as a tool for intuitively obvious goals visualization. Well-order and partial order relationships defined on LLLS dimensions are used for competency profiles evaluation and comparison. NCMM facilitates KAM process structuring and control. Rules for KAM process support and performance are described. The types of completed projects for more specific domains are mentioned.	knowledge acquisition	Evgeny Z. Zinder;Irina G.

From there, we outline important strengths and weaknesses of existing EA management tools discovered in the survey and suggest some approaches for improving the tool support available in this field. The tool evaluation, to which the paper refers, is built on a definition of EA management, which we operationalized via a set of scenarios, which constitute a sufficiently concrete base for making precise statements about the tool support. The paper outlines some scenarios, which are constructed to be representative for EA management, and therefore cover typical tasks. In order to ensure the representativeness of the scenarios, they were validated by ten of our industry partners. Considering the results of the evaluation, which covered nine EA management tools, we show characteristic strengths and weaknesses common to the tools. From this analysis, which e.g. covered the tools' metamodeling capabilities, the methodologies they offer to address EA management, and especially their visualization-specific capabilities, we suggest areas for further improvement regarding the software support for EA management.

For example, if designer A is creating a design for a helicopters hydraulics system and this is dependent on electrical power (EP) from a sub-system from designer B then how can the workflows, decisions and options of the two designers be managed so that each can understand the implications of their own design decisions and more importantly the implications and design decisions they force on others? The proposed CAPS system employs two dependency reasoning engines one handles quantitative values and other qualitative values. The quantitative engine identifies that a motor with an output of 3000rpm allows a generator to output 100V whereas the qualitative engine could rule out several motors options if the overall design states that the weight of a helicopters transmission needs to be comparable to that of the engine or the positioning of a sensor makes it susceptible to an EM process that could affect its function. A mapping capability is provided allowing analysis to be passed between the two engines. The proposed CAPS architecture has been evaluated against a large collaborative design task involving the design of the electrical, hydraulic, structural and mechanical aspects of a helicopter.	actor model;automatic parallelization;design tool;expectation propagation;feedback;inference engine;list of toolkits;scalability;software design	Brian Drabble	2013	2013 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)	10.1109/CTS.2013.6567264	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;design education;management;computer security;hydraulic machinery;collaborative software;design brief	HCI	-60.40212165358056	10.384940277932808	156576
1bf3fbb86dcd85e0090f45356e2407ef7a7f2636	configuring a fleet of ground robots for agricultural tasks		Lately, many computer-based sensors and actuators have been incorporated in agricultural equipment with the main goal of configuring agricultural robots capable of achieving different tasks autonomously. However, the incorporation of different electronic systems in a robot impairs its reliability and increases its cost. Thus, hardware minimization and ease of software integration is mandatory to obtain feasible robotic systems. This paper strives to find a hardware architecture for both individual robots and robots working in fleets to improve reliability, decrease development costs and allow the integration of software from different developers.	robot	Luis Emmi;Mariano Gonzalez-de-Soto;Pablo González de Santos	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-03413-3_37	simulation	Robotics	-55.15824131016764	10.43599831881914	156602
615b2000658fd697525db550bbd7f1938efb006c	application of industrial engineering concepts and techniques to ambient intelligence: a case study		Ambient intelligence (AmI) researchers have primarily come from information engineering, electrical engineering, and medical backgrounds. However, industrial engineering (IE) concepts and techniques are crucial to the sustainable development of the AmI industry. For this reason, two IE concepts and techniques, the planning cycle and cost–benefit analysis, were applied to an AmI system in this study. First, a five-step planning cycle was proposed, according to which a detailed cost–benefit analysis was performed that aggregated objectives on the client side, the server side, and in the AmI system as a whole. A restaurant recommendation system was used to illustrate the proposed methodology. The experimental results showed that the system administrator was able to perform a credible cost–benefit analysis and improve the system performance by using the proposed methodology.	ambient intelligence;industrial engineering	Toly Chen;Horng-Ren Tsai	2018	J.

974dc4e6964def8d57cb3aae7f00f3b9c320c86a	a collaborative approach to public administrations inter-organizational business processes modelling		The paper presents a collaborative approach to the definition of interorganizational Business Processes. Applying the proposed modeling approach multiple organizations can easily reconcile local and global views. In particular, the modeling phase is based on BPMN 2.0 standard notation and it proceeds according to the following steps: (i) all organizations collaboratively derive a communication view of the process, (ii) a local communication view is automatically deduced for each organization, and (iii) each organization models its own private process taking into account foreseen local communications. The approach is supported by a user-friendly and web based tool named HawkEye that has been successfully applied to real scenarios in the e-government domain.	business process model and notation;e-government;ibm basic programming support;programming paradigm;usability;web application	Riccardo Cognini;Damiano Falcioni;Alberto Polzonetti;Barbara Re	2013			knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business administration;management science	Vision	-54.5614233528521	16.127677507829464	156785

In our research works, we focus on the use of SOA to implement inter-organizational workflows (IOWF). Our goal is to obtain IOWF models flexible enough in order to ease their adaptation at build-time and at runtime, because services are loosely coupled components, easily invoked and interoperable. This paper focuses on specific and well common IOWF-architectures defined in the literature; it deals with adaptation of IOWF process models obeying to these architectures. First, we define the concept of Service-Based Cooperation Pattern (SBCP) that supports service-based IOWF models meeting one of the specific architectures considered. Then, we state a set of recurrent operations of adaptation (attached to process and interaction aspects) that can be applied on service-based IOWF models, and we illustrate their implementation for IOWF models specified with BPEL.	adaptation (computer science);business process execution language;interoperability;logic programming;loose coupling;obedience (human behavior);programming paradigm;run time (program lifecycle phase);service-oriented architecture;unavailability	Saïda Boukhedouma;Mourad Oussalah;Zaia Alimazighi;Dalila Tamzalit	2013	IEEE 7th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS)	10.1109/RCIS.2013.6577722	web service;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;software engineering;service-oriented architecture;database;open system;law	Visualization	-52.38997463587402	16.49519299881215	156835

Apart from that, a new class of event-driven applications is emerging to address business challenges in fraud prevention, risk management, compliance verification, customer service, customer acquisition, cross-sell and more. These applications involve processes that are typically unpredictably non-linear, dynamic, and continuously influenced by outside events. This requires businesses to become more flexible and responsive to the changing needs. SOA a proven principle for driving business agility, when combined with event processing and event responding capabilities can work wonders. It can make business more agile, more responsive to market needs and achieve greater heights. This paper with the help of a case study, proposes the critical success factors for implementation of EDSOA.	agile software development;complex event processing;event-driven architecture;loose coupling;nonlinear gameplay;nonlinear system;programming paradigm;publish and subscribe (mac os);risk management;service-oriented architecture	Sadhana Yogesh Ghalsasi	2009		10.1145/1655925.1656191	simulation;risk management;computer science;marketing;complex event processing;operations management;operating system;service-oriented architecture;database;critical success factor;management;world wide web;computer security	OS	-58.73597800846802	17.858061412962098	156942

The authors have reported the Web-based Remote FPGA Lab (RFL) which provides a novel, real-time control and visualization interface to a remote, always-on FPGA hardware implementation. The RFL helps students to understand and reason about digital systems operation, using interactive animation of signal behavior in an executing digital logic system, at any level of the design hierarchy. The RFL supports the creation of real-time interactive digital systems teaching demos. The article presents student RFL usage data and survey data which highlight improved student engagement, learning and achievement. The article describes the RFL architecture, communication interface, Web page functionality, user access administration and database management.

Unfortunately, not all of them can be identified in advance. Hence, risk management in construction requires proactive as well as reactive treatment. Among the other risk management tasks, risk treatment requires a sound methodology to rapidly develop concrete change actions and alter the corresponding project management plans. In this paper, process modeling techniques are used to develop configurable treatment templates, which describe how treatment can change the schedule plan. Such templates can contribute in structuring configurable reference models which in turn can be tailored and assembled to form up-to-date project schedules. Risk data as a part of reference repository may serve as means of knowledge management by providing all available risk-related information as response to critical events.	agent-based model;knowledge management;process modeling;risk management	Wael Sharmak;Sven-Eric Schapke;Raimar J.

However a review of literature has shown the limited use of such games in teaching concepts related to Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) in the engineering field. The contribution of this paper and the DEG is specific to MRO in offshore wind energy. In our DEG the player mimics the behavior of a single decision maker, namely, the manager of the MRO facility who is responsible for the day-to-day allocation of resources for the upkeep of two offshore wind farms. The game enables the player to learn from a complex planning task wherein idle MRO resources must be minimized. The aim of the game is to prevent loss of revenue brought about through inadequate maintenance of the windfarms. The game is developed in Microsoft Excel using the VBA programming environment.	degree (graph theory);integrated development environment;visual basic for applications	Navonil Mustafee;Anna Wienke;Andi Smart;Phil Godsiff	2015	2015 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		games;simulation;computer science;engineering;graphics;world wide web	AI	-61.076619306895445	4.239234273840761	157943

These efforts have resulted in the development of computer programs (WorkPlan and DePlan) that guide production units in creating reliable work plans. One of these programs was extended to include distributed planning and coordination and space scheduling capabilities as well (WorkMovePlan). During and after the development of these tools, LCI member companies used them and provided valuable feedback. Some of these companies have developed in-house spreadsheet applications to meet their own particular needs. These beta-testers were familiar with the Last Planner concepts, which allowed them to make suggestions based on their conception of the Last Planner methodology. This paper reports on the feedback from the beta-testers of WorkPlan, DePlan, and WorkMovePlan. This feedback provided a foundation for further specifying requirements for the Last Planner computer tools. The paper also discusses barriers to adoption of Last Planner tools in companies that are new to lean construction and in companies that have already started lean transformation.

Inter-Organizational Information Systems (IOIS) have largely been endorsed as B2B enablers, and their middleware components have become critical in integrating processes in heterogeneous systems from different partners. To remain in sync with continuous change of requirements in business environment, processes in these middleware components require continuous lifecycle management from design to retirement. While this is often feasible, replacing legacy processes can be costly, complicated, and discouraging. This research utilizes a multi-methodological approach that interweaves Design Science and Action Research to propose a roadmap for upgrading legacy processes in middleware components of IOIS. The proposed roadmap is generic and customizable to different organizational contexts.	information system;middleware;requirement	Radhouane B. N.

This approach will be generic enough to be adaptable to most, if not all social networks. The subset of bots this focuses on are those that can evade most, if not all current detection methods. This is simply because they have little to no information associated with them that can be analyzed to make a determination. Although any account on any social media site inherently has information associated with it, it is very easy to blend in with the majority of users who are simply lurkers those who only consume content, but do not contribute. How can you determine if an account is a bot if they dont do anything? By the time they act, it will be too late to detect.

Initial implementations of ODA have not, in the main, covered every aspect of the standard: rather, particular applications, such as interworking between existing equipment, have demanded the definition of particular subsets of the base standard, tailored to specific uses.  The ODA standard provides for the definition of such subsets as document application profiles. A key concept in the definition of document application profiles is the “metaclass” or “constituent constraint” by which generalised ODA mechanisms are grouped for the purpose of representing conventional document features such as footnotes.  A specialised notation is required for the precise definition of constituent constraints, which is provided by a proposed Addendum to the base standard.  Particular document application profiles have been developed to support different levels of functionality and combinations of content types. These have now been developed as functional standards by regional standards bodies, and are being progressed as International Standards, thus enabling global document interchange.  Practical experience, such as the document interworking demonstrations mounted by the ESPRIT PODA project, has been formative in arriving at suitable profile definitions, and in their validation.	protection profile	Andy Spiceley	1991	Computer Networks and ISDN Systems	10.1016/0169-7552(91)90036-C	document processing;project;telecommunications;computer science;interconnection;telematics;open system	HCI	-49.642911638780454	6.54863661298848	159201

Nowadays, a user of these algorithms needs an expert knowledge in order to successfully apply them. In this demo, we present the RS4PD, a recommender system that uses portfolio-based algorithm selection strategies to face the following problems: to find the best discovery algorithm for the data at hand, and to allow bridging the gap between general users and process mining algorithms.	algorithm selection;bridging (networking);control flow;recommender system	Joel Ribeiro;Josep Carmona	2014			business process discovery;recommender system;control flow;bridging (networking);process mining;algorithm;algorithm selection;computer science;portfolio	HCI	-61.07795407370854	16.454492838352877	159505

Due to outsourcing and the increasing need for companies to work together to meet their joint customer demands, there is a need for monitoring of business processes across organizational boundaries. Thereby, partners in a choreography have to exchange monitoring data, in order to enable process tracking and evaluation of process metrics. In this paper, we describe an event-based monitoring approach based on BPEL4Chor service choreography descriptions. We show how to define monitoring agreements specifying events each partner in the choreography has to provide. We distinguish between resource events and complex events for calculation of process metrics using complex event processing technology. We present our implementation and evaluate the concepts based on a scenario.	business activity monitoring;business process;complex event processing;organizational behavior;outsourcing;service choreography;service-oriented architecture	Branimir Wetzstein;Dimka Karastoyanova;Oliver Kopp;Frank Leymann;Daniel Zwink	2010		10.1145/1774088.1774601	computer science;knowledge management;complex event processing;service-oriented architecture;database;process management;business process;business process modeling;business activity monitoring	DB	-54.82618342614602	17.464655516223047	159595

Such a contract must encompass seeking consensus among parties in some issues, while simultaneously allowing for competition  in others. Present solutions in contract negotiation are not satisfactory because they do not accommodate such a variety of  needs and negotiation protocols. This paper shows our solution to this problem, discussing how our SPICA negotiation protocol  can be used to build up virtual organizations. It assesses the effectiveness of our approach and discusses the protocol’s  implementation.

These principles are intended to guide the development of a formal foundation for frameworks. Enterprise architecture frameworks organize, manage, and interrelate the wide variety of models used to structure and operate an enterprise. The principles are drawn from analyses of a number of existing frameworks and from observation of and participation in framework development. Since these frameworks involve modeling, some of the principles apply to broader aspects of modeling; other principles apply only to frameworks. As the goal of this work is a requirements speci cation for formalization of frameworks, the paper ends with a sketch of how the identi ed principles might guide this formalization.	enterprise architecture framework;requirement;table (information);tree (data structure)	Richard A.

This situation impedes efficient centralised logistic process control. Autonomously controlled logistic processes are proposed to solve this problem. They use intelligent logistic objects which employ specific infrastructure components to perform process control tasks locally on their own. As the infrastructure configuration task is rarely addressed in literature, this paper sketches a concept for the management of requirements and infrastructure components of autonomous logistic processes. It presents exemplarily requirements and infrastructure components in a tabular organised textual requirements catalogue. Further, the paper introduces an ontological approach to represent the tabular requirements in a computable graphical model allowing to select specific components (semi-) automatically.	autonomous robot;centralisation;computable function;control theory;formal ontology;graphical model;graphical user interface;knowledge base;logistics;microsoft outlook for mac;requirement;table (information)	St. Sowade;Leo Chan;Bernd Scholz-Reiter	2013	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-012-0435-1	simulation;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence;data mining;mechanical engineering	SE	-55.74062834821624	11.836446759760774	160066

To study various kinds of processes, including technological, logistical and business, we use the multi-agent resource conversion process model. To run simulations on such processes more and more computational resources are required. Due to this, an important problem is search and use of new principles for building and analyzing multi-agent models of resource conversion processes. In order to analyze and simulate these processes we suggest a method for analysis and debottlenecking the multi-agent resource conversion process, which is based on integration of the named process model with operational analysis of probabilistic networks, multi-agent approach and expert systems. The paper presents the results of experimental comparison of the new method, suggested by the authors, with the critical path method. The developed principles of building the multi-agent process models and the analysis and debottlenecking method for the named process have been implemented in the automated system for metallurgical production.	process modeling	Konstantin A.

To ensure smooth delivery and continuous profitability, it is critical for the service providers to leverage the experiences and lessons learnt from the historical contracts and prevent similar issues from reoccurring in the future. In this context, we investigate how to predict potential risks for new contracts based on their similarities with existing ones. A critical challenge along this line is to effectively measure the similarity between the contracts. To this end, extending from the Mahalanobis distance metric learning framework, we develop a new approach to gauge contract similarity using expert assessment data collected prior to contract signing (so called """"contract fingerprints""""). A key advantage of the proposed method is the ability to train model with not only continuous distance measures between contract pairs, but also the binary side information of dissimilar pairs. Finally, experimental results on real-world service contract data show that our proposed approach greatly outperforms existing benchmarks, and can provide more accurate contract risk assessment."""	déjà vu;experience;experiment;fingerprint;gradient descent;ibm notes;iterative method;performance;risk assessment;risk management	Zhongmou Li;Shu Tao;Hui Xiong	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing	10.1109/SCC.2014.28	contract management;actuarial science;operations management;data mining;business	SE	-53.00265751731887	7.482295589461809	160111

Every expert having his own formalisms and tools, integration and collaboration of the expert tools has become a challenge to avoid design conflict along the product lifecycle. The synchronisation of heterogeneous representation of product will be a major step to integrate expert activities. In this paper, the authors propose 1) a constraint-based model to maintain complex relationships in multi-disciplinary collaborative design during synchronisation process, 2) a meta-rule concept to control the constraint network in design leading to a new notification mechanism for presenting conflict to all corresponding actors. These results should contribute to the improvement of collaborative design.	conflict resolution strategy;rule 90;semiconductor consolidation	Mohsen Sadeghi;Khaled Hadj-Hamou;Frédéric Noël	2010	Int.

fea620f79fa44adb0d698f8b04be329e3aabaa81	case management: an evaluation of existing approaches for knowledge-intensive processes		Process support for knowledge work is far from being mastered in existing information systems. Predominant workflow management solutions are too rigid and provide no means to deal with unpredictable situations. Various case management approaches have been proposed to support this flexibility for unstructured processes. Recently the Object Management Group published the Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) as a standard notation for case management. In this paper we compare prominent definitions of case management over the last twenty-three years against characteristics of knowledge-intensive processes (KiPs). Our goal is to evaluate the applicability of case management and CMMN for KiPs. We provide requirements for execution environments implementing CMMN and delineate existing case management approaches to advance the understanding of this important domain. We concluded that CMMN seems to be a suitable approach to KiPs when combined with an appropriate execution environment.	baseline (configuration management);definition;information system;requirement	Mike A.

Service licensing enables broader usage of services and a means for designing business strategies and relationships. A service license describes the terms and conditions for the use and access of the service in a machine interpretable way that services could be able to understand. Service-based applications are largely grounded on composition of independent services. In that scenario, license compatibility is a complex issue, requiring careful attention before attempting to merge licenses. The permissions and the prohibitions imposed by the licenses of services would deeply impact the composition. Thus, service licensing requires a comprehensive analysis on composition of these rights and requirements conforming to the nature of operations performed and compensation of services used in composition. In this paper, we analyze the compatibility of service license by describing a matchmaking algorithm. Further, we illustrate the composability of service licenses by creating a composite service license, that is compatible with the licenses being composed.	algorithm;composability;interaction;interoperability;license compatibility;requirement;service-oriented modeling;world wide web	G.

Finally, a Gaussian mixture model is trained for each user using these features.

However, despite being based on a simple concept -- and user evaluations consistently reporting impressive memory retention -- only one commercial example exists and overall take-up is low. Barriers to uptake include a perceived vulnerability to observation attacks; issues regarding deployability; and the impact of innocuous design decisions on security not being formalized. Our contribution is to dissect each of these issues in the context of mobile devices -- a particularly suitable application domain due to their increasing significance, and high potential to attract unauthorized access. This produces: 1) A novel yet simple solution to the intersection attack that permits greater variability in login challenges; 2) Detailed analysis of the shoulder surfing threat that considers both simulated and human testing; 3) A first look at image processing techniques to contribute towards automated photograph filtering. We operationalize our observations and gather data in a field context where decentralized mechanisms of varying entropy were installed on the personal devices of participants.

In a given enterprise, individuals acting in various roles contribute to the modeling, development, deployment, and management of the security aspects of a business application. We look at the business-application life cycle and propose a policy-driven approach overlaid on a model-driven paradigm for addressing security requirements. Our approach suggests that security policies are to be modeled using policies and rule templates associated with business processes and models, designed and implemented through infrastructure-managed or application-managed environments based on modeled artifacts, deployed into an infrastructure and potentially customized to meet the security requirements of the consumer, and monitored and managed to reflect a consistent set of policies across the enterprise and all layers of its application infrastructure. We use a pragmatic approach to identify intersection points between the platform-independent modeling of security policies and their concrete articulation and enforcement. This approach offers a way to manage and monitor systems behavior for adherence and compliance to policies. Monitoring may be enabled through both information technology (IT) and business dashboards. Systematic approaches to connect business artifacts to implementation artifacts help implement business policies in system implementations. Best practices and security usage patterns influence the design of reusable and customizable templates. Because interoperability and portability are important in service-oriented architecture (SOA) environments, we list enhancements to standards (e.g., Business Process Execution Language [BPEL], Unified Modeling LanguageTM [UML®]) that must be addressed to achieve an effective life cycle.	application security	Nataraj Nagaratnam;Anthony J.

A primary need is to develop semantic interpretations related to business processes and documents to all value chain partners. We propose a semantic Web service oriented framework to fulfil the task using OWLS. We present a product family ontology and sketches of two core services: Product configuration and product lifecycle cost estimation. We believe that with the benefits of rich semantic descriptions from OWLS, effective value chain integration can be developed-this is the key to successful mass customization.	business process;semantic web service	Haifeng Liu;Wee Keong Ng;Bin Song;Xiang Li;Wen Feng Lu	2007	The 2nd IEEE Asia-Pacific Service Computing Conference (APSCC 2007)	10.1109/APSCC.2007.18	web service;web modeling;computer science;knowledge management;ws-policy;data mining;database;web intelligence;law	DB	-50.91765189845062	12.011320645058454	162120

In normal industrial robot programming, the path is created and the process is based on the path. Here a process-focused method is proposed, where a task can be split in sub-tasks, one for each part of the process with similar process-characteristics. By carefully encapsulating the information needed to execute a sub-task, this component can be re-used whenever the actual sub-task occurs. Applications using system design do not change between simulation and actual shop floor runs and the system allows a mix of realand simulated components during simulation and run-time.	admissible numbering;industrial robot;robot software;simulation;systems design	Per Cederberg;Magnus Olsson;Gunnar Bolmsjö	2005	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574705001669	simulation;engineering;manufacturing engineering;systems design	Robotics	-54.693592706144194	11.404654485938297	163922

Sharing product information must precede for the integration. However, because most of the participants have different business experience and business domains, interoperability of product information among enterprises should be guaranteed for collaboration. To achieve interoperability, we suggest product ontology architecture through the investigation of generic ontology architecture. We first suggest 4-layered ontology architecture for an integrated value chain. Extending this ontology architecture, we develop product ontology architecture which facilitates building product ontologies that are referred to all related participants inbound and outbound of the enterprise for collaboration. Using a product ontology, each enterprise can have semantic interoperability across each other for collaborative works. Because product ontologies have the feature of evolving through product lifecycle, the proposed product ontology architecture reflects this evolving feature to guarantee semantic interoperability. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To promote the application of grid technologies in the manufacturing industry, a framework for a manufacturing grid (MG) has been expatiated. The framework is composed of a network infrastructure layer, a manufacturing resource aggregation layer, a manufacturing resource management layer, a manufacturing service application layer and a MG portal layer. Modelling manufacturing resources, one key technology of implementing the MG application system, has been studied intensively. A manufacturing resource hierarchy model (MRHM), which consists of a manufacturing resource layer, a resource expressing layer and a resource interface layer, is proposed. In the model, various manufacturing resources are aggregated into a resource layer; all resource information is encapsulated in an information expressing layer employing XML (extensible markup language) schema; all accessing operations to resources are defined in the resource interface layer using WSDL (web service description language). Lastly, being the validation of MRHM, a standard part library system based on Unigraphics18.0 and SQL Server2000 is encapsulated as a resource node in the MG. The node provides online services like querying information for standard parts, viewing and downloading geometry models of standard parts, and so on.

In print media industries networked production requires advanced print and media specific job definitions and the communication of job relevant information along the complete production chain. The relatively young XML based communication standard JDF/JMF allows to specify workflow models and data exchange. Based on an object-oriented approach a simulation and modeling framework is proposed, which implements modules for the resources and controls applied in this particular industry. For this framework the available JavaSim-simulation library shall be extended to enable modeling of networked print production using the same JDF-/JMF-communication algorithms as applied in realworld system communication. This leads towards integration of simulation for factory planning and operative planning and control of networked print production in a digital factory environment.	3d modeling;algorithm;digital media;java media framework;printing;simulation;xml	Wolfgang Kuehn	2008	2008 Winter Simulation Conference		data exchange;xml;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;mean squared error;multimedia;world wide web	HPC	-56.45123940123048	12.93150509318786	164328

However, the process analysis phase may fail in some cases because it focuses either on the data perspective and ignores business activities, or on the functional and behavioral perspectives of the business process and overlooks the data. Indeed, traditional analysis approaches are based on models that do not represent all of these business process perspectives together. Recently, Entity-Centric Modeling has been proposed as a promising approach for the design of business processes based on so-called business entities. It aims to bring together business goals, business operations and business data in a natural way. In this paper, we propose a method to design an enterprise view based on business entities in order to bring together data and processes in a coherent and consistent way. The constructed view provides for an integrated analysis of data and processes. Our method takes as input a domain class diagram of the enterprise information system and a BPMN model representing its business process model, and it constructs a business entity model using the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) language.	business process model and notation;class diagram;coherence (physics);domain model;enterprise information system;entity;information model;process modeling;word lists by frequency	Imen Jellali;Mounira Ben-Abdallah;Nahla Zaaboub Haddar;Hanêne Ben-Abdallah	2015	2015 12th International Joint Conference on e-Business and Telecommunications (ICETE)	10.5220/0005573301000108	business model;business object;business analysis;business domain;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;function model;business case;process modeling;data mining;business process model and notation;business analytics;process management;business process;business process discovery;management;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	DB	-55.94368482514343	17.96053715425485	164367

Automatic feature recognition from CAD solid systems highly impacts the level of integration. CAD files contain detailed geometric information of a part, which are not suitable for using in the downstream applications such as process planning. Different CAD or geometric modeling packages store the information related to the design in their own databases. Structures of these databases are different from each other. As a result no common or standard structure has been developed so far, that can be used by all CAD packages. For that reason this paper proposes an intelligent feature recognition methodology (IFRM) to develop a feature recognition system which has the ability to communicate with various CAD/ CAM systems. The proposed methodology is developed for 3D prismatic parts that are created by using solid modeling package by using CSG technique as a drawing tool. The system takes a neutral file in Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) format as input and translates the information in the file to manufacturing information. The boundary (B-rep) geometrical information of the part design is then analyzed by a feature recognition program that is created specifically to extract the features from the geometrical information based on a geometric reasoning approach by using object oriented design software which is included in C++ language. A feature recognition algorithm is used to recognize different features of the part such as step, holes, etc. Finally, a sample application description for a workpiece is presented for demonstration purposes. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

NDSVNS mainly uses the pattern recognition techniques to setup a Stolen Vehicle Identification System (SVIS), and integrates multiple heterogeneous databases of different city and county police departments. Each database functions as a stand-alone entity, but they are also connected by Police VPN. These heterogeneous databases include stolen vehicle data and license plate recognition records from 26 city and county police departments across this island. To share the valuable information, firstly Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) unified the data format of license plate recognition records and exchange formats on Police VPN. Secondly, some appropriate locations are selected in all cities and counties and toll stations of highways to install SVIS. In this paper, system design and deployment for a National Detecting Stolen Vehicles Network System is presented.	sensor;software deployment	Weiping Chang;Chingwei Su	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13601-6_3	simulation;computer science;data mining;computer security;systems design	Mobile	-51.64731814828236	4.8144348695439785	164866

Making appropriate decisions is inevitably bound to the availability and provision of relevant information. Information systems should be able to provide information in an efficient way. Thus, within information systems development a detailed analysis of information supply and information demands has to prevail. Based on Syperski’s information set and subset-model we will give an epistemological foundation of information modeling in general and show, why conceptual modeling in particular is capable of specifying effective and efficient information systems. Furthermore, we derive conceptual modeling requirements based on our findings. A short example illustrates the usefulness of a conceptual data modeling technique for the specification of information systems.	americas conference on information systems;data modeling;information model;information system;microsoft outlook for mac;requirement;software development process	Björn Niehaves;Michael Ribbert;Alexander Dreiling;Roland Holten	2004			idef1x;data modeling;conceptual model;information engineering;data model;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;three schema approach;information mapping;information integration;management information systems;management science;information quality;modeling language;information architecture	Web+IR	-60.2365117975522	13.867636139250056	164979

Each task involves various areas of knowledge and experience. However, successful collaborative product design depends on the ability to effectively manage and share engineering knowledge and experience throughout the entire development process. Consequently, the realization of distributed engineering knowledge management, which not only supports collaborative product design but also accumulates and utilizes corporate memory situated at various locations, has become one of the key tasks managed by industries. This paper presents a distributed engineering knowledge management approach for the practice of collaborative product design. In developing the proposed approach, a CPD-based engineering knowledge management methodology is first proposed under the concepts of knowledge management and collaboration. This methodology includes a knowledge management-oriented engineering management work model, a distributed engineering knowledge management framework, and rules and methods for managing engineering knowledge. The CPD-based engineering knowledge management system framework is designed, on the basis of this proposed methodology. Finally, a CPD-based engineering knowledge management system is developed using unified modeling language (UML) modeling techniques.	knowledge management	Yuh-Jen Chen;Yuh-Min Chen;Hui-Chuan Chu	2008	Computers in Industry	10.1016/j.compind.2007.10.001	unified modeling language;knowledge base;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;operations management;applied engineering;knowledge engineering;knowledge extraction;personal knowledge management;product design;knowledge value chain;management;domain knowledge;production engineering;product engineering	DB	-62.47865726828323	12.830503274906258	165450

This workshop considers the design of the user interfaces of such systems. Some of these user interfaces must enable coping with cognitively demanding situations. The workshop will, in addition, consider the process of designing these systems. The possibly most difficult part of the design regards the attempt to identify all the possible critical cases. This may require the participation of different kinds of experts and employing methods designed for uncovering difficult-to-detect critical cases. The design of dependable systems may thus involve a most demanding kind of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW).	computer-supported cooperative work;control system;dependability;human factors and ergonomics;user interface	Eliezer Kantorowitz	2013		10.1145/2501907.2501964	reliability engineering;real-time computing;system of systems;systems engineering;engineering;life-critical system	EDA	-57.99705099670191	4.745265473557942	165688

The concept of designinstitute is introduced where, based on visionary systemdesign demonstrators, new methodologies, tools, librariesand courses are created and distributed over the globalnetwork. Design institutes provide a learning school fornew design paradigms and form the ideal environment forthe education of global system designers.	systems engineering;very-large-scale integration	Hugo De Man	1997		10.1145/266021.266115	embedded system;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;integer programming;electronic design automation;covering problems;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;silicon;logic;computer engineering;mechanical engineering	EDA	-55.05020098170378	5.18671491719568	165771

We affirm that Enterprise Architecture Descriptions are an important part of the necessary communication in information systems development and maintenance. This article is about categorizing the models that describe Business-to-Business integration (B2Bi) practices, and identifying the numerous ways B2Bi issues could and should be described. The framework we propose is based on lessons learnt from proven architecture description frameworks. The Zachman framework forms the basis of the Framework for the Architectural Description of the Extended Enterprise (the FADEE) presented in this paper. It changes the communication between CIO and CEO, what results in more involvement of the CIO in the strategy making process.	business continuity;business requirements;categorization;chief information officer;enterprise architecture;extended enterprise;information system;software development process;zachman framework	Frank G.

Such businesses are becoming increasingly federated, loosely coupled, and distributed. They are also generating a huge number of events ranging from record entries representing business activities to more technical events at various granularity levels.2 Internet-based systems and middleware now integrate massive amounts of diverse data (email, PDF attachments, database records, system logs, phone calls, videos, photos, and so on) from distributed and heterogeneous sources and make it widely available. Furthermore, the proliferation of online collaboration tools and platforms such as YouTube, Flickr, Facebook, LinkedIn, Chatter, Second Life, Many Eyes, Pinterest, and many others have made it easier for people to collaborate.3,4 This has enabled the growth of ad hoc, peopledriven, informal processes. Industries such as healthcare, insurance, and banking have witnessed explosive growth in such processes.5–13 Dynamic and collective activities are characterized by their flexibility and data-driven nature. Automobile insurance claims processing, order processing of prescription drugs, patient case management in a hospital, and recovery and response assistance during natural disasters are a few examples. The execution of such informal processes isn’t always controlled by a predefined model or a single execution runtime.14 Various factors, including human judgment and document contents, determine the set of activities that humans involved in such activities must perform and in what order those activities are executed. This special issue focuses on challenges and solutions involved in handling Internet-enabled dynamic collective work activities.	agile software development;attachments;database;email;federation (information technology);flickr;hoc (programming language);internet;loose coupling;middleware;portable document format;second life	Geetika T.

IT's charter is now closely aligned with the business goals and processes in a company and to support this charter, enterprise application architecture is shifting towards what's commonly referred to as a services-oriented architecture (SOA), or an enterprise-services architecture [1, 2]. In this talk, I want to discuss the shift to this new architecture and some ramifications of this, in particular some challenges posed by this shift for our research community to pursue.	applications architecture;enterprise software;service innovation;service-oriented architecture	Vishal Sikka	2005		10.1145/1066157.1066264	enterprise architecture framework;information technology architecture;reference architecture;the open group architecture framework;space-based architecture;website architecture;database-centric architecture;nist enterprise architecture model;data management;computer science;knowledge management;architecture domain;applications architecture;operations architecture;service-oriented modeling;service-oriented architecture;enterprise architecture management;database;service;solution architecture;management science;enterprise architecture;view model;information technology;enterprise information security architecture;data architecture;business architecture	OS	-58.704906049420885	17.334291526090578	167268
dffba0457bf84164e12f09f821071cf1cabfe0d7	aplying the kofi methodology to improve knowledge flows in a manufacturing process	knowledge flow	Development of methods to integrate Knowledge Management (KM) in organizational processes is an open issue. KM should facilitate the flow of knowledge from where it is created or stored, to where it is needed to be applied. Therefore, an initial step towards the integration of KM in organizational processes should be the analysis of the way in which knowledge is actually flowing in these processes, and then, to propose alternatives to improve that flow. This paper presents the use of the Knowledge Flow Identification (KoFI) methodology as a means to improve a manufacturing process knowledge flow. Since KoFI was initially developed to analyze software processes, in this paper we illustrate how it can also be used in a manufacturing domain. The results of the application of KoFI are also presented, which include the design of a knowledge portal and an initial evaluation from its potential users.	application domain;business process modeling language;cognitive map;knowledge management;linear algebra;requirement	Oscar M.

These logs have to meet minimum requirements, i.e. each event should refer to a case and a task. Many system logs do not meet these requirements, and therefore it is not possible to use process mining for process optimization or delta analysis. This paper shows an alternative process mining procedure for logs containing data on the frequency that process steps have been executed. To be able to mine such logs we apply Configurable Event-driven Process Chains (C-EPCs). If a C-EPC is available, we propose a method to mine the process. If only a classical reference model (i.e. an EPC) is available, we propose a method to first derive the C-EPC through mining and then analyse the process. This approach enables us to do process mining in the context of ERP systems such as the SAP solutions.	electronic product code;enterprise information system;event-driven process chain;mathematical optimization;process modeling;process optimization;reference model;requirement	Monique H.

The building of such global VMISs, raises important issues of marketing, management, and operation. In this paper, a powerful conceptual framework for such VMISs is presented using the knowledge representation language Telos. This framework is developed and based on careful analysis and abstraction of VMISs, using a real-world virtual market as an example. Capabilities of this integrated hybrid modelling framework include meta-level facilities, constraint enforcement, and inference facilities. By creating rich ontologies, this method provides a comprehensive framework for analysis, design, and investment decisions involving future VMISs.

94934ea8c8163641c7625edd7751d99e5dd71ec4	the intelligent computer aided satellite designer icasd - creating viable configurations for modular satellites		The introduction of modular satellite systems rep- resents an attractive goal pursued by several aerospace agencies as well as scientific institutions worldwide. Advantages in robustness, long-term use and production are only few examples that speak for modularity. The downside to modularity is the still prevailing complexity of designing satellites and their building blocks. The intelligent Computer Aided Satellite Designer (iCASD) was developed initially to speed up this design process. The tedious work of fitting, placing and integrating multiple components is especially time consuming since every building block comes with often competing restrictions. The presented tool uses the modularity of satellite components, and turns the design process into an abstracted problem capable to be solved by methods such as the proposed genetic algorithm. In this paper, we will present the underlying processes, how building blocks and corresponding rules are modelled and how a optimal configuration is calculated with this comprehensive tool.	genetic algorithm	Timothee Buettner;Atanas Tanev;Lars Pfotzer;Arne Rönnau;Rüdiger Dillmann	2018	2018 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)	10.1109/AHS.2018.8541366	real-time computing;genetic algorithm;computer-aided;software;robustness (computer science);engineering design process;computer science;modular design;design process;modularity;distributed computing	AI	-57.159608932754814	12.756882703227896	167959
6e74890b37d80e94fe7eb12919724390a27a2e3d	anonymizing personal text messages posted in online social networks and detecting disclosures of personal information	fingerprint	While online social networking is a popular way for people to share information, it carries the risk of unintentionally disclosing personal information. One way to reduce this risk is to anonymize personal information in messages before they are posted. Furthermore, if personal information is somehow disclosed, the person who disclosed it should be identifiable. Several methods developed for anonymizing personal information in natural language text simply remove sensitive phrases, making the anonymized text message unnatural. Other methods change the message by using synonymization or structural alteration to create fingerprints for detecting disclosure, but they do not support the creation of a sufficient number of fingerprints for friends of an online social network user. We have developed a system for anonymizing personal information in text messages that generalizes sensitive phrases. It also creates a sufficient number of fingerprints of a message by using synonyms so that, if personal information is revealed online, the person who revealed it can be identified. A distribution metric is used to ensure that the degree of anonymization is appropriate for each group of friends. A threshold is used to improve the naturalness of the fingerprinted messages so that they do not catch the attention of attackers. Evaluation using about 55,000 personal tweets in English demonstrated that our system creates sufficiently natural fingerprinted messages for friends and groups of friends. The practicality of the system was demonstrated by creating a web application for controlling messages posted on Facebook. key words: fingerprint, anonymized text message, disclosure detection, online social network	anonymous web browsing;data anonymization;fingerprint;natural language;personally identifiable information;sensor;social network;web application	Hoang-Quoc Nguyen-Son;Minh-Triet Tran;Hiroshi Yoshiura;Noboru Sonehara;Isao Echizen	2015	IEICE Transactions		fingerprint;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-50.162899237620344	5.22362631814313	167981

However, business processes are known to be complex and distributed among multiple business entities. As a result, the impact of new IT on an entire business process is typically unknown as quantitative methods for evaluation are missing. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a process‐oriented methodology for evaluating the impact of IT on a business process. In our method, process mining and discrete event simulation are key ingredients. Based on automatically stored data, process mining allows for obtaining detailed knowledge on a business process, e.g., it can be discovered how a business process is actually executed. Using discrete event simulation, a model can be build which accurately mimics the discovered process and which can subsequently be used for exploring and evaluating various redesign of the same process. Our method is evaluated by means of a detailed case study. For two complex dental processes, it turns out that the introduction of new digital technologies is largely beneficial for patients and dental lab owners, whereas for dentists there is hardly any benefit.	business process;entity;simulation	R.

Local, remote and grid services were integrated by using Web services and REST Service technologies. The common CAE tasks in simulation system were abstracted into appropriate granularity simulation components.

In functional-logical structure, behavior representation assures concept level virtual execution of the model. Product development purpose of model is extended to support of CPS product operation. Emerging knowledge driven engineering will increasingly require organized intelligent property (IP) in the future. Using former own research results, this paper introduces a novel concept and methodology for active knowledge support the above purposes of product model by information content (IC) driving of product representation and cyber CPS unit entities. IC is formerly defined as purposeful organized and personalized knowledge in the background of decision on product information. Main contributions of the reported work are new active information content (AIC) structure to establish CPS enabled IC and new multilevel transfer structure to connect AIC to various organized IP environments. After discussion of relevant cyber-physical and product model characteristics and features, the proposed scenario of active IC driving and relevant system of driving contextual connections are explained and discussed. Following this, IP entity transfer structure is proposed to communicate IC with AIC structure. Implementation of results is planned in host industrial professional modeling system.

We have performed a comprehensive state of the art analysis and present some findings here. In parallel, the two industrial participants in the project have specified their requirements and expectations regarding modernization of their applications. The SOA paradigm implies the breakdown of architecture into high-grain components providing business services. For taking advantage of the services of cloud computing technologies, the clients' architecture should be decomposed, decoupled and be made scalable. Also requirements regarding servers, data storage and security, networking and response time, business models and pricing should be projected. We present software engineering challenges related to these aspects and examples of these in the context of one of the industrial cases in the project.	agile software development;cloud computing;computer data storage;eclipse process framework;legacy code;model-driven architecture;programming paradigm;requirement;response time (technology);scalability;server (computing);service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;software architecture;software deployment;software engineering	Parastoo Mohagheghi;Thor Sæther	2011	2011 IEEE World Congress on Services	10.1109/SERVICES.2011.26	computer science;systems engineering;software engineering;computer engineering	SE	-58.12614994525939	18.052059560772573	169473

This is challenging due to the fact that events from this environment are often heterogeneous, lack process instance information, and their import and visualisation in traditional process engines is not sufficiently supported. To address these challenges, we implemented GET Controller and UNICORN, two systems that together enable event-driven process execution and monitoring. Their application is shown for a logistics scenario.	controller (computing);event-driven programming;logistics	Anne Baumgraß;Claudio Di Ciccio;Remco M.

The R&D activity in microelectronics and microfabrication field concerns with continuous innovations in the fabrication processes and with new devices to be developed. For this reason, the scientific and technological know-how shared among the research team is continuously growing and so are the variables to be studied and monitored. Some of the device is also produced in small series. All the detailed information and the related instructions about the fabrication process are necessary not only to researchers, who design the device and supervise the wafer processing in the clean-room, but especially to the specialised technical staff, who needs to have all the instructions from the researchers. Contrary to commercial software available, generally designed for standard and stable production processes, """"WebFabIS"""" is a system: • flexible: the researchers can include new technological steps by himself; • easy to use also to non-expert users: the GUIs are browser pages and the program is activated by typing an URL address; • open to several users but safe: an identification system allows to many users to access the system with the possibility to decide what information to share and what to keep private; • """"active"""": specific algorithms extract new information from the database of the system in order to help the researchers in monitoring the device processing and the laboratory manager in the monitoring of the resources. Furthermore, it must provide traditional functions, such us indication to the technical staff about the processing to be done, planning, yield and cost estimation. The low budget of the used tools and their portability to several platforms, resulted in an additional advantage with respect to systems available. From the software point of view, """"WebFabIS"""", is based on modern design (UML, OO) and implementation technologies (JAVA, HTML, servlets, relational database, WEB browser interface). For the implementation the following components have been chosen: • a relational database: where all the information of the system are stored (PostgreSQL 6.5.3); • a database driver: it allows the connection from the web server to the tables (JDBC); • java and java servlets: used for the implementation of the browser interface (in html pages) and for the processing of the information (JAVA2, JSDK2.0); • a web server (Apache Server1.3.19); • a java servlet engine: it manages through the http protocol the communication between the client (user interaction with browser) and the server (database and java code) (Apache JServlet Server 1.1); • a web browser: it allows for user-system interaction (Netscape, InternetExplorer and so on). The strong attention paid to the OO representation of the data allows to extend the system capabilities to new technologies and devices without changes in the source code. Further it can be adapted to other environments such as industrial plants, both in microelectronics and not. “WebFabIS” has been installed and is now used by the clean-room of the IMTEK, University of Freiburg (Germany)."""	algorithm;apache tomcat;cleanroom;commercial software;html;hypertext transfer protocol;information system;internet explorer;jdbc;java servlet;microfabrication;point of view (computer hardware company);postgresql;programming tool;relational database;scheduling (computing);semiconductor device fabrication;server (computing);software portability;unified modeling language;web server;world wide web	Lorenza Ferrario;Cristiana Armaroli	2001		10.1109/ICSM.2001.972732	unified modeling language;relational database;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;manufacturing;fabrication;programming language;java;microelectronics;information system;web server;manufacturing engineering	DB	-59.377434432230224	6.7231351937853585	170125

In order to retain flexibility even during business process re-engineering, the explicit modelling of business process aspects separately from the application system components is desired. The most prominent technology to serve this purpose is workflow management, which is a groupware technology and mainly focuses on the collaboration of people. Recently developer of distributed object platforms start to provide services that initially aimed at managing distributed transactions but also allow for the modelling and enactment of communication sequences between distributed objects. We have applied the workflow management approach practically within a heterogeneous laboratory environment integrating typical radiology application systems. Here, we compare our experiences with what can be expected from such a distributed object platform taking Microsoft’s BizTalk as example.

488f243bd0793ab489862971a24ad1c2ea10b818	a combined design structure matrix (dsm) and discrete differential evolution (dde) approach for scheduling and organizing system development tasks modelled using sysml	discrete differential evolution;sequencing;systems engineering process;design structure matrix;model based systems engineering	During a system engineering process there are an important number of tasks that need to be organized, mapped together and recursively considered. The tasks that are mapped together are exchanging different flows of information and material. In this type of iterative processes, significant savings in term of development time can be made by providing a method that is optimizing the amount of feedbacks and iterations to the minimal level simply required for the successful development of the system. Task scheduling in a system engineering process can become extremely complex. Nevertheless it is a crucial step of the early stages of the systems engineering process for time-to-market, cost-efficiency and quality reasons. In this article, the authors are proposing to combine a computational approach (Discrete Differential Evolution) with Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) for minimizing iterations and reducing lead-time development. The present article is contributing to recent research works using Design Structure Matrixes (DSM) and computational methods for visualizing and analyzing systems engineering processes. The paper is proposing a framework integrating a model-based approach and a DSM based analysis of the process architecture to assist system engineers in organizing and scheduling tasks. As a result, this framework allows engineers to automatically populate DSMs generated from MBSE models developed in SysML. A specific stereotype is proposed to represent system development tasks in SysML. The sequencing of the engineering tasks is optimized with the application of a Discrete Differential Evolution algorithm (DDE) taking into account the different constraints. The practical use of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the case study of a mobile robot developed for the Eurobot competition. The article also discusses the possibility to use the current framework to analyze the impact of requirement changes on the scheduling of development tasks.	design structure matrix;differential evolution;dynamic data exchange;scheduling (computing);systems modeling language	Sarayut Nonsiri;François Christophe;Eric Coatanéa;Faisal Mokammel	2014	J.

The increasing automation and tighter quality constraints related to these processes make the operator's job more and more difficult. This makes decision support systems (DSSs) for the operator more important than ever before. A traditional operator support system (OSS) focuses only on specific tasks that are performed. In the case of complex processes, the design of an integrated information system is extremely important. The proposed data-warehouse-based OSS makes possible linking complex and isolated production units based on the integration of the heterogenous information collected from the production units of a complex production process. The developed OSS is based on a data warehouse designed by following the proposed focus-on-process data-warehouse-design approach, which means stronger focus on the material and information flow through the entire enterprise. The resulting OSS follows the process through the organization instead of focusing separate tasks of the isolated process units. For human-computer interaction, front-end tools have been worked out, where exploratory data analysis and advanced multivariate statistical models are applied to extract the most informative features of the operation of the technology. The concept is illustrated by an industrial case study, where the OSS is designed for the monitoring and control of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plant	decision support system;distributed manufacturing;human–computer interaction;information flow (information theory);information system;open sound system;statistical model	Peter Pach;Balazs Feil;Sandor Z.

cb0c18b56765deba292ef2f582f0fd2654c75f9d	business process-centered big data analysis for collaborative task systems		Though cloud computing technology is usually used to analyze big data, for business data produced by collaborative task system, the massive business data sets should be analyzed from a business process perspective, more than a technology perspective. To achieve the goal, an analysis approach based on iterative computation is proposed. Firstly, taking data sequence analysis in collaborative workflows for instance, massive business data is partitioned horizontally and vertically. In the horizontal level, the complete workflow is considered as the basic unit of data analysis. In the vertical level, massive business data is partitioned to segments, the size of which depends on the load capacity. Then, sequential relationship matrix is used to represent the relationship between data sets, and the data sequences are calculated iteratively segment by segment and combined. The results of the analysis are represented as a more accurate data sequence model. Finally, the proposed approach has been tested with a simulation experiments and a case analysis respectively.	big data;business process;cloud computing;computation;experiment;iterative method;sequence analysis;simulation	Mengxia Liang;Haibo Li;Ting He	2016	2016 9th International Conference on Service Science (ICSS)	10.1109/ICSS.2016.29	business process;data virtualization;business process modeling;data mining;business intelligence;data modeling;data warehouse;artifact-centric business process model;business domain;computer science	ML	-53.6754651691591	16.75650713911585	170834

0bfee412a7d9c4b8107623341695be7e62442d87	towards online spam filtering in social networks		Online social networks (OSNs) are extremely popular among Internet users. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, they are also effective tools for executing spam campaigns. In this paper, we present an online spam filtering system that can be deployed as a component of the OSN platform to inspect messages generated by users in real-time. We propose to reconstruct spam messages into campaigns for classification rather than examine them individually. Although campaign identification has been used for offline spam analysis, we apply this technique to aid the online spam detection problem with sufficiently low overhead. Accordingly, our system adopts a set of novel features that effectively distinguish spam campaigns. It drops messages classified as “spam” before they reach the intended recipients, thus protecting them from various kinds of fraud. We evaluate the system using 187 million wall posts collected from Facebook and 17 million tweets collected from Twitter. In different parameter settings, the true positive rate reaches 80.9% while the false positive rate reaches 0.19% in the best case. In addition, it stays accurate for more than 9 months after the initial training phase. Once deployed, it can constantly secure the OSNs without the need for frequent re-training. Finally, tested on a server machine with eight cores (Xeon E5520 2.2Ghz) and 16GB memory, the system achieves an average throughput of 1580 messages/sec and an average processing latency of 21.5ms on the Facebook dataset.	anti-spam techniques;best, worst and average case;email filtering;online and offline;overhead (computing);real-time locating system;sensitivity and specificity;server (computing);social network;spamming;throughput	Hongyu Gao;Yan Chen;Kathy Lee;Diana Palsetia;Alok N.

9dbc868cda9e87e195be46dd20ee7153d6ac82d5	ontological modeling of spatial shaft-position knowledge for steam turbine rotor		Large business enterprises rely heavily on their human capital. The human capital consists of domain knowledge, experience, analytical and creativity levels. It is recognized that, creativity levels and analytical skills are traits of individuals. All these need to be captured by the use of suitable knowledge capturing techniques, particularly due to exponential knowledge growth in all domains of technology. Ontological modeling has the potential to capture such knowledge, and organize it in a structured format based on the concepts and their mutual relations. It can capture the analytical and creative rationale of design and troubleshooting, besides incorporating specific design sub-routines for tasks. This paper discusses an ontology based model, which stores knowledge for the positioning-system of steam turbine rotor. The efficacy of the model has been demonstrated in capturing this domain knowledge, which can be used by the design and the maintenance personnel and thereby, increase their efficiency.	r.o.t.o.r.;steam	Piyush Gupta;O.

dce8728e0a188f99917209a9ef32d7bdf35552ce	conformance checking and performance improvement in scheduled processes	scheduled processes;queueing networks;process mining;scheduling;statistical inference;conformance checking;process improvement	Conceptual models of service processes enable operational analysis and may be constructed automatically from event logs containing recorded traces of process execution. In this work, we target the analysis of resource-driven, scheduled processes based on event logs. Specifically, we approach the questions of conformance checking (how to assess the conformance of the schedule and the actual process execution) and performance improvement (how to improve the operational process performance). The first question is addressed based on a comparative analysis of queueing networks for both the schedule and the actual process execution. These results of this analysis are used to improve the operational performance of a process: we suggest adaptations of the scheduling policy of the service process to decrease the tardiness (non-punctuality) and lower the flow time. The work summarized in this extended abstract has been published in [Se16]. 1 Operational Analysis of Scheduled Processes Service systems play a fundamental role in domains such as transportation and the health sector. Services are provisioned by a service process [Du13, Da11], broadly defined by a set of activities that are executed by a service provider to serve particular clients. We focus on service processes that are multi-stage and scheduled. The former means that there is a series of interactions between a client and a service provider, or specific resources at a provider’s end. Scheduled processes, in turn, are structured such that the arrival of clients as well as the basic activities of handling their requests are largely known in advance. In this work, we target operational analysis of such multi-stage scheduled service processes. Specifically, we elaborate on methods to answer the following two questions: how to assess the conformance of a pre-defined schedule of a service process to its actual execution? and how to improve operational performance of the scheduled process? We address the above questions with a model-driven approach, exploiting a specific type of queueing networks. This choice is motivated by the need to capture the key actors of service 1 Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, sariks@tx.technion.ac.il 2 Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany, matthias.weidlich@hu-berlin.de 3 Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, lirony@ie.technion.ac.il 4 Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, avigal@ie.technion.ac.il 5 Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, avim@ie.technion.ac.il 6 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States, sarah kadish@dfci.harvard.edu 7 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States, craig bunnell@dfci.harvard.edu Conformance Checking Performance Improvement Schedule Hypotheses Testing / Similarity Assessment Diagnostics Event Log Discovery of Queueing Networks Scheduling Policy Adaptation Figure 1: Overview of the approach to conformance checking and process improvement processes (clients and providers), their interactions, and the dependencies of different stages of the service process, including parallel processing of activities [Bo06]. Against this background, we rely on Fork/Join networks [AG89], which serve as the foundation for analysis of parallel queueing systems [AMZ12]. 2 Conformance Checking & Process Improvement To address the question of conformance, we present a method that is grounded in queueing networks that are discovered for both the schedule and the actual process execution. We then apply statistical inference (hypotheses testing) and similarity assessment to validate the scheduling assumptions of the process. As outlined in Figure 1, the conformance checking step yields diagnostics on operational deviations between the schedule and the execution of the process. The identified deviations then guide the efforts to answer the question of how to improve the operational performance of a process. In particular, we target improvements in terms of decreased tardiness (lateness with respect to due dates) and lower flow time by adapting the scheduling policy. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: Conformance Checking: Following the existing theory for validating (simulation-based) operational models against execution data [Sa11], we decompose the conformance checking problem along two dimensions, namely conceptual and operational. Conceptual conformance checks the assumptions and theories that underlie the schedule. To assess this type of conformance, we compare the schedule and the event log indirectly by means of Fork/Join networks that are discovered for both. These networks are compared through the lenses of their corresponding components: structure, routing, and server dynamics, which enables general insights beyond the level of instance-based conformance checking. Operational conformance checks the ‘predictive power’ of a schedule with respect to various performance measures (e.g., delay predictions). To this end, we measure deviations between the observed and the scheduled performance indicators. Process Improvement: Conformance checking detects parts of the process that fail to conform (conceptually or operationally) to a given schedule. We handle lack of conformance by combining data-driven analysis via the Fork/Join model, and principles from scheduling research [Pi12]. Specifically, we target local improvement of service policy, whenever conformance is lacking. By default, scheduled processes often operate under the Earliest-Due Date first (EDD) service policy per node, thus ‘optimizing’ schedule-related performance measures (e.g., non-punctuality). Assuming that all cases are available at the beginning of the scheduling horizon, it is indeed optimal to use the EDD policy. However, when cases Jan Mendling and Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, eds.: Proceedings of EMISA 2016, Gesellschaft für Informatik, Bonn 2016 arrive into the system at different times (according to schedule), we show that the EDD policy can be improved to achieve lower tardiness. Moreover, we show that without losing punctuality, our algorithms also improve other performance measures such as flow time.	algorithm;client (computing);conformance testing;fork (software development);gesellschaft für informatik;interaction;jan bergstra;model-driven architecture;operations research;parallel computing;qualitative comparative analysis;queueing theory;routing;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;single-machine scheduling;tracing (software)	Arik Senderovich;Matthias Weidlich;Liron Yedidsion;Avigdor Gal;Avishai Mandelbaum;Sarah Kadish;Craig A.

Run-time contextual entities are used to monitor KPIs continuously to update an ontology-based context model and subsequently convert it into business-relevant information via context management. The delivered high-level knowledge is further utilised by an optimisation support system OSS to infer optimal job rescheduling and dispatching, keeping a higher machine utilisation rate at run-time. The reference architecture is presented as add-on functionality for FMS control, where a modular development of the overall approach provides the solution generic and extendable across other domains. The key components are functionally implemented to a practical FMS use-case within service-oriented architecture -based control architecture. Test runs are performed in a simulated environment provided by the use-case control software, and the results are analysed, which indicates an improvement of the dynamic machine utilisation rate and the enhancement of the OEE.	mathematical optimization	Mohammad Kamal Uddin;Juha Puttonen;José L.

Multi-agent systems have been proposed as a possible solution. However, the information needs of the agent, particularly in responding to any variation from the norm, are similar to a human in the same position. This paper reviews the concepts of business intelligence (BI) and real-time enterprises (RTE) and looks at the need for BI in dynamic information management. A multi-agent framework is described and case-based reasoning investigated as a reasoning paradigm capable of responding to the need for business intelligence. A CBR approach is proposed with key performance indicators defining the case problem and BI operations the case solution.	case-based reasoning;information management;information needs;intelligent agent;multi-agent system;programming paradigm;real-time business intelligence;real-time transcription;transaction processing	Gavin R.

While business views are identified in many Enterprise Architecture (EA) proposals, business strategy formulations from the area of Strategic Management are overlooked. Thus, IT solutions cannot be traced back to business strategy in a clear and unambiguous way. Our intended proposal, a Unified Business Strategy Meta-Model (UBSMM), aims at establishing such a link. UBSMM is a formalization of the integration of known business strategy formulations with precise semantics enabling its model-level usage to provide strategic awareness to Enterprise Architecture. In this paper we present the development process of UBSMM, and further, we propose conceptual relationships towards Enterprise Architecture (EA).	enterprise architecture;metamodeling;model-driven integration	Constantinos Giannoulis;Jelena Zdravkovic;Michaël Petit	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31072-0_18	enterprise architecture framework;functional software architecture;enterprise software;nist enterprise architecture model;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;architecture domain;service-oriented modeling;process modeling;enterprise architecture management;solution architecture;management science;enterprise architecture;business system planning;technology strategy;enterprise integration;view model;business rule;business process modeling;enterprise information system;business architecture;enterprise life cycle	AI	-58.43611854178972	17.15774717317011	171458

The overall distribution problem is described and the main scheduling tasks identified. The discussion starts with the main issues concerning distribution logistics and then focuses on fleet operation modelling. Two case studies undertaken at AI Applications Institute (ALAI) are discussed. These provide a more concrete investigation of the above issues in the context of practical examples. One of these studies involves the delivery of computer systems, the other involves beer delivery scheduling. Two prototype scheduling systems, DELIVS-0 and HERMES, are described. These are not fully developed systems, but prototypes or testbeds for experimenting with delivery scheduling problems and for evaluating a variety of potentially useful AI techniques. The AI techniques embodied within the prototypes are discussed more fully. The paper discusses the main contributions and limitations of the two testbeds and proposes further work and development.	applications of artificial intelligence;artificial intelligence applications institute;computer;embodied cognition;experiment;graphical user interface;hermes (programming language);icl;knowledge engineering;logistics;prolog;prototype;scheduling (computing);testbed	Roberto Desimone;Teresa L.

This goal can be reached by integrating of the available islands of automation. This integration would be facilitated greatly if there were a generally agreed upon architectural structure in which the software modules of the various vendors could operate. CIMOSA (computer integrated manufacturing--open system architecture) aims at providing such an architectural structure and strives to become a European standard. An important part of CIMOSA consists of the enterprise model. In this article the results of a project are described which is aimed at the validation of CIMOSA in a typical SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) environment. In a first step, the CIMOSA partial and particular models for SMEs were developed. The authors developed a coarse model of the order management and a detailed model of the future concept of the CAD/PPC interface. In order to master the increasing complexity of the planning of software systems of an enterprise, new planning methods and tools are required. Thus in the second part, an integrated approach to software system planning and selection based on CIMOSA enterprise models was developed. The underlying idea of the approach is the conversion of the planning problem into an equivalent constraint satisfaction problem. The conversion process can be accomplished fully automatically. To interconnect a real system, in a lot of cases, it is required to configure data conversion modules. In the third part, the article focuses on a configuration system which allows a straightforward configuration of the data conversion modules.	cimosa;computer-aided design;computer-integrated manufacturing;constraint satisfaction problem;enterprise modelling;knowledge-based configuration;order management system;overhead (computing);real-time operating system;software system;systems architecture	G.

404ef23cdab1f9556432457689693234f291cc41	step-based data schema for implementing product data management system	product data management	Currently, the challenge of implementing a product data management system (PDMS) is how to ensure system integration and product data exchange is shared between heterogeneous systems. In this research, an integrated data models and implementation approach for PDMS is proposed that uses the STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product) model data standard and schema as proposed by the Object Management Group (OMG). The objective of migrating these data schemas is to propose a standardized product data management (PDM) data schema that fulfils its functionality, including product structure management, configuration management, document management, workflow/process management, effectivity management, and engineering change management. The PDM-related data schema that is defined in the STEP standard, the PDM schema, and the Joint Product Data Management (JPDM) Enablers is identified, discussed, compared and migrated in this paper. To solve the barrier of product data exchange and sharing within and between enterprises, a robust and standardized PDM data schema fulfilling the functionality of PDM can be constructed with the proposed migrated data models. The implementation issues of a STEP-based system via these data schema are also discussed. With the proposed approach and architecture, the integrated data models fulfilling the functionality of PDM for PDMS, as well as the methods of implementing STEP-based PDMS, have been demonstrated.	change management (engineering);configuration management;data model;database schema;iso 10303;pdms;system integration	Shen-Chou Yeh;Chun-Fong You	2002	Int.

An extensible functionality of the agents also extends the static document to interface unit. The prototype of the agent system, based on the MIND architecture, shows the possibility of its implementation using available technology.

Naturally, this means users who wish to avoid automatic recognition are becoming less able to do so. Where do we stand in this cat-and-mouse race? We currently live in a society where everyone carries a camera in their pocket. Many people willfully upload most or all of the pictures they take to social networks which invest heavily in automatic face recognition systems. In this setting, is it still possible for privacy-conscientious users to avoid automatic face detection and recognition? If so, how? Must evasion techniques be obvious to be effective, or are there still simple measures that users can use to protect themselves? In this work, we find ways to evade face detection on Facebook, a representative example of a popular social network that uses automatic face detection to enhance their service. We challenge widely-held beliefs about evading face detection: do our old techniques such as blurring the face region or wearing """"privacy glasses"""" still work? We show that in general, state-of-the-art detectors can often find faces even if the subject wears occluding clothing or even if the uploader damages the photo to prevent faces from being detected."""	evasion (network security);face detection;facial recognition system;image;privacy;sensor;social network;upload	Michael J.

Currently, workflow systems tackle this problem anew. To put the current efforts into perspective and show how we can benefit from earlier office automation research, a goal-based workflow system is presented. This system, PolyFlow, is the most recent addition to the POLYMER line of task support research. PolyFlow takes advantage of diverse communication technologies, advanced user interfaces, and distributed systems technologies. In the context of PolyFlow, this article traces the theme of goal-based task support, starting with an office information system, Procedure Oriented Interface for Supportive Environments (POISE), which over years of research developed into an intelligent task support system, POLYMER.

56add4d81b3239e3c91488c69503e14a06d3f579	a pilot study of multiple password interference between text and map-based passwords		Today’s computer users have to remember several passwords for each of their accounts. It is easily noticed that people may have difficulty in remembering multiple passwords, which result in a weak password selection. Previous studies have shown that recall success rates are not statistically dissimilar between textual passwords and graphical passwords. With the advent of map-based graphical passwords, this paper focuses on multiple password interference and presents a pilot study consisting of 60 participants to study the recall of multiple passwords between text passwords and map-based passwords under various account scenarios. Each participant has to create six distinct passwords for different account scenarios. It is found that participants in the map-based graphical password scheme could perform better than the textual password scheme in both short-term (one-hour session) and long term (after two weeks) password memorability tests (i.e., they made higher success rates). Our effort attempts to complement existing studies and stimulate more research on this issue.	password;statistical interference	Weizhi Meng;Wenjuan Li;Lee Wang Hao;Lijun Jiang;Jianying Zhou	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-61204-1_8	world wide web;computer security;cognitive password;password;computer science;internet privacy;recall	Crypto	-51.604721273877395	6.114105810961093	173106

Simultaneously, our approach gives the students the opportunity to conduct hands-on experiments with real signals and hardware, using Texas instruments (TI) C6713 evaluation boards. By taking this combined approach, we tried to focus the efforts of the students on the DSP problems themselves rather than on the actual programming. A comprehensive ensemble of experiments, which expose the students to a wide spectrum of DSP concepts, is introduced in this paper. The experiments were designed to enable the illustration and demonstration of theoretical aspects, already acquired by several DSP courses in the curriculum.	algorithm;digital signal processing;digital signal processor;electrical engineering;experiment;hands-on computing;level design;microprocessor development board;real-time transcription;simulink	Sharon Gannot;Vadim Avrin	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference			Robotics	-53.702943447501475	4.482000804339309	174083

ace62f3658ee5391804ee3c2932e588893cdb916	web services-enhanced agile modeling and integrating business processes		In a global business context with continuous changes, the enterprises have to improve their productivity and their brand image according to a given strategy. They are expected to face big challenges in order to overcome hard competition and meet the growing demands of clients. Indeed, they should capitalize on the potential of new information and communication technologies to enhance their operational efficiency, to react more quickly and to ensure the flexibility of their business processes. Therefore, they should use ebusiness methods, mechanisms and techniques. In simple terms, e-business refers to the use of Intranet to network, to enhance and to empower intra-enterprise business processes, and of Internet to serve customers and to collaborate with business partners reusing external processes. Nevertheless, e-business aims cannot be resumed to a simple design of Intranet applications or Web sites to share business data or publish products and business services. It is necessary to note that e-business engages managing business processes. It intends particularly to model, to integrate and to make business processes able to exchange data. Indeed, Business Process Management (BPM) must be done in the most appropriate way to ensure interoperability between both intra and inter enterprises information systems, and to guarantee business process agility and dynamic integration.	agile modeling;beam propagation method;business process;electronic business;information system;interoperability;intranet;web service	Fatima-Zahra Belouadha;Hajar Omrana;Ounsa Roudiès	2012	CoRR		web modeling;business process execution language;web standards;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;software engineering;ws-policy;services computing;ws-i basic profile	DB	-53.958220726811014	14.284810371244504	174552

In order to manage inter-organizational business processes, existing concepts for business process management need to be adapted and extended. In this paper an approach is presented, that shows how cross-organizational processes can be planned and implemented. The approach in this article describes the conceptual preparation of CBPs independently from specific techniques used for execution. However, the authors consider the potentials of their execution offered by agents in comparison to other state of art techniques like WS-BPEL engines.	business process execution language	Timo Kahl;Ingo Zinnikus;Stephan Roser;Christian Hahn;Jörg Ziemann;Jörg P.

By analyzing architectural principles at an enterprise, knowledge is gained on how to formulate principles so that they are an effective steering tool. This knowledge is transformed into a framework for formulating architectural principles. The analysis of the architectural principles has been performed from two different angles; have we got the principles right (syntax) and have we got the right principles (semantics). The industrial case is complemented with examples from literature. .

This paper describes a unified simulation and application framework where it is possible to represent the entire performance process along a supply chain in a unified business model, improve its performance with discrete event simulation technology, and then generate and implement the corresponding business application software from the same unified model, based on a so-called framework-based application technology which allows implementation of changes derived from simulation analysis with minimal effort and time. This enables a company to optimise not only operational processes such as shopfloor or warehouse operations but also business processes such as planning, order management and scheduling through simulation.	application framework;business process;business software;code refactoring;decision support system;order management system;scheduling (computing);simulation;unified model	Peter Lendermann;Nirupam Julka;Lai Peng Chan;Boon-Ping Gan	2003		10.1145/1030818.1031064	business model;business domain;decision support system;computer science;systems engineering;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;function model;unified process;discrete event simulation;simulation modeling;unified model;process modeling;business process model and notation;supply chain;process management;business process;process mining;business process discovery;business rule;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	Embedded	-56.52984487359869	16.69916311167913	174779
28a384667d241b3a558156761b58f59c6ac028c7	how can diagrammatic conceptual modelling support knowledge management?		"""Traditionally, venues that are publishing Knowledge Management research have been separating concerns between two viewpoints that rarely converge into holistic approaches: one is the tradition of Artificial Intelligence research, where """"Knowledge Management"""" is often employed as an umbrella term in relation to a variety of semantic technologies, knowledge representation and knowledge discovery techniques; the other viewpoint is a specialisation of """"intangible asset management"""", dealing with the business value and the pragmatics of organisational knowledge. Knowledge Management Systems are a catalyst for bridging such complementary perspectives and Design Science artefacts must be employed to facilitate alignments between these viewpoints, specifically between humanoriented and machine-oriented knowledge representations. Motivated by this desideratum and driven by project-based experience, the paper at hand advocates a key role of Diagrammatic Conceptual Modelling methods in enriching the seminal SECI Knowledge Conversion spiral, to the aim of opening it towards Knowledge Management Systems that could not have been envisioned at the time of Nonaka's original SECI proposal, but can now benefit from state-of-the-art semantics-driven practices. By hybridising the SECI model with a machine-oriented Knowledge Distilling cycle, an extended SECI spiral variant is proposed and analysed in the paper, as a reflection on project-based deployments and experience."""	agile software development;artificial intelligence;bridging (networking);code generation (compiler);converge;diagram;holism;knowledge management;knowledge representation and reasoning;management system;method engineering;microsoft outlook for mac;modeling language;separation of concerns;software engineering;umbrella term	Dimitris Karagiannis;Robert Andrei Buchmann;Michael Walch	2017				AI	-60.89818381937887	16.35991032315352	174840

In this paper, we propose and evaluate two novel shoulder-surfing defense techniques for recognition based graphical passwords. These techniques are based on WYSWYE (Where You See is What You Enter) strategy, where the user identifies a pattern of password images within a presented grid of images and replicates it onto another grid. We conducted controlled laboratory experiments to evaluate the usability and security of the proposed techniques. Both the schemes had high login success rates with no failures in authentication. More than seventy percent of participants successfully logged on to the system in their first attempt in both the schemes. The participants were satisfied with the schemes and were willing to use it in public places. In addition, both the schemes were significantly secure against shoulder surfing than normal unprotected recognition based graphical passwords. The login efficiency improved with practice in one of the proposed scheme. We believe, WYSWYE strategy has considerable potential and can easily be extended to other types of authentication systems such as text passwords and PINS.	authentication;experiment;graphical user interface;login;password;personal identification number;usability	Rohit Ashok Khot;Ponnurangam Kumaraguru;K.

The template, featured by process automation, has a wider application scope than the customized development, and will greatly improve the efficiency of those simulation analyses involving many repetitive operations. The template has been integrated to the Web, through which users can download tag files. The next steps for them are to add tags to the simulation model and submit simulation parameters. Then computing will be executed at the cloud background. By virtue of this mode, the users no longer need to pay much for software and hardware resources, and it will be more accessible to the wire drawing die simulation analysis. Thus, the analysis based on computer aided engineering (CAE) can also be applied by the users unskilled in CAE software."""	ctags;die (integrated circuit);download;web-based simulation;wire drawing;world wide web	Pengjie Sun;Fenlou Zhai;Ru Wang;Zhe Li	2016		10.1145/3012258.3012273	simulation;engineering;operations management;engineering drawing	EDA	-56.918500446061614	7.766215108583338	175256

Multiple ontologies were developed to define these interacting domains. Combined with planning technology, they are used in a threelayered framework that enables the definition, creation and execution of a workflow management system based on dynamic user requirements. We report on how such ontologies play a central role in enabling the workflow system to work consistently and systematically while communicating and collaborating with other project partner systems. We also extend the capability elements of the ontologies with hardware and software performance measures.

Once created, models need to be digitized for shared stakeholder understanding and further processing. Whenever paper serves as carrier medium, it is likely to disrupt further processing, elicitation, and modeling. While digital environments support transformation processes in collaborative modeling from its very beginning, the necessary technical infrastructure still might hamper situated capturing of models. Hence, this contribution aims to reduce the need for sophisticated technical components by enabling stakeholders to capture their paper-based models in a situation-sensitive way. We present a system that enables capturing paper-based models with mundane technical means by end users under uncontrolled conditions. We describe the components developed for recognition of these models and embed it in a mixed-modality workflow supported by a tabletop interfacing a web platform for further processing. As our empirical evidence demonstrates, this approach enables both situated and error-tolerant capturing of hand-drawn conceptual models by individual users. Moreover, it can be integrated with more sophisticated IT-based modeling tools for further digital processing.	digital data;error-tolerant design;modality (human–computer interaction);organizational behavior;requirements elicitation;situated;uncontrolled format string;webplatform	Stefan Oppl;Christian Stary;Simon Vogl	2017	IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems	10.1109/THMS.2016.2611943	computer vision;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;organization;knowledge management;context model;computational model;collaboration	SE	-59.497121135438015	15.183483036245196	176373
3800ff44b4642d0e651018e7abf3d71f6d169dca	embracing imperfection in enterprise architecture models		In Enterprise Architecture (EA) projects, models are built to represent business and Information Technologies (IT) elements, and to abstract the relation between them in one enterprise under study. The construction of EA models depends on information provided by different kinds of sources, but sources could be insufficient or information could be incomplete or incorrect regarding aspects of the enterprise. As a result, modelers must often create models based on low quality information that could not properly represent the enterprise. Since EA models are used as the base for the analysis of the enterprise, using models that do not represent the enterprise correctly, there is a risk that the analysis produces unreliable conclusions. This paper presents a proposal for managing imperfect models in the EA context. An imperfect model is capable of representing information that can be imprecise, inconsistent, vague, uncertain, or incomplete; thus, when analyses are performed, they can use this information to produce more reliable results. In this proposal, imperfect models also include information about modeler decisions.	enterprise architecture;semiconductor industry;tracing (software);vagueness	Hector Florez;Mario E.

By keeping the systems of business partners as autonomous and lose coupled service components, the service oriented paradigm supports flexible integration of heterogeneous systems or components within virtual enterprises. Taking a real world project in Chinese apparel industry as an example, this paper firstly analyzed the challenges in virtual enterprise construction. Then it presented a service oriented framework that supports IT-enabled heterogeneous resource sharing and dynamic virtual enterprise construction. According to the deployments in apparel companies in China, we conclude that the framework presented in this paper facilitates the construction of dynamic virtual enterprises with process services, participant management and message based inter-organizational process collaborations.	autonomous robot;organizational behavior;programming paradigm;service-oriented architecture;virtual enterprise	Gang Li;Ying Liang	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing	10.1109/SCC.2008.48	knowledge management;marketing;business	Visualization	-54.8936407665936	13.962136181207882	176549

But, the supply chain (SC) partners are often reluctant to share their strategic information. The exchange of relevant strategic information yet maintaining privacy is a challenging issue for CSCP. It is therefore required to develop privacy preserving coordination mechanisms (PPCM) that can align the business objectives of SC partners. This paper presents a distributed algorithm for PPCM for CSCP based on secure multiparty computation. This requires negotiations for compensation between the buying and the selling firms. We have considered a single buyer and single supplier (SBSS) case along with the process flow logic using a process flow construct for secure computation. We have extended the method to a multiparty negotiation process for a multiple buyer and single supplier (MBSS) case.

For instance, CPS can be deployed in the manufacturing domain to form a modular production system, which, at some time during its lifecycle, might have to produce new products or to interact with new modules, which have been designed by different stakeholders. In order to be able to cope with open contexts, CPSs rely on ontologies that represent the information being shared among them. However, due to the complexity of a CPS's context, building these ontologies as a basis for information exchange during runtime is a non-trivial task that requires a structured approach. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we present an ontology building method that is tailored towards the needs of CPS, beginning with ontological requirements and ending with a formal ontology. Second, we apply this method to build an ontology for communicating information between CPSs about processes and machine states in the manufacturing domain.

However, previous fixture design research has mainly focused on machining fixtures rather than welding fixtures. In this paper, an approach of data abstraction for fixture design information representation is proposed, first to systemize and manage myriads of fixture related resources, e.g., past fixture design solutions, fixture units depository. Based on this approach, a multi-level CBR method for welding fixture design is then presented. This method could help designers, by referencing previous design cases, to make a conceptual fixturing solution quickly and, finally, finish the detailed solution of fixture design.	case-based reasoning;test fixture	Yiming Kevin Rong	2008	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/j.cad.2008.11.001	case-based reasoning;design research;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence;engineering drawing;manufacturing engineering	EDA	-57.98006299605184	10.716158466805696	177724
0cea6c687073694867b594d7569a9e44bc713373	process lines for automatic workflow development		In some business environments, processes of different organizations are very similar to each other. This produces families of processes with common characteristics but also portions that vary according to the specific organization. Two emerging approaches can be adopted and combined to easily model, implement and update families of business processes: Software Product Line (SPL) and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Our work suggests a framework to transfer the main peculiarities of the SPL to the SOA system development, in order to realize a SOA system line. Starting from the SPL concept, we introduce process lines, i.e., families of process models suitable for different customers or market segments. Moreover, we present an approach for the automatic generation of a SOA system starting from a process model. The combination of these approaches, can be used to easily develop a family of SOA systems each one appropriate for different context characteristics. In this work, an application of the proposed approach in a real project is also proposed.	best practice;business process execution language;business process model and notation;business process;computer-aided software engineering;decision table;process modeling;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;software development process;software product line	Mario Luca Bernardi;Marta Cimitile;Fabrizio Maria Maggi	2013		10.5220/0004492400410049	workflow management system;workflow engine;workflow technology	SE	-56.008203660897635	18.194451979626912	177925

The main technique matter concerns designing a generalized primary (root) semiformal (DFD and UML) domain models system that serves as the source for a wide range of secondary (derived) models for particular information security problems.  Within the ISIE framework, the derived models are obtained from the root model by extracting the necessary (for a given particular problem) partial model and its subsequent regulated modification: supplement, generalization, evolving etc. With these operations, the derived models, in general, remain coordinated with the root model and the corresponding IS standard that ensures the possibility of reuse of every particular derived model in other tasks.  The application of the proposed technique in several specific information security organizational problems is discussed, alongside with some logical schemes of common engineering operations.	data flow diagram;information security;unified modeling language	Alexander V.

Unlike existing registries, IPAS presents the novelty of modelling public services from the view point of the value they have for the consumers and the providers. A value-added-service (VAS) is linked to a life event that requires its fruition, addresses consumer categories to identify market opportunities for private providers, and is described by non-functional-properties such as price and time of fruition. Where Italian local authorities leave the citizen-users in a daedalus of references to understand whether they can/have to apply for a service, the IPAS model captures the necessary back-ground knowledge about the connection between administrative legislation and service specifications, life events, and application contexts to support the citizen-users to fulfill their needs. As a proof of concept, we developed an operational Web environment named ASSO, designed to assist the citizen-user to intuitively create bundles of mandatory-by-legislation and recommended services, to accomplish his bureaucratic fulfillments. Although ASSO is an ongoing project, domain experts gave preliminary positive feedback on the innovativeness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.	bridging (networking);interactivity;knowledge base;linked data;matchmaking (video games);open-source software;positive feedback;real life;recommender system;user profile	Claudio Baldassarre;Marco Cremaschi;Matteo Palmonari	2013	2013 24th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications	10.1109/DEXA.2013.25	service catalog;computer science;knowledge management;knowledge-based systems;data mining;database;world wide web	Web+IR	-49.16383594783753	15.118480023649543	178871

The model is designed in a simple, formal, and unambiguous way. It allows an explicit access to the structural and functional information of the plant. Via this access, the downstream engineering processes can be supported by automatic assistance functions and self-configuration tools.

The system is implemented as an XML/CORBA-based environment for conveying design and manufacturing messages across traditional technology boundaries. The approach is based on the exchange of manufacturability requests and product information between different agents using a new Manufacturability Markup Language (MML). This paper provides an overview of key domain models and their integration within the decision-making environment. The reported research aims to provide designers with a rapid manufacturability assessment tool to be used at an early design stage in extended manufacturing enterprises.	design for manufacturability;extended enterprise;xml	Joe Y.

649b33584da389032072f48d6b6b00abf12890fb	an extensive review of it service design in seven international itsm processes frameworks: part ii		An IT service design process is considered to be a fundamental piece of the seven key international IT Service Management (ITSM) processes frameworks (ITIL v2, ITIL v3 (and ITIL v2011), ISO 20000-4, CobIT 4.0, CMMI-SVC, MOF 4.0, and ITUP). Nevertheless the availability of IT service design processes, few –if anydescriptive-comparative studies among them have been reported. Thus, in this paper (Part I), we address this knowledge gap. An extensive descriptive-comparative review of seven IT service design processes in aforementioned frameworks is reported. Fundamental concepts (viz., design as noun, design as verb, service, service system, IT service, IT service system, and IT service architecture design) are analyzed by using a Systems Approach. Our findings indicate that the frameworks ITIL v2, ISO/IEC 20000 and Cobit 4.0 are using weak systemic concepts, while the frameworks ITIL v3, CMMI-SVC, ITUP and MOF 4.0 are more foundationally congruent with the new service systems view. Implications for ITSM theory and practice are discussed.

The continuous alignment of business and IT in a rapidly changing environment is a grand challenge for today’s enterprises. The ability to react timeously to continuous and unexpected change is called agility and is an essential quality of the modern enterprise. Being agile has consequences for the engineering of enterprises and enterprise information systems. In this paper a new paradigm for next generation enterprise information systems is proposed, which shifts the development approach of model-driven engineering to continuous alignment of business and IT for the agile enterprise. It is based on a metamodelling approach, which supports both human-interpretable graphical enterprise architecture and machine-interpretable enterprise ontologies. Furthermore, next generation enterprise information systems are described, which embed modelling tools and algorithms for model analysis. 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Even within the process level, the contribution of activities to the value chain has to be obvious to enhance understanding. One important aspect to reach correspondence between the strategic value-oriented business model level and business process level is consistency in modeling. Therefore, the quality of value models to users' perception and perceived impact to business processes has become obvious. Therefore, the paper's contribution is to evaluate the perceived quality of two value models, i.e. e^3 value and the Resource Event Agent (REA) model to a consistent modeling. Based on an experiment, it is shown that both models show a high user understanding. Understanding is not only limited to business models, but also on business processes. In conclusion, the results contribute to an integration of value models in current enterprise models.	beam propagation method;business process;business requirements	Johannes Buder;Carsten Felden	2012	2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2012.251	business model;value engineering;computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;marketing;business value;semantics;management science;process management;context model;business process discovery;business rule;new business development	SE	-54.941691806731626	18.131568895513517	180826
8d36bdd1a23d344c5201fbafce30d5b75cb7f137	bpmodelmasher: manage your process variants effectively		Nowadays, modern organizations build large repositories of process models to describe and document their daily business operations. One reason for the large number of process models is the need to adapt with differnt business contexts, i.e. process variants. Automated maintenance of the consistency between process variants is an important goal that saves the time and efforts of process modelers. We present a query-based approach to maintain consistency among process variants called BPModelMasher. In particular, we maintain the link between the variant process models by process model views. These views are defined using, BPMN-Q, a visual query language for process models. Dynamic evaluation for the defined queries of the process views guarantee that the process modeler is able to get up-to-date and consistent status of the process model. In addition, our view-based approach allows building multiple configurations for a holistic view of related variants of the same process model. The conceptual results are illustrated with a real-world sample process on customer service from eBay.	business process model and notation;holism;process modeling;query language	Sherif Sakr;Emilian Pascalau;Ahmed Awad;Mathias Weske	2011			management science;query language;business operations;process modeling;computer science	SE	-54.29376269523532	17.298092320823624	181092

This paper proposes a dynamic PERT/CPM approach using a compound number, and discusses its applications to dynamic enterprise process scheduling for Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). By using the compound number, activity’s duration, the earliest start time, and the latest start time of activities in a process model can be defined and calculated effectively to facilitate the enterprise process flexible scheduling and process forecast during process enactment. A framework to role-oriented process-driven enterprise cooperative work is proposed, some schedule strategies and the algorithm implementation are discussed, as well as the process-driven enterprise application integration.	algorithm;computer-supported cooperative work;dynamic enterprise;enterprise application integration;enterprise software;process modeling;program evaluation and review technique;scheduling (computing);service-oriented device architecture;simulation	WenAn Tan;Yun Yang;Zhenhong Lv;Zhonglong Zheng	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-75902-9_10	knowledge management;operations management;management science;business	OS	-53.101089839108965	15.213333757989586	181310

The various operations involved generate large number of events that need to be integrated in order to enable internal and external traceability. Further, provenance of artifacts and agents involved in the supply chain operations is now a key traceability requirement. In this paper we propose a Semantic web/Linked data powered framework for the event based representation and analysis of supply chain activities governed by the EPCIS specification. We specifically show how a new EPCIS event type called “Transformation Event” can be semantically annotated using EEM The EPCIS Event Model to generate linked data, that can be exploited for internal event based traceability in supply chains involving transformation of products. For integrating provenance with traceability, we propose a mapping from EEM to PROV-O. We exemplify our approach on an abstraction of the production processes that are part of the wine supply chain.	anomaly detection;business process;exemplification;file spanning;input/output;json-ld;linked data;markov chain;requirements traceability;semantic web;track and trace;web standards	Monika Solanki;Christopher Brewster	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-10491-1_5	real-time computing	SE	-53.34924509837692	16.952757978056756	181541

Technical conflicts and modified design goals will lead to ad-hoc changes within the workflow. They are no exception but usual. Therefore, common principles must be established throughout the construction industry, that allow for flexibly combining engineering and construction services. New members must be able to join and leave the project consortium on demand. The need to rapidly establish new organisational structures and effectively manage these virtual organisations places high demands on the methods used for modelling the processes. Consequentially, there is a need for an overall model-framework representing the different design, construction and management processes that integrates specialized process models used for different domains.	hoc (programming language);process modeling	Martin Keller;Karsten Menzel;Raimar J.

71783d2d59a76a7611861839256f40fee9f7ddcf	complex event as an core aspect of enterprise architecture - edemf: event driven enterprise architecture modeling framework		For the last decade, Complex Event Processing (CEP) has been emerged as a powerful instrument supporting a more agile and intelligent enterprise. Although several studies have attempted to extend current business modelling standards with elements of complex event modelling they have not fully integrated into Enterprise Architecture (EA). EA provides holistic approach of enterprise business and IT system modelling. In our view CEP is not just an element associated with a business process, but at the centre of business analysis and design. This paper proposes an EA modelling framework that takes CEP as a core aspect of modelling. The framework supports CEP based business architecture within different levels of abstraction: contextual, conceptual/logical, and physical. Meta-models in three hierarchies and modelion: contextual, conceptual/logical, and physical. Meta-models in three hierarchies and model mapping between the meta-models have been developed and demonstrated on a linked data platform in a case study. The case study used the framework as a tool of analysis and modelling, aiming to integrate scattered information as event data by specifying a complex event layer on top of legacy systems. The designed models were then transformed into executable program codes using the model transformation, for example, RDF script from information model; SPARQL query from complex event model.	agile software development;archimate;autonomic networking;business analysis;business architecture;business process;code;complex event processing;enterprise architecture;event (computing);executable;holism;information model;legacy system;linked data platform;model transformation;principle of abstraction;resource description framework;sparql;service layer	Hyeonsook Kim;Samia Oussena;Peter Komisarczuk	2013		10.5220/0004440802920301	service-oriented modeling;enterprise life cycle;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;functional software architecture;enterprise architecture framework;real-time computing;applications architecture;enterprise architecture management;architecture domain;solution architecture	Web+IR	-56.197636392685276	17.307471943364078	182115

With an increasingly wide adoption of the project-oriented management, new models are needed for ERP systems to support the management of enterprise resources in a project-oriented manner. This paper presents an architecture of an ERP system supporting project-oriented management. Two characteristics of the project-oriented management are integrated in the proposed architecture: first, social protocols are used to model interactions between actors (humans or software agents) within a given group. Second, the concept of group actions is detailed as a way to integrate group dynamics to social protocols.	erp;enterprise resource planning;finite-state machine;humans;interaction;interoperability;partial template specialization;refinement (computing);social collaboration;software agent;technical support;web service	Willy Picard;Grzegorz Wojciechowsk	2006		10.1007/978-0-387-39229-5_6	business process;process management;software agent;architecture;approaches of management;business	DB	-51.376756950167525	14.88512936352634	182240

This article presents a generic way of connecting models with model borders both vertically and horizontally in a multilevel modelling framework. One model can be connected vertically to several models allowing a model element to be an instance of several metaclasses and different views can then be managed in an integrated way. Models at the same level can also be connected by defining the correspondence between model elements. The idea behind the approach is to break model architectures down to elementary building blocks so that all parts that might be of interest become explicit and accessible.	metaclass;multilevel model	Jan Pettersen Nytun	2006			multilevel model;computer science;systems engineering	AI	-49.4386302158016	11.03187977352469	182812

5211f4dc25b5c425bff9112604bef278506126b0	theory-driven reverse engineering of organisations	information management	Driven by the strong demand for reusable yet situational business solutions on the one side and the necessity to provide a stable, reliant foundation that allows to adapt the supporting information systems in a systematic way on the other side, the need for a closer link between relevant theories and successful practices for the design of enterprise information systems becomes evident. The aim of the reported research is to provide such a link by means of prescriptive guidelines for the class of problems concerning the reverse engineering of organisations. The reverse engineering of organisations aims at deriving at the ontological models of organisations, which build the basis for the design and engineering of information systems supporting the business needs. An ontological model as used in the presented research is defined as the highest-level constructional model of an organisation, which is fully independent of its implementation. The prescriptive guidelines for reverse engineering presented in this paper are derived from the Ψ-theory (the Greek letter Ψ is pronounced PSI, which stands for Performance in Social Interaction), the theory that underlies the notion of Enterprise Ontology. This theory regards organisations as social systems and sees IT systems as support for social actors in performing coordination-related activities and productionrelated activities. In this paper we focus specifically on recommendations based on the Ψ-theory concerning the coupling of two types of enterprise models in order to derive at ontological models of organisations. The first type of models are derived by applying the Design and Engineering Methodology for Organisations (DEMO) and the second type of models are derived by applying the Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS).

9b3315b9743fd3a8501bb93564da4cea72dbcc24	a methodological evaluation of business process compliance management frameworks	compliance management;compliance management frameworks;business processes	Existing compliance management frameworks (CMFs) offer a multitude of compliance management functionalities for the modeling of specific norms for specific domain and compliance checking of normative requirements. This makes difficult for enterprises to decide on a framework suitable for their compliance requirements. Making a decision on the suitability requires a deep understanding of the functionalities of a framework. Gaining such an understanding is a difficult task which, in turn, requires specialised tools and methodologies for evaluation. Current compliance research lacks such tools and methodologies for evaluating CMFs. This paper reports a methodological evaluation of existing CMFs based on pre-defined evaluation criteria. Our evaluation highlights what existing CMFs can offer, and what they cannot. Also, it underpins various open questions and discusses the challenges in this direction.	business process;expressive power (computer science);formal language;formal methods;information systems;modeling language;qualitative comparative analysis;reliability-centered maintenance;requirement;semantics (computer science)	Mustafa Hashmi;Guido Governatori	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-02922-1_8	economics;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science;business process;management	SE	-60.24414673226851	17.715539678624296	182971
26b72da7f3c1c4dc433f4c4fe1d5ff36945f2ba0	applying process mining in manufacturing and logistic for large transaction data		Process mining is a promising approach to extract actual business processes form event logs. However, process mining algorithms often result in unstructured and unclear process models. Moreover, sufficient data quality is required for accurate interpretation. Therefore, adopting process mining for the field of manufacturing and logistics should take into account the complexity and dynamics as well as the heterogeneous data sources and the quality of event data. Therefore, the objective of this work is to study the application of process mining in the manufacturing and logistics domain with real data from manufacturing companies. We propose a methodology to improve the limitations of process mining by using a Markov chain as a sequence clustering technique in the data preprocessing step and apply heuristic mining to extract the business process models. Finally, we provide results from an experiment with real-world data in which we successfully improve the quality of discovered process model in the regards of replay fitness dimension.

Starting from a cybernetic approach, methods  of knowledge-oriented management have been used that support the cooperative planning of production network resources and  their allocation to dynamic business processes for networked organizations.    In particular, methods for network analysis, process-oriented modeling and distribution of Organizational, Procedural and  Operational Knowledge have been developed, allowing for a flexible network configuration and coordination. They have been  validated and implemented in several production networks of textile small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as part of a European  research project, on basis of e-business collaboration platforms.      	cybernetics	Thomas Fischer;Sven-Volker Rehm	2004		10.1007/1-4020-8139-1_15	organizational network analysis;knowledge base;enterprise private network;intelligent computer network;network architecture;economics;network analysis;network formation;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;value added;artificial intelligence;operations management;conceptual framework;value network;business process	AI	-57.82335613818389	13.217591038185143	183380

To face such cases, a rescheduling mechanism is necessary and such a possibility is investigated for a holonic system that materializes its coordination through a combination between the Contract Net Protocol and Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem. The proposed method is investigated for a case study, by doing simulation experiments with the system coloured Petri net model. The results are analysed for the cases when the new command received during execution is more or less important than the ongoing ones.

71dc3b98eedc3a1050452a2804d6fd82e374b0ed	a graph api for complex business network query and traversal		Business Network Management (BNM) provides companies with techniques for managing their trading partner networks by making technical integration, business and social aspects visible within a network view and sets them into context to each other. Therefore, it computa- tionally links data into business and (technical) integration networks as well as computes semantic correlation between entities of both perspec- tives. The linked real-world data is then captured in an etwork-centric variant of Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), which we call Network Integration Model (NIM). In this paper, we propose a novel con- cept, which features access to the complex inter-connected business and technical perspectives in NIM in a standard RESTful architecture style, called Business Graph API (BGAPI). As foundation we use a powerful Resource Graph (RG) definition, which is directly computed from the underlying NIM, and allows simple, uniform, but expressive queries and traversal on the linked data. We present a novel approach on applying state of the art RESTful Web-Services to our domain and report on our experiences with it.	social graph;tree traversal	Daniel Ritter;Christoph Herrmann	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-29166-1_5	computer science;artifact-centric business process model;artificial intelligence;marketing;operating system;machine learning;data mining;database;business process model and notation;business rule;world wide web	DB	-54.73785897408151	16.106343127320827	183461

Automated decision support systems are built to help human operators in making reliable, fast and economically advantageous decisions. In many cases, however, the construction of these systems is very complex due to the needs of integrating heterogeneous information sources or knowledge sources. This paper introduces the topic of strategic process control and gives an example of such an application in the cement sector built atop the integrated control architecture (ICa).	common object request broker architecture	Ricardo Sanz	2003	Annual Reviews in Control	10.1016/S1367-5788(03)00003-8	intelligence;decision support system;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;process control;strategic control	Arch	-53.79232123869032	10.645122617717199	183751

However, in order for the architect to take the right design decisions, assistance is required for exploring the architectural knowledge, which encompasses the various architectural solutions, their relationships and distinctions. In the past decades, the number of available technology options has increased significantly, while existing architecture knowledge approaches support technology decisions by representing relations between the different technology solutions, as well as design problems. However, they do not differentiate the candidate technologies according to their offered qualities and drawbacks. Our main goal in this exploratory study is to understand how technology solutions are being considered by the architects during the design process, and how can we enhance existing architecture knowledge concepts to support technology decision making. Our contribution in this paper is differentiating the different technology solutions' features based on a set of architecturally significant aspects, to facilitate considering technologies during the architecture design decisions. In addition, we proposed an extension for existing architecture knowledge models, which characterise the technology design decisions, and their reasoning. We evaluated our results through real examples from practitioners. Moreover, we conducted interviews with experts to validate our proposed concepts.	knowledge representation and reasoning;natural language processing;software architecture	Mohamed Soliman;Matthias Riebisch;Uwe Zdun	2015	2015 12th Working IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture	10.1109/WICSA.2015.14	information technology architecture;software architecture;interview;usability;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;software engineering;architectural technology;solution architecture;design technology;user interface;java;data architecture;computer engineering;technology	SE	-60.485391808367766	15.25605301300315	183841

As a result, there is a tremendous amount of user profile data online, e.g., name, birth date, etc. Protecting this data is a challenge. The task of access policy composition is a tedious and confusing effort for the average user having hundreds of friends. In this paper, we propose a Policy Manager (PolicyMgr) Framework for social networks. PolicyMgr assists users in composing and managing their access control policies for objects posted to their profiles. Our approach is based on a supervised learning mechanism that leverages user provided example policy settings as training sets to build classifiers that are the basis for auto-generated policies. Furthermore, we provide mechanisms to enable users to fuse policy decisions that are provided by their friends or others in the social network. These policies then regulate access to user profile objects. We implemented our framework and, through experimentation, demonstrate positive emerging results.	access control;social network;supervised learning;user profile	Mohamed Shehab;Gorrell P.

But the key questions are “Does the selected service address the real business need?” and “How to select the right service?”. Separating the business choices and technical choices is necessary in order to structure the solution to these questions. In this research, the two perspectives are handled by embedding service thinking at business level design and secondly, by supporting the integration with available services and process templates. To reach this combined goal, we present a pattern-based approach for business service integration.

Automated workflow engine enabled Industry Foundation Processes (IFP) are introduced in this paper that facilitate process conformance through structural transparency, foundation process inheritance, and automated conformance checking. While IFP processes can be customized to suit particular project or corporate conditions, they need to conform to a standard core structure and thus behavior. This has been achieved through defining specific workflow inheritance rules and developing an automated structural process conformance checking algorithm. The algorithm has been developed based on graph theory fundamentals using a first-order logic language, which compares two workflows and detects the conformance of a customized one with its associated IFP. The developed algorithm has been functionally tested and validated with different structural settings of workflows with a number of critical cases. Its functionality has been demonstrated in this paper with an example of the commonly used process of RFI (Request for Information). A new construct is thus contributed that can help improve process conformance to industry best practices particularly in the architectural, engineering, and construction industry, leading to improved project conformance.	conformance testing	Behrooz Golzarpoor;Carl T.

However, conventional workflow management systems don’t offer complete solutions for B2B collaborations considering many unsolved issues such as security, trust and complex and flexible interaction handling. In this paper, we propose a web service-based multi-agent platform, which can be used as a complementary solution for B2B collaborations.

It is more difficult, however, to shorten the design process rather than manufacturing process since the underlying design activities in process and related data are often interlinked and quite uncertain, and the attempts to perform the design activities concurrently increase the complexity of the design process. In case the targeting process is well-structured and easy to be managed, many approaches have been proposed and it is the best way to use the well-known reengineering method such as crashing the bottle-neck activity. However, they have only concerned mainly about well-defined procedures, not an operational-level sophisticated workflow. As a means to effectively manage and accelerate the design process, a process or workflow model needs to define complex relations such as iteration or coupled dependency in design process in order to coordinate the sophisticated process effectively. And, the acceleration approaches based on the operational-level information needs to be discussed. Firstly, in order to develop an appropriate model that effectively captures the operational-level characteristics in design process, we define the workflow including the control and data flow with an incidence matrix called Workflow Matrix (WfM). Secondly, a workflow structuring method is developed for identifying the reengineering issue and it also transform the complex design process into a well-structured workflow. Finally, we analyze the design process with WfM and suggest reengineering strategies to improve the design process. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

But traditional CAD systems can not treat it efficiently because of the shapes-oriented approaches. Thus, there has been a considerable growth of interest in knowledge-based design support systems.

c00a49c84c959bbaac9c26246023df871ed3d66e	decision data model in virtual product development		Abstract Products and applications are getting more and more complex. Therefore, engineers in product development need to consider an increasing amount of information from different disciplines and sources. From this point of view product development is basically decision making. Product development has changed over time from a sequential to a concurrent or simultaneous process. Hence, information and decision support need to be available for engineers throughout the whole product life cycle. In the early stages of product development, decisions have a great potential to reduce time and cost. With each decision on the one hand the information about the product or application increases, but on the other hand the design space is restricted. At the beginning of a product development we therefore have the least knowledge and information about the application, but all opportunities open to realize its full potential. With each decision the degrees of freedom for following decisions decrease. Hence, it is important to support engineers in their decision-making during the product development process. In this paper an approach is proposed to support decision-makers, namely engineers, in the product development process. This is done by implementing a method for decision presentation and documentation in virtual product development based on a proposed decision data model. Validation of the implemented systematic approach is presented and applied in the context of a profile gasket from the Freudenberg Group. It’s application to engineering problems and the benefit for decision support is shown particularly for sealing technologies and is finally discussed.	data model;new product development	Frank Schönberg;Matthias Messer	2018	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2018.05.047	systems engineering;operations management;new product development;engineering;documentation;product lifecycle;data model;virtual product development;decision support system	DB	-59.935848518570616	11.714224813886164	184892

Data collected during business process execution are used for deriving the key performance indicators (KPI) that allow continuous tracking of the process behavior and measurement of process-specific goals. KPIs evaluation leverages on business process monitoring solutions that can be embedded into the BPM execution framework or integrated as additional facilities. This paper presents an integrated framework that allows modeling, execution and analysis of business process based on a flexible and adaptable monitoring infrastructure. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it is independent from any specific business process modeling notation and execution engine and allows for the definition and evaluation of user-specific KPI measures. An example of implementation of the proposed execution and monitoring framework as well as its validation on a real case study in the learning domain are also presented.	application domain;beam propagation method;business process model and notation;embedded system;event monitoring;experiment;heart rate variability;organizational behavior;process modeling;scalability;software engineering	Antonello Calabrò;Francesca Lonetti;Eda Marchetti	2015	2015 International Conference on Enterprise Systems (ES)	10.1109/ES.2015.23	real-time computing;business process execution language;systems engineering;engineering;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;process modeling;business process model and notation;process management;business process;process mining;business process discovery;business rule;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	Robotics	-55.07182435810805	17.41278482123091	185163

The approach appropriate for SMEs mainly solves two types of interoperability involving processes’ interior in the process level. Life cycle of process level interoperability is redesigned and reorganized. In each phase of the life cycle a comprehensive solution is given. In final, this paper gives a case study to describe and enhance the approach.	enterprise interoperability;iso/iec 12207;semantic interoperability	Cuiling Liu;Chengwei Yang;Shijun Liu;Lei Wu;Xiangxu Meng	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19680-5_6	systems engineering;engineering;operations management;manufacturing engineering	SE	-58.321987173420204	15.132843273880685	185226
