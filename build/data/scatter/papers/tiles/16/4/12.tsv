Among these research studies, the accuracy and delay of trustworthiness decision are both important problems. In this paper, we propose a road-side unit (RSU) and beacon-based trust management system, called RaBTM, which aims to prorogate message opinions quickly and thwart internal attackers from sending or forwarding forged messages in privacy-enhanced VANETs. To evaluate the performance and efficiency of the proposed system, we conducted a set of simulations under alteration attacks and bogus message attacks with various adversary ratios. The simulation results show that the proposed system RaBTM is highly resilient to adversarial attacks and performs at least 15% better than weighted vote (WV) scheme.	adversary (cryptography);attack model;f1 score;management system;privacy;simulation;trust (emotion);trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Yu-Chih Wei;Yi-Ming Chen	2012	2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2012.79	business;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.9762516297505	74.08666528126486	62208
cd01f81f56dcb6fed8859f12749e4ae02f1cd38b	behavior-dependent routing: responding to anomalies with automated low-cost measures	anomaly response;behavior models;routing;information flow controls	As cyber attacks on enterprise systems and critical infrastructure increase in prevalence and severity, persistent presence of adversaries in these systems is a common theme. While there are many efforts and tools focused on locating and removing adversaries from cyber systems, there is an increasing need for automated, steerable response that happens in attack-relevant time scales-an active cyber defense. The research presented here describes design and implementation of a system (SEQUESTOR) to achieve a form of active defense at the network layer by using the output of multiple behavior models to drive differential routing of traffic through a core network. This approach is based on two assertions: 1) methods for detecting behavior that are inconsistent with a user's past are a proxy for compromised systems or credentials, but are subject to high rate of false positives; and 2) automatically changing the logical route taken by future traffic emanating from the potentially compromised system provides a means for graded response that makes is possible to balance the cost of false positive with the risk of allowing the behavior to continue. The presented system is a framework that combines behavior models in a modular way and allows for future models and responses to be incorporated. Ultimately, this is a model for how real-time situational awareness technologies can be coupled to automated responses as well as supporting steerable responses that provide decision support to human operators.	credential;decision support system;enterprise system;real-time locating system;routing;sensor	Christopher S.

The Dolev-Yao model is commonly used for wireline and wireless networks. It is defined on abstract messages exchanged between entities and includes arbitrary, real-time modification of messages by the attacker. In this work, we aim at understanding and evaluating the conditions under which these real-time, covert low-energy signal modifications can be successful. In particular, we focus on the following signal and message manipulation techniques: symbol flipping and signal annihilation. We analyze these techniques theoretically, by simulations, and experiments and show their feasibility for particular wireless channels and scenarios.	categorization;dolev–yao model;entity;experiment;real-time clock;simulation;yao graph	Christina Pöpper;Nils Ole Tippenhauer;Boris Danev;Srdjan Capkun	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23822-2_3	computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-53.56638520277737	70.18493930137859	62293
21783ee47b0090d0cb76f3a7e9dc984664ddc988	practical relay attack on contactless transactions by using nfc mobile phones		Contactless technology is widely used in security sensitive applications, including identification, payment and access-control systems. Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range contactless technology allowing mobile devices to act primarily as either a reader or a token. Relay attacks exploit the assumption that a contactless token within communication range is in close proximity, by placing a proxy-token in range of a contactless reader and relaying communication over a greater distance to a proxy-reader communicating with the authentic token. It has been theorised that NFC-enabled mobile phones could be used as a generic relay attack platform without any additional hardware, but this has not been successfully demonstrated in practice. We present a practical implementation of an NFC-enabled relay attack, requiring only suitable mobile software applications. This implementation reduces the complexity of relay attacks and therefore has potential security implications for current contactless systems. We also discuss countermeasures to mitigate the attack.	access control;application lifecycle management;biometric passport;channel (communications);contactless payment;contactless smart card;control system;countermeasure (computer);experiment;mobile device;mobile phone;mobile ticketing;near field communication;open-source software;relay attack;security service (telecommunication);software deployment;world-system	Lishoy Francis;Gerhard P.

61a711b35de6ee5860a34346a3916ed9658d51b2	towards quantifying the cost of a secure iot: overhead and energy consumption of ecc signatures on an arm-based device	libraries;libraries elliptic curve cryptography internet of things energy consumption runtime;runtime;internet of things;elliptic curve cryptography;energy consumption;telecommunication security energy consumption internet of things public key cryptography;cryptographically protected message secure iot energy consumption ecc signatures elliptic curve cryptography signatures arm based constrained devices zolertia re mote cryptographic operations	In this paper, we document the overhead in terms of runtime, firmware size, communication and energy consumption for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) signatures of modern ARM-based constrained devices. The experiments we have undertaken show that the cryptographic capabilities of the investigated Zolertia Re-Mote based on a TI's CC2538 chipset running Contiki OS is indeed suitable for the Internet-of-Things (IoT): Computing a signature using a curve with a 192-bit key length adds an additional runtime of roughly 200 ms. However, we found that in comparison to sending an unsigned message approximately two-thirds of the runtime overhead is spent on cryptographic operations, while sending the signed message accounts for the remainder. We give real measurements which can be used as a basis for analytical models. Our measurements show that the saving gained by using curves with lower security levels (i. e., 160-bit key length) is not worth the sacrifice in protection. While signatures add non-negligible overhead, we still think that the additional 200 ms (signing with secp192r) is worth consideration. This paper gives an indication of the true costs of cryptographically protected message integrity which is greater or equal to the cost of encryption. We show what needs to be spent in order to verify the origin of the data in the application, since in the IoT it will have travelled through many `things'.	arm architecture;antivirus software;chipset;contiki;digital signature;elliptic curve cryptography;encryption;experiment;firmware;information security;key size;operating system;overhead (computing);sensor node	Max Mossinger;Benedikt Petschkuhn;Johannes Bauer;Ralf C.

They are easy to use and fast, and can be accessed from any computer or smartphone without installation. They let us easily communicate and share data with one another, shop simply, and access vast amounts of information. However, they're also frequently mentioned in connection with novel exploits, data leaks, or identity theft. Active content, tight integration, and the overall complexity of the continuously evolving Web 2.0 technology create new risks that we can hardly grasp. Turning back on the technology is not a solution because we would lose many features that we've come to rely on. But how can we achieve both a pleasant user experience and security in a place as messy as the Web 2.0 landscape? First, we can look to understand the wide range of attacks as well as the complex security situation and attack surface of Web 2.0 applications. Second, we can study the open research challenges in this field and assess how best to approach these issues.	attack surface;open research;plasma cleaning;smartphone;user experience;web 2.0;world wide web	Benjamin Stritter;Felix C.

76baae43abd75d7d13decf1306d46adf70d72c34	password protected smart card and memory stick authentication against off-line dictionary attacks		We study the security requirements for remote authentication with password protected smart card. In recent years, several protocols for password-based authenticated key exchange have been proposed. These protocols are used for the protection of password based authentication between a client and a remote server. In this paper, we will focus on the password based authentication between a smart card owner and smart card via an untrusted card reader. In a typical scenario, a smart card owner inserts the smart card into an untrusted card reader and input the password via the card reader in order for the smart card to carry out the process of authentication with a remote server. In this case, we want to guarantee that the card reader will not be able to impersonate the card owner in future without the smart card itself. Furthermore, the smart card could be stolen. If this happens, we want the assurance that an adversary could not use the smart card to impersonate the card owner even though the sample space of passwords may be small enough to be enumerated by an off-line adversary.	adversary (cryptography);authenticated key exchange;authentication;card reader;dictionary attack;online and offline;password;requirement;server (computing);smart card	Yongge Wang	2012	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-30436-1_40	multos;smart card;java card;common access card;smart card application protocol data unit;card reader;internet privacy;openpgp card;world wide web;computer security;contactless smart card;card security code	Security	-50.145844965589454	65.74991235927385	62702
3bf0fa6afa41d762b5c38d4650d017ea1d88cf4c	rate-based watermark traceback: a new approach	signal detection;time synchronization;watermark;packet delay;stepping stone;ipd	Network based intrusions have become a serious threat to Internet users. Despite many sophisticated defense techniques, attacks continue to increase. At present, in order to hide the source of the attack, many attackers prefer a stepping stone to launch their attack due to the anonymous nature of the Internet. The size, header and content of an IP packet will be changed because of the stepping stone and all these changes make it more difficult to trace the source of attacks. Currently, researchers study the time interval between IP packets and embed the watermark into the packet stream by adjusting the time interval between IP packets to trace the source of attacks. In this paper we study the previous watermarking schemes based on inter packet delay and propose a novel watermark scheme based on the rate of packets. For the first time we used weak signal detection model and cluster technology to resume the watermark, so as to avoid the present schemes which are based on precision time synchronization or packet number. Simulation tests show that the novel watermark is robust and can countermine the time perturbation, packet losing perturbation and packet padding perturbation caused by an attacker on purpose.	algorithm;detection theory;digital watermarking;internet;network packet;sensor;simulation;stepping level	Zongbin Liu;Jiwu Jing;Peng Liu	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12827-1_13	integrated project delivery;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;internet privacy;transmission delay;watermark;computer security;detection theory	Security	-58.918232209849606	69.0298699606723	62842

These protocols can be used for secure location verification and detection of relay attacks, even in presence of strong attackers. The rapid-bit-exchange is the core of distance bounding protocols---the verifier sends single bit challenges, which the prover is expected to answer with minimal and stable processing delay. Based on the measured round trip time of flight, the verifier calculates its upper bound to the prover. Although several aspects of distance bounding implementations have been discussed in the past, no full implementation of a wireless distance bounding system has been presented so far.  In this work, we present the first full realization of a rapid bit exchange system for distance bounding. Our system consists of an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging radio and of an efficient digital processing implemented on an Field-Programmable-Gate-Array (FPGA) board; it achieves a ranging accuracy of 7:5 cm and a short processing delay at the prover (< 100 ns). This minimal processing delay is the lowest reported so far for provers that demodulate the challenge before responding.	digital data;field-programmable gate array;processing delay;relay;ultra-wideband	Nils Ole Tippenhauer;Heinrich Luecken;Marc Kuhn;Srdjan Capkun	2015		10.1145/2766498.2766504	embedded system;special drawing rights;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;key exchange;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-52.90170023779436	69.73406176586009	62868

These types of networks have been useful to find former classmates or to improve our interaction with friends. Currently, a huge amount of information is generated and consumed by millions of people from these types of networks. Most popular online social networks are based on centralized servers, which are responsible for the management and storage all information. Although online social networks introduce several benefits, these networks still face many challenges such as central control, privacy or security. P2P infrastructures have emerged as an alternative platform to deploy decentralized online social networks. However, decentralized distributed systems are vulnerable to malicious peers. In this work, we evaluate P2P infrastructures against Sybil attacks. In particular, we simulate and evaluate hybrid and distributed P2P architectures.	centralized computing;distributed computing;peer-to-peer;simulation;social network;sybil attack	Francisco de Asís López-Fuentes;Salvador Balleza-Gallegos	2015	2015 IEEE 17th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications, 2015 IEEE 7th International Symposium on Cyberspace Safety and Security, and 2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems	10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.252	communications protocol;flowchart;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;internet privacy;computational model;world wide web;computer security;bandwidth;server;computer network	Embedded	-54.92362517258064	66.62743501780415	63378

The problem still remains mostly open, since a solution having the properties of being low-cost, low power consuming, robust, and easy-to-use, is yet to be proposed in the literature. As a remedy to this situation, in this paper, we propose a visible light based touchless input device (named Sporshohin), retaining all the properties mentioned above, for ensuring ubiquitous usage. Sporshohin recognizes predefined gestures performed by the user, through an underlying mechanism that exploits well-known reflection model over the visible light spectrum. The underlying mechanism is intelligent enough to guarantee robustness against varying environmental lighting conditions and undefined noisy gestures. Real implementation, involving interaction with diversified users, confirms high accuracy and usability along with existence of all the above mentioned properties. We show the emulation of Sporshohin as an input interface for an information kiosk. The attributes of Sporshohin exhibit its prospect of being used in diversified applications going beyond information kiosks.	emulator;exploit (computer security);gesture recognition;input device;undefined behavior;usability	Tusher Chakraborty;Md.

Participants rarely know each other, and may be completely anonymous, so the self-interest of the participants works against trust and they miss out on the benefits of cooperation. Reputation mechanisms help to remedy selfish misbehaviour. In this paper a new layered reputation mechanism establishes a trusted P2P environment, with bad content filtered out and novel content continuously introduced, by giving appropriate incentives to participants.

This framework could provide the missing link that lets general consumers secure their online access via smart cards.From phishing schemes to pharming scams, online identity theft is a risk that Internet users face as attackers continue to trick people into revealing personal information. One promising solution is the use of smart cards-secure, portable, and tamper-resistant cards with embedded microprocessors. Smart cards have successfully provided security services in many other domains over the past two decades as subscriber identification modules (SIMs) in cell phones, physical access cards for buildings and public transportation tokens for logical access to computers and networks, and identification cards or passports for citizens. However, having developed technologies for using smart cards to prevent online identity theft, we've found that it's very difficult to push such technologies to the general Internet consumer market. This article analyzes some of these difficulties and offers a solution for addressing them.	computer;device driver;embedded system;list of code lyoko episodes;microprocessor;mobile phone;online identity;operating system;personally identifiable information;pharming;phishing;physical access;smart card;subscriber identity module;tamper resistance;usb	Karen Lu;Asad M.

Such a system will continuously monitor the typing behaviour of a user and will determine if the current user is still the genuine one or not, so that the system can be locked if a different user is detected. The main focus of this paper will be the way to evaluate the performance of such a biometric authentication system. The purpose of a performance evaluation for a static and for a continuous biometric authentication system differ greatly. For a static biometric system it is important to know how often a wrong decision is made. On the other hand, the purpose of a performance evaluation for a continuous biometric authentication system is not to see if an impostor is detected, but how fast he is detected. The performance of a continuous keystroke dynamic system will be tested based on this new evaluation method. a 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

863282402fb0be5ddbf68c95e0467e782c08154a	biometric layering with fingerprints: template security and privacy through multi-biometric template fusion	qa mathematics	As biometric applications are gaining popularity, there is increased concern over the loss of privacy and potential misuse of biometric data held in central repositories. We present a biometric authentication framework that constructs a multi-biometric template by layering multiple biometrics of a user, such that it is difficult to separate the individual layers. Thus, the framework uses the biometrics of the user to conceal them among one another. The resulting biometric template is also cancelable if the system is implemented with cancelable biometrics, such as voice. We present a realization of this idea combining two or three different fingerprints of the user, using four different methods of template construction. Three of the methods use less and less information of the constituent biometrics, so as to lower the risk of leakage and cross-link rates. Results are evaluated on publicly available Finger Verification Championship (FVC) 2000, 2002 and NIST fingerprint databases. With the FVC databases, we obtain 2.1%, 3.9% and 3.4% Equal Error Rate on average using the three proposed methods, while the state-of-the-art commercial system achieves 1.9%. Furthermore, we show low cross-link rates under 63% under different scenarios, while genuine identification rates are 100%, with such a small gallery of 55 templates.	authentication;biometrics;database;fingerprint verification competition;privacy;real life;spectral leakage	Muhammet Yıldız;Berrin A.

However, considering the possibility of TCP data injection, as described in [Wa04], it becomes obvious that this protocol is vulnerable to DoS attacks just because it is layered upon TCP. In this paper, we analyze DoS-attacks on SSL/TLS and describe a simple, yet effective way to provide protection for SSL/TLS by protecting the underlying TCP connection. We focus on a simple, feasible, and efficient solution, trying to balance security and usability issues by using the built-in key exchange of SSL/TLS to initialize TCP’s MD5 option.	64-bit computing;algorithm;built-in self-test;byte;checksum;confidentiality;denial-of-service attack;fits;hash-based message authentication code;key exchange;md5;microsoft outlook for mac;network packet;sha-1;transport layer security;usability	Lars Völker;Marcus Schöller	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-69962-0_20	key exchange;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Security	-55.20800136590359	68.98001700100109	64318
aaa4c05d4f15d4ea0ab050f99d17a93032df5160	a trusted power system network in electrical industry		Smart grid has become a vital part of our daily life. While enjoying the convenience provided by smart grid, users may lose privacy since the smart grid collects all the information about users and hacker technology may track them in various ways. To address the privacy issue, we propose a scheme to build a trusted platform which combining trusted computing and secure multi-party computing. We first design a trusted electronic document framework according to the requirement of State Grid Corporation of China, and then propose a secure multi-party computing scheme, to make sure that the information about users won't be spread. An illustration is applied to a SCADA power system, the security of our proposed scheme is verified by the mechanism of Stuxnet. Evaluation results show that the proposed framework can significantly improve the secure level in smart grid.	control system;general computer corporation;information security;information system;network theory;rationality;requirement;secure multi-party computation;stuxnet;trusted computing	Mengying Yuan;Xiangzhou Chen;Yang Wang;Huixia Ding	2017	2017 IEEE Second International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace (DSC)	10.1109/DSC.2017.98	information security;smart grid;grid computing;trusted network connect;hengzhi chip;trusted computing;computer security;scada;computer science;trusted platform module	DB	-50.28374277794908	68.09476098060321	64355

75c7bbb829556e840c2020915665f962bc6fd4fc	cookies invading our privacy for marketing advertising and security issues		Privacy has been a major concern for everybody over the internet. Governments across the globe have given their views on how the internet space can be managed effectively so that there is some control on the flow of confidential information and privacy to users and as well as to data is achieved. Taking advantage of the lack of one unified body that could govern the online space with its strict and stringent rules certain websites use the text files called cookies in collecting data from users and using them for marketing them in advertisements networks and third party websites with the help of JavaScript and flash technologies. Even before many of us think what is happening around us in the online usage we are being invaded by the cookies and are targeted with their specific information that could tempt us to buy a product or service to which we were longing for in the recent past. Though it may be argued it’s a kind of marketing strategy to give the customer what he wants but it can no way be something like the user is just being targeted because he has already shown interest in something and he should be disturbed until he gets hold of something. It’s purely a security breach as most of the websites don’t ask permission for the usage of cookies and setting them into the user’s browser and the most important thing is no privacy statement is issued that the information is used for targeted marketing. This analysis paper has views from different sources, an example of such an activity that is a potential security breach and various other information of what these sites do to use the deadly cookies for commercial tricks.	confidentiality;http cookie;javascript;privacy	Sowmyan Jegatheesan	2013	CoRR		telecommunications;advertising;internet privacy;management;world wide web;computer security	Security	-54.80436874815458	62.99983835248994	64507

These savings, however, come at the cost of errors in the shared data, which are usually assumed low enough to not disrupt the application. We argue that this assumption does not hold in a more hostile environment, such as the Internet, where attackers can send a carefully crafted Bloom filter in order to break the application. In this paper, we propose the concatenated Bloom filter (CBF), a robust Bloom filter that prevents the attacker from interfering on the shared information, protecting the application data while still providing space efficiency. Instead of using a single large filter, the CBF concatenates small subfilters to improve both the filter robustness and capacity. We propose three CBF variants and provide analytical results that show the efficacy of the CBF for different scenarios. We also evaluate the performance of our filter in an IP traceback application and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism in the face of attackers.	bloom filter;concatenation;data structure;distributed computing;ip traceback;internet;router (computing);simulation	Marcelo Duffles Donato Moreira;Rafael P.

The approach is validated thanks to several months of data collected with the worldwide distributed Leurr\'e.com system. To distinguish the relevant traces from the other ones, we group them according to either the platforms, i.e. targets hit or the countries of origin of the attackers. We show that the choice of one of these two observation viewpoints dramatically influences the results obtained. Each one reveals unique botnets. We explain why.

c0721fb5b135fc776cdb05430ed62d5278d40722	covert channel detection framework for cloud using distributed machine learning		Recent research shows that colluded malware in different VMs sharing physical host may use access latency of a resource as a covert channel to leak critical information. Covert channels employ time characteristics to transmit confidential information to attackers. In this manuscript we have made two important contributions and to the best of our knowledge they are novel. One is to propose a framework for detecting covert channel attack based anomalies in cloud using machine learning . This framework is based on application criticality where the degree of error tolerance will be based on the sensitivity of application. This is a useful feature for cloud based applications as SLAs are trade off between service and cost. There are two modules of the framework ,a cluster monitor and another module becomes part of hypervisor for monitoring purposes. Second contribution is we propose an approach to distribute the machine learning technique in such a manner to be able to handle imbalance learning as well as enabling SVM to handle large datasets.	cloud computing;confidentiality;covert channel;criticality matrix;error-tolerant design;hypervisor;machine learning;malware;sensor	Mansaf Alam;Shuchi Sethi	2015	CoRR		computer science;operating system;data mining;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security	Security	-60.369153249651504	62.37636854797017	65475

In this paper, an approach to reconstruct Android user behavior from YAFFS2 based on SQLite is proposed. Based on the storage mechanism of YAFFS2 file system and the file structures of SQLite, all of the SQLite records can be recovered from the Android image, regardless of whether the SQLite file has been deleted or not in YAFFS2, and the user behaviors are parsed from those recovered SQLite records; then an Android user behavior timeline is constructed for visualizing based on the time stamp stored in it’s SQLite records. The evaluated experiment results show that the proposed method can reconstruct user behavior correctly, and can obtain more user behaviors than Encase to help investigators to complete digital forensic.	android;basic stamp;encase;mobile phone;parsing;sqlite;timeline	Ming Xu;Jun Yao;Yizhi Ren;Jian Xu;Haiping Zhang;Ning Zheng;Shiyue Ling	2014	JCP	10.4304/jcp.9.10.2294-2302	computer science;digital forensics;internet privacy;android beam;world wide web;computer security;android	Security	-57.13878814033501	60.51384916263876	65625

Due to the insecure design and the open standards of USB technologies, attackers have successfully exploited various vulnerabilities in USB protocols, USB embedded security software, USB drivers, and Windows Autoplay features to launch various software attacks against host computers and USB devices. The purposes of this paper are: (i) to provide an investigation on the currently identified USB based software attacks on host computers and USB storage devices, (ii) to identify the technology enablers of the attacks, and (iii) to form taxonomy of attacks. The results show that a multilayered security solution framework involving software implementations at the User Mode layer in the operating systems can help eliminate the root cause of the problem radically. a 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents attack diagnosis (AD), a novel attack mitigation scheme that combines the concepts of Pushback and packet marking. AD's architecture is inline with the ideal DDoS attack countermeasure paradigm, in which attack detection is performed near the victim host and attack mitigation is executed close to the attack sources. AD is a reactive defense that is activated by a victim host after an attack has been detected. A victim activates AD by sending AD-related commands to its upstream routers. On receipt of such commands, the AD-enabled upstream routers deterministically mark each packet destined for the victim with the information of the input interface that processed that packet. By collecting the router interface information recorded in the packet markings, the victim can trace back the attack traffic to the attack sources. Once the traceback is complete, the victim issues messages that command AD-enabled routers to filter attack packets close to the source. The AD commands can be authenticated by the TTL field of the IP header without relying on any global key distribution infrastructure in Internet. Although AD can effectively filter traffic generated by a moderate number of attack sources, it is not effective against large-scale attacks. To address this problem, we propose an extension to AD called parallel attack diagnosis (PAD) that is capable of throttling traffic coming from a large number of attack sources simultaneously. AD and PAD are analyzed and evaluated using a realistic network topology based on the Skitter Internet map. Both schemes are shown to be robust against IP spoofing and incur low false positive ratios.	authentication;denial-of-service attack;deterministic algorithm;honeypot (computing);ip address spoofing;ip traceback;input device;item unique identification;key distribution;network packet;network topology;programming paradigm;router (computing);simulation;transistor–transistor logic;upstream (software development)	Ruiliang Chen;Jung-Min Jerry Park	2005	Proceedings. 14th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, 2005.

9fe9eb4c2438f08f3f530ed6d6cc94116a93e513	phishing attacks detection using genetic programming		Phishing is a real threat on the Internet nowadays. According to a re- port released by an American security firm, RSA, there have been approximately 33,000 phishing attacks globally each month in 2012, leading to a loss of $687 mil- lion. Therefore, fighting against phishing attacks is of great importance. One popu- lar and widely-deployed solution with browsers is to integrate a blacklist sites into them. However, this solution, which is unable to detect new attacks if the database is out of date, appears to be not effective when there are a lager number of phish- ing attacks created very day. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by applying Genetic Programming to phishing detection problem. We conducted the experiments on a data set including both phishing and legitimate sites collected from the Internet. We compared the performance of Genetic Programming with a number of other machine learning techniques and the results showed that Genetic Programming produced the best solutions to phishing detection problem.

They can be deployed as protection mechanisms to an organization's real systems, or as research units to study and analyze the methods employed by individual hackers. In this paper we present the results of a research honeypot's operation, which undertook the role of a web trap for attackers who target the SSH service in order to gain illegal server access. The fake system has remained online and fully operational during a course of several consequent months, capturing attacks and logging all malicious activity. During this assessment it was shown that honeypots remain very effective tools in gathering information about SSH attacks. Furthermore, we observed that attackers are constantly targeting servers in the wild employing ready-to-use tools and dictionaries, while their post-compromise actions include mostly pivoting and IRC-related activities. Lastly we present a visualization tool aimed at helping security researchers during the analysis and conclusions drawing phases, for use with the same SSH honeypot implementation software as outlined in this work.	client honeypot;computer security;credential;dictionary;download;firewall (computing);graphical user interface;honeypot (computing);information security;internet relay chat;linux;malware;password;pivot table;protection mechanism;server (computing);system administrator	Ioannis Koniaris;Georgios I.

211adbeeadaaaa144f6ed9b0481e3ca1aa76f3d4	securing vehicle to vehicle communications using blockchain through visible light and acoustic side-channels		Autonomous and self-driving vehicles are appearing on the public highways. These vehicles commonly use wireless communication techniques for both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Manufacturers, regulators and the public are understandably concerned about large-scale systems failure or malicious attack via these wireless vehicular networks. This paper explores the use of sensing and signalling devices that are commonly integrated into modern vehicles for side-channel communication purposes. Visible light (using a CMOS camera) and acoustic (ultrasonic audio) sidechannel encoding techniques are proposed, developed and evaluated in this context. The side-channels are examined both theoretically and experimentally and an upper bound on the line code modulation rate that is achievable with these side channel schemes in the vehicular networking context is established. A novel inter-vehicle session key establishment protocol, leveraging both side-channels and a blockchain public key infrastructure, is then presented. In light of the limited channel capacity and the interoperability/security requirements for vehicular communications, techniques for constraining the throughput requirement, providing device independence and validating the location of the intended recipient vehicle, are presented. These reduce the necessary device handshake throughput to 176 bits for creating symmetric encryption and message authentication keys and in verifying a vehicle’s certificate with a recognised certification authority.	acoustic cryptanalysis;autonomous robot;bitcoin;cmos;certificate authority;channel capacity;device independence;encryption;experiment;exploit (computer security);identifier;interference (communication);interoperability;key exchange;line code;message authentication;modulation;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;radio frequency;requirement;session key;side-channel attack;symmetric-key algorithm;throughput;transport layer security;vehicle-to-vehicle	Sean Rowan;Michael Clear;Mario Gerla;Meriel Huggard;Ciarán Mc Goldrick	2017	CoRR		certificate authority;computer security;wireless;public key infrastructure;vehicular ad hoc network;device independence;session key;computer science;computer network;side channel attack;communication channel	Mobile	-50.555296971957986	71.32941893334426	66420

9da5e2bcecc2a3338c572aaa5286b4bf73bb31ea	identification of malicious edge devices in fog computing environments		Device security is one of the major challenges for successful implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and fog computing. Researchers and IT organizations have explored many solutions to protect systems from unauthenticated device attacks (known as outside device attacks). Fog computing uses many edge devices (e.g., router, switch, and hub) for latency-aware processing of collected data. So, identification of malicious edge devices is one of the critical activities in data security of fog computing. Preventing attacks from malicious edge devices is more difficult because they have certain granted privileges to store and process the data. In this article, a proposed framework uses three technologies, a Markov model, an intrusion detection system (IDS), and a virtual honeypot device (VHD) to identify malicious edge devices in a fog computing environment. A two-stage Markov model is used to categorize edge devices effectively into four different levels. The VHD is designed to store and maintain a log repository of all identified malicious devices, which assists the system to defend itself from any unknown attacks in the future. The proposed model is tested in a simulated environment, and results indicate the effectiveness of the system. The proposed model is successful in identifying the malicious device as well as reducing the false IDS alarm rate.	categorization;data logger;data security;edge device;fog computing;hidden markov model;honeypot (computing);internet of things;intrusion detection system;malware;markov chain;router (computing);simulation;usb hub;virtual reality;volumetric haptic display	Rajinder Sandhu;Amandeep Singh Sohal;Sandeep K.

The digital evidence may be manifest in various forms. It may be manifest on digital electronic devices or computers that are simply passive repositories of evidence that documents the activity, or it may consist of information or meta-information resident on the devices or computers that have been used to actually facilitate the activity, or that have been targeted by the activity. In each of these three cases, we have recorded digital evidence of the activity. This paper examines some recent advances in digital forensics and some important emerging challenges. It considers the following topics: tools and their evolution; the implications of large volumes of data; the impact of embedded and special-purpose computer systems; corporate governance and its implications for 'forensic readiness'; and the role of forensics in securing the Internet.	computer;corporate governance;digital humanities;document;embedded system;internet;manifest (transportation)	George M.

68c6be914d9dcc6c08bf64faa869cbf75f3560c6	idea: a unifying theory for evaluation systems		Secure systems for voting, exams, auctions and conference paper management are theorised to address the same problem, that of secure evaluations. In support of such a unifying theory comes a model for Secure Evaluation Systems (SES), which offers innovative common grounds to understand all four groups. For example, all rest on submissions, respectively votes, test answers, bids and papers, which are to be evaluated and ultimately ranked. A taxonomy for all groups is advanced to provide a comparative understanding of the various systems. The taxonomy is built according to the type of submissions and the type of evaluation. The uniformity of the security requirements across all groups offers additional validation, and this is an innovative finding in the direction, currently unexplored, of a common system design. Still, the requirements may variously shape up. For example, while voter privacy is normally required forever, anonymity of the submissions is required until after the marking/evaluation phase for the test answers of an exam, for the (sealed) bids of an auction, and for the papers submitted to a conference.	authentication;circuit complexity;fairness measure;item unique identification;mathematical model;non-repudiation;requirement;scsi enclosure services;systems design;taxonomy (general)	Giampaolo Bella;Rosario Giustolisi	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-62105-0_15	management science;common value auction;voting;computer science;ranking	SE	-50.86999413050989	70.85344021025907	66781

This paper details the analysis of the traffic of a large set of real ADSL customers in the corenet work. We build a profile of network usage for each customer and we detect malicious ones. Based on these data we study the impact of some characteristics in ADSL customer profiles on their likeliness to generate malicious traffic. We find two application types that are risk factors and we also bring evidence that the type of operating system impacts greatly the odds of being infected. Based on these results we build a profile of customers more likely to be infected.	antivirus software;asymmetric digital subscriber line;customer relationship management;download;executable;expect;ip address spoofing;malware;microsoft windows;open-source software;operating system;peer-to-peer;risk assessment;risk factor (computing);sensor;social messaging;software propagation;user agent	Yannick Carlinet;Ludovic Mé;Hervé Debar;Yvon Gourhant	2008	2008 Second International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies	10.1109/SECURWARE.2008.30	epidemiology;digital subscriber line;computer science;operating system;malware;world wide web;computer security;risk factor;computer virus;computer network	Security	-57.84625936194824	61.94329057069904	66885
e5fa9b508416ae8380465ed6185a073c4123635d	access control schemes for implantable medical devices: a survey		Implantable medical devices (IMDs) are electronic devices implanted within human body for diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic purposes. It is imperative to guarantee that IMDs are completely secured since the patient’s life is closely bound to the robustness and effectiveness of IMDs. Intuitively, we have to ensure that only the authorized medical personnel and IMD programmer can access the IMD. However, in recent years, several attacks have been reported which can successfully compromise a number of IMD products, e.g., stealing the sensitive health data and issuing fake commands. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed and well-recognized security standards and the protection of IMD is still an open problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on IMD security, with a focus on the access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access. Specifically, we first reviewed the security incidents, IMD threat model and the development of regulations for IMD security. Next, we classified existing IMD access control schemes based on architecture, type of keys used, access control channel, and logic. We also analyzed how different access control models can be adopted to secure IMD. Besides, we particularly discussed the viability of online authentication and low/zero power authentication in the IMD context.	access control;authentication;authentication server;authorization;imperative programming;low-power broadcasting;programmer;proxy server;random access;server (computing);threat model	Longfei Wu;Xiaojiang Du;Mohsen Guizani;Amr Mohamed	2017	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2017.2708042	robustness (computer science);computer network;access control;computer science;architecture;programmer;computer security;threat model;computer access control;authentication;compromise	Security	-50.87565010564955	72.07351615947249	66941

The backbone traffic is so huge that it is difficult to monitor abnormal traffic by traditional methods. Our system is based on Hadoop, an open source framework, and used to detect the abnormal traffic. Firstly, We establish a precise regression model to describe the network traffic. Secondly, distributed system Hadoop is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Finally, the experimental results prove that our system can detect the abnormal traffic accurately and efficiently in the real-world network environment.	anomaly detection;apache hadoop;big data;cluster analysis;distributed computing;internet backbone;mathematical model;network traffic control;open-source software;real-time clock	Jishen Yu;Feng Liu;Wenli Zhou;Hua Yu	2014	2014 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems	10.1109/CCIS.2014.7175718	traffic generation model;network traffic control;real-time computing;computer science;world wide web;computer security	HPC	-62.2477153675107	66.50366429216903	67522
028055985f90fe54d2ecece7f474d12554611a13	an analysis of socware cascades in online social networks	social spam;online social networks;facebook	Online social networks (OSNs) have become a popular new vector for distributing malware and spam, which we refer to as socware. Unlike email spam, which is sent by spammers directly to intended victims, socware cascades through OSNs as compromised users spread it to their friends. In this paper, we analyze data from the walls of roughly 3 million Facebook users over five months, with the goal of developing a better understanding of socware cascades.  We study socware cascades to understand: (a) their spatio-temporal properties, (b) the underlying motivations and mechanisms, and (c) the social engineering tricks used to con users. First, we identify an evolving trend in which cascades appear to be throttling their rate of growth to evade detection, and thus, lasting longer. Second, our forensic investigation into the infrastructure that supports these cascades shows that, surprisingly, Facebook seems to be inadvertently enabling most cascades; 44% of cascades are disseminated via Facebook applications. At the same time, we observe large groups of synergistic Facebook apps (more than 144 groups of size 5 or more) that collaborate to support multiple cascades. Lastly, we find that hackers rely on two social engineering tricks in equal measure?luring users with free products and appealing to users' social curiosity?to enable socware cascades. Our findings present several promising avenues towards reducing socware on Facebook, but also highlight associated challenges.	cascades in financial networks;email;emoticon;global cascades model;malware;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;next-generation network;social engineering (security);social network;spamming;synergy;system on a chip	Ting-Kai Huang;Md.

This method analyzes the entropy characteristics of n-gram entropy for text, picture, compressed file, and encrypted traffic in the network. Furthermore, an analysis of cumulative sum is performed to better distinguish compressed file traffic and encrypted traffic. The experiments show that our propsed method reaches high accuracy for encrypted traffic identification and performs well in distinguishing compressed file traffic and encrypted traffic.	algorithm;binary classification;encryption;experiment;goto;n-gram;network security;network traffic control;traffic classification;way to go	Guang Cheng;Ying Hu	2018		10.1145/3226052.3226057	statistics;n-gram;encryption;mathematics	Metrics	-61.350749334390486	66.61513710117595	67808

However, WMNs are particularly vulnerable to malicious nodes given their inherent attributes such as decentralized infrastructure and high dependence of node cooperation. We then propose a distributed and Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS) architecture for detecting insider attacks at real-time, which comprises: i) a Routing Protocol Analyzer (RPA) to analyze the collected routing traffic and generate respective Routing Events; ii) a Distributed Intrusion Detection Engine (DIDE) that treats the Routing Events by applying Routing Constraints and calculate related Misbehaving Metrics; iii) a Cooperative Consensus Mechanism (CCM) to check the Misbehaving Metrics using a proposed threshold scheme and to track down the source of intrusion. The entire CIDS solution is implemented in a virtualized mesh network platform. The experimental results show the proposed CIDS architecture efficiently detects message fabrication attacks with good precision and low resource consumption.	algorithm;bro;central processing unit;computation;computational resource;deployment environment;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;intrusion detection system;mesh networking;network architecture;norm (social);overhead (computing);real-time clock;routing;scheme;secret sharing;sensor;waypoint;web service;wireless mesh network	Anderson Morais Paiva Morais;Ana R.

The mere existence of communication is often enough to raise suspicion and trigger investigative actions. Covert channels aim to side-step this problem by hiding additional information within the 'normal' behaviour of preexisting communication streams. The huge amount of data and vast number of different protocols in the Internet make it ideal as a high-bandwidth vehicle for covert channels. Several researchers have proposed modulation techniques to encode covert information into the IP Time To Live field. In this paper we compare the different encoding techniques and also propose two new improved encoding schemes. We present a software framework developed for evaluating covert channels in network protocols. We use this software to empirically evaluate the transmission rates of the different TTL modulation techniques for real Internet traffic.	byte;channel (communications);communications protocol;covert channel;encode;emulator;encryption;formal methods;internet;modulation;network packet;software framework;stealth;time to live;transistor–transistor logic	Sebastian Zander;Grenville J.

Prior to an attack, an IDS operates in anticipation of a general threat. During an attack, the IDS can deal less in the general and more in the particularnamely, particulars about attackers and attacked devices. A profile of the attacker is developed, using information he reveals about himself during his attacks. Principles from economics are used to predict the attacker's behavior, based on estimates of his asset-appraisal, attack-costs and attack-resources. Likelycompromised devices (LCDs) are identified, using the profile and the economics-based estimates. Knowledge of LCDs is useful for work in attack repair, neutralization and containment.	intrusion detection system	Jim Yuill;Shyhtsun Felix Wu;Fengmin Gong;Ming-Yuh Huang	1999			computer science;computer security;intrusion detection system	Security	-61.608312195552585	61.115160316288254	68193

These attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to a normal behavior. In this paper we discuss a control-theoretic Hidden Markov Model (HMM) strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observations across multiple nodes. This model consists of a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine. This drives the defensive response based on hysteresis to reduce the frequency of false positives, thereby avoiding inappropriate ad hoc responses.	8b/10b encoding;anomaly detection;cybernetics;data mining;decision stump;distributed computing;expectation–maximization algorithm;exploit (computer security);feedback;hidden markov model;hoc (programming language);hysteresis;intrusion detection system;kullback–leibler divergence;machine learning;malware;markov chain;observable;profiling (computer programming);raid;randomness;sigkdd;sensor;signal processing;software release life cycle;static program analysis;stochastic process;theory	Rahul Khanna;Huaping Liu	2007		10.1145/1280940.1280965	anomaly-based intrusion detection system;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer security;hidden markov model;statistics;computer network	Security	-61.3023698577879	70.28928328766786	68233

To solve these problems, this paper proposes a content distribution and copyright authentication system based on media index and watermarking techniques. Before media distribution, the media content is marked (by embedding the ownership information or customer identification into the media), and the robust features that can be used both for media index and content emendation is extracted from the watermarked media and registered in a feature database. Some customer may leak out his media copy over Internet directly or after slight operations, such as rotation, shearing, scaling, translation, etc. To detect whether a media over Internet is copyright-protected or not, the following work is done. Firstly, a watermark is extracted from the media and compared with the original one. If the watermark exists, then the media is copyright-protected, and the authentication process is finished. Otherwise, a robust feature is extracted from the considered media and matched with the feature database. The matching result gives the operation parameters that are used to emend the media content. After media emendation, a watermark is extracted or detected again and used to authenticate the copyright. In this system, the robust feature is not only used to search the related media contents but also to emend the media in order to improve the robustness against such operations as adding noise, compression, rotation, shearing, scaling, translation, etc. Experimental results show that the combination of media index and watermark detection can improve the detection rate greatly.	ansi escape code;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;authentication;computation;digital distribution;digital watermarking;experiment;fingerprint (computing);image scaling;internet;social network;utility functions on indivisible goods;watermark (data file)	Shiguo Lian;Xi Chen;Jinwei Wang	2010	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-010-0521-3	telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;watermark;world wide web;computer security;computer network	DB	-53.587083689961354	63.702960281255066	68254

The existing studies cannot eliminate the false positives by using the simple classification algorithms. In this paper, we analyze the essential difference between DDoS attacks and flash crowds which causes some similar consequences to DDoS. Accordingly we design a novel effective Entropy-based DDoS Defense Mechanism (EDDM) running on the SDN controller, which including a two-stage DDoS detection method. Compared with the existing works, the EDDM avoids the dropping of legitimate packets and minimizes the losses of legitimate users. Simulations demonstrate that the EDDM can distinguish the DDoS attacks from flash crowds, find the locations of bots, and block attack packets at source effectively.	denial-of-service attack	Yajie Jiang;Xiaoning Zhang;Quan Zhou;Zijing Cheng	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-66625-9_17	control theory;crowds;distributed computing;software-defined networking;statistical classification;computer security;denial-of-service attack;network packet;computer science	Networks	-60.52448953776563	66.89860897986742	68440

In this paper, we propose to dynamically balance the anticipated QoS and security for adapting to the varying vehicular context and the served applications with aims to attain a satisfactory performance rating but without compromising any security. To this end, a variant of IKEv2 called Vehicular Internet Key Exchange (VIKE) is put forward to autonomously negotiate the optimal encryption and integrity algorithms and the related profile that particularly suit to the current context with respect to the confronted SNR, security risk and application requirements. We theoretically derive the relations between the QoS and security for analytical solutions in terms of four categories of vehicular applications. The extensive numerical calculations are conducted to comprehensively investigate how the proposed VIKE responses to the various combinations of the SNR, modulation scheme and key length. The results show that the VIKE is capable of self-adapting to the vehicular context, and of contributing to the quality of communication performance without compromising any security. The proposed VIKE is expected to port the mass-deployed IKE into securing the emerging numerous vehicular applications and services.	algorithm;authentication;confidentiality;context awareness;data integrity;encryption;hoc (programming language);internet key exchange;key size;mathematical model;modulation;non-repudiation;numerical analysis;performance rating;privacy;quality of service;requirement;serial experiments lain;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Jiake Xu;Yanheng Liu;Jian Wang;Weiwen Deng;Thierry Ernst	2015	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-014-0856-1	internet key exchange;telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-52.55522975578757	72.14996665169181	68551

QR Codes are mainly used to convey or store messages because they have higher or large storage capacity than any other normal conventional ‘barcodes’. In this paper the primary focus will be on storing messages in encrypted format with a password and send it to the required destination hiding in a QR Code, without being tracked or decrypted properly by any hacker or spyware. Since QR Codes have fast response time and have large storage capacity, QR Codes can be used perfectly to send encrypted data (messages) to the receiver. This method will be suitable in any business house, government sectors, communication network to send their encrypted messages faster to the destination. Or a person can even use this method to keep his important documents, like passport number, pan-card id, social security number, perfectly secured with him all the time, without the information getting leaked to outside world. The new method is achieved by entering the message along with a password. This password will generate a secret code, which will be added to each digit or alphabet in the numbers or text entered in the message (which is needed to be encrypted) and generate the first phase of encryption. That newly generated encrypted message will again be encrypted using various other methods to generate the final encrypted message.	cryptography;encryption;password;qr code;response time (technology);secure digital;social security;spyware;telecommunications network	Somdip Dey	2012	CoRR		internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-50.70045773206998	66.50744159035827	68591

A computer system connected to the network is accessible from another computer in this network regardless of its geographical position. Along with providing many benefits for legitimate users this technology creates almost unlimited opportunities for malicious persons, which using software vulnerabilities may successfully penetrate the networked computer systems. In order to eliminate potential devastating consequences caused by breaches in computer systems, more and more attention is drawn to the information security problems. However, despite these efforts, the occurrences of the security violations in the computer networks became increasingly frequent. In this paper we discuss an approach to detect the intrusions. Being able to accurately recognize its legitimate users a system may effectively detect masqueraders. The paper particularly focuses on the question of temporal pattern extraction from user behavior and shows that sequential patterns are not the only ones that may be found in user events sequences. There are also temporal patterns present in user behavior, which together with sequential may be used for efficient user recognition.	action potential;anomaly detection;bit error rate;computer;experiment;information security;intrusion detection system;malware;pattern language;pattern recognition;real life;user profile;vulnerability (computing)	Alexandr Seleznyov;Oleksiy Mazhelis	2002		10.1145/508791.508836	computer science;artificial intelligence;information security;network security;machine learning;pattern matching;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security	Security	-59.424621173407616	62.06287638549149	68809

Government officials are also trending towards acquiring Android mobile devices. Google's application architecture is already ubiquitous and will keep expanding. The beauty of an application-based architecture is the flexibility, interoperability and customizability it provides users. This same flexibility, however, also allows and attracts malware development.  This paper provides a horizontal research analysis of techniques used for Android application malware analysis. The paper explores techniques used by Android malware static analysis methodologies. It examines the key analysis efforts used by examining applications for permission leakage and privacy concerns. The paper concludes with a discussion of some gaps of current malware static analysis research.	android;applications architecture;bespoke;interoperability;malware analysis;mobile device;spectral leakage;static program analysis	Suzanna Schmeelk;Junfeng Yang;Alfred V.

Therefore, DDoS attacks increasingly use normal- looking application-layer requests to waste server CPU or disk capacity. CAPTCHAs attempt to distinguish bots from human clients and are often used to avoid such attacks. However, CAPTCHAs themselves consume resources and frequently are defeated. Kill-Bots reduces CAPTCHA overhead by pushing client authentication into the kernel. However, Kill-Bots requires kernel modifications, which can be infeasible. We describe the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of Sentinel, a network device that overcomes several limitations in Kill-Bots. Sentinel can be easily deployed as a bridge in front of server farms, modularly accepts a variety of present and future authentication schemes, and can use network processors to accelerate authentication. Experiments show that Sentinel greatly reduces the impact of DDoS attacks on the response time experienced by legitimate clients.	captcha;central processing unit;computer data storage;cryptographic hash function;denial-of-service attack;digest access authentication;experiment;hardware acceleration;ibm notes;kernel (operating system);modular programming;network processor;networking hardware;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;response time (technology);server (computing);server farm;video game bot	Peter Djalaliev;Muhammad Asim Jamshed;Nicholas L.

Organisations and institutions design different ways of providing security to their systems. Antivirus software and passwords are the common tools used to achieve security. However, the traditional use of passwords for information security is a cause for concern. Some systems require frequent change of passwords and this may entail users writing down their passwords each time they change. This may expose their passwords to unauthorised users. Computer users usually choose passwords that are easy to recall and this renders computer systems at institutions like universities inherently insecure. In this paper we describe a work-in-progress that investigates computer security threats mitigated by user's desire for convenience in choosing passwords. Our work further investigates non technical actions used to enforce systems security.	antivirus software;authorization;computer security;information security;password;rendering (computer graphics);user (computing)	S.

Our first intentional use of these protocols goes back to a 1999 article that proposed physical contact for imprinting as opposed to the wireless channel used in subsequent operations. Only later did we understand three key points. First, explicit use of multiple channels in the same protocol can offer significant advantages for both security and usability. Second, explicitly stating the properties of the channel on which each protocol message is transmitted is useful for understanding one's own protocol in greater depth and therefore for addressing subtle vulnerabilities early on. Third, multichannel protocols existed long before we recognized them as such - think of the courier handcuffed to the briefcase carrying the code book that will later protect postal or telegraphic traffic. The paper presents a security protocol that exploit additional transmissions over lower-capacity channels, typically found in ubicomp environments, that offer a different combination of security properties.	codebook;cryptographic protocol;postal;the code book;ubiquitous computing;usability;vulnerability (computing)	Ford-Long Wong;Frank Stajano	2007	IEEE Pervasive Computing	10.1109/MPRV.2007.76	universal composability;security through obscurity;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network;channel	Security	-52.74882347494234	69.73216650776138	70373

The analysis is presented in a black-box model of anonymous communication in the Universally Composable (UC) framework that abstracts the essential properties of onion routing in the presence of an active adversary who controls a portion of the network and knows all a priori distributions on user choices of destination. Our results quantify how much the adversary can gain in identifying users by exploiting knowledge of their probabilistic behavior. In particular, we show that, in the limit as the network gets large, a user u's anonymity is worst either when the other users always choose the destination u is least likely to visit or when the other users always choose the destination u chooses. This worst-case anonymity with an adversary that controls a fraction b of the routers is shown to be comparable to the best-case anonymity against an adversary that controls a fraction √b.	adversary (cryptography);best, worst and average case;black box;essence;exploit (computer security);probabilistic analysis of algorithms;routing;uc browser	Joan Feigenbaum;Aaron Johnson;Paul F.

By monitoring changes in DNS records of over 350 distinct spam-advertised domains collected from URLs in 115,000 spam emails received at a large spam sinkhole, we measure the rates and locations of remapping DNS records, and the rates at which “fresh” IP addresses are used. We find that, unlike the short-lived nature of the scams themselves, the infrastructure that hosts these scams has relatively persistent features that may ultimately assist detection.	email;fast flux;load balancing (computing);spamming	Maria Konte;Nick Feamster;Jaeyeon Jung	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-00975-4_22	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Metrics	-56.32862205648343	65.33624628557409	70651

This paper presents the results of a survey of 297 mobile subscribers, which attempted to assess their use of mobile devices, their use of current authentication methods, and their attitudes towards future security options. The findings revealed that the majority of the respondents make significant use of their devices, with clear demands for protection against unauthorised use. However, the use of current PIN-based authentication is problematic, with a third of the respondents indicating that they do not use it at all, and other problems being reported amongst those that do. In view of this, the respondents' opinions in relation to future security options are interesting, with 83% being willing to accept some form of biometric authentication on their device. The discussion considers these findings, and the potential applicability of the preferred techniques to mobile devices.	authentication;binocular disparity;biometrics;event (computing);facial recognition system;mobile device;mobile phone;resultant;signature recognition;speaker recognition;telephone number;usability	Nathan L.

In this paper, we demonstrate a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching 'link' fingerprints which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are unique, they are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for certain interesting security properties such as system accountability and non-repudiation.	fingerprint;forge;non-repudiation;personalization	Syed Taha Ali;Vijay Sivaraman;Diethelm Ostry;Sanjay Jha	2013		10.1145/2517351.2517432	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-50.15139970419176	72.1335020346749	70916

The irreversible financial and security damages that can result from this type of threat have placed Insider Threat among the most important problems in cybersecurity [1]. The complexity of the problem is mainly due to the fact that the attacker is a legitimate user of the system, which makes it very difficult to draw a clear line between legitimate and malicious actions. This paper presents a multi-perspective approach for detection of insider threats in typical enterprise networks. In this approach, multiple detection engines monitor network activities from different perspectives and use the aggregate information to adjust their detection sensitivities. Experimental results from our studies show that this approach results in reduced false alarm probability as well as an increased ability to detect attacks by colluding insiders.	aggregate data;computer security;entity;insider threat;logical framework;malware;threat (computer);user profile	Majid Raissi-Dehkordi;David Carr	2011	2011 - MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2011.6127457	business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	AI	-58.626427774481705	62.406223882483125	70937

Some of them are easily detected (like an DDOS targeting the system) while others are more stealthy and consist in successive attacks steps that compromise different parts of the targeted system. The alarm referring to detected attack steps are often hidden in a tremendous amount of notifications that include false alarms. Alert correlators use correlation rules (that can be explicit, implicit or semi-explicit [3]) in order to solve this problem by extracting complex relationships between the different generated events and alerts. On the other hand, providing maintainable, complete and accurate correlation rules specifically adapted to an information system is a very difficult work. We propose an approach that, given proper input information, can build a complete and system dependant set of correlation rules derived from a high level attack scenario. We then evaluate the applicability of this method by applying it to a real system and assessing the fault tolerance in a simulated environment in a second phase.	denial-of-service attack;fault tolerance;high-level programming language;information system;semiconductor industry;virtual reality	Erwan Godefroy;Eric Totel;Michel Hurfin;Frédéric Majorczyk	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)	10.1109/CNS.2015.7346896	intrusion detection system;real-time computing;computer science;sensor;knowledge-based systems;data mining;computer security;correlation	DB	-62.22626634519632	61.93062187299035	71124

MIXes and their variants are used today to provide untraceable communication with systems such as TOR, and they have been a major issue of research on privacy protection for more than twenty years. One of the major problems presented by a MIX is that its administrator is able to link the incoming and outgoing messages transiting through it, and this is the reason why MIXes are almost always organized in networks, according to the model presented by David Chaum (1981). In this paper, we present a protocol that combines these two fields of research, allowing us to create MIXes that have the remarkable property of being unable to link the incoming and outgoing packets transiting through them. This brings the possibility for its users to be untraceable while most of the data of their communication are sent through a single MIX, improving the performance and versatility of anonymizing systems	mix;router (computing);tor messenger	Carlos Aguilar Melchor;Yves Deswarte	2005	Fourth IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications	10.1109/NCA.2005.40	information privacy;computer science;cryptography;internet privacy;programming language;computer security;computer network	Arch	-58.44325569923595	68.62865321041328	71195

There is a plethora of URL blacklists/reputation services, out of which Google’s Safe Browsing and Microsoft’s SmartScreen stand out as the two most commonly used ones. Frequently, such lists are the only safeguard web browsers implement against such threats. Inevitably, as with any blacklist implementation, there is a time window between the creation of a rogue web site and the time it gets submitted to the blacklist(s), in which users are not protected. In this paper, we examine the level of protection that is offered by popular web browsers on iOS, Android and desktop (Windows) platforms, against a large set of phishing and malware URL. The results reveal that most browsers – especially those for mobile devices offer limited protection against such threats. As a result, we propose and evaluate an architecture, which can be used to significantly improve the level of protection offered to the users, regardless of the web browser or platform they are using.	android;browser security;browsing;desktop computer;emoticon;firefox;google chrome;internet explorer;malware;microsoft smartscreen;microsoft windows;mobile device;opera (web browser);phishing;protection mechanism;proxy server;rogue;security controls;semantic url attack;smartphone;threat (computer);ios	Nikos Virvilis;Alexios Mylonas;Nikolaos Tsalis;Dimitris Gritzalis	2015	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2015.04.009	browser security;phishing;spoofed url;web accessibility initiative;computer science;information security;web page;mobile device;malware;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;android	Security	-55.466158974512545	60.98601364184116	71250

Wireless devices that can learn from their environment can also be taught things by malicious elements of their environment. By putting artificial intelligence in charge of wireless network devices, we are allowing unanticipated, emergent behavior, fitting a perhaps distorted or manipulated level of optimality. The state space for a cognitive radio is made up of a variety of learned beliefs and current sensor inputs. By manipulating radio sensor inputs, an adversary can affect the beliefs of a radio, and consequently its behavior. In this paper we focus primarily on PHY-layer issues, describing several classes of attacks and giving specific examples for dynamic spectrum access and adaptive radio scenarios. These attacks demonstrate the capabilities of an attacker who can manipulate the spectral environment when a radio is learning. The most powerful of which is a self-propagating AI virus that could interactively teach radios to become malicious. We then describe some approaches for mitigating the effectiveness of these attacks by instilling some level of """"common sense"""" into radio systems, and requiring learned beliefs to expire and be relearned. Lastly we provide a road-map for extending these ideas to higher layers in the network stack."""	adversary (cryptography);agile software development;artificial intelligence;cognition;cognitive radio;computer virus;emergence;interactivity;key (cryptography);malware;phy (chip);protocol stack;sensor;state space;threat (computer)	T.

Emerging complicated attack scenarios such as DDoS attacks increase the complexity of tracking malicious and high risk network activities within a huge number of monitored network flows. To address this problem, we propose an iterative framework for assessing risk scores for hosts and network flows. To obtain risk scores of flows, we take into account two properties, flow attributes and flow provenance. Also, our iterative risk assessment measures the risk scores of hosts and flows based on an interdependency property where the risk score of a flow influences the risk of its source and destination hosts, and the risk score of a host is evaluated by risk scores of flows initiated by or terminated at the host. Moreover, the update mechanism in our framework allows flows to keep streaming into the system while our risk assessment method performs an online monitoring task. The experimental results show that our approach is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows as well as sufficiently efficient to be deployed in high throughput networks compared to other algorithms.	algorithm;computation;denial-of-service attack;interdependence;iteration;iterative method;openflow;risk assessment;sensor;software deployment;software-defined networking;throughput	Mohsen Rezvani;Aleksandar Ignjatovic;Sanjay Jha	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems	10.1109/DCOSS.2013.26	risk analysis;computer science;network security;data mining;iterative method;computer security;computer network	Security	-62.510328646187844	65.14310677200605	71419
5dcf339f6a20331f9801b981fc9513ff65fa4fd4	comprehensive behavior profiling model for malware classification		In view of the great threat posed by malware and the rapid growing trend about malware variants, it is necessary to determine the category of new samples accurately for further analysis and taking appropriate countermeasures. The network behavior based classification methods have become more popular now. However, the behavior profiling models they used usually only depict partial network behavior of samples or require specific traffic selection in advance, which may lead to adverse effects on categorizing advanced malware with complex activities. In this paper, to overcome the shortages of traditional models, we raise a comprehensive behavior model for profiling the behavior of malware network activities. And we also propose a corresponding malware classification method which can extract and compare the major behavior of samples. The experimental and comparison results not only demonstrate our method can categorize samples accurately in both criteria, but also prove the advantage of our profiling model to two other approaches in accuracy performance, especially under scenario based criteria.	behavior model;categorization;malware;maximal set	J.

In this paper, we aim at suggesting an open and secure e-ticketing architecture which provides an alternative to the conventional paper-based ticketing and is customizable for different tariff schemes. Our solution is based on NFC which should facilitate its interoperability with value-added services (from the third parties as well) and pave the way to its convergence with other applications comprising an Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem in the urban environment. The suggested architecture covers the main processes specific to the ESPT scenario and provides for e-ticket unclonability, unforgeability as well as for protection from tapping and replay attacks. Finally, the results of practical validation using real hardware are presented to demonstrate the real-world pertinence of our solution.	backup;ecosystem;electronic ticket;floor and ceiling functions;internet of things;interoperability;issue tracking system;near field communication;open-source software;relay;relevance;replay attack;requirement;software deployment;usability	Ivan Gudymenko;Felipe Sousa;Stefan Köpsell	2014			simulation;engineering;world wide web;computer security	Security	-49.826287058704935	69.48031640791055	71531

To counter large volumes of malware variants, machine learning techniques have been applied recently for automated malware classification. Despite the successes made from these efforts, we still lack a basic understanding of some key issues, such as what features we should use and which classifiers perform well on malware data. Against this backdrop, the goal of this work is to explore discriminatory features for automated malware classification. We conduct a systematic study on the discriminative power of various types of features extracted from malware programs, and experiment with different combinations of feature selection algorithms and classifiers. Our results not only offer insights into what features most distinguish malware families, but also shed light on how to develop scalable techniques for automated malware classification in practice.	algorithm;backdrop cms;cyberspace;feature selection;machine learning;malware;reverse engineering;scalability	Guanhua Yan;Nathan Brown;Deguang Kong	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39235-1_3	computer science;data mining;world wide web;computer security	Security	-60.00978918075729	60.57379640712567	71638

A comprehensive site survey is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjects to environmental changes. In this work, we develop a mobile participatory game, MobiBee, to collect fingerprints with the help of quick response (QR) codes (posted on walls or pillars as location tags). Various incentive strategies, including monetary, entertainment and competition, are utilized. The location marker is deliberately designed to ensure that fingerprints are collected at the targeted locations in a stationary manner. Interestingly, a few instances of QR code forgery have been identified during the game play, which exposes the vulnerability of using QR code in indoor localization. A fraud detection mechanism is hence proposed. Experiments show that the proposed approach can accurately detect the QR code forgery and improve indoor localization accuracy.	fingerprint;qr code;stationary process	Qiang Xu;Rong Zheng	2016		10.1145/2968219.2968590	embedded system;fingerprint;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;crowdsourcing	Mobile	-56.41287945964628	62.313559399521324	71677

Its decentralized nature introduces security and privacy vulnerabilities for applications built on top of them, we thus set out to design a lookup mechanism achieving both security and anonymity, heretofore an open problem. We present the design of Octopus, which uses attacker identification mechanisms to discover and remove malicious nodes, severely limiting an adversary's ability to carry out active attacks, and splits lookup queries over separate anonymous paths and introduces dummy queries to achieve high levels of anonymity. We analyze the security of Octopus by developing an event-based simulator to show that the attacker discovery mechanisms can rapidly identify malicious nodes with low error rate. We calculate the anonymity of Octopus using probabilistic modeling and show that Octopus can achieve near-optimal anonymity. We evaluate Octopus's efficiency on Planet lab and show that Octopus has reasonable lookup latency and low bandwidth overhead.	adversary (cryptography);cns;code;distributed hash table;dummy variable (statistics);ibm notes;lookup table;malware;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;planetlab;scsi initiator and target;simulation	Qiyan Wang;Nikita Borisov	2012	2012 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2012.78	routing;anonymity;pollution;vulnerability;information privacy;computer science;information security;probability;accuracy and precision;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-56.78445337319084	72.55715976507175	71793
2f8662f0ec26c24a1e67e489dfc19a7fbdb94323	distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks detection mechanism		Pushback is a mechanism for defending against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks are treated as a congestion-control problem, but because most such congestion is caused by malicious hosts not obeying traditional end-to-end congestion control, the problem must be handled by the routers. Functionality is added to each router to detect and preferentially drop packets that probably belong to an attack. Upstream routers are also notified to drop such packets in order that the router’s resources be used to route legitimate traffic hence term pushback. Client puzzles have been advocated as a promising countermeasure to DoS attacks in the recent years. In order to identify the attackers, the victim server issues a puzzle to the client that sent the traffic. When the client is able to solve the puzzle, it is assumed to be authentic and the traffic from it is allowed into the server. If the victim suspects that the puzzles are solved by most of the clients, it increases the complexity of the puzzles. This puzzle solving technique allows the traversal of the attack traffic throughout the intermediate routers before reaching the destination. In order to attain the advantages of both pushback and puzzle solving techniques, a hybrid scheme called Router based Pushback technique, which involves both the techniques to solve the problem of DDoS attacks is proposed. In this proposal, the puzzle solving mechanism is pushed back to the core routers rather than having at the victim. The router based client puzzle mechanism checks the host system whether it is legitimate or not by providing a puzzle to be solved by the suspected host.	client puzzle protocol;dos;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end principle;network congestion;obedience (human behavior);outsourcing;router (computing);server (computing)	Saravanan Kumarasamy;R.

In contrast to traditional web pages, the blog has several significant features: it allows authoring via a web browser, and offers automatic backlink requesting, called trackback. The latter provides direct communication between blog servers. In this paper, we propose a distributed computation method based on trackback communication and present the implementation of a software verification system based on distributed computing. The software verification system consists of ordinary blog systems which are used as frontend interfaces, and verification blog bots which are used as backend inference engines. One of the prominent features is that one can limit the danger of intrusion into vulnerable verifier programs to the private networks where the verification blog bots are operated.	blog;computation;distributed computing;software verification	Takayuki Sasajima;Shin-ya Nishizaki	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34062-8_60	computer science;database;distributed computing;world wide web	Logic	-55.9436315972955	63.911977893107405	72312

Our work is based upon the automatic phishing incident processing tool PhiGARo which locates users responding to phishing attack attempts and prevents access to phishing sites from the protected network. Although PhiGARo processes the phishing incidents automatically, it depends on reports of phishing incidents from users. We propose a framework which introduces honey pots into the process in order to eliminate the reliance on user input. The honey pots are used to capture e-mails, automatically detect messages containing phishing and immediately transfer them to PhiGARo. There is a need to propagate e-mail addresses of a honey pot to attract phishers. We discuss approaches to the honey pot e-mail propagation and propose a further enhancement to using honey pots in response to phishing incidents. We propose providing phishers with false credentials, accounts and documents that will grant them access to other honey pot services. Tracing these honey tokens may lead us to the originators of the phishing attacks and help investigations into phishing incidents.	credential;email;honeypot (computing);phishing;software framework;software propagation	Martin Husák;Jakub Cegan	2014	2014 Ninth International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	10.1109/ARES.2014.46	phishing;spoofed url;engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;tabnabbing	Web+IR	-57.978339080262565	64.52656621162674	72471

In this paper, we arise this concern by presenting an automatic attack against modern touchscreen keyboards. We demonstrate the attack against the Apple iPhone — 2010's most popular touchscreen device — although it can be adapted to other devices (e.g., Android) that employ similar key-magnifying keyboards. Our attack processes the stream of frames from a video camera (e.g., surveillance or portable camera) and recognizes keystrokes online, in a fraction of the time needed to perform the same task by direct observation or offline analysis of a recorded video, which can be unfeasible for large amount of data. Our attack detects, tracks, and rectifies the target touchscreen, thus following the device or camera's movements and eliminating possible perspective distortions and rotations In real-world settings, our attack can automatically recognize up to 97.07 percent of the keystrokes (91.03 on average), with 1.15 percent of errors (3.16 on average) at a speed ranging from 37 to 51 keystrokes per minute.	android;blackberry;distortion;event (computing);information sensitivity;mobile device;numerical analysis;online and offline;sensor;space bar;touchscreen;usb on-the-go;usability	Federico Maggi;Simone Gasparini;Giacomo Boracchi	2011	2011 7th International Conference on Information Assurance and Security (IAS)	10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122840	embedded system;engineering;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-51.53235300992975	64.81492122292875	72543

It has progressed through several iterations and has recently developed capabilities to circumvent measures employed by certain anti-DDoS hosting providers, this new capability was exposed as a new attack type named -- smart. The primary contribution of this paper is to show how the mechanism of the -- smart attack can itself be exploited to prevent an attacking Dirt Jumper bot from reaching its desired target application webserver as well as tarpitting the botnet, reducing its request rate more than a hundred fold.

While the business value of the IoS is undoubted, security and trustworthiness concerns still constitute an obstacle for uptake. In this paper we argue that security certification is a valid means to address these issues. However, existing certification schemes addressing static systems and environments do not scale to the IoS and, thus, cannot be straightforwardly adapted. We investigate into the reasons for the lack of scale and conclude that three areas need to be addressed: explicit representation, machine readability, and advanced composition support. For each of these areas, we sketch solutions and identify further challenges.	entity;hoc (programming language);interaction;internet protocol suite;programming paradigm;requirement;service discovery;software deployment;trust (emotion)	Volkmar Lotz;Samuel Paul Kaluvuri;Francesco Di Cerbo;Antonino Sabetta	2012	2012 5th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)	10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208771	wireless ad hoc network;trustworthiness;the internet;computer science;organization;information security;business value;network security;authentication;internet privacy;trustworthy computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network	DB	-48.666442970411644	71.97543540352603	72953

The ubiquity of personal data processing has raised public awareness about the infringement of information privacy. To protect users’ information privacy, several initiatives have been developed to provide Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). One of the most wellknown PETs is the Onion Router (Tor) network, which provides users with online anonymity. The Tor network is supported by a group of volunteers who contribute their resources to sustain the availability and quality of the service. However, Tor Volunteers may find themselves in a tough spot at times because Tor network is often monitored by law enforcement, which makes this PET community different from any other open-source initiatives. To explore this volunteer community’s motivation for providing their services despite the risks, we conducted an online survey. Our study results reveal that one of the main motivations for these volunteers is to advocate and provide privacy for online users. In addition, Tor-relay operators report on their views about anonymous networks, the challenges they face, and how their belief in providing an opportunity for everyone to access information without interference or censorship is a key component of their volunteer participation.	information privacy;interference (communication);open-source software;personally identifiable information;polyethylene terephthalate;privacy-enhancing technologies;relay;router (computing);tor messenger	Hsiao-Ying Huang;Masooda Bashir	2016		10.1002/pra2.2016.14505301034	privacy software;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-55.65543994968056	63.08793394412589	72965

However the obvious fear of the killer worm itself being compromised, or of any self-propagating code set loose (possibly over administrative boundaries), has barred serious exploration on the practical aspects of the idea. In this paper, we suspend such concerns momentarily, and investigate its functional validity. This effort is motivated by recent fast worm epidemics exemplified by that of SQL slammer, which was overwhelmingly faster than traditional human-intervened response. Specifically, this paper evaluates the killer worm in terms of the prevention effect and the incurred traffic cost. Above and beyond, we consider supplementary techniques that could boost the performance and mitigate the harmful side-effects of the worm-killing worm.	anti-worm;assistive technology;killer application;malware;onset (audio);sql slammer;software propagation	Hyogon Kim;Inhye Kang	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

An embedded biometric system for comparison aims at comparing a stored biometric data with a freshly acquired one without the need to send the stored biometric data outside the system. Here one may try to retrieve the stored data via side channel, similarly as for embedded cryptographic modules where one may try to exploit side channel for attacking the modules. On one hand, we show that we can find partial information by the means of simple Side Channel Analysis that may help to retrieve the stored fingerprint. On the other hand, we illustrate that reconstructing the fingerprint remains not trivial and we give some simple countermeasures to protect further the comparison algorithm.	algorithm;biometrics;countermeasure (computer);cryptography;embedded system;fingerprint;side-channel attack	Maël Berthier;Yves Bocktaels;Julien Bringer;Hervé Chabanne;Taoufik Chouta;Jean-Luc Danger;Mélanie Favre;Tarik Graba	2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Crypto	-48.659335202867275	68.57625861802774	73252

Among other threats, morphing attacks consist of the infiltration of artificial images created using biometric information of two or more subjects. These morphed images are hence positively matched to several subjects. Recent studies have shown that such images pose a concrete threat to civil security: wanted criminal offenders can use an authentic passport to enter a country with a false identity. However, there is still no quantitative manner to analyse this threat. We address this shortcoming by proposing a new framework for the evaluation of the vulnerability of biometric systems to morphing attacks. The experimental analysis on real systems based on face, iris and fingerprint shows that even systems providing high verification accuracy are vulnerable to this kind of attacks, depending on the verification threshold and the shape of the mated and non-mated score distributions.	biometrics;fingerprint;morphing;operating point;software deployment;threat (computer)	Marta Gomez-Barrero;Christian Rathgeb;Ulrich Scherhag;Christoph Busch	2017	2017 5th International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF)	10.1109/IWBF.2017.7935079	computer vision;engineering;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-51.39736294576053	66.58616539602038	73265

Even though this could be done for non malicious reasons, for example to improve products, services, and targeting, it represents a dangerous invasion of privacy with sometimes intolerable consequences. Anyway, completely defusing the information power of Likes appears improper. In this paper, we propose a mechanism able to keep Likes unlinkable to the identity of their authors, but to allow the user to choose every time she expresses a Like, those non-identifying (even sensitive) attributes she wants to reveal. This way, anonymous analysis relating Likes to various characteristics of the population is preserved, with no risk for users' privacy. The protocol is shown to be secure and also ready to the possible future evolution of social networks towards P2P fully distributed models.	like button;malware;peer-to-peer;privacy;social network	Francesco Buccafurri;Lidia Fotia;Gianluca Lax	2013	2013 Eleventh Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust	10.1109/PST.2013.6596034	communications protocol;information privacy;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-48.91114870272707	64.32183684421639	73307

This approach depends on Web cookies to identify, at checkout time, which affiliate should receive a commission. Thus, scammers ``stuff'' their own cookies into a user's browser to divert this revenue. This paper provides a measurement-based characterization of cookie-stuffing fraud in online affiliate marketing. We use a custom-built Chrome extension, AffTracker, to identify affiliate cookies and use it to gather data from hundreds of thousands of crawled domains which we expect to be targeted by fraudulent affiliates. Overall, despite some notable historical precedents, we found cookie-stuffing fraud to be relatively scarce in our data set. Based on what fraud we detected, though, we identify which categories of merchants are most targeted and which third-party affiliate networks are most implicated in stuffing scams. We find that large affiliate networks are targeted significantly more than merchant-run affiliate programs. However, scammers use a wider range of evasive techniques to target merchant-run affiliate programs to mitigate the risk of detection suggesting that in-house affiliate programs enjoy stricter policing.	affiliate marketing;cookie stuffing;http cookie;point of sale;social engineering (security)	Neha Chachra;Stefan Savage;Geoffrey M.

Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection Attack (SQLIA) remains an intruder's exploit of choice on vulnerable web applications to pilfer confidential data from the database with potentially damaging consequences. The existing solutions of mostly signature approaches were all before the recent challenges of big data mining and at such lacks the functionality and ability to cope with new signatures concealed in web requests. An alternative Machine Learning (ML) predictive analytics provides a functional and scalable mining to big data in detection and prevention of SQLIA. Unfortunately, lack of availability of readymade robust corpus or data set with patterns and historical data items to train a classifier are issues well known in SQLIA research. In this paper, we explore the generation of data set containing extraction from known attack patterns including SQL tokens and symbols present at injection points. Also, as a test case, we build a web application that expects dictionary word list as vector variables to demonstrate massive quantities of learning data. The data set is pre-processed, labelled and feature hashing for supervised learning. The trained classifier to be deployed as a web service that is consumed in a custom dot NET application implementing a web proxy Application Programming Interface (API) to intercept and accurately predict SQLIA in web requests thereby preventing malicious web requests from reaching the protected back-end database.

ebc8b2967e5a09115fa33befff342f6c2e50afc3	physical layer security in random cellular networks		In this chapter, the context and the fundamental concepts of physical layer security are well introduced. It starts at Shannon’s definition of information-theoretic security, Wyner’s wiretap model, and secrecy conditions. Then the secrecy metrics are described, including secrecy capacity/rate, ergodic secrecy capacity/rate, secrecy outage, and secrecy throughput. At the end of this chapter, we provide a brief survey on the recent research advances on wireless physical layer security. 1.1 Information-Theoretic Security Ensuring secrecy, or privacy, is a fundamental issue in any modern information systems. For a data communications system, how to achieve confidential information transmission, i.e., to guarantee the conveyed information not to be intercepted and eavesdropped by any adversary during the data transmission, is a critical task of information security. As the rapid development of today’s wireless transmission technologies, various wireless communications systems emerge, such as 4G-LTE, WLAN, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc. On the other hand, the wide popularization of smart phones and smart terminal equipments make wireless communications become an indispensable part of daily life. Multitudinous information and data have been conveyed through the electromagnetic wave to their destinations, including personal private information, financial data, business information, and even data relevant to national security, etc. These diversified applications greatly strengthen the criticality of the secrecy ofwireless communications. However, due to the openness of the physical propagation channel and the broadcast nature of the radio transmission medium, protecting confidentiality of wireless communications is believed to be more challenging compared to its wireline counterpart. Any receiver located in the covered range of the transmitter can intercept the transmitted signal, putting the conveyed information under the risk of being decoded by the adversarial users. © The Author(s) 2016 H.-M.

968fd1eafdd673674fc62a04a7c45198f891b5d0	fail-safe on-board communication for automatic train protection		Automatic train protection (ATP) systems have to be fail-safe in order to avoid hasards to train passengers. At the same time they have to react to inputs in real time. Previously such systems employed a centralized intelligence with dedicated connections to auxiliary devices, but today’s demands require the distribution of ATP functionality to several intelligent modules connected with a flexible data bus. This paper describes an approach to fail-safe and real-time communication for future ATP systems.	fail-safe;on-board data handling	Bernhard Eschermann;Hubert D.

Its users frequently use URL shortening services that provide (i) a short alias of a long URL for sharing it via tweets and (ii) public click analytics of shortened URLs. The public click analytics is provided in an aggregated form to preserve the privacy of individual users. In this paper, we propose practical attack techniques inferring who clicks which shortened URLs on Twitter using the combination of public information: Twitter metadata and public click analytics. Unlike the conventional browser history stealing attacks, our attacks only demand publicly available information provided by Twitter and URL shortening services. Evaluation results show that our attack can compromise Twitter users' privacy with high accuracy.	browsing;click analytics;inference attack;privacy;social network;url shortening	Jonghyuk Song;Sangho Lee;Jong Kim	2016	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2014.2382577	mobile telephony;computer science;accuracy and precision;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;statistics	Web+IR	-55.78357292548882	61.27617210388083	73779

The idea of SDN is based upon the dissociation of the control plane from networking devices to better optimize each. The control of the whole network becomes the responsibility of the controller. In an SDN network, locations of all hosts can be monitored with the host tracking service (HTS) in SDN controller. However, HTS may not support host authentication mechanisms. In this paper, we reveal that an attacker could attack this vulnerability of HTS, which could lead to host impersonation attack, man-in-the-middle attack, and denial-of-service attack. In addition, we also discuss and propose the possible countermeasure for this issue.	authentication;control plane;denial-of-service attack;high-throughput satellite;man-in-the-middle attack;networking hardware;programming paradigm;software-defined networking;gift	Tri-Hai Nguyen;Myungsik Yoo	2016	2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763545	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Security	-57.840774483725745	67.38817398679926	73853

In situations where there are intensive attacks, not only will actual alerts be mixed with false alerts, but the amount of alerts will also become unmanageable. As a result, it is difficult for human users or intrusion response systems to understand the alerts and take appropriate actions. This paper presents a sequence of techniques to address this issue. The first technique constructs attack scenarios by correlating alerts on the basis of prerequisites and consequences of attacks. Intuitively, the prerequisite of an attack is the necessary condition for the attack to be successful, while the consequence of an attack is the possible outcome of the attack. Based on the prerequisites and consequences of different types of attacks, the proposed method correlates alerts by (partially) matching the consequences of some prior alerts with the prerequisites of some later ones. Moreover, to handle large collections of alerts, this paper presents a set of interactive analysis utilities aimed at facilitating the investigation of large sets of intrusion alerts. This paper also presents the development of a toolkit named TIAA, which provides system support for interactive intrusion analysis. This paper finally reports the experiments conducted to validate the proposed techniques with the 2000 DARPA intrusion detection scenario-specific datasets, and the data collected at the DEFCON 8 Capture the Flag event.	alert correlation;capture the flag;charge trap flash;experiment;feature extraction;high- and low-level;intrusion detection system;sensor	Peng Ning;Yun Cui;Douglas S.

In other research in static keystroke dynamics, the password/PIN code of a user is fixed, hence the template will contain exact information on how a genuine user types this information. The novelty in this paper lies in the fact that a user will be challenged every time with a new 6-digit number which he/she might never have typed before. We will show that in this situation we can still derive Keystroke Dynamics related features that allow a user to be authenticated.

We propose an authentication method, which uses this personal IdP as a security token to prevent password leakage. In our method, the personal IdP on a mobile phone issues a security assertion signed by a private key on a Universal Subscriber Identifier Module (USIM). There are some authentication solutions that require special hardware tokens to prevent password leakage incidents, but their disadvantage is a higher distribution cost. In our method, there is no need for distribution of special hardware tokens because mobile phones are widespread personal devices. There are other authentication methods that use mobile phone terminals, but our method has the advantage that there is no need for installation of special software on PCs. In addition, users are able to carry out single sign-on (SSO) with our method by using the Liberty Alliance architecture. Compared with ordinary SSO where the IdP is a server computer, our method has a unique feature that the initial authentication is performed on a user's mobile phone with the key pad as an input device and LCD as an output device. Therefore, the credential for initial authentication is not transmitted from the mobile phone, and we can avoid the risk of password theft. If the mobile phone has its own security feature like fingerprint authentication, the feature can be used for SSO too. In this paper, we also discuss implementation issues on a mobile phone network and security issues regarding the man-in-the-middle attack. Results of the performance test of a prototype system are also described.	assertion (software development);authentication;credential;fingerprint recognition;identifier;identity provider;input device;man-in-the-middle attack;mobile phone;openid;output device;password;prototype;public-key cryptography;relay;security token;server (computing);single sign-on;spectral leakage	Tsuyoshi Abe;Hiroki Itoh;Kenji Takahashi	2007		10.1145/1314403.1314412	man-in-the-middle attack;mobile identification number;mobile search;gsm services;computer science;authentication;internet privacy;one-time password;world wide web;software token;computer security	Security	-49.30672131404294	65.97378895346539	74512
e9554547983a51a25af1f2a41f287fb7ebe4ab1f	disabling a computer by exploiting softphone vulnerabilities: threat and mitigation		As more and more people are using VoIP softphones in their laptop and smart phones, vulnerabilities in VoIP protocols and systems could introduce new threats to the computer that runs the VoIP softphone. In this paper, we investigate the security ramifications that VoIP softphones expose their host to and ways to mitigate such threats. We show that crafted SIP traffic (noisy attack) can disable a Windows XP host that runs the official Vonage VoIP softphone within several minutes. While such a noisy attack can be effectively mitigated by threshold based filtering, we show that a stealthy attack could defeat the threshold based filtering and disable the targeted computer silently without ever ringing the targeted softphone. To mitigate the stealthy attack, we have developed a limited context aware (LCA) filtering that leverages the context and SIP protocol information to ascertain the intentions of a SIP message on behalf of the client. Our experiments show that LCA filtering can effectively defeat the stealthy attack while allowing legitimate VoIP calls to go through.	electronic billing;experiment;internet;laptop;microsoft windows;overhead (computing);real-time clock;ringing (signal);server (computing);smartphone;vulnerability (computing)	Ryan Farley;Xinyuan Wang	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-04283-1_7	computer security	Security	-55.97450970064376	60.91344013478487	74563

Introducing the participation of the users and combining the mechanism of trust and reputation can make the direct and indirect use of feedback simple effective and lossless. Improved inference algorithm embodies the distribution characteristic of SPIT behavior and reflects the weight relation of factors which influence the result. In addition, the incremental learning algorithm gives the Real-time trust and reputation. The algorithm dynamically integrates the trust with the reputation and makes a Comprehensive Evaluation of the SPIT.

The state-of-the-art traffic classification methods aim to take the advantages of flow statistical features and machine learning techniques, however the classification performance is severely affected by limited supervised information and unknown applications. To achieve effective network traffic classification, we propose a new method to tackle the problem of unknown applications in the crucial situation of a small supervised training set. The proposed method possesses the superior capability of detecting unknown flows generated by unknown applications and utilizing the correlation information among real-world network traffic to boost the classification performance. A theoretical analysis is provided to confirm performance benefit of the proposed method. Moreover, the comprehensive performance evaluation conducted on two real-world network traffic datasets shows that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing methods in the critical network environment.	anomaly detection;c4.5 algorithm;cloud computing;experiment;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;machine learning;naive bayes classifier;network packet;network traffic control;neural correlates of consciousness;performance evaluation;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;sensor;software propagation;test set;traffic classification	Jun Zhang;Chao Chen;Yang Xiang;Wanlei Zhou;Athanasios V.

First, the configuration and protocols of the INTELSAT command system are briefly described. Three possible configurations between the INTELSAT Headquarters and Telemetry, macking, and Command (TTC) stations are distinguished and a layered architecture is introduced to illustrate the command protocols corresponding to the IS0 layers. The impact of introducing command security is then studied for the INTELSAT command network. In order to analyze the effect of errors on the operation and performance of the command network, a finite-state Markov chain is proposed to model the command and telemetry channels with different error and delay characteristics. We further analyze several possible risks which may threaten the INTELSAT secure command network operations, including single-event upsets, Vcc corruption, and manipulation of transmitted messages. Finally, the end-to-end performance of the INTELSAT Command network is examined for three possible configurations-terrestrial link, single-hop satellite, and 2-hop satellite, respectively.	end-to-end encryption;markov chain;memory corruption;single event upset;terrestrial television;vii	Raymond L.

As computing becomes pervasive, concerns about data protection have taken on new urgency. For example, obtaining unauthorized access to someone's medical history once would have required physically breaking into a doc-tor's office, searching through one or more filing cabinets , and extracting the patient's folder. Today, it is often possible to obtain such records by breaking into the doctor's computer from a remote location. What makes securing digital data difficult is that it is rarely static—rather, data is manipulated by software, often in a networked environment. For example, parts of a hospital's medical database may be accessible to queries by the police department. In many cases, to steal or manipulate data an attacker need not take over the host computer but instead only has to defeat the software programs responsible for protecting the data. Software itself is a form of data and as such is vulnerable to theft and misuse. Given the enormous investment of time, money, and intellectual capital in software development, piracy has long been— and continues to be—a major threat to the software industry. In its most recent study, which tracked 26 popular business applications in 85 countries, the Business Software Alliance (www.bsa.org) reported that the global economic impact of pirated software totaled nearly US$11 billion in 2001. 1 The problem, however, extends well beyond that of software piracy. Software is increasingly being distributed as mobile code in architecture-independent formats. Most such formats are essentially equivalent to source code, which makes the software susceptible to decompilation and reverse engineering. Malicious parties can steal the intellectual property associated with such code with relative ease. Clearly, there is a strong need for developing more efficient and effective mechanisms to protect software. Unfortunately, none of the major approaches currently used by software developers and vendors provide adequate protection, especially on today's open computing platforms. However, three promising techniques under development— tamper proofing, obfuscation, and watermarking— offer hope for the future. As Figure 1 shows, from a software vendor's point of view, a program executes in either a trusted or untrusted environment. We use the term """" program """" for simplicity—software protection mechanisms can and should be applied not only to complete programs, but also to program components, such as reusable class libraries.

d3cf3d53cfe02491a1f2f3a6cfb096ba4cba6078	privacy, security, and protection in distributed computing systems	security and protection;distributed computing system	The innovations in semiconductor technology in the past decade have brought down the computing hardware cost to such a low level that the system planners of today are more inclined to have distributed systems installed wherever possible and interconnect them through communication networks. The distributed systems basically are candidates for giving increased performance, extensibility, increased availability, and resource sharing. The necessities like multiuser configuration, resource sharing, and some form of communication between the workstations have created a new set of problems with respect to privacy, security, and protection of the system as well as the user and data. This is equally true with automated office systems, which are formed by interconnecting the workstations of various departments, as the access to different sets of classified information may be restricted to different levels of management personnel. Computer privacy is concerned with the type of information collected, the person authorised to collect, the type of access and dissemination, the subject rights, the penalties, and licencing matters. Thus privacy affects all aspects of computer security. The first level of implementation of these privacy issues, the external protection environment, consists of administrative control and physical security. The next level, the internal protection mechanisms, consists of authentication, access control, surveillance, and communications security. Implementation of the internal protection are done at three levels. The first, at the hardware level, is accomplished by means of memory protection, multiple execution states, and/or special front end processors. The second level is implemented through software by means of surveillance mechanism comprising logging, access control, information flow control, and/or threat monitoring or by isolation. The last level is the data security both in database and data transmission. Cryptographic techniques are used for data security.

d4e1b59141b4aae9de32541bbd63fbd486ba770f	identifying superfluous network transmissions in android applications		The network transmission is an important way to exchange information between Android applications and their own backend or other third-party servers. Some transmissions are necessary for the appsu0027 functionalities, while other transmissions are superfluous. The superfluous network transmission not only increases the network traffic but also may leak usersu0027 sensitive data, which threatens the useru0027s privacy. To identify the superfluous network transmissions, we propose a static-analysis approach. We first study the features of network transmissions to figure out the difference between necessary transmissions and superfluous ones: whether the responses of network transmissions are used by apps. Then we utilize information flow analysis to trace the use of the responses and identify superfluous network transmissions. Evaluation with real world market apps shows that our approach could effectively detect superfluous network transmissions in Android apps.	android;data-flow analysis;internet leak;mega man network transmission;network packet;static program analysis	Jianmeng Huang;Wenchao Huang;Zhaoyi Meng;Fuyou Miao;Yan Xiong	2018	2018 4th International Conference on Big Data Computing and Communications (BIGCOM)	10.1109/BIGCOM.2018.00022	humanoid robot;data mining;information flow (information theory);android (operating system);computer network;computer science;server	Mobile	-56.68870401248708	61.30059996649135	75231

We argue the blame lies not with users but with the tools they have available to them. Securing a communication channel with encryption is easy - the hard part is distributing keys in the first place. Current solutions rely ultimately on user actions -verification of encryption keys by inspecting either fingerprints or certificates. Instead, we present a model in which keys are established insecurely and automatically confirmed by exchanging cryptographic hashes of the key. To thwart an active attacker, hashes must travel over some path the attacker does not control. To do so, we exploit users' everyday mobility, plus the capabilities of an overlay network, to resend hashes from diverse access points. Initial simulation and field results support our claim that this generates routes sufficiently diverse to foil all but the most powerful attackers, without requiring explicit action on the part of users	centralized computing;channel (communications);cryptographic hash function;cryptography;encryption;fingerprint;key distribution;key exchange;man-in-the-middle attack;markov chain;mobile computing;overlay network;programming paradigm;retransmission (data networks);simulation;verification and validation;wireless access point	Anthony J.

However, most existing technologies for user authentication only cover the login stage or only work in restricted controlled environments or GUIs in the post login stage. In this work, we present TIPS, a Touch based Identity Protection Service that implicitly and unobtrusively authenticates users in the background by continuously analyzing touch screen gestures in the context of a running application. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate contextual app information to improve user authentication. We evaluate TIPS over data collected from 23 phone owners and deployed it to 13 of them with 100 guest users. TIPS can achieve over 90% accuracy in real-life naturalistic conditions within a small amount of computational overhead and 6% of battery usage.	algorithmic efficiency;authentication;computation;duty cycle;login;mobile device;overhead (computing);real life;simulation;software deployment;touchscreen;uncontrolled format string	Tao Feng;Jun Yang;Zhixian Yan;Emmanuel Munguia Tapia;Weidong Shi	2014		10.1145/2565585.2565592	engineering;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	Mobile	-50.84046537027026	65.1639134404458	75647

As a consequence, an access is granted for a long time after the only successful verification, which allows replacing the authorized user to the advantage of an impostor, as it is often the case with mobile phones. This work proposes a method of frequent user verification, based on cascading of unobtrusive biometrics with more reliable biometrics, provided explicitly, in such a way that explicit effort is required only if unobtrusive verification fails. Experiments with voice, gait and fingerprint data have shown that in most of noise conditions cascade was able to satisfy security requirements of False Accept Rate 1% and to achieve overall False Reject Rate 3% or less, while requiring explicit effort in 10 - 60% of cases.	authorization;biometrics;computer;fingerprint;mobile operating system;mobile phone;requirement;verification and validation	Elena Vildjiounaite;Satu-Marja Mäkelä;Mikko Lindholm;Vesa Kyllönen;Heikki Ailisto	2007	2007 Second International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications (ICSNC 2007)	10.1109/ICSNC.2007.44	embedded system;computer science;operating system;mobile device;internet privacy;computer security	Mobile	-48.64043750319786	68.31545056006462	75654
a16b6689f6c54887915b5a50d6dfb545d4cb7859	architecting citywide ubiquitous wi-fi access		Cities around the world are currently considering building expensive Wi-Fi infrastructure. In urban areas, resident o perated Wi-Fi access points (APs) are dense enough to achieve ubiquitous Internet access, provided we can induce the host s to provide guest Wi-Fi access. However, sharing Wi-Fi involves taking on responsibility for the guest’s actions. Ou r main contribution is a novel mechanism to handoff the host’s responsibility to a trusted point by tunneling the guest’s p ackets through it. The tunnel also guarantees that the guest’s traffic cannot be subverted by malicious hosts. Using tunnel ing as a primitive, we show how to architect a citywide cooperative forsafely sharing Wi-Fi with legitimate guests. We offer this as an economically viable alternative to inves ting millions in new infrastructure.	internet access;tunneling protocol;wireless access point	Nishanth R. Sastry;Jon A Crowcroft;Karen R.

This requirement can in practice impose a high bar on making effective use of the cryptographic protections, because securing the coupling between credentials and actual identity can prove to be an arduous process. We frame a more relaxed form of identity, termed opportunistic personas, that works by (i) generating cryptographic credentials on an as-needed basis, (ii) associating credentials not with a user per se but instead as a link to past behavior by the same actor, as a means to inform future interactions, and (iii) managing these credentials implicitly in an opportunistic fashion. Using three realworld examples, we illustrate the benefits this unorthodox approach to identity management can yield.	credential;cryptographic hash function;cryptography;identity management;interaction;join (sql);persona (user experience);the legend of zelda: a link to the past	Mark Allman;Christian Kreibich;Vern Paxson;Robin Sommer;Nicholas Weaver	2007			engineering;internet privacy;social psychology;computer security	Security	-49.57498311879722	68.27090832512233	75895

b5d3b5c437716bdd810204f7d787ff1fd83b1d81	multi-dimension threat situation assessment based on network security attributes		Cyber-attacks become more and more complex, but the network situation assessment based on log analysis cannot meet the security requirements because of the low quality of logs and alerts. This paper addresses the lack of consideration of security attributes of hosts and attacks in network. What's more, the most common attacks, identity and effectiveness of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) are hard to be proved in risk assessment based on alerts and flow matching. The multi-dimension threat situation assessment method based on network security attributes is proposed in this paper. Firstly, it gives an adaptive Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) calculation, which considers asset value as environment metric. Secondly, it collects deterioration rate of properties by sensors in hosts and network, that aims at assessing the time and level of DDoS attacks. Thirdly, it adopts the distribution of asset value in security attributes considering the features of attacks and network, which aims at assessing and showing the whole situation. Experiments demonstrate that the results show the primary threat and security requirement of network. By comparison and analytic study, the method reflects more in security requirement and security risk situation than traditional methods based on alert and flow analyzing.	attack (computing);denial-of-service attack;experiment;log analysis;network security;requirement;risk assessment;sensor;threat (computer)	Yang Yu;Jian Wang;Jiqiang Liu;Lei Han;Xudong He;Shaohua Lv	2018	2018 27th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2018.8487387	computer security;cvss;situation analysis;telecommunications network;computer network;network security;computer science;risk assessment;denial-of-service attack	Security	-62.17365744401767	62.43048880571666	76017

Recently, new classification methods based on analysis of statistical features of transport layer traffic have been proposed. While these new methods address the limitations of the port based and payload based traffic classification, the current software-based solutions are not fast enough to deal with the traffic of today’s high-speed networks. In this paper, we propose an online statistical traffic classifier using the C4.5 machine learning algorithm running on the NetFPGA platform. Our NetFPGA classifier is constructed by adding three main modules to the NetFPGA reference switch design; a Netflow module, a feature extractor module, and a C4.5 search tree classifier. The proposed classifier is able to classify the input traffics at the maximum line speed of the NetFPGA platform, i.e. 8 Gbps without any packet loss. Our method is based on the statistical features of the first few packets of a flow. The flow is classified just a few micro seconds after receiving the desired number of packets. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, there are various users in the smart grid network, including customers, operators, maintenance personnel, and so on, who use these devices for various purposes. Therefore, a secure and efficient mutual authentication and authorization scheme is needed in the smart grid to prevent various insider and outsider attacks on many different devices. In this paper, we propose an authentication and authorization scheme for mitigating outsider and insider threats in the smart grid by verifying the user authorization and performing the user authentication together whenever a user accesses the devices. The proposed scheme computes each user role dynamically using an attribute-based access control and verifies the identity of the user together with the device. Security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme resists various insider as well as outsider attacks, and is more efficient in terms of communication and computation costs in comparison with the existing schemes. The correctness of the proposed scheme is also proved using BAN-Logic and Proverif.	access control;actor (uml);authorization;bilinear filtering;burrows–abadi–needham logic;computation;correctness (computer science);cryptography;formal proof;grid network;hash function;key (cryptography);multi-factor authentication;mutual authentication;proverif;rogue;sha-2;secure communication;shared secret;smart meter;suicidegirls	Neetesh Saxena;Bong Jun Choi;Rongxing Lu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2015.2512525	maintenance engineering;computer science;information security;smart grid;authorization;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-49.37545479101236	70.00340227670173	76257

As one of the most difficult problems in network security, it has received considerable attention from the mass media and the research community. In this paper, we design an effective and practical countermeasure which allows a general-purpose TCP-based public server to sustain high availability even during severe DDoS attacks. A novel microeconomic framework based on Generalized Vickrey auction GVA is proposed. By adopting this mechanism, not only the availability of services is improved, but also the total utility of legitimate clients can be maximized. Initial simulations have shown that this mechanism is highly effective in preferentially dropping attacker traffic over legitimate client traffic, and the protected server can remain operational under various system loads and severely attacked conditions. The results indicate that it is a promising approach to countering DDoS attacks.	denial-of-service attack	Zhihong Tian;Mingzeng Hu;Bin Li;Bo Liu;Hongli Zhang	2006	Web Intelligence and Agent Systems		computer science;internet privacy;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	AI	-58.78372193473492	69.01277345028976	76541
e744aa97239bed0ca8e7953cef66027a228e7de6	inside the walled garden: deconstructing facebook's free basics program		Free Basics is a Facebook initiative to provide zero-rated web services in developing countries. The program has grown rapidly to 60+ countries in the past two years. But it has also seen strong opposition from Internet activists and has been banned in some countries like India. Facebook highlights the societal benefits of providing low-income populations with free Internet access, while detractors point to concerns about privacy and network neutrality.  In this paper, we provide the first independent analysis of such claims regarding the Free Basics service, using both the perspective of a Free Basics service provider and of web clients visiting the service via cellular phones providing access to Free Basics in Pakistan and South Africa.  Specifically, with control of both endpoints, we not only provide a more detailed view of how the Free Basics service is architected, but also can isolate the likely causes of network performance impairments. Our analysis reveals that Free Basics services experience 4 to 12 times worse network performance than their paid counterparts. We isolate the root causes using factors such as network path inflation and throttling policies by Facebook and telecom service providers.  The Free Basics service and its restrictions are designed with assumptions about users' device capabilities (e.g., lack of JavaScript support). To evaluate such assumptions, we infer the types of mobile devices that generated 47K unique visitors to our Free Basics services between Sep 2016 and Jan 2017. We find that there are large numbers of requests from constrained WAP browsers, but also large fractions of high-capability mobile phones that send Free Basics requests.

1823db0e35651ab9220bf77bdaab65273d4d7d36	a potential http-based application-level attack against tor	anonymity;application level attack;web traffic pattern;man in the middle attack;tor;anonymous communication;low latency;traffic analysis;overlay network;web browsing	Tor has become one of the most popular overlay networks for anonymizing TCP traffic, however, the anonymity of Tor clients is threatened by various attacks exploiting traffic analysis or Tor’s design features. Although considerable effort has beenmade to secure and improve Tor networks, little attention has been paid to various application-level attacks against Tor. In this paper, we present a potential HTTP-based application-level attack against Tor, which exploits both Tor’s design features and HTTP’s vulnerability toman-in-the-middle attacks. Such an application-level attack can efficiently and effectively compromise the anonymity of clients without using invasive plugins like Java or any other active content systems in a web browser, posing a serious threat to Tor. Our analytical and empirical results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the attack. Based on our analysis of the potential attack mechanism, we propose corresponding countermeasures to thwart such potential application-level attacks against Tor, thereby effectively securing and improving Tor networks. Since the fundamental vulnerability exposed by this paper is not specific to web browsing via Tor but rather to the problem of other lowlatency applications based on TCP streams, our study is critical for securing and improving low-latency anonymous communication systems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

VoLTE is an voice solution based on Internet Protocol and 4G LTE technology, at the same time exposing many vulnerabilities when using packet-switched network. There are many heavy weighted detection systems using content analysis, while high demands of computing resource constraint their practical use. In this paper, we purpose a lightweight detection scheme for VoLTE network security, based on analysis of data traffic flow. To optimize parameters in our scheme, we formulate a Bayesian game model. Bayesian game has the features of incomplete information and asymmetry, similar to practical attack-defense model. Besides, The dynamic Bayesian game is more realistic, since both sides can update believes about their opponents. Simulation results provide some guidances on parameter selection, as well as verifying the superiority of our scheme.	compaq lte;denial-of-service attack;network packet;network security;packet switching;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;simulation;verification and validation	Na Ruan;Qi Hu;Lei Gao;Haojin Zhu;Qingshui Xue;Weijia Jia;Jingyu Cui	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841555	games;communications protocol;simulation;quality of service;feature extraction;computer science;information security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-60.513304022798515	67.70716391668553	76752

However, while outsourcing services and workflows into the cloud provides indisputable benefits in terms of flexibility of costs and scalability, there is little advance in security (which can influence reliability), transparency and incident handling. The problem of applying the existing security tools in the cloud is twofold. First, these tools do not consider the specific attacks and challenges of cloud environments, e.g., cross-VM side-channel attacks. Second, these tools focus on attacks and threats at only one layer of abstraction, e.g., the network, the service, or the workflow layers. Thus, the semantic gap between events and alerts at different layers is still an open issue. The aim of this paper is to present ongoing work towards a Monitoring-as-a-Service anomaly detection framework in a hybrid or public cloud. The goal of our framework is twofold. First it closes the gap between incidents at different layers of cloud-sourced workflows, namely we focus both on the workflow and the infrastracture layers. Second, our framework tackles challenges stemming from cloud usage, like multi-tenancy. Our framework uses complex event processing rules and machine learning, to detect populate user-specified metrics that can be used to assess the security status of the monitored system.	abstraction layer;anomaly detection;cloud computing;cluster analysis;complex event processing;entity;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;fingerprint;fundamental fysiks group;machine learning;multitenancy;naive bayes classifier;outsourcing;population;random forest;real-time clock;scalability;semiconductor industry;side-channel attack;stemming;supervised learning;the verge;threat (computer);trustworthy computing;web service	Matthias Gander;Michael Felderer;Basel Katt;Adrian Tolbaru;Ruth Breu;Alessandro Moschitti	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-45260-4_8	cloud computing security;engineering;data mining;world wide web;computer security	Security	-60.51960518165141	62.183736087813394	76799
5dd6232ff977b25c3cf73b94fb8a4cd69c5359f4	on mobile agents resistance to traffic analysis	security protocols;mobile agents security;side channel attacks;traffic analysis	This paper will concern itself with a formulation of a traffic analysis problem for mobile agents. It is an interesting theoretical problem as well as a critical feature when using agents on a massive scale in decision making systems. The decision making systems are applied to demanding and complex environments such as stock markets. The mobile agents used are natural targets for attacks because they provide information for decision making. The resulting information can have a value measured in millions of dollars and information of such a high value attracts potential attacks. An efficient way to attack the user of decision making systems is to learn her strategy and respond in kind. In this respect even passive observation of agents can provide useful data, namely what information they are gathering. A common first defense is to provide anonymity for mobile agents. However, what happens when anonymity is gone? What information then becomes available and what steps will the user take? Yet, the problem has not been previously formulated for such a framework. We formulate it in terms of various factors used for traffic analysis. These factors originate from different side channels that provide information on the operating agents. At the end we state a paradox, which links an excessive use of countermeasures against traffic analysis with weakening system security.	mobile agent;traffic analysis	Kamil Kulesza;Zbigniew Kotulski;Konrad Kulesza	2006	Electr.

e6c9c296979fd757c710576b848b7c44aa1a29ef	medi: measurement-based device identification framework for internet of things		IoT systems may provide information from different sensors that may reveal potentially confidential data, such as a person’s presence or not. The primary question to address is how we can identify the sensors and other devices in a reliable way before receiving data from them and using or sharing it. In other words, we need to verify the identity of sensors and devices. A malicious device could claim that it is the legitimate sensor and trigger security problems. For instance, it might send false data about the environment, harmfully affecting the outputs and behavior of the system. For this purpose, using only primary identity values such as IP address, MAC address, and even the public-key cryptography key pair is not enough since IPs can be dynamic, MACs can be spoofed, and cryptography key pairs can be stolen. Therefore, the server requires supplementary security considerations such as contextual features to verify the device identity. This paper presents a measurement-based method to detect and alert false data reports during the reception process by means of sensor behavior. As a proof of concept, we develop a classification-based methodology for device identification, which can be implemented in a real IoT scenario.	aggregate data;confidentiality;informatics;internet of things;mac address;network packet;public-key cryptography;sensor;server (computing)	Narges Yousefnezhad;Manik Madhikermi;Kary Främling	2018	2018 IEEE 16th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	10.1109/INDIN.2018.8472080	engineering;real-time computing;proof of concept;public-key cryptography;mac address;spoofing attack;cryptography;identity theft;authentication;server	Mobile	-52.933869502059956	68.35057579806147	77290

This paper provides the first empirical evidence about which malicious strategies are successful at deceiving general users. We first analyzed a large set of captured phishing attacks and developed a set of hypotheses about why these strategies might work. We then assessed these hypotheses with a usability study in which 22 participants were shown 20 web sites and asked to determine which ones were fraudulent. We found that 23% of the participants did not look at browser-based cues such as the address bar, status bar and the security indicators, leading to incorrect choices 40% of the time. We also found that some visual deception attacks can fool even the most sophisticated users. These results illustrate that standard security indicators are not effective for a substantial fraction of users, and suggest that alternative approaches are needed.	malware;need to know;phishing;usability testing;web application	Rachna Dhamija;J.

The presented method uses the web server log files to determine the type of the attack against the web server. The web server log files are collections of text strings describing users’ requests, so one of the most important part of the work was to propose the method of conversion informative part of the requests, to numerical values to make possible further automatic processing. The vector of values obtained as the result of web server log file processing is used as the input to Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network. Finally, the SOM network has been trained to detect SQL injections and brute force password guessing attack. The method has been validated using the data obtained from a real data center.	multidimensional analysis;server log;web server;world wide web	Grzegorz Kolaczek;Tomasz Kuzemko	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11289-3_67	log shipping;web log analysis software;database;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-59.9764903987988	61.67265207815368	77543

Such methodologies must be able to act under strict confidentiality restrictions, such as traffic encryption, which are increasingly used in current communication environments. Proposed approaches must be able to analyze the traffic profiles in order to determine if the network is under a security attack or not. In this paper, we propose an approach that was designed to cope with the previously mentioned restrictions and is able to perform a pseudo real-time identification of illicit traffic: by passively analyzing some statistical properties of captured IP traffic, the methodology calculates and analyses the multi-scale properties of each traffic flow in order to infer multi-dimensional probability distributions for each one of studied protocols, allowing the analysis of the correlation between the values of several dimensions. By doing this, more exact approximations are inferred, enabling the assignment of unknown traffic to the corresponding protocol and the identification of illicit flows. The results obtained prove that the proposed technique can accurately classify Internet traffic and identify illicit flows on a quasi real-time basis. Besides, the fact that the analysis is performed over statistics that were collected for each traffic flow makes it suitable for scenarios where the packet payload is not accessible.	approximation;confidentiality;curve fitting;encryption;extended euclidean algorithm;internet;network packet;network security;online and offline;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;tracing (software)	Eduardo Rocha;Paulo Salvador;António Nogueira	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962651	traffic generation model;probability distribution;stochastic process;computer science;data mining;computer security;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-61.177710048636776	66.29346436607952	77667

The results of previous researches to treat these viruses are not very different from detection methods for ordinary host  based viruses. These methods are weak to detect a polymorphic E-mail based virus. Thus, to deal successfully with the limitations  of previous works, the research of this paper suggests the idea, which can detect polymorphic viruses from the macroscopic  behavior of the infected mail. In this paper we will show that the spread of viruses can be contained and the number of infected  clients can also be decreased at the equilibrium state by advancing some portion of E-mail servers.

When a network suffers from denial of service, packets cannot reach their destinations. Existing routing protocols are not, well-equipped to deal with denial of service; a misbehaving router-which may be caused by software/hardware faults, misconfiguration, or malicious attacks-may be able to disable entire networks. To protect network infrastructures from routers that incorrectly drop packets and misroute packets, we hypothesize failure models for routers and present protocols that detect and respond to those misbehaving routers. Based on realistic assumptions, we prove that our protocols have the following properties: (1) A well-behaved router never incorrectly claims another router as a misbehaving router; (2) If a network has misbehaving routers, one or more of them can be located; (3) Misbehaving routers will eventually be removed.	denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection system;router (computing);routing	Steven Cheung;Karl N.

To make full use of the darknet traffic at hand, in this paper, we present a study on early detection of emerging novel attacks observed in the darknet. First, exploration of the regularities in the communications from attacking hosts are done by feeding all observed packets in the darknet to a frequent itemset mining engine, where the most frequently occurred attack patterns are automatically grouped together. Second, a time series which characterizes the activity level of each attack pattern is created over the observation period. Then, to extract the most prominent attack patterns, a clustering algorithm is engaged to cluster the attack patterns into groups that carry the similar activities in a long run, dimension reduction is employed to provide visual hints about their relationship. Finally, attacks featured by a recent rapid increase are picked up to be further inspected by security experts for incident handling purpose. The experiments show that the proposed scheme is effective, efficient in early detection of new attack patterns from conventional approaches.	algorithm;association rule learning;attack patterns;cluster analysis;darknet;dimensionality reduction;emergence;experiment;internet;time series	Tao Ban;Shaoning Pang;Masashi Eto;Daisuke Inoue;Koji Nakao;Runhe Huang	2016	2016 Intl IEEE Conferences on Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced and Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing and Communications, Cloud and Big Data Computing, Internet of People, and Smart World Congress (UIC/ATC/ScalCom/CBDCom/IoP/SmartWorld)	10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP-SmartWorld.2016.0068	the internet;computer science;information security;operating system;time series;data mining;database;cluster analysis;world wide web;computer security	Security	-61.03415350657671	64.21544859627595	78677

Indeed, the sensitive nature of the hijacked prefixes, including US government agencies, garnered a great deal of attention and highlights the importance of being able to characterize such incidents after they occur. We use the China Telecom incident as a case study, to understand (1) what can be learned about large-scale routing anomalies using public data sets, and (2) what types of data should be collected to diagnose routing anomalies in the future. We develop a methodology for inferring which prefixes may be impacted by traffic interception using only control-plane data and validate our technique using data-plane traces. The key findings of our study of the China Telecom incident are: (1) The geographic distribution of announced prefixes is similar to the global distribution with a tendency towards prefixes registered in the Asia-Pacific region, (2) there is little evidence for subprefix hijacking which supports the hypothesis that this incident was likely a leak of existing routes, and (3) by preferring customer routes, providers inadvertently enabled interception of their customer’s traffic.	classless inter-domain routing;dvd region code;forwarding plane;information privacy;internet;page hijacking;pueblo;tracing (software)	Rahul Hiran;Niklas Carlsson;Phillipa Gill	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-36516-4_23	routing;border gateway protocol;telecommunications;computer science;information security;data mining;computer security;measurement;computer network	Metrics	-57.189431022759564	68.6310325794911	78814

These personal devices carry multiple sensors that continuously measure, collect, and analyze various sensitive personal information. Therefore, a strong and user friendly authentication mechanism is much needed to prevent illegitimate accesses to those devices. However, traditional protection approaches are far from sufficient and desirable for smartwatches. In this work, we present our recent study on developing and testing a motion-based real time authentication system for smartwatch. Our system applies behavioral biometrics collected from a smartwatch to verify the person who wears the watch. We have developed a prototype application using Android Wear to authenticate users in real time. We tested our system against two types of attacks to evaluate its resilience to attacks. We recruited five volunteers in our preliminary evaluation, from which some interesting findings were discovered. Our preliminary experimental results indicate that real time motion-based authentication is viable and promising.	android wear;authentication;biometrics;personally identifiable information;prototype;sensor;smartwatch;usability	Antwane Lewis;Yanyan Li;Mengjun Xie	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)	10.1109/CNS.2016.7860521	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;operating system;authentication;prototype;software testing;internet privacy;computer security	Mobile	-52.29981332462732	65.25079270250302	78862
19039bb8a21970d189cf0eb10657ecc454c323fc	formal analysis of the emv protocol suite	part of book or chapter of book	This paper presents a formal model of the EMV (EuropayMasterCard-Visa) protocol suite in F# and its analysis using the protocol verification tool ProVerif [4] in combination with FS2PV [3]. The formalisation covers all the major options of the EMV protocol suite, including all card authentication mechanisms and both onand offline transactions. Some configuration parameters have to be fixed to allow any security analysis; here we follow the configuration of Dutch EMV banking cards, but the model could easily be adapted to other configurations. As far as we know this is the first comprehensive formal description of EMV. The convenience and expressivity of F# proved to be a crucial advantage to make the formalisation of something as complex as EMV feasible. Even though the EMV specs amount to over 700 pages, our formal model is only 370 lines of code. Formal analysis of our model with ProVerif is still possible, though this requires some care. Our formal analysis does not reveal any new weaknesses of the EMV protocol suite, but it does reveal all the known weaknesses, as a formal analysis of course should.	authentication;internet protocol suite;online and offline;proverif;protocol stack;source lines of code;virtual instrument software architecture	Joeri de Ruiter;Erik Poll	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27375-9_7	telecommunications;computer science;world wide web;computer security	Security	-50.87928921930973	69.16187158211116	78990

Fraudulent abuse of domain name registration is at the core of cybersquatting. By registering domain names similar to famous brands, cybersquatters lure consumers into purchasing counterfeit products, cause them to reveal their personally identifiable information, and expose themselves to spyware. Typosquatting is registering domain names that are typographical mistakes on popular and common domains. To the best of our knowledge, no solution has been proposed to thwart typosquatting. In this paper, we propose and implement Anti Typo Squatting Tool (ATST), an extension to Internet browsers that could detect and warn users of any possible typos. Through extensive analysis and evaluation, we show that ATST can detect up to 85% of user typos. Further, ATST is lightweight, and is able to check for typos and provide possible suggestions in as little as 300ms.	browsing;counterfeit consumer goods;e-commerce;personally identifiable information;purchasing;real-time computing;spyware;the times;typosquatting;web design	Guanchen Chen;Matthew F.

5cd00b42e040402ea019eece288f722c88597159	collaborating with the enemy on network management		Software Defined Networking (SDN) deconstructs the current routing infrastructure into a small number of controllers, which are general purpose computers, and a large number of switches which are programmable forwarding engines. It is already deployed in data centres, where it offers considerable advantages of both cost and flexibility over a switching fabric of traditional routers. Such applications have a single controlling organisation and issues of trust between subdomains do not really arise. However for SDN to fulfil its potential, it is necessary to design and develop mechanisms for smart networks with mututally mistrustful principals. In an earlier paper, we used as an example an airport where we might have 100,000 staff working for 3,000 different firms which include not just competitors but also organisations in a state of conflict (for example, El Al and Iran Air) [1]. That paper discussed using hierarchical control structures to delegate trust with mechanisms focussed on preventing denial-of-service attacks, with the assumption that confidentiality and integrity would be provided by the principals at higher layers. But this turns out to be a quagmire. Can you run your app and your enemy’s app on the same controllers of the same fabric, and get a passable separation of behaviour on private networks that run over the same switches? And can all this be done without a trusted root anywhere? This paper reports a project to build a test environment that adapts Quagga so that a software defined network can be automatically configured using information learned from BGP. Our Quagga for SDN Module, “QuaSM”, is designed to support the use of SDN in three further use cases: in a network exchange point, in an organisation seeking to join up two or more SDN islands using an existing BGP fabric; and in security research on virtual networking.	border gateway protocol;computer;confidentiality;control flow;denial-of-service attack;deployment environment;network switch;private network;router (computing);routing;software-defined networking;switched fabric	Chris Hall;Dongting Yu;Zhi-Li Zhang;Jonathan Stout;Andrew M.

The rapid progress of grid systems opens the door for numerous companies to adopt this technology in their business development. This progress is characterized by the increasing openness and opportunity of resource-sharing across organizations in different domains. In the business context, these shared resources can be misused by some malicious users that can abuse the provided resources and make them behave maliciously to return wrong results and sabotage the jobs execution. The common technique used by most grid systems to deal with this problem is based on replication with voting. Nevertheless, these techniques rely on the assumption that the grid resources behave independently. They may be ineffective where a number of collusive resources collectively return the same wrong results of a job execution. In order to overcome this threat, we propose a reputation-based voting (RBV) approach, which investigates the trustworthiness of the grid resources through a reputation system, and then takes a decision about the results. In addition, the performance of our approach and other voting techniques, like m-first voting and credibility-based voting, are evaluated through simulation to perceive the effect of collusive grid resources on the correctness of the results. The obtained results show that our approach achieves a lower error-rate and better performance in terms of overhead.	attack model;autonomous robot;bit error rate;computation;correctness (computer science);elegant degradation;grid systems corporation;job stream;malware;openness;overhead (computing);reputation system;sensor;simulation;trust (emotion)	Ahmed Bendahmane;Mohammed Essaaidi;Ahmed El Moussaoui;Ali Younes	2015	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2014.2369049	voting;reputation;computer science;resource management;internet privacy;redundancy;computational model;computer security;grid computing	HPC	-59.671196230261344	72.49915313645174	79685

Even though the main aim of firewalls is to screen or filter part or all network traffic, firewall logs could provide rich traffic information that could be used as evidence to prove or disprove the occurrence of online attack events for legal purposes. Since courts have a definition of what could be presented to it as evidence, this research investigates on the determinants for the acceptability of firewall logs as suitable evidence. Two commonly used determinants are tested using three different firewall-protected network scenarios. These determinants are: 262 R.

Their operation depends upon catching an instance of an intrusion or virus and encoding it into a signature that is stored in its anomaly database, providing a window of vulnerability to computer systems during this time. Further, the maximum size of an Internet Protocol-based message requires the database to be huge in order to maintain possible signature combinations. In order to tighten this response cycle within storage constraints, this paper presents an innovative Artificial Immune System-inspired Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm. This distributed intrusion detection system (IDS) is intended to measure the vector of tradeoff solutions among detectors with regard to two independent objectives: best classification fitness and optimal hypervolume size. Our antibody detectors promiscuously monitor network traffic for exact and variant abnormal system events based on only the detector's own data structure and the application domain truth set, responding heuristically. Applied to the MIT-DARPA 1999 insider intrusion detection data set, our software engineered algorithm correctly classifies normal and abnormal events at a high level which is directly attributed to a detector affinity threshold.	affinity analysis;anomaly detection;application domain;artificial immune system;computational intelligence;computer science;computer security;data structure;engineering design process;evolutionary algorithm;extensibility;heuristic;high-level programming language;ieee transactions on evolutionary computation;intrusion detection system;java;moea framework;network traffic control;p (complexity);processor affinity;sensor;software engineering;springer (tank)	Charles R.

This paper proposes a role-based access control framework comprising two main components – a content-based steganographic module and a reversible watermarking module, to protect mammograms on PACSs. Within this framework, the content-based steganographic module is to hide patients’ textual information into mammograms without changing the important details of the pictorial contents and to verify the authenticity and integrity of the mammograms. The reversible watermarking module, capable of masking the contents of mammograms, is for preventing unauthorized users from viewing the contents of the mammograms. The scheme is compatible with mammogram transmission and storage on PACSs. Our experiments have demonstrated that the content-based steganographic method and reversible watermarking technique can effectively protect mammograms at PACS.	denial-of-service attack;hoc (programming language)	Antonis Michalas;Nikos Komninos;Neeli R.

Our study reveals the rampancy of malvertising: hundreds of top ranking Web sites fell victims and leading ad networks such as DoubleClick were infiltrated.  To mitigate this threat, we identify prominent features from malicious advertising nodes and their related content delivery paths, and leverage them to build a new detection system called MadTracer. MadTracer automatically generates detection rules and utilizes them to inspect advertisement delivery processes and detect malvertising activities. Our evaluation shows that MadTracer was capable of capturing a large number of malvertising cases, 15 times as many as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront did together, at a low false detection rate. It also detected new attacks, including a type of click-fraud attack that has never been reported before.	click fraud;digital distribution;google safe browsing;malware;marathon trilogy;microsoft forefront;online advertising;sensor;tracing (software)	Zhou Li;Kehuan Zhang;Yinglian Xie;Fang Yu;XiaoFeng Wang	2012		10.1145/2382196.2382267	online advertising;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-56.69344771704873	62.32224973855305	80216

Initially, we introduce a traffic classification procedure based on a new construction approach of conservative multiplicative cascades, to ensure information security by blocking malicious attempts and creating priorities over well-intentioned traffic. The admission control process accepts or rejects then the request for a new call by evaluating the available bandwidth within a particular transmission interval for different pre-classified traffic types. The experimental investigation by simulation showed that the proposed method is capable of ensuring the efficient use of available network resources and at the same time providing consistent QoS provisions and data security for network traffic flows.	data security;quality of service;traffic classification	Jeferson Wilian de Godoy Stênico;Lee Luan Ling	2015		10.1007/978-981-287-990-5_22	security service;business;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	HPC	-59.2951782026695	69.33595559845956	80353

The pollution reduces the availability of system sharply. Compared with peer reputation, object reputation is more efficient in face of pollution. Pollution proliferation model based on file object is presented. Vector space similarity is computed to weight the votes collected from other peers. Horting graph-theoretic approach is employed to deal with data sparsity problem. Self-adaptive reputation threshold scheme is adopted to estimate the file authenticity. An anti-pollution p2p file sharing system based on object reputation is established to improve the availability. Simulation results show that the system can distinguish between good and polluted files accurately and thwart the proliferation of pollution in the network with low communication cost. The system can subject freeriders to a penalty and do well in the presence of collusion and bad-mouthing attacks.	cluster analysis;graph theory;peer-to-peer file sharing;secret sharing;simulation;sparse matrix;sybil attack;vertex-transitive graph	Wei Dong;Yang Shou-bao;Guo Lei-tao	2006	2006 1st International Conference on Digital Information Management	10.1109/ICDIM.2007.369248	message authentication code;self-certifying file system;vector space;computer science;graph theory;operating system;peer-to-peer;data mining;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;file sharing	DB	-59.99778639224278	72.35723900716096	80469

As a result, we have been witnessing a significant growth in the number of elderly people around the world. Ensuring a comfortable living environment for elderly people has gained much attention in recent years. By leveraging information and communication technologies, the AAL system shows great promise in satisfying many requirements of elderly people and enables them to live safely, securely, healthily, and independently. Over the last few years various AAL systems, mostly based on Wireless Body Area Network technologies, have been proposed to improve the quality of life of elderly people. Since the information transmitted in AAL systems is very personal, the security and privacy of such data are becoming important issues that must be dealt with. We first discuss the overall system architecture of a typical AAL system and its associated security requirements. Next we propose an efficient authentication protocol for the AAL system and describe how it meets various security requirements. Finally we compare the performance of the proposed authentication protocol with two other recent authentication protocols and demonstrate its superior efficiency.	atm adaptation layer;authentication protocol;elliptic curve cryptography;living systems;requirement;systems architecture;the quality of life	Debiao He;Sherali Zeadally	2015	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2015.7010518	communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;authentication;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;elliptic curve;computer security;server;computer network	Mobile	-49.62998286237864	73.20766275120387	80488

Protection is usually afforded by authenticating users of the network and encrypting communication which travels through the wireless medium. However, the amount of protection offered by WPA is limited where it uses a pre-shared key (PSK) for authentication and encryption. In this case, if anyone holding the PSK could eavesdrop on other authorized users.

417135c951e258fb35961520e4a16c1ee55a414d	design and analysis of hybrid single packet ip traceback scheme		Although cybercrime and cyber threats are increasing significantly, yet prevention and security of the critical infrastructure are still far from perfect. The internet has no protection against malicious packet modifications. Attackers exploit such vulnerabilities to forge the source IP addresses while instigating an attack. Consequently, investigating cybercrime is becoming extremely difficult. The best antidote would be to weed out the problem at its root by identifying the source of the attack. The objective of this study is to propose an IP traceback scheme that can identify the origin of an attack with a single packet with minimum computational and storage overhead while ensuring a high degree of accuracy. Compared to the state-ofthe-art single packet IP traceback technique, the proposed scheme entails lesser computation overhead. According to CAIDA topology dataset, it requires only 320 kB of storage on each router. Storage requirement is several thousand times lesser than the pioneer single packet traceback scheme and 6.25 times lesser than the state-of-the-art traceback scheme. It has the better endurance to the change in topology compared with the state-of-the-art schemes. It identifies the attack node with high accuracy and minimal false positive. The obtained result has been validated to demonstrate its statistical significance.	computation;cybercrime;forge;ip traceback;mike lesser;network packet;overhead (computing);router (computing);san diego supercomputer center;threat (computer)	Vijayalakshmi Murugesan;Mercy Shalinie;Ming-Hour Yang	2018	IET Networks	10.1049/iet-net.2017.0115	the internet;computer network;cybercrime;critical infrastructure;router;ip traceback;exploit;network packet;computer science	Security	-57.41682368183023	70.27220019084889	80573
60f125d92070d42e1e174df63f25e42d92669f71	browser fingerprinting: exploring device diversity to augment authentication and build client-side countermeasures. (empreinte digitale d'appareil: exploration de la diversité des terminaux modernes pour renforcer l'authentification en ligne et construire descontremesures côté client)		Users are presented with an ever-increasing number of choices to connect to the Internet. From desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones, anyone can find the perfect device that suits his or her needs while factoring mobility, size or processing power. Browser fingerprinting became a reality thanks to the software and hardware diversity that compose every single one of our modern devices. By collecting device-specific information with a simple script running in the browser, a server can fully or partially identify a device on the web and follow it wherever it goes. This technique presents strong privacy implications as it does not require the use of stateful identifiers like cookies that can be removed or managed by the user. In this thesis, we provide three contributions to the browser fingerprinting domain: 1. We perform the analysis of 118,934 genuine fingerprints from the AmIUnique.org website. We show that device identification is possible as 89.4% of collected fingerprints are unique. Notably, we observe that browser fingerprinting can be extended to mobile devices despite their constrained nature in terms of software and hardware. 2. We design two countermeasures called Blink and FPRandom. Since the information contained in a fingerprint is primarily used to tailor the browsing experience to the user’s device, modifying it correctly presents great challenges as the wrong information can be detected and break the browsing session. By taking advantage of software diversity and randomness, we constantly change the values collected by tracking scripts so that they are unable to identify a device online. 3. We detail a complete protocol based on canvas fingerprinting to augment authentication on the web. At a time where passwords and logins are considered insecure with the numerous data breaches reported each year, we provide a new way to assert the identity of a device. By asking the browser to render very specific images in a canvas element, we can verify that a device is a known one, preventing account takeover through simple credentials theft. Browser fingerprinting is still in its early days. As the web is in constant evolution and as browser vendors keep pushing the limits of what we can do online, the contours of this technique are continually changing. With this dissertation, we shine a light into its inner-workings and its challenges along with a new perspective on how it can reinforce account security.	application programming interface;authentication;blink;canvas element;canvas fingerprinting;client-side;comparison of programming languages (string functions);credential;data breach;desktop computer;device fingerprint;fingerprint (computing);http cookie;identifier;integer factorization;internet;javascript;laptop;linear algebra;mobile device;password;radio fingerprinting;randomness;server (computing);smartphone;stateful firewall;surround sound;tablet computer;webgl	Pierre Laperdrix	2017				Security	-54.37344635726848	62.553181932526066	80583

Once an app is reported for exhibiting policy-violating behaviors, it is removed from the store to protect users. Currently, Google Play store relies on mobile users’ feedbacks to identify policy violations. Our paper takes the first step towards understanding these policy-violating apps. First, we crawl 302 Android apps, which are reported in the Reddit forum by mobile users for policy violations and are later removed from the Google Play store. Second, we perform empirical analysis, which reveals that many violating behaviors have not been studied well by industry or research communities. We discover that 53% of the reported apps are either copying popular apps or violating copy-rights or trademarks of brands. Moreover, 49% of reported apps are violating ads policies by sending push notifications, adding homescreen icon and changing browser settings. Only 8% show malware-like behaviors, such as downloading malicious files to users’ mobile phones. Based on our empirical analysis results, we extract 175 features for differentiating bad apps from benign apps. Our features cover use of brand names and other keywords, third-party libraries, network activities, meta data, permissions, and suspicious API calls originated from third-party libraries. We then apply 10 machine learning classifiers on the extracted features to detect reported bad apps. Our experiment result shows that the best algorithm can detect them with 86.80% true positive rate and 13.6% false positive rate. On the other hand, the same samples of policy violating apps are detected by VirusTotal with true positive rate of 55.63% and false positive rate of 17.48%.	algorithm;android;application programming interface;download;library (computing);machine learning;malware;mobile app;mobile phone;play store;push technology;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;trust (emotion);virustotal	Su Mon Kywe;Yingjiu Li;Jason Hong;Cheng Yao	2016	2016 11th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE)	10.1109/MALWARE.2016.7888725	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	SE	-56.43639749429974	60.82623923922712	80654

This way, auditors are able to detect unauthorized applications or to detect anomalies in the traffic created by known applications, possibly as a consequence of the action of some malware in the source application or host.	anomaly detection;ar (unix);authentication;authorization;cryptographic hash function;entity;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;intrusion detection system;key distribution center;malware;network address translation;network traffic control;traffic analysis;virtual machine	André Zúquete;Miguel Rocha	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364951	element management system;network traffic control;intelligent computer network;network architecture;network management station;computer science;network security;network simulation;network management application;network access control;traffic shaping;world wide web;computer security;network monitoring;network forensics;computer network	HPC	-59.38174954974342	66.15577642885738	80754

Our research showed that theoretically one could indeed build a tool capable of automating a hacking attack, functional under certain circumstances. In this work, we first discuss the fundamental concepts of a penetration testing process and afterwards we highlight a number of open source tools, frameworks and programming languages used to build an automated process (Nmap, Metasploit, Python). Then, we demonstrate how those three technologies/tools can be combined to automate the intrusion process and create a script, allowing an attacker to access a single or multiple remote systems by only typing a single command. Finally, we present some countermeasures. Overall, this paper will serve to justify not only the increase in cyber-attacks but also the decrease in the required knowledge to conduct and be successful in the attack.	computer security;countermeasure (computer);intrusion detection system;metasploit;nmap security scanner;open-source software;penetration test;programming language;python;security hacker	Valkaniotis Tilemachos;Charalampos Manifavas	2015		10.1145/2801948.2802001	penetration test;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security	Security	-59.93721666609698	60.93938751658372	80765

Representing this authentication data as a set of user-specific graphs and graph features, including time-constrained attributes, enables novel and comprehensive analysis opportunities. We show graph-based approaches to user classification and intrusion detection with practical results. We also show a method for assessing network authentication trust risk and cyber attack mitigation within an enterprise network using bipartite authentication graphs. We demonstrate the value of these graph-based approaches on a real-world authentication data set collected from an enterprise network.	authentication	Alexander D. Kent;Lorie M.

4c2fff02554661529f4e16bfdb078dee8111393b	aitsteg: an innovative text steganography technique for hidden transmission of text message via social media		With the popularity of smartphones and widespread use of high-speed Internet, social media has become a vital part of people’s daily life. Currently, text messages are used in many applications, such as mobile chatting, mobile banking, and mobile commerce. However, when we send a text message via short message service (SMS) or social media, the information contained in the text message transmits as a plain text, which exposes it to attacks. In some cases, this information may be confidential, such as banking credentials, secret missions, and confidential appointments; moreover, it is a major drawback to send such information via SMS or social media, as neither provides security before transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel text steganography technique called AITSteg, which provides end-to-end security during the transmission of text messages via SMS or social media between end users. The AITSteg technique is evaluated by considering a trusted scenario. We then evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique in terms of embedding capacity, invisibility, robustness, and security. The experiments confirm that the AITSteg is able to prevent various attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks, message disclosure, and manipulation by readers. Moreover, we compare the experimental results with the existing techniques to show the superiority of the proposed technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first text steganography technique that provides end-to-end secure transmission of the text message using symmetric keys via social media.

af8850a2af203ac7d7bce24337df175215454b31	usb side-channel attack on tor		Tor is used to communicate anonymously by millions of daily users, which rely on it for their privacy, security, and often safety. In this paper we present a new attack on Tor that allows a malicious USB charging device (e.g., a public USB charging station) to identify which website is being visited by a smartphone user via Tor, thus breaking Tor’s primary use case. Our attack solely depends on power measurements performed while the user is charging her smartphone, and it does not require the adversary to observe any network traffic or to transfer data through the smartphone’s USB port. We evaluated the attack by training a machine learning model on power traces from 50 regular webpages and 50 Tor hidden services. We considered realistic constraints such as different network types (LTE and WiFi), Tor circuit types, and battery charging levels. In our experiments, we were able to correctly identify webpages visited using the official mobile Tor browser with accuracies up to 85.7% when the battery was fully charged, and up to 46% when the battery level was between 30% and 50%. Both results are substantially higher than the 1% baseline of random guessing. Surprisingly, our results show that hidden services can be identified with higher accuracies than regular webpages (e.g., 84.3% vs. 68.7% over LTE). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A variety of attacks has been proposed against this mechanism, of which notable are methods that recover the lock patterns using the oily residues left on screens when people move their fingers to reproduce the unlock code. In this paper we present a pilot study on user habits when setting a pattern lock and on their perceptions regarding what constitutes a secure pattern. We use our survey's results to establish a scheme, which combines a behaviour-based attack and a physical attack on graphical lock screen methods, aiming to reduce the search space of possible combinations forming a pattern, to make it partially or fully retrievable.	android;attack model;brute-force attack;brute-force search;code;heuristic (computer science);location (geography);lock screen;operating system;password;sim lock;side-channel attack;smartphone;text-based (computing)	Panagiotis Andriotis;Theodore Tryfonas;George C.

There are now over 400,000 applications on the Android market. Over 10 billion Android applications have been downloaded from the Android market. Due to the Android popularity, there are now a large number of malicious vendors targeting the platform. Many honest end users are being successfully hacked on a regular basis. In this work, a cloud based reputation security model has been proposed as a solution which greatly mitigates the malicious attacks targeting the Android market. Our security solution takes advantage of the fact that each application in the android platform is assigned a unique user id (UID). Our solution stores the reputation of Android applications in an anti-malware providers' cloud (AM Cloud). The experimental results witness that the proposed model could well identify the reputation index of a given application and hence its potential of being risky or not.	android;cloud computing;computation;computer security model;item unique identification;malware;open-source software;smart card;smartphone;unique user;user identifier	Welderufael Berhane Tesfay;Todd Booth;Karl Andersson	2012	2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2012.236	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-51.07945160677795	61.748542732282	82249
c98933d0cc2577ec81a19e94a0db38f79fe3c5b1	towards hierarchical cooperative analytics architecture in law enforcement agencies		The vast growth in populations and the widespread of metropolitan areas hinder the efforts of crime investigation and inhibit tracking the risk of threats to safety and national security. Information technology has been helping in tracing criminals and terrorists, but with the outspread of social networks and the emergence of the Internet of Things, new challenges have arisen. The Internet is becoming a major part of everyone's daily life. Data representing trustful and suspicious activities is continuously generated and stored everywhere at an unprecedented scale. This extremely large data, which is known as Big Data, may contain critical and helpful information that can be used in detecting, and in many cases, preventing illegal activities, crimes and more importantly terror attacks. Unfortunately, the limitations on the communication between administrative zones, the huge amount of data and the intrinsically unstructured nature of such data makes leveraging its usefulness impractical. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical cooperative analytics architecture that utilizes Big Data Analytics, Ontologies, and Metamodels to facilitate the analysis of data collected from different sources to aid law enforcement agencies' efforts in establishing law and maintaining security.	big data;emergence;internet of things;metamodeling;ontology (information science);population;sensor;social network	Luay Alawneh;Mahmoud H.

To build a mental model of the log, an analyst is required to recognise continuous timelines and attack patterns from a dataset that is essentially limited to an ordered list of events. Information Visualization techniques arrange data into directly perceivable visual patterns that may alleviate some overheads associated with interpreting these datasets and improve the ability of users, especially those in resource-stretched Small and Medium sized Businesses (SMBs), to make sense of activity patterns in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) event logs. To this end, we discuss existing network security visualizations for IDS logs and after examining the strengths and drawbacks of those applications we have prototyped a visualization tool, Pianola, that arranges events on multiple timelines to reveal patterns both in time and across a network. The tool was evaluated against the traditional use of command-line interface (CLI)-based tools for analyzing network security events and displayed significant improvements in both recognition and detection of attacks and reduction in the users' subjective workload, measured using the NASA Task Load index (TLX).	attack patterns;command-line interface;data logger;information visualization;intrusion detection system;mental model;network security;timeline	Alistair Thomson;Martin Graham;Jessie B.

54bba8ef46ed5e8ac125cea0bf2f78a5b226a927	traffic morphing: an efficient defense against statistical traffic analysis.	real time;fixed time;network traffic;traffic analysis;web browsing	Recent work has shown that properties of network traffic that remain observable after encryption, namely packet sizes and timing, can reveal surprising information about the traffic’s contents (e.g., the language of a VoIP call [29], passwords in secure shell logins [20], or even web browsing habits [21, 14]). While there are some legitimate uses for encrypted traffic analysis, these techniques also raise important questions about the privacy of encrypted communications. A common tactic for mitigating such threats is to pad packets to uniform sizes or to send packets at fixed timing intervals; however, this approach is often inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel method for thwarting statistical traffic analysis algorithms by optimally morphing one class of traffic to look like another class. Through the use of convex optimization techniques, we show how to optimally modify packets in real-time to reduce the accuracy of a variety of traffic classifiers while incurring much less overhead than padding. Our evaluation of this technique against two published traffic classifiers for VoIP [29] and web traffic [14] shows that morphing works well on a wide range of network data—in some cases, simultaneously providing better privacy and lower overhead than naı̈ve	algorithm;byte;convex optimization;earl levine;encryption;ibm notes;information sensitivity;machine learning;mathematical optimization;morphing;network packet;network traffic control;observable;overhead (computing);password;privacy;real-time clock;traffic analysis;web page;web traffic	Charles V.

Collaborators must be authorized to access those information systems that contain information that they should be able to receive. However, these systems typically also contain information that should be withheld. Collaborations can be rapidly created, requiring dynamic alterations to security provisions. Solutions based on extending access control methods to deal with collaborations are either awkward and costly, or unreliable. An alternative approach to protection of mixed source information, complementing basic access control, is to provide filtering of results. Filtering of contents is also costly, but provides a number of benefits not obtainable with access control alone. The most important one is that the complexity of setting up and maintaining specific, isolating information cells for every combination of access rights assigned to external collaborators is avoided. New classes of collaborators can be added without requiring a reorganization of the entire information structure. There is no overhead for internal use, i.e., for participants that are wholly trusted. Finally, since contents of the documents rather than their labels is being checked, cases of misfiled information will not cause inappropriate release. The approach used in the TIHI/SAW projects at Stanford uses simple rules to drive filtering primitives. The filters run on a modest, but dedicated computer to be managed by the organization’s security officer (SO). The rules implement the institution’s security policy and balance manual effort and complexity. By not relying on the database and network administrators and system facilities, a better functional allocation of responsibilities ensues. Result filtering can also be used to implement pure intrusion detection, since it can be implemented invisibly. The intruder can be given an impression of success, while becoming a target for monitoring or cover stories.	access control;authorization;computer security;information system;intrusion detection system;overhead (computing);reliability engineering;requirement	Gio Wiederhold	2001	IEEE Trans.

With the widespread use of smartphones in general, and Android in specific, privacy concerns grow with that expansion in the user base. With the millions of applications being downloaded by users daily, it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate between the good and the bad in terms of security and privacy. In this paper, we present the results of a survey conducted among 4027 Android users worldwide. This survey was conducted to measure the awareness of Android users regarding their privacy. The study measures the usersu0027 interaction with the permissions required by different applications they install. The results of the survey show apparent weakness in the awareness of Android users regarding the privacy of their data.	android	Mohammed M.

In this poster, we compare two alternative designs for secure association of new IoT devices in existing ICN deployments, which are based on asymmetric and symmetric cryptography respectively. While the security properties of both approaches are equivalent, an interesting trade-off arises between properties of the protocol vs properties of its implementation in current IoT boards. Indeed, while the asymmetric-keys based approach incurs a lower traffic overhead (of about 30%), we find that its implementation is significantly more energy- and time-consuming due to the cost of cryptographic operations (it requires up to 41x more energy and 8x more time).	cryptography;icn gps;overhead (computing);sensor;symmetric-key algorithm	Marcel Enguehard;Ralph E.

The design requirements of the system are posited to demonstrate the requirements for an early detection system. An overview of the system is presented to show how these requirements are met. DiDDeM provides a two-tier detection approach. First, pre-filters (PFs) filter traffic for possible attacks. This is achieved through the application of both stateful and stateless signatures utilising routing congestion algorithms. Second, command and control (C/sup 2/) servers provide intra- and inter-domain co-operation and response to contain an attack within the routing infrastructure.

Even when using the coffee machine in the morning, or driving our car to work, we interact with integrated circuits. e increasing spread of information technology in virtually all areas of life in the industrialized world offers a broad range of attack vectors. So far, mainly software-based attacks have been considered and investigated, while hardware-based attacks have attracted comparatively little interest. e design and production process of integrated circuits is mostly decentralized due to financial and logistical reasons. erefore, a high level of trust has to be established between the parties involved in the hardware development lifecycle. During the complex production chain, malicious attackers can insert non-specified functionality by exploiting untrusted processes and backdoors. is work deals with the ways in which such hidden, non-specified functionality can be introduced into hardware systems. After briefly outlining the development and production process of hardware systems, we systematically describe a new type of threat, the hardware Trojan. We provide a historical overview of the development of research activities in this field to show the growing interest of international research in this topic. Current work is considered in more detail. We discuss the components that make up a hardware Trojan as well as the parameters that are relevant for an attack. Furthermore, we describe current approaches for detecting, localizing, and avoiding hardware Trojans to combat them effectively. Moreover, this work develops a comprehensive taxonomy of countermeasures and explains in detail how specific problems are solved. In a final step, we provide an overview of related work and offer an outlook on further research in this field.	algorithm;backdoor (computing);countermeasure (computer);hardware trojan;high-level programming language;integrated circuit;logistics;malware;microsoft outlook for mac;sensor;taxonomy (general);trojan horse (computing)	Christian Krieg;Adrian Dabrowski;Heidelinde Hobel;Katharina Krombholz;Edgar R.

6311315f630d294eae5b8bae510b939fa8e0b5df	a smart meter and smart house integrated to an idm and key-based scheme for providing integral security for a smart grid ict		The literature does not present integral solutions to allow using the same credential to access the smart meter and smart house from an electric utility and vice-versa. The main reason being the technology gap in the communication between the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and the Internet. The technology used in the Internet domain to communicate with Data Concentrators (DC) and the electric utility is more powerful than the technology used in the communication between smart meters and the DC, which is bandwidth limited and better suited to the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Therefore, we are proposing the use of Identity Management (IdM) and a key-based scheme to enable the integration of IoT and the Internet using the same credentials, without creating a security bottleneck in the communication. An additional security mechanism is provided in the smart house context to isolate the house from direct accesses from the Internet, though allowing the utility to reconfigure the electric power consumption profile to avoid a potential blackout, for instance. Our proposal includes multi-sensor anti-tampering techniques to provide physical protection to a smart meter, in conjunction with a multilevel integrity mechanism to provide logical protection to its resource-constrained microcontroller, given the smart meter is a key component to mitigate electricity consumption fraud. The prototype has shown that our proposal is feasible for protecting the smart house, smart meter and the end-to-end communication between smart meter or house and the utility.	authentication;authorization;credential;denial-of-service attack;electrical engineering;end-to-end principle;false precision;firmware;flash memory;hard coding;identity management;internet of things;lib sh;microcontroller;password;power supply;prototype;secure communication;session key;smart house;smart meter;token ring	Vilmar Abreu;Altair Olivo Santin;Alex Xavier;Alison Lando;Adriano Witkovski;Rafael V Ribeiro;Maicon Stihler;Lisandro Zambenedetti Granville;Ivan Chueiri	2018	MONET	10.1007/s11036-017-0960-4	the internet;computer network;electric utility;electric power;smart grid;computer science;identity management;smart meter;bottleneck;computer security;information and communications technology	Security	-51.2441488363944	67.94794983201831	83881
407cbd22114456311332416fe53fb390bf32d899	informing the decision process in an automated intrusion response system	decision process	The increasing volume and speed of network attacks point towards the need for automated solutions that can assist the response to detected intrusions. However, a significant question surrounds the reliability that could be achieved by an automated response system. This paper contends that suitable automated decisions can be made if the Responder is able to establish the context of an attack rather than just the occurrence of a suspected incident. The related decision criteria include the number of affected systems, the urgency to respond, and the confidence of the detection system. This paper considers the information that an automated response system would need to acquire from a variety of sources in order to inform response decisions. The discussion is presented in the context of the Flexible Automated Intelligent Responder architecture (which has been developed as part of the authors’ wider research), and suggests that while the requirements are non-trivial, suitable information can be obtained and utilised to support automated response decisions. a 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In these attacks, confidential data leak through application gateways. In order to detect such leakage, a network management server collects multiple logs. Then a gateway traces them to check whether the forwarding data is confidential or not. In the conventional basic scheme, this check will require long processing time if log volume becomes large. In our proposed scheme, at first, multiple logs are preprocessed offline to form a black list. A gateway checks a file to be forwarded online using this black list. The evaluation results show that the tracing time can be shortened to one severalth by means of our proposed scheme.	confidentiality;data breach;data pre-processing;online and offline;server (computing);spectral leakage;tracing (software)	Takuya Suzuki;Koki Ikeda;Pichaya Kietkaroon;Junichi Murayama;Takahiro Hamada;Yuichi Murata	2015	2015 10th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies (APSITT)	10.1109/APSITT.2015.7217111	computer science;world wide web;computer security;computer network	OS	-57.18893728024531	64.87356645243489	84049

Most users would not like to have their data exposed to other people on the Internet. The initial approach used for attacking a user's privacy and security is done by scanning the nodes on a network. This gives an attacker the ability to obtain the IP addresses in use by this node so that this information can then be used to initiate further attacks against this node, such as tracking them via their IP address across the networks, and then, later correlating the user's activities with his IP address. The first attempt by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to protect a user's privacy was defined in the Privacy Extension RFC [13]. Unfortunately this RFC has some deficiencies which makes its use vulnerable to privacy related attacks. To address this problem, and solve the deficiencies that exist with the use of this RFC, we introduce our new algorithm, which not only maintains a node's lifetime, but also provides a user with a method for randomized Interface ID (IID) generations.	central processing unit;internet;privacy;randomized algorithm	Hosnieh Rafiee;Christoph Meinel	2013		10.1145/2523514.2527004	privacy software;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;private network;computer network	Security	-52.51377249425195	73.52321743348713	84477
b0894406994eecc0ce5b7a45dc9ccbdaf35aa028	securing networks using situation-based firewall policy computations		In the last decade, the number of users connecting with Web has increased by multiple folds. As the number of users is increasing, naturally, the network’s computability load will also increase, which creates the challenges to network in terms of security threats and attacks. At this juncture, the network security plays key-role by using the firewall which is considered as one of most immediate requirements assuring the users about the network security. With expansion of the size of network, it is also required to improve the security road map implementation; otherwise, it would be tough for users to rely on network-based services. In this article, a novel idea has been proposed to cater the avoidance of threats and attack in organization’s network by expanding the scope of firewall policies. The chapter shows the importance of network design and firewall rules compatibility to make network free from threats and attacks.	computation;firewall (computing)	Vijender Kumar Solanki;Kumar Pal Singh;M.

It was developed to provide user with an easy way to use and manage various user's digital identities that were provided from each web service. If the user subscribes to an Identity Management service, the user can access the other web sites affiliated with the Identity Management service and use their web services by using the identity issued by the Identity Management service. And the user can manage the user's personally identifiable information distributed among various web sites in an integrated way through this service. However, if the identity provider, which provides this Identity Management service, discloses the user’s identity and personal identifiable information, identity theft can happen throughout the entire affiliated web sites. As a result, the privacy protection level of the Identity provider, that is, the level of protection for personally identifiable information, is the critical factor of successful Identity Management service. Therefore, Identity Provider should provide an easy way to the internal or external auditor of them for assessing the privacy protection level. This paper describes privacy threats for each identity life cycle, such as Identity provision, propagation, use and maintain, and destruction, and proposes the criteria that evaluate the privacy protection level provided by the Identity provider as a countermeasure against these threats. The internal or external auditor can use the criteria described in this paper, as a way of assessing the privacy protection level of Identity Provider	digital identity;identity management;identity provider;internet;personally identifiable information;privacy;software propagation;web service	Hyangjin Lee;Inkyoung Jeun;Hyuncheol Jung	2009	2009 Third International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies	10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.31	web service;personally identifiable information;identity theft;information privacy;computer science;information security;technology management;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;identity management	DB	-49.02027524119627	63.98322370235466	84598

This increases the need for efficient and effective measures helping users to judge their direct contacts so as to avoid friendship with malicious users that could misuse their personal information. At this purpose, in this paper we propose a risk measure, called local risk factor, having as a key idea the fact the malicious users in OSNs (aka attackers) show some common features on the topology of their social graphs, which is different from those of legitimate users. This consideration brought us to design a set of features defined based on attacker activity patterns. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed risk measure, we run several experiments on a real OSN dataset (i.e., Orkut social network) with more than 3 million vertices and 117 million edges, by injecting synthetic fake users according to different settings and showing how the proposed measures can indeed help in their detection.	algorithm;anomaly detection;experiment;financial risk modeling;internet;malware;personally identifiable information;risk assessment;risk measure;social network;synthetic data	Naeimeh Laleh;Barbara Carminati;Elena Ferrari	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart City/SocialCom/SustainCom (SmartCity)	10.1109/SmartCity.2015.124	computer science;data mining;world wide web;computer security	DB	-58.3496520301913	62.85587444078507	84667

It is designed for multimedia streaming in a home-network environment. By setting up Chromecast, you can stream videos onto a larger screen and control it from a mobile device such as a smart-phone, tablet or a laptop. We examined the network packets exchanged between the smaller remote control device and the Chromecast attached larger screen. While Chromecast encrypts most of the content, remote control device sends control packets to the remote servers in the clear-text, which makes it vulnerable to reply-attacks or session-hijacking attacks. Besides, data transmission pattern leak personal information outside of the home-network, raising privacy concerns. Network protocols used by Chromecast are investigated and known vulnerabilities are listed.

184930e66345b46a3fef1b67470558d898cbd630	retrieving hidden friends: a collusion privacy attack against online friend search engine		Online social networks (OSNs) are providing a variety of applications for human users to interact with families, friends, and even strangers. One such application, the friend search engine, allows the general public to query individual users’ friend lists and has been gaining popularity recently. However, without proper design, this application may mistakenly disclose users’ private relationship information. Our previous work has proposed a privacy preservation solution that can effectively boost OSNs’ sociability while protecting users’ friendship privacy against attacks launched by individual malicious requestors. In this paper, we propose an advanced collusion attack, where a victim user’s friendship privacy can be compromised through a series of carefully designed queries coordinately launched by multiple malicious requestors. The effect of the proposed collusion attack is validated through synthetic and real-world social network data sets. The in-depth research on the advanced collusion attacks will help us design a more robust and secure friend search engine on OSNs in the near future.	information privacy;malware;privacy;social network;synthetic data;theory;web search engine	Yuhong Liu;Na Li	2019	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2018.2866309	artificial intelligence;collusion;internet privacy;friendship;computer science;search engine;pattern recognition;robustness (computer science);social network;popularity	Security	-56.197605859813244	62.81782126303913	84827

In this paper, we argue that a real-time IDS' input changes considerably over time and ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve. To address this problem, we propose a simple, generic and adaptive technique to achieve good ROC operating points for any given IDS. The proposed technique stochastically predicts the next anomaly score of an IDS and the anomaly classification threshold is then set as a function of the predicted score. We first perform statistical and information-theoretic analyses of network- and host-based IDSs' anomaly scores to reveal a consistent time correlation structure during benign activity periods. We model the observed correlation structure using Markov chains and then use this model to predict and adapt an IDS' classification threshold. The proposed adaptive thresholding module is incorporated into six prominent network- and host-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs). These adaptive ADSs are evaluated on public and labeled attack datasets. We show that, while reducing the need for manual threshold configuration and having very low-complexity, adaptive thresholding enables the ADSs to achieve considerably higher accuracies on the ROC plane.	algorithm;anomaly detection;information theory;markov chain;real-time clock;receiver operating characteristic;thresholding (image processing);time complexity;time-invariant system	Muhammad Qasim Ali;Hassan Khan;Ali Sajjad;Syed Ali Khayam	2009		10.1145/1653662.1653700	intrusion detection system;anomaly detection;computer science;pattern recognition;data mining;computer security	Security	-62.80522517881084	67.87100933549733	85023

Scalable, simple to implement, and no extra bandwidth required are the major advantages of DPM. Besides, it allows incremental deployment and service providers can implement it without revealing their internal network topology. Several DPM schemes have recently been proposed. Unfortunately, these schemes suffer from either a high false positive rate when there are multiple simultaneous attackers or a high false negative rate when packet loss happens because of congestion. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the false positive and false negative rates of a novel DPM scheme that is much scalable than the previous schemes. In the proposed DPM scheme, we use multiple hash functions to reduce the probability of address digest collision. Our analysis and computer simulations show that the proposed DPM scheme results in much smaller false positive rate than previous schemes. Moreover, by modifying the reconstruction procedure, one can control the false negative rate to combat packet loss with slight increase of false positive rate. With eight different kinds of marks, the expected number of packets required to reconstruct an interface address is only 22.	computer simulation;cryptographic hash function;ip traceback;ingress router;intranet;item unique identification;network congestion;network packet;network topology;router (computing);scalability;software deployment	Iven Lin;Tsern-Huei Lee	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.310	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;packet loss;computer security;computer network	Networks	-57.855717891595	69.91242837380241	85274
f3c2120ede9f74fad75d2a26f083c3ac14b98dbf	on the security of the zigbee light link touchlink commissioning procedure		Abstract: Specifications of security mechanisms often lack explicit descriptions of the envisioned security goals and the underlying assumptions. This makes it difficult for developers and customers to understand the level of security provided by the systems. Moreover, this omission has repeatedly resulted in practical attacks that violate the implicit security assumptions of the specifications. In this work, we illustrate this effect on the example of the ZigBee Light Link (ZLL) profile, currently one of the most popular standards for smart lighting in domestic environments. We first provide a concise description of ZLL commissioning procedure for initiating and extending a network of smart bulbs, extracted directly from the specification. We then discuss how the commissioning protocol can be transformed into a formal security model, but also highlight where this is subject to interpretations because of the unclear implicit security assumptions. The proposed security model is flexible, i.e., it can be extended to capture further security requirements or attacker classes, and hence provides a solid foundation for rigorous security analyses of ZLL and other ZigBee profiles.	confidentiality;requirement;smart lighting	Christian Müller;Frederik Armknecht;Zinaida Benenson;Philipp Morgner	2016			embedded system;computer network;project commissioning;business	Security	-49.13344234537095	69.43432315273077	85332
f777ed6cc3ee75e81551d80c1fd5f677f2a8bb7a	secured connections to external networks		INTRODUCTION A private network that carries sensitive data between local computers requires proper security measures to protect the privacy and integrity of the traffic. When such a network is connected to other networks, or when telephone access is allowed into that network, the remote terminals, phone lines, and other connections become extensions to that private network and must be secured accordingly. In addition, the private network must be secured from outside attacks that could cause loss of information, breakdowns in network integrity, or breaches in security. Many organizations have connected or want to connect their private local area networks (LANs) to the Internet so that their users can have convenient access to Internet services. Since the Internet as a whole is not trustworthy, private systems are vulnerable to misuse and attack. Firewalls are typically used as a safeguard to control access between a trusted network and a less trusted network. A firewall is not a single component; it is a strategy for protecting an organization’s resources from the Internet. A firewall serves as the gatekeeper between the untrusted Internet and the more trusted internal networks. Some organizations are also in the process of connecting their private networks to other organizations’ private networks. Firewall security capabilities should also be used to provide protection for these types of connections as well. This article identifies areas of security that should be considered with connections to external networks. Security policies must be developed P A Y O F F I D E A	computer;firewall (computing);gatekeeper;internet;privacy;private network;telephone line;web service	Steven F.

Carefully designed countermeasures as applied in sophisticated P2P botnets such as P2P Zeus impede botnet monitoring and successive takedown. These countermeasures reduce the accuracy of the monitored data, such that an exact reconstruction of the botnet's topology is hard to obtain efficiently. However, an accurate topology snapshot, revealing particularly the identities of all bots, is crucial to execute effective botnet takedown operations. With the goal of obtaining the required snapshot in an efficient manner, we provide a detailed description and analysis of the P2P Zeus neighbor list restriction mechanism. As our main contribution, we propose ZeusMilker, a mechanism for circumventing the existing anti-monitoring countermeasures of P2P Zeus. In contrast to existing approaches, our mechanism deterministically reveals the complete neighbor lists of bots and hence can efficiently provide a reliable topology snapshot of P2P Zeus. We evaluated ZeusMilker on a real-world dataset and found that it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for botnet monitoring with regard to the number of queries needed to retrieve a bot's complete neighbor list. Furthermore, ZeusMilker is provably optimal in retrieving the complete neighbor list, requiring at most 2n queries for an n-elemental list. Moreover, we also evaluated how the performance of ZeusMilker is impacted by various protocol changes designed to undermine its provable performance bounds.	best, worst and average case;botnet;deterministic algorithm;elemental;emoticon;enumerated type;euler;exclusive or;hexadecimal;nl (complexity);peer-to-peer;performance;provable security;randomness;simulation;snapshot (computer storage);takedown: red sabre;verlet list;worst-case complexity;xor	Shankar Karuppayah;Stefanie Roos;Christian Rossow;Max Mühlhäuser;Mathias Fischer	2015	2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2015.69	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;database;distributed computing;botnet;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-56.58077104341057	71.94935414640432	85416

First, we consider the problem of explicit key leakage occurring on opensource intelligence platforms. To do this, we monitor the Pastebin feed from Sep 2017–Mar 2018 to find exposed secret Bitcoin keys, revealing that attackers could have stolen 22.40 BTC worth roughly $178,000 given current exchange rates. Then, we focus on implicit key leakage by exploiting the wrong usage of cryptographic primitives and scan Bitcoin’s blockchain for ECDSA nonce reuse. We systematically outline how an attacker can use duplicate r values to leak nonces and secret keys, which goes beyond the simple case where the same nonce and the same key have been used in conjunction more than once. Our results show that ECDSA nonce reuse has been a recurring problem in the Bitcoin ecosystem and has already been exploited by attackers. In fact, an attacker could have exploited nonce reuse to steal 412.80 BTC worth roughly $3.3 million.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;cryptographic nonce;cryptography;ecosystem;open-source intelligence;open-source software;pastebin;relevance;spectral leakage	Michael Brengel;Christian Rossow	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-00470-5_29	computer security;computer science;cryptographic primitive;key (lock);reuse;cryptographic nonce;blockchain;leakage (electronics);cryptocurrency;elliptic curve digital signature algorithm	Security	-53.42162544460492	66.37197730055463	86475

Organizations can reduce their expenditures by reusing server, switch and router hardware, but they must use reliable and efficient methods of sanitizing these devices before they can be redeployed. The sanitization process removes proprietary, sensitive or classified data, as well as persistent malware from a device prior to reuse. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory has developed an automated, rapid, and secure method for sanitizing servers, switches and routers. This sanitization method was implemented and tested on several different types of network devices during the Cyber Measurement & Analysis Center project, which was funded under Phases I and II of the DARPA (2008) National Cyber Range program. The performance of the automated sanitization system was excellent with an order of magnitude reduction in the time required to sanitize servers, routers and switches, and a significant improvement in the effectiveness of the sanitization process through the addition of persistent malware removal. a 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Antivirus software is widely used as a countermeasure against malware. However, some kinds of malware can evade detection by antivirus software, hence, a new detection method is required. In this paper, we propose a malware detection method that focuses on Anti-Debugging functions. An Anti-Debugging function is a method that prevents malware analysts from analyzing an application program (AP). The function can form part of benign as well as malicious APs. Our method focuses on a behavioral difference between benign and malicious APs and detects malware by comparing the two behavioral patterns. Evaluation results with malware confirmed our method to be capable of successfully detecting malware.	antivirus software;behavioral pattern;debugging;evasion (network security);experiment;malware;sensor;terminate (software)	Kota Yoshizaki;Toshihiro Yamauchi	2014	2014 Second International Symposium on Computing and Networking	10.1109/CANDAR.2014.36	asprox botnet;cyber-collection;computer science;cryptovirology;malware;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-58.207549058108135	61.09406708677392	87261

This ability would be very useful in various ways such as enforcing security policies on the use of P2P applications (e.g. banning file-sharing networks such as Bit Torrent), mitigating malicious P2P networks (i.e. botnets), or allocating network resources appropriately to improve network performance. To provide this ability, in this work we propose a method to discover P2P networks (both benign and malicious) from network flow records captured at the boundary of a tier-1 Internet backbone provider. The basic idea is that flows belonging to P2P applications can be modeled as observations from a mixed membership statistical model, with P2P applications acting as latent variables. Hence the communication patterns of hosts (who-talks-to-whom), as measured at the edge of a large network, can be decomposed into constituent application-layer P2P communities without any human effort in selecting specific features. This allows for automatic identification and isolation of P2P communities of interest, including those that take deliberate measures to remain hidden, as well as new or evolving ones such as P2P Botnets. In large scale experiments on flow records from a portion of IPv4 space of size /8, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to detect a number of well known P2P networks, as well as a few evolving malicious P2P botnets.	automatic identification and data capture;bittorrent;botnet;classless inter-domain routing;experiment;file sharing;flow network;internet backbone;latent variable;network performance;network topology;norm (social);peer-to-peer;private network;randomness;statistical model;unsupervised learning	Liyun Li;Suhas Mathur;Baris Coskun	2013	2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)	10.1109/CNS.2013.6682693	the internet;evolving networks;resource allocation;computer science;network security;operating system;internet security;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-61.49730495892909	65.36166682081344	87411

However, an intrinsic vulnerability of the protocol is its inability to validate the integrity and correctness of routing information exchanged between peer routers. As a result, it is relatively easy for people with malicious intent to steal legitimate IP blocks through an attack known as prefix hijacking, which essentially consists of injecting bogus routing information into the system to redirect or subvert network traffic. In this article, we give a short survey of visualization methods that have been developed for BGP monitoring, in particular for the identification of prefix hijacks. Our goal is to illustrate how network visualization has the potential to assist an analyst in detecting abnormal routing patterns in massive amounts of BGP data. Finally, we present an analysis of a real validated case of prefix hijacking, which took place between April and August 2011. We use this hijack case study to illustrate the ongoing work carried out in VIS-SENSE, a European research project that leverages visual analytics to develop more effective tools for BGP monitoring and prefix hijack detection.	border gateway protocol;control plane;correctness (computer science);graph drawing;inter-domain;malware;network traffic control;page hijacking;router (computing);routing;sensor;spamming;visual analytics	Ernst W.

7cee1ce2c597d66d95b12ae4578241726b5c8b61	dynamically enabled defense effectiveness evaluation of a home internet based on vulnerability analysis and attack layer measurement	home internet;dynamically enabled defense;vulnerability score;markov chain;attack layer	Smart devices in a home Internet, such as routers and cameras, suffer malicious attacks from hackers on a daily basis. Defenders should change system states dynamically to improve the system’s defense ability. To quantify evaluation of defense effectiveness, this paper proposes an improved vulnerability scoring method for home Internets based on the Information Security Technology Security Vulnerability Classification Guide, which calculates a vulnerability score. A higher vulnerability score indicates weaker defense ability. This method only considers defense. In actual system attack and defense, the actions of attackers should also be considered. Therefore, a measurement method for the attack layer based on the Markov chain (MC) is proposed. This method builds a model of an attack layer that can assess whether the defender’s dynamic defense is effective by calculating the factor attack layer detection probability P d. To optimize computing process, this paper introduces stochastic Petri nets (SPN) so that the parameters of MC transition matrix are easily gained. This model also obtains the minimum time period Δt, during which the defender must change system states. If the change time period is greater than Δt, attackers increase their probability of hacking into the home Internet system. Finally, the study concludes that if the vulnerability scores are lower after the system states are changed, Δt will become longer, meaning the home Internet system has enhanced defense ability.	information security;internet;internets;markov chain;router (computing);smart device;stochastic petri net;stochastic matrix;substitution-permutation network	Min Lei;Yu Kyung Yang;Nan Ma;Chunru Zhou;Minyao Ma	2017	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-017-1084-3	hacker;information security;computer science;the internet;stochastic petri net;computer security;vulnerability (computing);vulnerability;vulnerability assessment;markov chain	Security	-57.60202940470935	67.76034437428467	87483
63e21447b7098b41c4ff16e7e2be257fbb24e49a	flush, gauss, and reload - a cache attack on the bliss lattice-based signature scheme		We present the first side-channel attack on a lattice-based signature scheme, using the Flush+Reload cache-attack. The attack is targeted at the discrete Gaussian sampler, an important step in the Bimodal Lattice Signature Schemes (BLISS). After observing only 450 signatures with a perfect side-channel, an attacker is able to extract the secret BLISS-key in less than 2 minutes, with a success probability of 0.96. Similar results are achieved in a proof-of-concept implementation using the Flush+Reload technique with less than 3500 signatures. We show how to attack sampling from a discrete Gaussian using CDT or Bernoulli sampling by showing potential information leakage via cache memory. For both sampling methods, a strategy is given to use this additional information, finalize the attack and extract the secret key. We provide experimental evidence for the idealized perfect side-channel attacks and the Flush+Reload attack on two recent CPUs.	allocate-on-flush;antivirus software;bliss;bernoulli polynomials;cpu cache;central processing unit;digital signature;eclipse;finalize (optical discs);information leakage;key (cryptography);sampling (signal processing);side-channel attack;spectral leakage	Leon Groot Bruinderink;Andreas Hülsing;Tanja Lange;Yuval Yarom	2016		10.1007/978-3-662-53140-2_16	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing	Security	-53.156828750722845	67.79443970834797	87588
e03e885bbb071f2f5384ce708d672353b3cf0ca3	detection of malware propagation in sensor node and botnet group clustering based on e-mail spam analysis		Cyber incidents are increasing continuously. More than 200,000 new malicious codes appear, with more than 30,000 malicious codes distributed each day on average. These cyber attacks are expanding gradually to the social infrastructure (nuclear energy, power, water, etc.) and smart sensor networks. This paper proposes a method of detecting malware propagation in sensor Node and botnet clustering automatically by analyzing e-mails. More than 80% of spam e-mails are generated by the Node infected with malicious code, using various methods to avoid filtering such as direct-to-MX, fake Received header, and open relay vulnerability. This paper proposes a scheme that detects those types accurately, including a clustering method that targets the URL included in the e-mail body, e-mail subject, attached file, and hosting server, to detect the botnet group infected with the same malicious code. The proposed method recorded about 85% zombie IP detection rate when spam e-mails distributed in a commercial environment were analyzed. When applied to the portal site that delivers 10 million e-mails, the proposed technology is expected to detect at least 150,000 zombie Nodes each day. If advanced measures are taken against the detected zombie Nodes, the spread of cyber attack damages can apparently be reduced.	botnet;malware;sensor node;software propagation	Tae-Jin Lee;Hesun Cho;Haeryong Park;Jin Kwak	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/530250	srizbi botnet;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-58.10733790354132	64.7001148484864	87728

8740df43fcd4312a966afbef02467141a19aebb0	netviewer: a network traffic visualization and analysis tool	network traffic	The frequent and large-scale network attacks have led to an increased need for developing techniques for analyzing network traffic. If efficient analysis tools were available, it could become possible to detect the attacks, anomalies and to appropriately take action to contain the attacks before they have had time to propagate across the network. This paper describes NetViewer, a network monitoring tool that can simultaneously detect, identify and visualize attacks and anomalous traffic in real-time by passively monitoring packet headers. NetViewer represents the traffic data as images, enabling the application of image/video processing techniques for the analysis of network traffic. NetViewer is released free to the general public. By employing a freely available visualization tool, the users of NetViewer can comprehend the characteristics of the network traffic observed in the aggregate. NetViewer can be employed to detect and identify network anomalies such as DoS/DDoS attacks, worms and flash crowds. NetViewer can also provide information on traffic distributions over IP address/port number domains, utilization of link capacity and effectiveness of Quality of Service policies.	aggregate data;denial-of-service attack;image processing;network packet;network traffic control;norm (social);quality of service;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);tracing (software);video content analysis;video processing	Seong Soo Kim;A.

29cfe9fafb4109941b5c88ef49669615f5727363	computationally efficient privacy preserving anonymous mutual and batch authentication schemes for vehicular ad hoc networks	anonymous certificate;authentication;internet of things;vehicular ad hoc networks;signature;conditional privacy	In the near future, it is envisioned that vehicular Ad hoc networks (VANETs) will be making use of long-distance communication techniques, such as cellular networks and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), to get instant Internet access for making the communication between vehicles and fixed road side infrastructure. Moreover, VANETs will also make use of short-distance communication methods, such as Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) and Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) to perform short range communication between vehicles in an ad hoc manner. This Internet connection can provide facility to other vehicles to send traffic related messages, collisions, infotainment messages other useful safety alerts. In such a scenario, providing authentication between vehicle to infrastructure and vehicle to vehicle is a challenging task. In order to provide this facility, in this paper, we propose a computationally efficient privacy preserving anonymous authentication scheme based on the use of anonymous certificates and signatures for VANETs in making them an important component of Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of smart cities. Even though there are several existing schemes available to provide such anonymous authentication based on anonymous certificates and signatures in VANETs, the existing schemes suffer from high computational cost in the certificate revocation list (CRL) checking process and in the certificate and the signature verification process. Therefore, it is not possible to meet the requirement of verifying a large number of messages per second in VANETs which would lead to increased message loss. Hence, we use a computationally efficient anonymous mutual authentication scheme to validate the message source as well as to ensure the integrity of messages along with a conditional tracking mechanism to trace the real identity of misbehaving vehicles and revoke them from VANET in the case of dispute. In this paper, we also introduce an efficient anonymous batch authentication protocol to be used in IoT for Road Side Units (RSUs) to authenticate multiple vehicles simultaneously rather than one after the other such that the total authentication time can be dramatically reduced. This proposed scheme is implemented and the performance analysis shows that our scheme is more efficient in terms of certificate and signature verification cost, while preserving conditional privacy in VANETs.	authentication;hoc (programming language)	Pandi Vijayakumar;Victor I.

In addition to the conventional approach of human interactive proofs such as CAPTCHAs, a more recent approach of human observational proofs (HOP) has been developed to automatically distinguish web bots from human users. Its design rationale is that web bots behave intrinsically differently from human beings, allowing them to be detected. This paper escalates the battle against web bots by exploring the limits of current HOP-based bot detection systems. We develop an evasive web bot system based on human behavioral patterns. Then we prototype a general web bot framework and a set of flexible de-classifier plugins, primarily based on application-level event evasion. We further abstract and define a set of benchmarks for measuring our system's evasion performance on contemporary web applications, including social network sites. Our results show that the proposed evasive system can effectively mimic human behaviors and evade detectors by achieving high similarities between human users and evasive bots.	algorithm;behavioral pattern;benchmark (computing);captcha;design rationale;evasion (network security);internet;plug-in (computing);prototype;sensor;social network;web application;world wide web	Jing Jin;A.

However, due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart wireless devices in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), CR systems are vulnerable to numerous security threats that affect the overall performance. There have been many significant advances on security threats and countermeasures in CRNs in the past few years. Our main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for CRN security to protect both unlicensed secondary users and licensed primary users. Specifically, we present the recent advances on security threats/attacks and countermeasures in CRNs focusing more on the physical layer by categorizing them in terms of their types, their existence in the CR cycle, network protocol layers (exploited during their activities and defense strategies), and game theoretic approaches. The recent important attacks and countermeasures in CRNs are also summarized in the form of tables. We also present recommendations that can be followed while implementing countermeasures to enhance CRN security. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of CRN security attacks and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this area.	categorization;cognitive radio;communications protocol;countermeasure (computer);game theory;on the fly;pervasive informatics;radio frequency;spectral density	Rajesh K.

The first step in the PCPP process is remote assessment of a prospective remote host to determine whether it is capable of executing the PCPP application and to classify the host as a potential threat or non-threat. This paper explores the use of a naive Bayesian classifier to classify prospective remote hosts. We show that the naive Bayesian classifier learns to recognize subtle patterns in historical host measurements and performs the classification task accurately and with minimal negative performance implications.	bayesian network;naive bayes classifier;programming paradigm;prospective search	Thomas H.

To date, most botnet detection approaches either operate at packet-level or flow-level by identifying signatures or flow patterns. In addition, some detection technologies correlate both flow and malicious behaviors to detect botnets. However, most of these approaches relay on obvious behavior characteristics of botnets and cannot simultaneously detect and characterize unknown bots in the early stages subsequent to an infection. In an effort to rectify this situation, we studied the distribution pattern of relevant packets and determined that, in general, the first request packet from bots and the first response packet from C&C servers contain the most valuable information. Consequently, we propose a technique that automatically detects unknown HTTP botnets and generates the signatures of C&C activities on the basis of this knowledge. The results of preliminary experiments conducted indicate that our proposed approach can accurately detect unknown HTTP botnets (such as SpyEye and ZeuS) with low false positive rates and generate their signatures automatically.	antivirus software;botnet;experiment;firewall (computing);hypertext transfer protocol;network packet;relay;sensor;type signature	Ke Li;Chaoge Liu;Xiang Cui	2014		10.1145/2660267.2662375	computer science;internet privacy;botnet;world wide web;computer security	Security	-59.518313896771076	65.55452299665757	88978

Our approach uses the cumulative online duration of a VoIP user to derive his reputation value. And we leverage user feedback to mark unsolicited calls. For each unwanted call, our voice spam filter charges the caller a reputation point, and transfers this reputation point to the callee. To avoid VoIP users to manually label nuisance calls, our voice spam filter automatically marks all VoIP calls with short call durations as unsolicited. The preliminary simulation results show that our approach is effective to counter voice spam.	anti-spam techniques;email filtering;feedback;peer-to-peer;simulation;spamming;telephone number;user (computing);whitelist	Ruishan Zhang;Andrei V.

SttS enables the verification of the position of a passive receiver by exploiting the radio reflection properties of ephemeral meteor trails, combined with multiple anchors (N) that can be deployed even hundreds of Km from the receiver itself. We developed a complete theoretical model for our solution–rooted on sound literature and past experimental campaigns–, and fully tested it with extensive simulations. Results show that SttS is highly reliable in guaranteeing position verification, and that it can detect a location spoofing attack even when up to $\left({\lceil \frac {N}{2}\rceil -1}\right)$ anchors are compromised by an adversary. Finally, it is completely tunable, trading off accuracy with the number of observed trails–for instance, observing just 200 trails enables to correctly classify the the location as valid or not with a 0.99 probability.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;authentication;glonass;global positioning system;mbc-55x;meteor;radio jamming;simulation;software deployment;spoofing attack;stripes;theory;transmitter	Savio Sciancalepore;Gabriele Oligeri;Roberto Di Pietro	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)	10.1109/CNS.2018.8433171	real-time computing;computer science;meteor burst communications;computer network;global positioning system;ephemeral key;spoofing attack;adversary;robustness (computer science);stars;meteoroid	Mobile	-53.13562574595967	70.65246238762091	89481
312be8a03e45eebfb4a1f0077a9e4e1ee179b5f4	unsure how to authenticate on your vr headset?: come on, use your head!		For security-sensitive Virtual Reality (VR) applications that require the end-user to enter authenticatioan credentials within the virtual space, a VR user's inability to see (potentially malicious entities in) the physical world can be discomforting, and in the worst case could potentially expose the VR user to visual attacks. In this paper, we show that the head, hand and (or) body movement patterns exhibited by a user freely interacting with a VR application contain user-specific information that can be leveraged for user authentication. For security-sensitive VR applications, we argue that such functionality can be used as an added layer of security that minimizes the need for entering the PIN. Based on a dataset of 23 users who interacted with our VR application for two sessions over a period of one month, we obtained mean equal error rates as low as 7% when we authenticated users based on their head and body movement patterns.	authentication;best, worst and average case;biometrics;computation;credential;deep learning;diffie–hellman key exchange;entity;headset (audio);interaction;malware;mobile app;personal identification number;systems design;virtual reality headset	Tahrima Mustafa;Richard Matovu;Abdul Serwadda;Nicholas Muirhead	2018		10.1145/3180445.3180450	computer science;internet privacy;headset;virtual reality;authentication	Visualization	-51.84661308451599	66.11411050327688	89623

As part of our findings, the user chat messages details and contacts were investigated for each application. By using two smartphones with different brands and the latest Android operating systems as experimental objects, we conducted digital investigations in a forensically sound manner. We summarize our findings regarding the different Instant Messaging chat modes and the corresponding encryption status of artifacts for each of the four applications. Our findings can be helpful to many mobile forensic investigations. Additionally, these findings may present values to Android system developers, Android mobile app developers, mobile security researchers as well as mobile users.	adversary (cryptography);android;database;encryption;end-to-end encryption;facebook messenger;instant messaging;mobile app;mobile security;network packet;online chat;operating system;smartphone;whatsapp messenger;wireshark	Hao Zhang;Lei Chen;Qingzhong Liu	2018	2018 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390330	humanoid robot;internet privacy;encryption;android (operating system);digital forensics;instant;computer science	SE	-52.42948195694467	63.74849083532007	89757

P2P applications supposedly constitute a substantial proportion of today's Internet traffic. However, current P2P applications use several obfuscation techniques, including dynamic port numbers, port hopping, HTTP masquerading, chunked file transfers, and encrypted payloads. As P2P applications continue to evolve, robust and effective methods are needed for P2P traffic identification. The paper compares three methods to classify P2P applications: port-based classification, application-layer signatures, and transport-layer analysis. The study uses empirical network traces collected from the University of Calgary Internet connection for the past 2 years. The results show that port-based analysis is ineffective, being unable to identify 30%-70% of today's Internet traffic. Application signatures are accurate, but may not be possible for legal or technical reasons. The transport-layer method seems promising, providing a robust means to assess aggregate P2P traffic. The latter method suggests that 30%-70% of the campus Internet traffic for the past year was P2P.	aggregate data;antivirus software;code signing;encryption;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hypertext transfer protocol;internet;network traffic control;peer-to-peer;tracing (software);traffic classification;type signature	Alok Madhukar;Carey L.

7609b37bfda2457edd65b5d7329fea4687639e5e	machine learning-based detection of ransomware using sdn		The growth of malware poses a major threat to internet users, governments, and businesses around the world. One of the major types of malware, ransomware, encrypts a user's sensitive information and only returns the original files to the user after a ransom is paid. As malware developers shift the delivery of their product from HTTP to HTTPS to protect themselves from payload inspection, we can no longer rely on deep packet inspection to extract features for malware identification. Toward this goal, we propose a solution leveraging a recent trend in networking hardware, that is programmable forwarding engines (PFEs). PFEs allow collection of per-packet, network monitoring data at high rates. We use this data to monitor the network traffic between an infected computer and the command and control (C&C) server. We extract high-level flow features from this traffic and use this data for ransomware classification. We write a stream processor and use a random forest, binary classifier to utilizes these rich flow records in fingerprinting malicious, network activity without the requirement of deep packet inspection. Our classification model achieves a detection rate in excess of 0.86, while maintaining a false negative rate under 0.11. Our results suggest that a flow-based fingerprinting method is feasible and accurate enough to catch ransomware before encryption.	binary classification;botnet;c++;deep packet inspection;encryption;fingerprint (computing);https;high- and low-level;hypertext transfer protocol;ibm notes;information sensitivity;key (cryptography);machine learning;malware;network packet;network traffic control;networking hardware;offset binary;plaintext;random forest;sandbox (computer security);sensor;server (computing);software-defined networking;stream processing	Greg Cusack;Oliver Michel;Eric Keller	2018		10.1145/3180465.3180467	computer security;networking hardware;computer science;encryption;deep packet inspection;network monitoring;malware;the internet;software-defined networking;ransomware;computer network	Security	-58.46166032580832	61.31859339657495	89966

923c6f92566c13cd6b6ccee8e2bf3eb6f9b79874	intelligent phishing detection system using similarity matching algorithms		Today, phishing attack is one of the most common and serious threat over internet. It is used to fraud users and steal their personal information either by using spoofed e-mails or fake websites or both. In this paper, we proposed a novel intelligent phishing detection system, i.e., CSS and URI matching-based phishing detection system (CUMP) to detect zero-day phishing attacks. Our proposed approach is based on the concept of uniform resource identifier (URI) and cascading style sheet (CSS) matching. This concept is used, as phisher always tries to mimic the URI pattern and visual design in the hope that even experienced user will not be able to detect phishing website by visualisation. To mimic the visual appearance, phishers generally use same CSS style. Without using same CSS, it is very difficult to achieve the same design. To defend against phishing websites attacks especially u0027zero-dayu0027 attacks, our proposed system used the basic properties of any phishing attacks for URI and CSS matching.

IoT is a rapidly growing field, on an account of this; the security measurements for IoT should be at first concern. In the modern day world, the most emerging cyber-attack threat for IoT is ransomware attack. Ransomware is a kind of malware with the aim of rendering a victim's computer unusable or inaccessible, and then asking the user to pay a ransom to revert the destruction. In this paper we are evaluating ransomware attacks statistics for the past 2 years and the present year to estimate growth rate of the most emerging ransomware families from the last 3 years to evaluate most threatening ransomware attacks for IoT. Growth rate results shows that the number of attacks for Cryptowall and locky ransomware are notably increasing therefore, these ransomware families are potential threat to IoT. Moreover, we present a Cryptowall ransomware attack detection model based on the communication and behavioral study of Cryptowall for IoT environment. The proposed model observes incoming TCP/IP traffic through web proxy server then extracts TCP/IP header and uses command and control (C&C) server black listing to detect ransomware attacks.	botnet;coding tree unit;cryptolocker;internet of things;internet protocol suite;internetworking;locky;malware;operating system;proxy server;server (computing);usability	Asma Zahra;Munam Ali Shah	2017	2017 23rd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)	10.23919/IConAC.2017.8082013	internet traffic;ip header;the internet;engineering;malware;proxy server;computer network;ransomware;computer security;internetworking;server	Security	-59.65986412193387	65.2622324204018	90252

a32edda7ca875bb9a9c877cd127144ec4fab0314	content protection in named data networking: challenges and potential solutions		ICNs are promising alternatives to current Internet architecture since the Internet struggles with a number of issues such as scalability, mobility, and security. ICN offers a number of potential benefits including reduced congestion and enhanced delivery performance by employing content caching, simpler network configurations, and stronger security for the content. NDN, an instance of ICN, enables content delivery instead of host-centric approaches by naming data rather than host. In order to make NDN practical in the real world, the challenging issues of content security need to be addressed. In this article, we examine the architecture and content security as well as possible solutions to these issues of NDN, with a special focus on the content integrity and provenance. We propose a variety of digital signature schemes to achieve the data integrity and origin authentication in NDN for various applications, which include cost-effective signatures, privacy preserving signatures, network coding signatures, and post-quantum signatures. We also present speed-up techniques in generating signatures and verifying signatures such as pre-computation, batch verification, and server-aided verification to reduce the computational cost of the producers and receivers in NDN. A number of certificate-free trust management approaches and possible adoptions in NDN are investigated.	algorithmic efficiency;antivirus software;apple icon image format;authentication;computation;content security policy;data integrity;digital distribution;digital signature;icn gps;internet;linear network coding;network congestion;post-quantum cryptography;precomputation;scalability;server (computing);trust management (information system);type signature;verification and validation	Yong Yu;Yannan Li;Xiaojiang Du;Ruonan Chen;Bo Yang	2018	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2018.1701086	the internet;architecture;computer network;linear network coding;delivery performance;digital signature;scalability;distributed computing;data integrity;computer science;authentication	Security	-56.11225413626097	71.32187206601826	90441
898d473291884bdca86a73e13b3be180e39612c9	bump in the wire (bitw) security solution for a marine rov remote control application		Abstract The work presented here describes a Bump-In-The-Wire (BITW) security solution for the provision of secure communications for a Marine ROV Control Application. The targeted marine application involves controlling a ‘Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)’ from a remote control station through standard Internet. A BITW solution is required as communication through the Internet is inherently insecure and open to signal modification or tampering. BITW technology is an implementation approach that places a security mechanism outside and independent of the system that is to be protected, in this case that is a ROV and its remotely located control station. Secure communications between the ROV and the remote control station is necessary to ensure that only authorised persons can issue control commands to the ROV and that no unauthorised individual can understand/sniff the communications between the ROV and control station. The proposed BITW security solution involves an efficient implementation of the AES cryptographic algorithm on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. The extra delay introduced into the remote control application was well within the allowable time window of 50 ms. Other security mechanisms can also be implemented in the same way depending upon the availability of hardware resources.	bump mapping;remote control	Muzaffar Rao;Thomas Newe;Edin Omerdic;Admir Kaknjo;Walid Elgenaidi;Avijit Mathur;Gerard Dooly;Elfed Lewis;Daniel Toal	2018	J.

As a consequence, understanding their behaviour is an important step towards the mitigation of such threat. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on network topology to assess the spreading and potential security impact of botnets. Our main motivation is to provide a toolbox to classify and analyse the security threats posed by botnets based on their dynamical and statistical behaviour. This would potentially lead to a better understanding and prediction of cybersecurity issues related to computer networks. Our initial validation shows the potential of our method providing relevant and accurate results.	botnet;computer security;network topology;threat (computer)	Marcello Trovati;Win Thomas;Quanbin Sun;Georgios Kontonatsios	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-57186-7_31	cyber-attack;network topology;toolbox;network theory;botnet;distributed computing;computer science	Security	-60.690743581471864	64.19729385079796	90798

This operation is so massive and time critical that there is usually no time to perform analysis to look for patterns and correlations between attacks. In this work we summarize our findings after applying data analysis and clustering analysis to the record of attacks registered for a major financial institution in the US. We use HTML structure and content analysis, as well as domain registration records and DNS RRSets information of the sites, in order to look for patterns and correlations between phishing attacks. It is shown that by understanding and clustering the different types of phishing sites, we are able to identify different strategies used by criminal organizations. Furthermore, the findings of this study provide us valuable insight into who is targeting the institution and their modus operandi, which gives us a solid foundation for the construction of more and better tools for detection and takedown, and eventually for forensic analysts who will be able to correlate cases and perform focused searches that speed up their investigations.	cluster analysis;computer cluster;html;phishing;takedown: red sabre	Javier Vargas;Alejandro Correa Bahnsen;Sergio Villegas;Daniel Ingevaldson	2016	2016 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)	10.1109/ECRIME.2016.7487942	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-60.43680352388736	63.300077216370404	90808

We present a new technique, called “backscatter analysis,” that provides a conservative estimate of worldwide denial-of-service activity. We use this approach on 22 traces (each covering a week or more) gathered over three years from 2001 through 2004. Across this corpus we quantitatively assess the number, duration, and focus of attacks, and qualitatively characterize their behavior. In total, we observed over 68,000 attacks directed at over 34,000 distinct victim IP addresses---ranging from well-known e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Hotmail to small foreign ISPs and dial-up connections. We believe our technique is the first to provide quantitative estimates of Internet-wide denial-of-service activity and that this article describes the most comprehensive public measurements of such activity to date.	dos;denial-of-service attack;dial-up internet access;e-commerce;outlook.com;text corpus;threat (computer);tracing (software);web service	David J Moore;Colleen Shannon;Douglas J.

Many of these APIs involve accessing sensitive functionality and/or user data and require approval by users. Android for instance allows developers to select from over 130 possible permissions.

In this paper, we report on the results of a study analyzing people's privacy preferences when it comes to granting permissions to different mobile apps. Our results suggest that, while people's mobile app privacy preferences are diverse, a relatively small number of profiles can be identified that offer the promise of significantly simplifying the decisions mobile users have to make. Specifically, our results are based on the analysis of settings of 4.8 million smartphone users of a mobile security and privacy platform.

Unlike previous work, minimum apriori knowledge of the system being analyzed is assumed. This assumption enhances the platform portability of the framework. The anomaly detection component works in a bottom-up manner on the contents of historical system log data to detect regions of the log, which contain anomalous (alert) behaviour. The identified anomalous regions (after inspection by a human administrator through a visualization system) are then passed to the signature generation component, which mines them for patterns. Consequently, future occurrences of the underlying alert in the anomalous log region, can be detected on a production system using the discovered patterns. The combination of anomaly detection and signature generation, which is novel when compared to previous work, ensures that a framework which is accurate while still being able to detect new and unknown alerts is attained.	anomaly detection;apriori algorithm;bottom-up parsing;log analysis;production system (computer science)	Adetokunbo Makanju;A.

Development of wireless sensor networking area has greatly increased the feasibility of a mobile e-health system since it provides wireless communication technology with promising sensor network applications. However, mobile e-health is subjected to a lot of security attacks such as sensor node cloning attack and man-in-the-middle attack. A secure e-health authentication system is one of the important approaches in order to provide high security for the whole e-health monitoring system. Considering the potential security attacks in mobile e-health application, a development of a unique identity of the e-health sensor node is proposed to provide a highly secure authentication protocol in mobile e-health. The identity of the e-health sensor node is a very important element in the proposed authentication protocol to ensure the confidentiality and the authenticity of transmitted e-health data.	authentication protocol;confidentiality;home automation;internet of things;mhealth;man-in-the-middle attack;mobile device;sensor node;software deployment;vulnerability (computing)	Nazhatul Hafizah Kamarudin;Yusnani Mohd Yussoff;Nurhaflyza Marbukhari;Mustaffa Samad;Habibah Hashim	2017	2017 IEEE 42nd Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2017.37	challenge-handshake authentication protocol;computer network;wireless sensor network;otway–rees protocol;authentication protocol;computer science;mobile telephony;sensor node;authentication;server	Mobile	-49.96422232300216	73.3384949524589	91669
7fa821fa3fd6b5f9729f33b4790f24d3300314a7	the rise of certificate transparency and its implications on the internet ecosystem		In this paper, we analyze the evolution of Certificate Transparency (CT) over time and explore the implications of exposing certificate DNS names from the perspective of security and privacy. We find that certificates in CT logs have seen exponential growth. Website support for CT has also constantly increased, with now 33% of established connections supporting CT. With the increasing deployment of CT, there are also concerns of information leakage due to all certificates being visible in CT logs. To understand this threat, we introduce a CT honeypot and show that data from CT logs is being used to identify targets for scanning campaigns only minutes after certificate issuance. We present and evaluate a methodology to learn and validate new subdomains from the vast number of domains extracted from CT logged certificates.	ct scan;certificate transparency;confidentiality;countermeasure (computer);ecosystem;honeypot (computing);information leakage;internet;software deployment;spectral leakage;time complexity	Quirin Scheitle;Oliver Gasser;Theodor Nolte;Johanna Amann;Lexi Brent;Georg Carle;Ralph Holz;Thomas C.

These boundaries occur at various levels, and vulnerabilities can become apparent as data crosses each boundary. In this inaugural column on practical security, boundaries from smaller to larger are discussed and a couple of vulnerabilities are described.

Wireless enabled devices belonging to the same user (domain) need to be associated long-term to each other with as much ease as connections with physical wires. It should be obvious which two devices are being associated. Managing device associations must be simple, intuitive and communication between associated devices secure. This paper describes touch-mediated association protocols (TAP) which enable user-friendly, secure long-term device associations. TAP extends the resurrecting duckling security model. It uses an intuitive UI (the mediator), a physical device which taps devices that need to be associated. TAP does not require any PKI, uses computationally cheap cryptography and is easy to integrate.	cryptography;peripheral;public key infrastructure;usability;user interface	Anantharaman Lakshminarayanan;Huafei Zhu	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424904	telecommunications;computer science;cryptography;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-49.40649644950598	70.52934408958146	92064

However, scalability and support for micropayments remain problems for blockchain-based applications, therefore other alternatives such as IOTA should be considered. This work reports on an experimental evaluation of IOTA on several different IoT platforms. We show that even though the communication overhead to join the IOTA network can be significantly reduced by adapting a proxy-based architecture, the computational overhead remains high. We conclude that IOTA is not currently suitable for battery-powered IoT devices.	advance directive - proxy;bridging (networking);hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;internet of things;iota and jot;isoelectric point;micropayment;overhead (computing);power (psychology);proof-of-work system;proxy server;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);requirement;scalability;server (computing)	Atis Elsts;Laura Nino-Torres;George C.

For protecting sensitive data and preventing attacks, many embedded devices employ cryptographic algorithms and authentication schemes. In the past years, various vulnerabilities have been found in commercial products that enable to bypass the security mechanisms. Since a large number of the devices in the field are in the hands of potential adversaries, implementation attacks (such as side-channel analysis and reverse engineering) can play a critical role for the overall security of a system. At hand of several examples of assailable commercial products we demonstrate the potential impact of the found security weaknesses and illustrate how to not do it.	dreams;internet of things	Timo Kasper;David Oswald;Christof Paar	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-43826-8_1	security through obscurity;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Theory	-50.97600108847164	64.82174822148336	92322
2cfbb7b89a5e220b21bbf64161dc880c1b644017	when governments hack opponents: a look at actors and technology		Repressive nation-states have long monitored telecommunications to keep tabs on political dissent. The Internet and online social networks, however, pose novel technical challenges to this practice, even as they open up new domains for surveillance. We analyze an extensive collection of suspicious files and links targeting activists, opposition members, and nongovernmental organizations in the Middle East over the past several years. We find that these artifacts reflect efforts to attack targets’ devices for the purposes of eavesdropping, stealing information, and/or unmasking anonymous users. We describe attack campaigns we have observed in Bahrain, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates, investigating attackers, tools, and techniques. In addition to off-the-shelf remote access trojans and the use of third-party IP-tracking services, we identify commercial spyware marketed exclusively to governments, including Gamma’s FinSpy and Hacking Team’s Remote Control System (RCS). We describe their use in Bahrain and the UAE, and map out the potential broader scope of this activity by conducting global scans of the corresponding command-and-control (C&C) servers. Finally, we frame the real-world consequences of these campaigns via strong circumstantial evidence linking hacking to arrests, interrogations, and imprisonment.	control system;cryptography;cybercrime;embedded system;finfisher;google hacking;internet;malware;phone hacking;problem domain;social engineering (security);social network;spyware	William R.

A mathematical analysis of this new approach is conducted and a mathematical model of P2P anti-worm is introduced to analyze the propagation. Simulation is made on SSFNET to compare the P2P anti-worm and pure random scan worm. The simulation results show that P2P anti-worm can slow down the speed of the malicious worm. Then this paper discusses the relationship between the propagation speed and the P2P overlay average degree, the initial number of the anti-worm and the release time delay. It is noticed from the experiments that the P2P feature makes anti-worm safer, and its propagation more stabile, more controllable and cost less.	anti-worm;broadcast delay;experiment;mathematical model;peer-to-peer;simulation;software propagation	Bin Wang;Piao Ding;Jinfang Sheng	2008	2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists	10.1109/ICYCS.2008.471	simulation;sensitivity;computer science;information security;theoretical computer science;peer-to-peer;mathematical model;computer security;network topology;computer network	Robotics	-59.683995762727555	68.09851366291537	92503

7cfcce2a3731e6f359b67e2683b4e37572f17dbb	revisiting email spoofing attacks		The email system is the central battleground against phishing and social engineering attacks, and yet email providers still face key challenges to authenticate incoming emails. As a result, attackers can apply spoofing techniques to impersonate a trusted entity to conduct highly deceptive phishing attacks. In this work, we study email spoofing to answer three key questions: (1) How do email providers detect and handle forged emails? (2) Under what conditions can forged emails penetrate the defense to reach user inbox? (3) Once the forged email gets in, how email providers warn users? Is the warning truly effective? We answer these questions through end-to-end measurements on 35 popular email providers (used by billions of users), and extensive user studies (N = 913) that consist of both simulated and real-world phishing experiments. We have four key findings. First, most popular email providers have the necessary protocols to detect spoofing, but still allow forged emails to get into user inbox (e.g., Yahoo Mail, iCloud, Gmail). Second, once a forged email gets in, most email providers have no warnings for users, particularly on mobile email apps. Some providers (e.g., Gmail Inbox) even have misleading UIs that make the forged email look authentic. Third, a few email providers (9/35) have implemented visual security cues for unverified emails, which demonstrate a positive impact to reduce risky user actions. Comparing simulated experiments with realistic phishing tests, we observe that the impact of security cue is less significant when users are caught off guard in the real-world setting.	authentication;email spoofing;end-to-end encryption;experiment;inbox by gmail;phishing;simulation;social engineering (security);spoofing attack;usability testing;yahoo mail;icloud	Hang Hu;Gang Wang	2018	CoRR		computer security;guard (information security);computer science;spoofing attack;phishing;authentication;social engineering (security)	Security	-56.13563655477078	62.346451640326805	92648

This attack causes a server not to accept additional connection requests by filling the server's backlog queue with malicious connection requests (SYNpackets). Although several methods have been proposed to solve the SYN Flooding attack, they cannot guarantee reliable connection establishments to clients under extremely aggressive SYN flooding attacks. In this paper, we propose a WhiteList-based defense scheme that increases connection success ratio of legitimate connection requests under SYN flooding attacks. We implemented this scheme as a Linux kernel module. Experimental results show that the proposed method ensures high connection success ratio for legitimate clients and effectively annuls bogus SYN flooding.	denial-of-service attack;linux;loadable kernel module;network packet;syn cookies;syn flood;server (computing);synergy;whitelist	Tae-Hyung Kim;Young-Sik Choi;Jong Kim;Sung Je Hong	2008	22nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Workshops (aina workshops 2008)	10.1109/WAINA.2008.218	computer science;syn flood;internet privacy;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Mobile	-57.86357661743196	68.64990065051481	92735

Invariably, new technologies introduce new vulnerabilities which often enable new attacks by increasingly potent adversaries. Yet new systems are more adept at handling well-known attacks by old adversaries than anticipating new ones. Our adversary models seem to be perpetually out of date: often they do not capture adversary attacks and sometimes they address attacks rendered impractical by new technologies. In this panel presentation, I provide a brief overview of adversary models beginning with those required by program and data sharing technologies ('60-70s), continuing with those required by computer communication and networking technologies (70s-'90s), and ending with those required by and sensor network technologies ('00s ->). I argue that sensor, ad-hoc, and mesh networks require new models, that are able to account for physical node capture by adversaries. Protecting device secrets (e.g., cryptographic keys) via physical security mechanisms will continue to require network security measures, despite advances in physical security measures and devices. I argue that """"good-enough"""" measures in the face of node capture by adversaries can be obtained by using emergent properties. Intuitively, these are properties that cannot be provided by individual network nodes - no matter how well-endowed nodes might be - but instead result from interaction and collaboration among multiple nodes. Such properties can be used to detect, often probabilistically, the presence of an adversary within a network and to pinpoint with reasonable accuracy the affected network area (e.g., identify a specific captured node, a particular properly of captured nodes). However, all such measures require periodic network monitoring in normal mode to detect a somewhat rare event (i.e., node capture, replica insertion) and hence their cost can be high. I illustrate a new simple probabilistic protocol that avoids the effects of node capture by detecting adversaries attempts to access a node's internal state, and discuss various design trade-offs that will characterize much of the future research in this area."""	adversary (cryptography);emergence;extreme value theory;hardware description language;hoc (programming language);key (cryptography);mesh networking;network security;normal mode;physical security;sensor	Virgil D.

In succession, we describe our steganographic system PDFStego in which several strategies are applied to improve security, such as making use of redundancy to complement security; constituting two chaotic maps to meet the Kerckhoffs principle and to prevent statistical attacks, and applying the secure hash algorithm to enable integrity service and blindly extracting service. Moreover, we define the embedding capacity of our system.

To accomplish this task automatically, we present the DSNSF (Digital Signature of Network Segment using Flow analysis), which characterizes the normal behavior of network traffic. For the DSNSF creation a modification of Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic is used, which improves the extraction of information, defining a normal profile. Furthermore, we propose a model based on DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) pattern matching technique for anomaly detecting, allowing the recognition of deviant behavior moving in time and those who are punctual. The anomaly notifications are multilevel, in order not to overload the network administrator with false reports. To evaluate the proposed system, IP flows from a real data set were used.	anomaly detection;ant colony optimization algorithms;digital signature;dynamic time warping;metaheuristic;network packet;network segment;pattern matching;receiver operating characteristic;sensor	Luiz Fernando Carvalho;Joel Jos&#x00E9; P.

The problem of extracting knowledge from the traffic flows is known as the heavy-hitter issue. In this context, the main challenge consists in mining the traffic flows with high accuracy and limited memory consumption. In the aim of improving the accuracy of heavy-hitters identification while having a reasonable memory usage, we introduce a novel algorithm called ACLStream. The latter mines the approximate closed frequent patterns over a stream of packets. Carried out experiments showed that our proposed algorithm presents better performances compared to those of the pioneer known algorithms for heavy-hitters extraction over real network traffic traces.	approximation algorithm;association rule learning;computation;experiment;intrusion detection system;network packet;network security;network traffic control;online and offline;performance;tracing (software)	Imen Brahmi;Sadok Ben Yahia;Pascal Poncelet	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23544-3_32	traffic generation model;network traffic control;simulation;computer science;traffic congestion reconstruction with kerner's three-phase theory;approximation;traffic flow;data mining;traffic shaping;computer security;network traffic simulation	Metrics	-62.15441221614965	66.58056308725708	93513

With their populace gone up beyond measure in the recent years, absolute protection from them is a question of ongoing research. The problem becomes more serious when it is a networked based environment. Starting from servers to clients, malwares can certainly create havoc in a networked environment. Networking among computer provides malwares with an easy mode of transport. They can easily transfer from one system to another, thus infecting several systems in no time. Numerous technologies have been employed to counter their threat. However, immunizations with these technologies keep being devised. Present scenario calls for technologies that hit the very base on which the spread of malwares in a networked environment stands. With the malware industry letting out new variants of malwares to infect large computer networks at an incredible pace, it has become imperative in the present to come up with strategies so as to counter their threat. With every new malware coming into picture, new technologies are designed to combat them and the reverse unfortunately stands true. The present scenario demands fresh technologies which strike the roots on how malwares enter a network and consequently spread inside it. The malwares have to be checked from the entry point itself because once they find a place inside the network, they can create innumerable places for them to hide. The mechanism to counter malwares in a networked environment proposed in this paper, checks the entry of malwares right from the entry point of a network itself. The architecture powered by networking among multiple OS kernels and cloud computing will certainly be a progressive step in controlling the malware menace among computer networks.	cloud computing;cybercrime;entry point;experiment;imperative programming;information security;malware;menace;network security;next-generation network;operating system;threat (computer)	Divyajyoti Das;Somesh Nanda	2013	World Congress on Internet Security (WorldCIS-2013)	10.1109/WorldCIS.2013.6751025	simulation;computer science;distributed computing;computer security	Security	-57.160664935553264	65.8354179049305	93634

It is understood that sharing private data has high potential for facilitating innumerable benefits as well as inviting intended or unintended malicious activities leading to severe privacy breach. Such privacy breach attacks mostly capture sensitive or broadly the anomalous events. Fine grained, high resolution smart meter energy consumption data contains sensitive house hold activity signature. In this paper, we propose a tool called `Sensitivity Inspector' that detects sensitivity in smart meter data and inculcates privacy awareness among smart meter users, presuming private events are related to anomalous or unusual activities. Specifically, we analyze the sensitive content of smart meter data through robust unsupervised statistical method considering user activity as a piece-wise, stationary, stochastic process with associated uncertainty. We show the efficacy of our scheme under relevant statistical and information theoretic measures. We implement our algorithm and compare sensitivity detection capability with related supervised learning based approach and relevant privacy breaching attack like Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM).	algorithm;image resolution;information privacy;information theory;malware;multitier architecture;personally identifiable information;privacy law;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;smart meter;stationary process;stochastic process;supervised learning;unsupervised learning	Arijit Ukil;Soma Bandyopadhyay;Arpan Pal	2014	2014 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912486	data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-55.647024189597275	72.61668816163662	93680

Such functions include, but are not limited to, locking, unlocking, remote start, window closures, and activation of an alarm. As consumers enjoy the remote access and become more comfortable with the remote functions, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have started looking for new features to simplify and reduce the user interface for vehicle access. These new features will provide users with an additional level of comfort without requiring them to touch or press any button on any remote devices to gain access to the vehicle. While this extra level of comfort is a desirable feature, it introduces several security threats against the vehicle's keyless-entry system. This paper describes a number of attacks against the security of keyless-entry systems of vehicles and also presents analyzes of several attacks and compares the vulnerability of the system under different attacks. At the end, some suggestions for improved design are proposed.	dictionary attack;handheld game console;lock (computer science);remote control;user interface	Ansaf Ibrahem Alrabady;Syed Masud Mahmud	2005	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2004.838829	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;authentication;user interface;computer security;computer network	Security	-50.069352650997175	66.09175239556703	93713

Based on well-known technique by Juels et al. called Blocker tag we introduce a set of methods for increasing security using a device called Hedgehog blocker. Hedgehog blocker copes with the problem of the additional information gained by the adversary through measuring signal power (i.e. learning the number of transmitting tags). We claim that although Hedgehog blocker would be more expensive than regular Blocker tags, it provides privacy protection within the context of a more realistic model. On the other hand Hedgehog blocker does not require any powerful devices like Selective jamming due to Rieback et al. We also introduce the ideas called Preventer and Proxy allower that are more demanding in terms of costs and computational power, however assuring nearly perfect protection against an adversary with ability to determine the number of antennas transmitting.	adversary (cryptography);chipless rfid;computation;information-theoretic security;many antennas;paul moskowitz;privacy;proxy server;radio jamming;radio-frequency identification;tag system;transmitter	Przemyslaw Blaskiewicz;Marek Klonowski;Krzysztof Majcher;Piotr Syga	2013	2013 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/CyberC.2013.23	radio-frequency identification;telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;computer security	Security	-49.27181429207796	72.35007100336688	93778

VANETs are considered as the main wireless communication platforms for the intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Service-oriented vehicular networks are special categories for VANETs that support diverse infrastructure-based commercial infotainment services including, for instance, Internet access, real-time traffic monitoring and management, video streaming. Security is a fundamental issue for these service networks due to the relevant business information handled in these networks. In this paper, we design and implement an efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism, called efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network (ELIDV) that aims to protect the network against three kinds of attacks: denial of service (DoS), integrity target, and false alert's generation. ELIDV is based on a set of rules that detects malicious vehicles promptly and with high accuracy. We present the performance analysis of our detection mechanism using NS-3 simulator. Our simulation results show that ELIDV exhibits a high-level security in terms of highly accurate detection rate (detection rate more than 97%), low false positive rate (close to 1%), and exhibits a lower overhead compared to contemporary frameworks.	algorithm;anomaly detection;cryptography;denial-of-service attack;electronic circuit simulation;high- and low-level;hoc (programming language);internet access;intrusion detection system;overhead (computing);real-time clock;real-time transcription;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;streaming media;testbed;vesa bios extensions	Hichem Sedjelmaci;Sidi-Mohammed Senouci;Mosa Ali Abu-Rgheff	2014	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2014.2366120	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;vehicular communication systems;computer security;intrusion prevention system;computer network	Mobile	-61.0396106842565	66.97860085483632	93930

However, generally, the huge number of alerts to analyze and the amount time required to update security rules after analyzing alerts provides time and opportunity for the attacker to inflict damages. Moreover, most of these tools generate positive and negative falses, which may be important to the attacked network. Otherwise, many solutions exist such as IPS, but it shows a great defect due, fundamentally, to false positives. Indeed, attackers often make IPS block a legitimate traffic when they detect its presence in the attacked network.	advanced intelligent tape;apache mina;artificial neural network;block size (cryptography);honeypot (computing);machine learning;neural network software;sensor;software bug;software deployment;web application	Abdeljalil Agnaou;Anas Abou El Kalam;Abdellah Ait Ouahman;Mina De Montfort	2016	CoRR		computer security;software deployment;computer science;honeypot;damages;false positive paradox;vulnerability	Security	-59.959163045632174	64.21044523995819	93968

Traditional controls offer no protection for unclassified information, such as a telephone list of employees that is unrestricted, yet available only to members of the company. On the opposing side of the continuum, organizations such as hospitals that manage highly sensitive information require stricter access control measures. Yet, traditional access control may well have inadvertent consequences in such a context. Often, in unpredictable circumstances, users that are denied access could have prevented a calamity had they been allowed access. It has been proposed that controls such as auditing and accountability policies be enforced to deter rather than prevent unauthorized usage. In dynamic environments preconfigured access control policies may change dramatically depending on the context. Moreover, the cost of implementing and maintaining complex preconfigured access control policies sometimes far outweighs the benefits. This paper considers an adaptation of usage control as a proactive means of deterrence control to protect information that cannot be adequately or reasonably protected by access control. a 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Information trustworthiness is an essential parameter in assessing the information quality. In this paper, we present a trust model to evaluate the trustworthiness of information as well as information publishing entities based on information provenance. In our trust model, decision makers can give an evaluation on the information they receive and further adjust the evaluation result to a more accurate value by considering two factors: information similarity and path difference. We introduce Collusion Attacks that may bias the computation and present a mechanism to detect and reduce the effect of Collusion Attacks. Based on the final adjusted information trust, feedback is given to the information publishing nodes to adaptively update their trust scores. Therefore, our collusion-resistant scheme can dynamically assess the trustworthiness of information as well as participating entities in a network and thus effectively enhance the network security. Detailed analysis of the proposed approach is presented along with simulation results.	computation;entity;information quality;network security;reputation system;simulation;trust (emotion)	Xinlei Wang;Kannan Govindan;Prasant Mohapatra	2011	2011 8th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks	10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984923	security information and event management;computer science;information integration;information filtering system;knowledge engineering;personal information management;management information systems;data mining;accuracy and precision;information quality;internet privacy;computational model;spread spectrum;computer security;correlation;statistics	DB	-60.198937214449444	73.21394673407116	94473

The recipient of the service has no choice but to rely on the reputation of the service provider based on the latter's prior performance. This paper introduces an iterative method for trust and reputation management referred as ITRM. The proposed algorithm can be applied to centralized schemes, in which a central authority collects the reports and forms the reputations of the service providers as well as report/rating trustworthiness of the (service) consumers. The proposed iterative algorithm is inspired by the iterative decoding of low-density parity-check codes over bipartite graphs. The scheme is robust in filtering out the peers who provide unreliable ratings. We provide a detailed evaluation of ITRM via analysis and computer simulations. Further, comparison of ITRM with some well-known reputation management techniques (e.g., Averaging Scheme, Bayesian Approach and Cluster Filtering) indicates the superiority of our scheme both in terms of robustness against attacks (e.g., ballot-stuffing, bad-mouthing) and efficiency. Furthermore, we show that the computational complexity of the proposed ITRM is far less than the Cluster Filtering; which has the closest performance (to ITRM) in terms of resiliency to attacks. Specifically, the complexity of ITRM is linear in the number of clients, while that of the Cluster Filtering is quadratic.	algorithm;belief propagation;centralized computing;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;entity;graph (discrete mathematics);it risk management;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;message passing;reputation management;software propagation;trust (emotion)	Erman Ayday;Hanseung Lee;Faramarz Fekri	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205441	computer simulation;information theory;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;mathematics;distributed computing;iterative method;statistics	Metrics	-60.010117204754096	73.03515325304184	94489

These researches have two critical concerns: secure information gathering and accurate detection method. Here we used system calls together with their arguments as a suitable pattern for describing behavior of each process. In security applications, these patterns must be collected safely, so we proposed SHADuDT, a secure and robust hypervisor-based architecture for system call intercepting and information gathering that utilizes the second generation of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) as intrusion detection method. Generally intrusion detection based on AISs fall into two categories. The first generation of AIS is inspired from adaptive immune reactions but the second one that is called danger theory focuses on both of these reactions to build a more biologicallyrealistic model of Human Immune System. Here we presented a novel Algorithm in Danger Theory field as SHADuDT detection method (SHADuDT_DM) for anomaly detection and utilized hypervisor architecture for SHADuDT secure auditor (SHADuDT_SA) to guarantee the safety of information gathering. We evaluated SHADuDT architecture through several criteria and compared its detection method with classic AIS methods for anomaly detection. These Evaluation results show considerable improvements in terms of detection performance and false alarm rates while keeping low overheads in execution time and memory by using the advantages of both hypervisor technology and Artificial Immune Systems. a 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to their open environment, the P2Ps usually employ reputation systems to provide guidance in selecting trustworthy resource providers for high reliability and security. However, node collusion impairs the effectiveness of reputation systems in trustworthy node selection. Although some reputation systems have certain mechanisms to counter collusion, the effectiveness of the mechanisms is not sufficiently high. In this paper, we leverage social networks to enhance the capability of reputation systems in combating collusion. We first analyzed real trace of the reputation system in the Overstock online auction platform which incorporates a social network. The analysis reveals the important impact of the social network on user purchasing and reputation rating patterns. We thus identified suspicious collusion behavior patterns and propose a social network based mechanism, namely Social Trust, to counter collusion. Social Trust adaptively adjusts the weight of ratings based on the social distance and interest relationship between peers. Experimental results show that Social Trust can significantly strengthen the capability of current reputation systems in combating collusion.	autonomous robot;eigentrust;ibm notes;microsoft research;peer-to-peer;purchasing;reputation system;social network;transaction processing;trustworthy computing	Ze Li;Haiying Shen;Karan Sapra	2011	2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/TC.2012.158	information privacy;computer science;information security;network security;internet privacy;particle detector;computer security;server;computer network;social network	Metrics	-59.684042568688376	72.575355215828	95243
783ec92d53ba7b00096bf002513495b98eb1c2ad	mitigating false negative intruder decisions in wsn-based smart grid monitoring		Monitoring the Smart Grid (SG) is highly desired for critical applications such as power quality assessment and transformer monitoring. Due to their low-cost, flexibility and efficiency as well as their widely usage in several critical infrastructure monitoring applications, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are estimated to be extensively used in SG applications. WSNs-based SG networks are vulnerable to different types of attacks and intruders. In order to operate networks in secured environments, in this paper we analyze our Clustered Hierarchal Hybrid-Intrusion Detection System (CHH-IDS) that is responsible for various attacks injected by known and unknown intruders. As False Positives (FPs) and False Negatives (FNs) are the key performance parameters in IDS, we investigate mitigation of FNs through a two-tier intrusion detection approach, which deals with anomaly and signature detection in parallel. In the presence of such a hybrid mode, utilization proportion between the anomaly detection and signature detection models affect the FN performance. In these two subsystems, Random Forest method is used for signature detection over known attacks and E-DBSCAN (Enhanced Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) method is used for anomaly detection over unknown attacks. Through simulations that run on real datasets, we validate that the higher the weight of anomaly detection subsystem (i.e. the lower the weight of the signature detection subsystem), the lower the FN rates experienced by the entire H-IDS system. More specifically, we show that FN rates can be significantly reduced by 20.4% when the weight on anomaly detection subsystem is increased from 60% to 70% while the accuracy is expected to be improved through signature detection subsystem by using the Random Forest which has higher detection rate than the E-DBSCAN method.	algorithm;anomaly detection;atari dos;dbscan;data mining;electric power quality;intrusion detection system;multitier architecture;negative feedback;random forest;simulation;suicidegirls;transformer	Safa Otoum;Burak Kantarci;H.

The University of Texas at Arlington, 2010 Supervising Professor: Matthew Wright A covert timing channel is a hidden communication channel based on network timing that an attacker can use to sneak secrets out of a secure system. Active covert channels, in which the attacker uses a program to automatically generate innocuous traffic to use as a medium for embedding the covert channel, are especially problematic, as they allow the attacker to output large amounts of secret data. A promising technique for detecting covert timing channels focuses on using entropybased tests. This technique can reliably detect known covert timing channels by using a combination of entropy (EN) and conditional entropy (CE) to detect anomalies in shape and regularity, respectively. The CE test is particularly effective at detecting regularity in active covert channels. In this work, we show that these detection techniques can be defeated by an active covert channel that generates traffic in a purposefully irregular manner. In particular, we propose Mimic, an active covert channel that mimics both the shape and regularity of legitimate traffic to disguise its presence. Mimic includes two modules, a shape modeler and a regularity modeler, for learning about the statistical properties	channel (communications);computer science;conditional entropy;covert channel;entropy (information theory);flaw hypothesis methodology;information security;kush games;mimic;sensor;software developer;surround sound;timing channel;traffic shaping	Kush Kothari;Matthew K.

Most recently, Levy writes, in Becoming Virtual, that “in cyberspace, since any point is directly accessible from any other point, there is an increasing tendency to replace copies of documents with hypertext links. Ultimately, there will only need to be a single physical exemplar of the text” [13 p.61]. Hypertext implies, in theory, the end of ‘the copy’, and the multiplication of access points to the original. But, in practice, the Internet abounds with copying, both large and small scale, both as conscious human practice, and also as autonomous computer function. Effective and cheap data storage that encourages computer users to keep anything of use they have downloaded, lest the links they have found, ‘break’; while browsers don’t ‘browse’ the Internet – they download copies of everything to client machines. Not surprisingly, there is significant regulation against ‘copying’ – regulation that constrains our understanding of ‘copying’ to maintain a legal fiction of the ‘original’ for the purposes of intellectual property protection. In this paper, I will firstly demonstrate, by a series of examples, how ‘copying’ is more than just copyright infringement of music and software, but is a defining, multi-faceted feature of Internet behaviour. I will then argue that the Internet produces an interaction between dematerialised, digital data and human subjectivity and desire that fundamentally challenges notions of originality and copy. Walter Benjamin noted about photography: “one can make any number of prints [from a negative]; to ask for the ‘authentic’ print makes no sense” [4 p.224].

In the method, security cameras, which encrypt the taken images and store them into the memory card inside, are used. Only when crimes occur, the memory cards are taken out from the cameras and the images are decrypted with the key and viewed by the city government and/or the police. When no crimes occur, images are overwritten by the new ones after a week automatically without being viewed by anyone. By using the stand-alone cameras without wiring to the control center, the installation cost and the operation cost are much lower than CCTV cameras. By using image encryption, the privacy of the tourists is protected. Using this system, high density installation of the security cameras with very low cost can be realized in encryption with image encryption privacy protection function.	closed-circuit television;encryption;memory card;privacy;wiring	Vacharee Prashyanusorn;Yusaku Fujii;Somkuan Kaviya;Somsak Mitatha;Preecha P.

For example, firewalls often record thousands of exploit attempts on a daily basis. Network administrators could benefit from information on potential aggressive attack sources, as such information can help to proactively defend their networks. For this purpose, several large-scale information sharing systems have been established, in which information on cyber attacks targeting each participant network is shared such that a network can be forewarned of attacks observed by others. However, the total number of reported attackers is huge in these systems. Thus, a challenging problem is to identify the attackers that are most relevant to each individual network (i.e., most likely to come to that network in the near future). We present a framework to estimate the relevance of each attacker with respect to each network. In particular, we model each attacker’s relevance as a function over the networks. Different attackers have different functions. The distribution of the functions is modeled using a Gaussian process (GP). The relevance function of each attacker is then inferred from the Gaussian process, that itself is learned from the collection of attack information. We test our framework on the attack reports in the DShield information sharing system. Experiments show that attackers found relevant to a network by our framework are indeed more likely to come to that network in the future.	approximation;dshield;experiment;firewall (computing);gaussian process;kriging;network security;relevance	Jian Zhang;Phillip A.

Security is a very important but not well addressed issue in CR networks. In this article we focus on security problems arising from primary user emulation (PUE) attacks in CR networks. We present a comprehensive introduction to PUE attacks, from the attack rationale and its impact on CR networks, to detection and defense approaches. In order to secure CR networks against PUE attacks, a two-level database-assisted detection approach is proposed to detect such attacks. Energy detection and location verification are combined for fast and reliable detection. An admission-control- based defense approach is proposed to mitigate the performance degradation of a CR network under a PUE attack. Illustrative results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detection and defense approaches.	cognitive radio;design rationale;elegant degradation;emulator;power usage effectiveness	Yan Zhang;Yi Liu;Stein Gjessing;Mohsen Guizani	2016	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2016.1200149NM	detector;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;data integration;network security;wireless network;interference;computer security;fingerprint recognition;bandwidth;computer network	Security	-54.45091623788776	72.23754040840198	96145

One critical point regarding security is the exchange of control data over the network. Recently, cryptographic techniques have been developed that can protect the transmitted data against a malicious interference. However, there are security threats which cannot be prevented using cryptographic techniques. Typical representatives are denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, this paper presents a novel, generic approach how such DoS attacks can be prevented or, if prevention is not possible, can be detected at least.	automation;communications protocol;critical point (network science);cryptography;denial-of-service attack;download;embedded system;interference (communication);malware;prototype;simulation	Wolfgang Granzer;Christian Reinisch;Wolfgang Kastner	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation	10.1109/ETFA.2008.4638438	computer science;information security;distributed computing;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	EDA	-58.5931617541044	66.99660336972701	96255

In this paper, we describe our approach to detect misuse of authorizations by insiders based on detection of anomalous user activity. Our system is based on novel machine learning algorithms to build multidimensional user profiles, which are then used to alert administrators upon detection of significant deviation in a useru0027s behavior. Key.components to our profiling are generative models of user activity, which are intended to produce the best probabilistic model to explain observed activity. We have deployed these models on a range of applications such as monitoring access to source code repositories, security subsystem activity in mainframe systems, web application logs, and other proprietary applications. Extensive testing of our system with more than six years of user activity, and multiple red-teaming exercises have enabled us to tune our analytics to produce accurate results with very low false positive rates. Our analytic models are currently in use today to monitor a number of sensitive assets within IBM.		Suresh Chari;Ted Habeck;Ian Molloy;Youngja Park;Josyula R.

In this case, the user must need to memorize many pair of a set of username and password. This one is then to enforce the users using ordinary/same passwords or to keep note of passwords somewhere. It is a problem as a secret of private user information on social life which to generate more crucial problems for a business applications. To get rid of this problem, a single sign on (SSO) is suggested. SSO describing a set of username and password maintain multiply passwords to access for different service providers and applications. In this study, we argued out the prevalent and the current issue of SSO protocols in literature and CAS which is one of the SSO protocols, is used to examine a model of business application.	authentication;business software;password;single sign-on;user (computing)	Halil Arslan;H.

There has been much work in the identification of malicious websites using application layer features based on content (HTML, images, links, etc.) and a plethora of classification techniques. However, there has been little work on using features from the other layers in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network stack. Capturing features from the transport and internet layers of the network stack based on responses to various Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests may allow for increased classification accuracy. In this paper, we use learning techniques (Winnow, Logit Regression, Naïve Bayes, J48, and Bayesian) utilizing these new features to identify fake pharmacy websites. The results show that using transport and Internet layer features yields an accuracy of 80% to 95% for detecting fake websites using standard machine learning algorithms. The results suggest that many organizations may be hosting multiple websites using shared code and hosting services to enable them to produce the maximum number of fraudulent websites.	algorithm;cyber spying;experiment;exploratory testing;html;hypertext transfer protocol;interconnection;logistic regression;machine learning;malware;naive bayes classifier;osi model;phishing;protocol stack;sensor;winnow (algorithm)	Jason Koepke;Siddharth Kaza;Ahmed Abbasi	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics	10.1109/ISI.2012.6284144	web mining;the internet;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-59.899500848969396	66.402448793056	96498

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are centralized in nature where a central node collects data from every node and detects whether any abnormal activity is taking place in the network. In our research we propose to use intelligent mobile agents to detect intrusions in a network. An agent is a piece of program which will execute specified operations on a node in a network. The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions. We have also tested the performance of the prototype by deploying the agents on PlanetLab which is a testbed in the Internet connecting more than 1300 machines all over the world. From our experiments we have observed that the performance of the agent based intrusion detection system depends on the size and topology of the network.	agent-based model;algorithm;centralized computing;experiment;internet;intrusion detection system;mobile agent;node (computer science);planetlab;prototype;simulation;testbed	Shankar M.

In this paper, we characterize the impact of the large scale compromise and coordination of mobile phones in attacks against the core of these networks. Through a combination of measurement, simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the ability of a botnet composed of as few as 11,750 compromised mobile phones to degrade service to area-code sized regions by 93%. As such attacks are accomplished through the execution of network service requests and not a constant stream of phone calls, users are unlikely to be aware of their occurrence. We then investigate a number of significant network bottlenecks, their impact on the density of compromised nodes per base station and how they can be avoided. We conclude by discussing a number of countermeasures that may help to partially mitigate the threats posed by such attacks.	botnet;countermeasure (computer);internet;mobile device;mobile phone;simulation	Patrick Traynor;Michael Lin;Machigar Ongtang;Vikhyath Rao;Trent Jaeger;Patrick D.

16f189b5faaa2d099af325b5f7f523b1336b4933	an anomaly-based intrusion detection system in presence of benign outliers with visualization capabilities		Abstract Abnormal network traffic analysis through Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and visualization techniques has considerably become an important research topic to protect computer networks from intruders. It has been still challenging to design an accurate and a robust IDS with visualization capabilities to discover security threats due to the high volume of network traffic. This research work introduces and describes a novel anomaly-based intrusion detection system in presence of long-range independence data called benign outliers, using a neural projection architecture by a modified Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to not only detect attacks and anomalies accurately, but also provide visualized information and insights to end users. The proposed approach enables better analysis by merging the large amount of network traffic into an easy-to-understand 2D format and a simple user interaction. To show the performance and validate the proposed visualization-based IDS, it has been trained and tested over synthetic and real benchmarking datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, AAGM and VPN-nonVPN) that are widely applied in this domain. The results of the conducted experimental study confirm the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach.	anomaly detection;anomaly-based intrusion detection system	Amin Karami	2018	Expert Syst.

During the process, the unauthenticated BU message may give rise to many security risks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Thus, authentication of the BU message is most important for the security of mobile IPv6. The purpose of cryptographically generated addresses (CGA) is to prevent stealing and spoofing of existent IP addresses. In this paper, a novel authentication mechanism based on CGA is proposed for BU message in mobile IPv6. With the implementation of the novel authentication mechanism, care-of address of MN will be automatically generated, and this will be related to MN private attribute, hence, it would not be possible for a vicious node to steal it. With this method, the BU message can be authenticated.	authentication;care-of address;cryptographically generated address;denial-of-service attack;mobile ip;windows update	Yong Feng;Zhongfu Wu;Jiang Zhong;Chunxiao Ye;Kaigui Wu	2008	2008 International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage	10.1109/NAS.2008.8	computer science;internet privacy;mobile computing;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Mobile	-48.447733805248696	70.80212151871272	96971

Hence, malware writers are taking advantage of this fact to propagate their viral code into OSNs. In recent years, major OSNs, such as Facebook, were extensively under malware attacks. These attacks commonly lead to hundreds of thousands of compromised accounts that may bear personal and even confidential information. In this paper, different types of malware in OSNs are discussed. Then, this paper investigates the attacking vector of the Trojan type malware in OSNs. First, the clustering coefficient which is one of the main OSN graph characteristics is examined through simulation. It is shown that the clustering coefficient has a linear effect on the speed of Trojans. Second, the effect of user behavior is studied using different user reactions to malicious posts. Through simulations, we show that, if Trojans try to deceive users by choosing interesting topics, the speed of propagation will be increased exponentially. This effect raises the significance of giving security knowledge to avoid designated social engineered posts. Finally, we suggest adjustment to the current model for malware propagation in scale-free networks to consider the effect of clustering coefficient and the user behaviors.	clustering coefficient;confidentiality;malware;simulation;software propagation	Mohammad Reza Faghani;Ashraf Matrawy;Chung-Horng Lung	2012	2012 5th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)	10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208767	embedded system;telecommunications;trojan;computer science;operating system;cryptovirology;internet privacy;clickjacking;world wide web;computer security;complex network;computer network	Metrics	-57.600530107460756	62.99483727678817	97071

a88ebfc12728324ecb6f59bffe31d268a28c8efe	self-protection of web content		In most Internet applications, there is little control on how to protect the data content once it reaches the client. Implementing centralized control for data content delivered to the client at the server side is complicated and requires frequent server and client interaction which may influence user experience negatively. This suggests that data contents embedded with self-protecting functions which run independently on the client side may be desirable. In this paper, we propose an approach utilizing existing browser and agent technology to enable content protection function by using agent embedded in the delivered content. We illustrate this approach by using a web mail application, in which the content of the display page is locked up automatically using embedded functionalities in the html page when no activities are detected for a period of time even when server connection is not available.	applet;attachments;autonomous robot;centralized computing;client-side;client–server model;copy protection;embedded system;encryption;html;internet;personalization;plug-in (computing);server (computing);server-side;user experience;web content;webmail	Hoi Chan;Trieu C.

To be well prepared for future attacks, it is not enough to study how to detect and defend against the botnets that have appeared in the past. More importantly, we should study advanced botnet designs that could be developed by botmasters in the near future. In this paper, we present the design of an advanced hybrid peer-to-peer botnet. Compared with current botnets, the proposed botnet is harder to be shut down, monitored, and hijacked. It provides robust network connectivity, individualized encryption and control traffic dispersion, limited botnet exposure by each bot, and easy monitoring and recovery by its botmaster. In the end, we suggest and analyze several possible defenses against this advanced botnet.	botnet;computer;encryption;peer-to-peer	Ping Wang;Sherri Sparks;Cliff Changchun Zou	2007	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2008.35	the internet;srizbi botnet;rustock botnet;computer science;network security;zeroaccess botnet;honeypot;internet privacy;botnet;computer security;encryption;web server;robustness;computer network	Security	-59.01254399821112	66.88549364882091	97552

Such opportunistic attackers aim to execute low-profile, nontargeted, widely applicable data-gathering attacks, such as the silent extraction of user-specific data and authentication credentials. In this article, the authors show that third-party code inclusion is rampant, even in privacy-sensitive applications such as online password managers, thereby potentially exposing the user's most sensitive data to attackers.

However, unrestricted routing policies can adversely impact routing stability. A key concept to understand the interplay between autonomy and expressiveness on one side, and stability on the other side, is safety under filtering, i.e., guaranteed stability under autonomous usage of route filters. BGP route filters are used to selectively advertise specific routes to specific neighbors. In this paper, we provide a characterization of safety under filtering, filling the large gap between previously known necessary and sufficient conditions. Our characterization is based on the absence of a particular kind of dispute wheel, a structure involving circular dependencies among routing preferences. We exploit our result to show that networks admitting multiple stable states are provably unsafe under filtering, and the troublesome portion of the configuration can be pinpointed starting from the stable states alone. This is especially interesting from an operational point of view since networks with multiple stable states actually happen in practice (BGP wedgies). Finally, we show that adding filters to an existing configuration may lead to oscillations even if the configuration is safe under any link failure. Unexpectedly, we find policy configurations where misconfigured filters can do more harm than network faults.	autonomous robot;border gateway protocol;circular dependency;routing	Luca Cittadini;Giuseppe Di Battista;Massimo Rimondini;Stefano Vissicchio	2011	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2011.2106798	static routing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;default-free zone;computer security;computer network	Networks	-57.7632881855053	72.89420077981515	97627
804a9bd47ae3f31a86b4374cb0ebfac39657cb4d	defense against malicious url spreading in micro‐blog network with hub nodes		SummaryrnThe micro-blog network is one of the most popular social networking platforms. By calculating the degree centrality, we found that hub nodes play an important role in micro-blog networks, which is the main power of message forwarding. To improve the security of the micro-blog network, we proposed a defending scheme against malicious Uniform Resource Locator (URL) diffusing in micro-blog networks with hub nodes. After a node found a new malicious URL, it will edit a warning massage about the malicious URL. If the normal node obtains malicious URL warning message, it will send private message with the warning message to the hub node and update its blog article. The malicious URL warning messages spread rapidly in the whole networks in a short period because of the influence of Hub nodes. At the same time, we add the comparison mechanism to reduce the redundancy of spreading the warning message in the networks. So the security of entire micro-blog networks can be improved against malicious URL without increasing the network load. Experiments show that our scheme can effectively defend against the malicious URL in the any scale of micro-blog networks.

01872a71cd5466dcb65df4cbe848eced625528c8	the design of a secure internet gateway		The Internet supports a vast and growing community of computers users around the world. Unfortunately, this network can provide anonymous access to this community by the unscrupulous, careless, or dangerous. On any given Internet there is a certain percentage of poorly-maintained systems. AT&T has a large internal Internet that we wish to protect from outside attacks, while providing useful services between the two. This paper describes our Internet gateway. It is an application-level gateway that passes mail and many of the common Internet services between our internal machines and the Internet. This is accomplished without IP connectivity using a pair of machines: a trusted internal machine and an untrusted external gateway. These are connected by a private link. The internal machine provides a few carefully-guarded services to the external gateway. This configuration helps protect the internal internet even if the external machine is fully compromised.	application-level gateway;computer;gateway (telecommunications);internet	Bill Cheswick	1990			internet layer;business;internet appliance;reserved ip addresses;the internet;internet architecture board;computer network;internet connection sharing;internet transit;h.248	OS	-56.30573390853972	66.91362633315855	97723

In this paper we introduce a new steganographic system: the PadSteg (Padding Steganography). To authors' best knowledge it is the first information hiding solution which represents inter-protocol steganography i.e. usage of relation between two or more protocols from the TCP/IP stack to enable secret communication. PadSteg utilizes ARP and TCP protocols together with an Etherleak vulnerability (improper Ethernet frame padding) to facilitate secret communication for hidden groups in LANs (Local Area Networks). Basing on real network traces we confirm that PadSteg is feasible in today's networks and we estimate what steganographic bandwidth is achievable while limiting the chance of disclosure. We also point at possible countermeasures against PadSteg.	communications protocol;confidentiality;countermeasure (computer);internet protocol suite;network traffic control;spectral leakage;steganalysis;steganography;tracing (software)	Bartosz Jankowski;Wojciech Mazurczyk;Krzysztof Szczypiorski	2010	2010 14th International Telecommunications Network Strategy and Planning Symposium (NETWORKS)		local area network;computer science;information security;network security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Arch	-56.24844525534135	69.48611479825583	97743

The IDSaaS can be roughly classified into two types: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue. In this work, focus on the signature-based IDSaaS, we begin by designing a promising privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism, the main feature of which is that the process of signature matching does not reveal any specific content of network packets by means of a fingerprint-based comparison. We further conduct a study to evaluate this mechanism under a cloud scenario and identify several open problems and issues for designing such a privacy-preserving mechanism for IDSaaS in a practical environment.	anomaly detection;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;cloud computing;fingerprint;information sensitivity;network packet;privacy	Yuxin Meng;Wenjuan Li;Lam-for Kwok;Yang Xiang	2013	2013 5th International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems	10.1109/INCoS.2013.35	intrusion detection system;cloud computing security;digital signature;cloud computing;computer science;network security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-57.9853747637995	65.82085005597244	98171

Cognitive radios arose as a promising solution to the scarcity of spectrum. They are expected to bring evolution to the spectrum scarcity problem through intelligent use of the fallow spectrum bands. However, as cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are wireless in nature, they face new security threats and challenges that have arisen due to their unique cognitive (self-configuration, self-healing, and self-optimization) characteristics. Because of these new security threats, the use of traditional security measures would be inadequate to address the challenges. Consequently, this research paper presents an intrusion detection and response model (IDRM) to enhance security in cognitive radio networks. Intrusion detection monitors all the activities in order to detect intrusions. It searches for security violation incidents, recognizes unauthorized accesses, and identifies information leakages. Unfortunately, system dministrators can neither keep up with the pace at which an intrusion detection system delivers responses and alerts, nor can they react within adequate time limits. Therefore, an automatic response system has to perform these tasks by reacting without human intervention within the cognitive radio network, which is the main goal of this research paper.	cognitive radio;intrusion detection system	Obeten O.

3d3616a9701878acb5e78f71b78b89ce86cfb993	learning to detect and mitigate cross-layer attacks in wireless networks: framework and applications		Security threats such as jamming and route manipulation can have significant consequences on the performance of modern wireless networks. To increase the efficacy and stealthiness of such threats, a number of extremely challenging, next-generation cross-layer attacks have been recently unveiled. Although existing research has thoroughly addressed many single-layer attacks, the problem of detecting and mitigating cross-layer attacks still remains unsolved. For this reason, in this paper we propose a novel framework to analyze and address cross-layer attacks in wireless networks. Specifically, our framework consists of a detection and a mitigation component. The attack detection component is based on a Bayesian learning detection scheme that constructs a model of observed evidence to identify stealthy attack activities. The mitigation component comprises a scheme that achieves the desired trade-off between security and performance. We specialize and evaluate the proposed framework by considering a specific cross-layer attack that uses jamming as an auxiliary tool to achieve route manipulation. Simulations and experimental results obtained with a testbed made up by USRP software-defined radios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.	computer performance;computer simulation;radio jamming;sensor;testbed;universal software radio peripheral	Liyang Zhang;Francesco Restuccia;Tommaso Melodia;Scott M.

Unfortunately, the Internet is facing different level of undesirable connectivity incidents. So, it is imperative to take serious measures in order to increase Internet connectivity resilience. We consider a scenario where a concerned region is facing an undesirable connectivity incident by its primary Internet Service Provider (ISP) which still advertises reachability to the concerned region. Assuming that connectivity to a secondary ISP is available, software is designed to implement different traffic engineering techniques in order to enhance internet connectivity resilience and send the traffic through the secondary ISP. The work is characterized by the implementation of these traffic engineering techniques in the laboratory through a detailed set of experiments.	inter-domain	Amer AlGhadhban;Ashraf S.

17811168ac3b2168e39c90cef45ee53571ed68dc	revisiting client puzzles for state exhaustion attacks resilience		In this paper, we address the challenges facing the adoption of client puzzles as means to protect the TCP connection establishment channel from state exhaustion DDoS attacks. We model the problem of selecting the puzzle difficulties as a Stackelberg game with the server as the leader and the clients as the followers and obtain the equilibrium solution for the puzzle difficulty. We then present an implementation of client puzzles inside the TCP stack of the Linux 4.13.0 kernel. We evaluate the performance of our implementation and the obtained solution against a range of attacks through experiments on the DETER testbed. Our results show that client puzzles are effective at boosting the tolerance of the TCP handshake channel to state exhaustion DDoS attacks by rate limiting the flood rate of malicious attackers while allocating resources for legitimate clients.

While this makes DTLS an ideal solution for IoT, the associated computational cost makes software-only implementations prohibitively expensive for resource-constrained embedded devices. We address this challenge through three key contributions: reconfigurable cryptographic accelerators enable two orders of magnitude energy savings, a dedicated DTLS engine offloads control flow to hardware reducing program code and memory usage by ∼10x, and an on-chip RISC-V core exercises the flexibility of the cryptographic accelerators to demonstrate security applications beyond DTLS.	algorithmic efficiency;confidentiality;control flow;cryptography;datagram transport layer security;embedded system;malware;mutual authentication;risc-v	Utsav Banerjee;Chiraag Juvekar;Andrew Wright;Arvind;Anantha Chandrakasan	2018	2018 IEEE International Solid - State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2018.8310174	datagram transport layer security;computer security;computer science;cryptographic protocol;elliptic curve cryptography;embedded system;cryptography;efficient energy use;end-to-end principle;cloud computing;authentication	Arch	-50.608766223728054	73.83346931049522	99011
d59694a277deeb3ea5b4191b21a93b8de24c0f62	a secure low-cost edge device authentication scheme for the internet of things		"""Because of the enhanced capability of adversaries, edge devices of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure are now increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting and piracy. Ensuring the authenticity of such devices is of great concern since an adversary can create a backdoor either to bypass the security, and/or to leak secret information over an unsecured communication channel. The reliability of such devices could also be called into question because they might be counterfeit, defective and/or of inferior quality. It is of prime importance to design and develop solutions for authenticating such edge devices. In this paper, we present a novel low-cost solution for authenticating edge devices. We use SRAM based PUF to generate unique """"digital fingerprints"""" for every device, which can be used to generate a unique device ID. We propose a novel ID matching scheme to verify the identity of an edge device even though the PUF is extremely unreliable. We show that the probability of impersonating an ID by an adversary is extremely low. In addition, our proposed solution is resistant to various known attacks."""	adversary (cryptography);authentication;backdoor (computing);care-of address;channel (communications);communications protocol;cryptographic hash function;cryptography;edge device;elegant degradation;encryption;fingerprint;hamming distance;heart rate variability;internet of things;on-board data handling;static random-access memory	Ujjwal Guin;Adit D.

In this paper, we present an alarm behavior analysis and discovery system, AABD, that establishes flapping and parent–child (P–C) rules to reveal the operation patterns from a large number of alarms in telecom networks. These rules can be exploited to filter out unimportant alarms, conduct multi-dimensional analysis of the alarms and identify potential network problems. We propose two novel and effective algorithms to establish the flapping rules and P-C rules. The proposed system is validated using alarm datasets from five Internet service providers. Specifically, we verify the system and methodology in each of the five network domains, i.e., circuit-switched network (CS), packet-switched network (PS), 2G-radio access network (RAN-2G), 3G-radio access network (RAN-3G) and 4G-radio access network (RAN-4G), as these five domains can, to a great extent, form a complete network environment. More importantly, our system can establish a small number of rules, only dozens of flapping rules and P-C rules, and compress the alarms by approximately 84%, i.e., 84% of alarms will not be sent to the network operator. To summarize, the proposed system can help network operators respond to network faults in a timely fashion, locate the faults accurately and significantly reduce the time spent on these tasks.

45e346772337c5f3cdb8d23985b7554f00ab52de	explore recurrent neural network for pue attack detection in practical crn models		The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoTs) and pervasive use of many different types of mobile computing devices make wireless communication spectrum a precious resource. In order to accommodate the still fast increasing number of devices requesting wireless connection, more efficient, finegrained spectrum allocation and sharing schemes are badly in need. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been widely recognized as one promising solution, in which the secondary users (SUs) are allowed to share channels with licensed primary users (PUs) as long as bringing no interference to the normal operations of the PUs. However, malicious attackers or selfish SUs may mimic the behavior of PUs to occupy the channels illegally. It is nontrivial to accurately, timely detect such kind of primary user emulation (PUE) attacks. In this paper, an efficient PUE attacked detection method is introduced leveraging the recurrent neural network (RNN). After a fundamental algorithm using basic RNN, an advanced version taking advantage of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) is proposed, which is more efficient on processing time series with long term memory. The experimental study has provided deeper insights about the different performances the RNNs achieved and validated the effectiveness of the proposed detectors.	algorithm;anomaly detection;artificial neural network;cognitive radio;emulator;entity–relationship model;experiment;frequency allocation;gradient;ibm notes;interference (communication);internet of things;layer (electronics);long short-term memory;malware;mobile computing;performance;power usage effectiveness;random neural network;recurrent neural network;sensor;software propagation;time series	Qi Dong;Yu Chen;Xiaohua Li;Kai Zeng	2018	CoRR		computer network;wireless sensor network;wireless network;distributed computing;wireless;frequency allocation;cognitive radio;computer science;mobile computing;recurrent neural network;emulation	Security	-54.83123847568664	72.03167547867642	99390
06c9c212751c3c10a99363640eb0ca6f13006853	abusing public third-party services for edos attacks		Cloud computing has been widely adopted nowadays as it provides economical, elastic and scalable services to customers. The cloud resources are offered in an ondemand manner and the consumers are charged based on their resource usage, known as “pay-as-you-go”. Such a cloud utility scheme opens the door to Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks in which the cloud consumers would suffer from financial losses. In this paper, we uncover the severity of EDoS attacks through demonstrating that EDoS attacks can be easily conducted at very low costs. In specific, we show that attackers can launch amplification attacks against the cloud consumers by abusing the free public third-party services provided by the Internet giants such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and LinkedIn. Through studying the characteristics of 10 main public third-party services, we reveal that all of them can be abused to launch EDoS attacks and the amplification factor can reach up to 135K. To combat against the uncovered attacks, we propose several mitigation strategies for the third-party service providers as well as the cloud consumers.	cloud computing;denial-of-service attack;scalability	Huangxin Wang;Zhonghua Xi;Fei Li;Songqing Chen	2016			advertising;business;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-55.159947235579196	62.357759331809866	99456

In this paper we introduce a network science based framework which conducts incident analysis on a dataset by constructing and analyzing relational communities. Construction of these communities is based on the connections of topological features formed when actors communicate with each other. We evaluate our framework using a network trace of the Black Energy malware network, captured by our honey net. We have found that our approach is accurate, efficient, and could prove as a viable alternative to the current status quo.	interaction;malware;network science;network security;software agent	Napoleon Paxton;Dae-il Jang;Stephen Russell;Gail-Joon Ahn;Ira S.

Anonymizing networks are then poised to become an important service to support anonymous-driven Internet communications and consequently enhance users' privacy protection. Indeed, Tor an example of anonymizing networks based on onion routing concept attracts more and more volunteers, and is now popular among dozens of thousands of Internet users. Surprisingly, very few researches shed light on such an anonymizing network. Beyond providing global statistics on the typical usage of Tor in the wild, we show that Tor is actually being is-used, as most of the observed traffic belongs to P2P applications. In particular, we quantify the BitTorrent traffic and show that the load of the latter on the Tor network is underestimated because of encrypted BitTorrent traffic (that can go unnoticed). Furthermore, this paper provides a deep analysis of both the HTTP and BitTorrent protocols giving a complete overview of their usage. We do not only report such usage in terms of traffic size and number of connections but also depict how users behave on top of Tor. We also show that Tor usage is now diverted from the onion routing concept and that Tor exit nodes are frequently used as 1-hop SOCKS proxies, through a so-called tunneling technique. We provide an efficient method allowing an exit node to detect such an abnormal usage. Finally, we report our experience in effectively crawling bridge nodes, supposedly revealed sparingly in Tor.	bittorrent protocol encryption;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;internet;network packet;peer-to-peer;privacy;routing;socks;semantic network;software deployment;tor messenger;tunneling protocol	Chaabane Abdelberi;Pere Manils;Mohamed Ali Kâafar	2010	2010 Fourth International Conference on Network and System Security	10.1109/NSS.2010.47	bittorrent;computer science;cryptography;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-57.31100318486264	67.97602359090655	100374

21b9751272ce02a93ff6a59e0972d4f366ba9602	a safe tcl toolkit for electronic meeting places.		Electronic commerce needs electronic meeting places to conduct business. To be useful, such meeting places must be safe for all participants and for hosts (owners of places). In this paper we discuss safety issues for participants and hosts. We then describe a system we are building, Safe Tcl, that will allow the construction of electronic meeting places with a range of safety properties. Safe Tcl has two attractive properties. First, it uses a simple security model based on ``padded cells’’ that allows participants to coexist and interact safely. Second, Tcl makes it easy to integrate the numerous facilities required in an electronic meeting place such as integrity verification and authentication. 1 The Problem Of Safety Electronic commerce, like human commerce, needs “safe places” where participants can meet to conduct business. The safety of a place can be measured by e.g.: Whether the host is protected against malicious or erroneous actions of individual participants. Whether participants are protected from each others’ malicious or erroneous actions, and whether participants can be coerced by other participants to release, against their free will or without their knowledge and agreement, valued resources they carry with them (including information). Whether participants are protected from the actions of the host, both malicious and erroneous. Tools for constructing safe meeting places for electronic commerce will become increasingly important as electronic commerce becomes more widely used. We believe that the basic security mechanisms for privacy, authentication, integrity checking and non-repudiation are relatively well understood. However, how to combine these mechanisms into higher level policies is less clear. Therefore, at this stage it is useful to create tools that allow experimentation and rapid prototyping as well as the construction and deployment of completed electronic commerce systems. Experience from human based commerce systems may be a useful guide in constructing electronic meeting and in choosing which tools to provide. We show how each safety problem identified above can be addressed in a computational context by drawing parallels from current common practice. Currently, the human host and participants are protected from malicious intent of a participant by ensuring that no coercion tools (weapons etc.) are brought into the meeting place. Without a means for coercion there is no way for one participant to force another participant to release valued resources (such as the $1 million they are carrying in a briefcase) or information they own. Also, without means for coercion, there is no way for one participant to coerce the host to deny service or subvert its service to another participant. The equivalent in computational systems is to place each participant (or group of mutually trusting participants) in a separate environment (``padded cell’’), thus restricting their ability to manipulate the state of other participants or the host. Functionality in an environment is restricted to remove any method for a participant inside the environment to harm another participant outside the environment. To enable communication between participants, environments are extended with controlled communication channels that only allow legitimate communication. Protecting a human participant from the host is currently achieved through insurance and liability based mechanisms. Upon entry into a meeting place the participant is at risk of being coerced by the owner of the place to divulge information or to part with valued resources. These risks can be ameliorated by insurance or liability shifting arrangements, or by bonding. Similar mechanisms can be implemented in an electronic commerce system: a third party can offer insurance covering aspects of electronic business such as compromise of a transaction or participant owned resources by a host. Since these mechanisms are based on authentication, integrity checking and privacy, a system that provides access to these building blocks suffices.	authentication;coexist (image);computation;e-commerce;electronic business;fail-safe;malware;multi-level governance;non-repudiation;parallels desktop for mac;privacy;rapid prototyping;software deployment;tcl;trust (emotion)	Jacob Y.

Typically, their use is appropriate when encryption is not available or not adequate (e.g. when available cryptography is too weak), or simply when it is convenient that no external observer can infer that some information is being exchanged. In the digital era, new cover mediums for hiding data in communication are constantly being proposed, fromthe classical image files (such as bmp, gif, and jpg formats) to audio files (i.e. wav and mp3), text and html documents, emails disguised as spam, TCP/IP packets, executables programs, DNA strands, etc. In this work, we present and analyze a novel methodology that illustrates how games (such as Chess, Backgammon, Go, etc.) can be used to hide digital contents. We also look at some of its possible advantages and limitations when compared with other techniques, discussing some improvements and extensions. Finally, we present the results of a first implementation of an open-source prototype, called STEGOGO, for hiding digital contents in Go games. a 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

c9b2ef1ebc2c967331462c177e1ea234383fb719	new privacy threat on 3g, 4g, and upcoming 5g aka protocols		Mobile communications are used by more than two thirds of the world population who expect security and privacy guarantees. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) responsible for the worldwide standardization of mobile communication has designed and mandated the use of the AKA protocol to protect the subscribers’ mobile services. Even though privacy was a requirement, numerous subscriber location attacks have been demonstrated against AKA, some of which have been fixed or mitigated in the enhanced AKA protocol designed for 5G. In this paper, we reveal a new privacy attack against all variants of the AKA protocol, including 5G AKA, that breaches subscriber privacy more severely than known location privacy attacks do. Our attack exploits a new logical vulnerability we uncovered that would require dedicated fixes. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of our attack using low cost and widely available setups. Finally we conduct a security analysis of the vulnerability and discuss countermeasures to remedy our attack.	broussonetia papyrifera;protocols documentation	Ravishankar Borgaonkar;Lucca Hirschi;S.

1e3017ce689c440653ab163d6938327789664dee	don't steal my drone: catching attackers with an unmanned aerial vehicle honeypot		The increased utilization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in both personal as well as commercial and public safety scenarios has also opened the door to adversaries. In more details, such malicious activities may include the hijacking of the UAV (and its cargo), the theft of private information stored in the device, etc. In this paper, we introduce the idea of a honeypot that is specifically designed for the protection of UAVs. The honeypot, which is also capable of running on small portable devices, e.g., a Raspberry Pi, emulates a number of UAV-specific and UAV-tailored protocols, making it possible to lure adversaries into attacking it. Our system can assist into detecting active attackers in a certain area as well as into shedding light into the adversaries' techniques for compromising UAVs.

e3cf85efd1a92fbadbe547b7e317101cef116176	multilevel analysis to detect covert social botnet in multimedia social networks		In recent years, social botnets have become a major security threat to both online social networking websites and their users. Social bots communicate over probabilistically unobservable communication channels and steal sensitive information from its victims. Stegobot is a social botnet which uses image steganography to hide the presence of communication. Since these botnets exhibit unique propagation methods, existing botnet detection techniques cannot identify these bots. In this paper, we propose an effective method to detect Stegobot hosts within a monitored social network. Based on the observations, Stegobot often has a differentiable communication pattern because of the unique design and implementation. Hence by investigating each host profile activity, it is possible to determine whether the profile is a Stegobot or normal. Our experiments show that the traffic patterns among Stegobot and normal traffic can be classified efficiently using multilevel social network profile analysis. In addition to the ability to detect bot traffic, a classification model is constructed using profile level and content level analysis to improve the detection ability. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect Stegobot profiles with more than 97% accuracy and false-positive rate lower than 3%.	botnet;effective method;experiment;information sensitivity;multilevel model;social engineering (security);social network;software propagation;steganography	V.

Wireless mediums represent the backbone of communications in the smart grid especially for Home Area Networks (HAN). Increased connectivity brings about an inheritance of vulnerabilities associated with wireless networks. In particular, spoofing attacks poses an immediate threat to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). In this study, an intrusion detection system (IDS) algorithm is proposed in which received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is analyzed by means of cosine similarity and data sectoring to detect spoofing attacks in smart grid 802.11 HANs.

a1fdd44a1c90dd2ad6d08c5560116f5cb3e74857	differentially private recommendation system based on community detection in social network applications		The recommender system is mainly used in the e-commerce platform. With the development of the Internet, social networks and e-commerce networks have broken each other’s boundaries. Users also post information about their favorite movies or books on social networks. With the enhancement of people’s privacy awareness, the personal information of many users released publicly is limited. In the absence of items rating and knowing some user information, we propose a novel recommendation method. This method provides a list of recommendations for target attributes based on community detection and known user attributes and links. Considering the recommendation list and published user information that may be exploited by the attacker to infer other sensitive information of users and threaten users’ privacy, we propose the CDAI (Infer Attributes based on Community Detection) method, which finds a balance between utility and privacy and provides users with safer recommendations.

Cryptographic keys have been used as a primary technique for securing wireless networks but are not completely secure. The symmetric keys used for cryptographic purposes are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and brute force attacks. More recently, PHY-layer based techniques have gained significant attention, where the principle of channel reciprocity and the natural randomness of the measured wireless channel to generate secret keys is leveraged. Although, PHY-layer secret key generation has been investigated and presented in the literature before, there has been a lack of discussion in terms of obtaining symmetric keys on both ends of the link. In this work, we present a novel PHY-layer secret key generation technique that aims for symmetric encryption keys while limiting the information leaked to an eavesdropper to ensure complete secrecy and to prevent potential intelligent attacks. Our algorithm utilizes forward and backward channel state information in a given wireless link and combats the minute differences observed in these pairs by generating channel trend information. We demonstrate our technique using experimental results from a realtime SDR testbed connected to a wireless channel emulator. Our results indicate that the algorithm is successful in generating symmetric keys under various wireless environments without revealing any information pertaining to the key via the open wireless channel. Our secret key extraction rate can reach values in excess of 17.3 Kbps.	brute-force search;channel state information;cryptography;data rate units;etsi satellite digital radio;emulator;encryption;information sensitivity;key (cryptography);key generation;man-in-the-middle attack;offset binary;phy (chip);randomness;symmetric-key algorithm;testbed	Cem Sahin;Brandon Katz;Kapil R.

Also, in the viewpoint of security, encryption of energy harvesters used in IoT system is required. On the other hand, in recent years, side-channel analysis (SCA) revealing the secret key stored in energy harvesters has been proposed. To secure the IoT system in the future, countermeasures against SCA for energy harvesters are very important; however, they have not been studied. Therefore, this study proposes a new shuffling based countermeasure against SCA for energy harvesters. Experiments using an actual energy harvester show the validity of the proposed method.

2d5b20bb0741bda90abaa6c2a7b4ac3b1403d233	the case for a general and interaction-based third-party cookie policy		The privacy implications of third-party tracking is a well-studied problem. Recent research has shown that besides data aggregators and behavioral advertisers, online social networks also act as trackers via social widgets. Existing cookie policies are not enough to solve these problems, pushing users to employ blacklist-based browser extensions to prevent such tracking. Unfortunately, such approaches require maintaining and distributing blacklists, which are often too general and adversely affect non-tracking services for advertisements and analytics. In this paper, we propose and advocate for a general third-party cookie policy that prevents third-party tracking with cookies and preserves the functionality of social widgets without requiring a blacklist and adversely affecting non-tracking services. We implemented a proof-of-concept of our policy as browser extensions for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. To date, our extensions have been downloaded about 11.8K times and have over 2.8K daily users combined.	browser extension;data aggregation;firefox;google chrome;http cookie;social network;the daily wtf	Istemi Ekin Akkus;Nicholas Weaver	2015	CoRR		internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-54.68864698895199	60.750657201652984	102221

For example, popular services like load balancers and Content Delivery Networks heavily rely on DNS. Because of its important role, DNS is also a desirable target for malicious activities such as spamming, phishing, and botnets. To protect networks against these attacks, a number of DNS-based security approaches have been proposed. The key insight of our study is to measure the effectiveness of security approaches that rely on DNS in large-scale networks. For this purpose, we answer the following questions, How often is DNS used? Are most of the Internet flows established after contacting DNS? In this study, we collected data from the University of Auckland campus network with more than 33,000 Internet users and processed it to find out how DNS is being used. Moreover, we studied the flows that were established with and without contacting DNS. Our results show that less than 5 percent of the observed flows use DNS. Therefore, we argue that those security approaches that solely depend on DNS are not sufficient to protect large-scale networks.	botnet;content delivery network;internet;load balancing (computing);phishing;server (computing);spamming;webrtc	Maziar Janbeglou;Habib Naderi;Nevil Brownlee	2014	2014 28th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2014.87	dns hijacking;round-robin dns;computer science;dns spoofing;split-brain;internet privacy;computer security;domain name system;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-59.139671014850826	67.22247591864767	102402

The timed FSM, called the JiNao Finite State Machine (JFSM) is extended from the conventional FSM with timed states, multiple timers, and time constraints on state transitions. The JFSM is implemented as a generator that can create and FSM by constructing the configuration file only. The results show that this approach is very effective for detecting real-time intrusions. Our approach can be extended for use in other network protocol intrusion-detection systems, especially for those with known attacks.	communications protocol;dynamic dispatch;finite-state machine;intrusion detection system;link-state routing protocol;parsing;pattern matching;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sensor;service layer;timer	Ho-Yen Chang;Shyhtsun Felix Wu;Y.

CINDAM achieves this deception without affecting network operations and without modifying client and server software.

Different security problems result in different requirements to the design of trust management, and the existing attacks in trust management for security are yet to be solved. In this paper, we first propose a framework to classify desired properties of trust management for each type of security problems. We then investigate typical representative attacks and existing solutions in trust management for security. By considering both these security properties and attacks on trust management systems, our work serves to propel the design of more effective and robust trust management systems for security.	access control;authentication;formal verification;privacy;propel;requirement;routing;trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Dongxia Wang;Tim Muller;Yang Liu;Jie Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2014.65	computer security model;cloud computing security;security through obscurity;security information and event management;security convergence;trust anchor;security service;business;internet privacy;security analysis;security testing;computer security;computational trust;computer network	Security	-48.826311572032175	61.35446818717417	103245

We develop machine learning models to detect information exfiltration from compromised machines and the establishment of command & control (C&C) servers via tunneling. We validate our approach by experiments where we successfully detect a malware used in several recent Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks [1].

PPM is a technique that seeks to identify the source of such attacks by marking individual packets with portion of the attack path, and then relies on the volume of attack traffic generated to ensure that the whole path can be reconstructed. However, modifying the identification field in the IPv4 packet header to mark packet incurs backward incompatibility for IP fragmented packets. In this paper, we address this issue and analyze the viability of PPM under the next-generation Internet Protocol, IPv6. In doing so, we consider the flaws inherent to IPv4 implementations that limit their backward compatibility, and demonstrate how these shortcomings can be avoided in IPv6. We show that the Flow Label field in the IPv6 datagram header can be safely and effectively overloaded to implement PPM schemes, and present simulation results verifying the applicability and efficiency of this approach. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Identity theft threatens various demographics, but some age groups, e.g., senior citizens, are particularly vulnerable. In this paper, we study how identity theft puts different personally identifiable information (PII) assets at risk of exposure, and how this risk changes throughout one's lifecycle. We categorize PII assets, introducing a fourth novel category, measure their exposure risk using the Identity Theft Assessment and Prediction (ITAP) repository of over 3,000 identity theft cases, and track the risk change throughout an individual's lifecycle. We introduce the concept of PII Balance Sheets, and finally, we present a free publicly available Android app that demonstrates our research results. This app not only educates individuals and highlights their vulnerable identity assets, but also is useful when they make the decision of whether or not to share their personally identifiable information.	categorization;digital identity;itap;personally identifiable information	Razieh Nokhbeh Zaeem;Monisha Manoharan;K.

The ever increasing number of successful attacks indicates that classical network protection solutions (firewalls, Intrusion Detections Systems, proxies etc.) are no longer sufficient. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new system that combines multiples approaches using advanced aggregation techniques to achieve a better detection performance. We also test the system on real data from a small corporate network, and show that our system is able to attain a high probability of detection to probability of false alarm ratio.	algorithm;firewall (computing);machine learning;multi-agent system;sensor	Wim Mees;Thibault Debatty	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops	10.1109/ISSREW.2014.86	engineering;operating system;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Arch	-61.15950616786729	67.35697941578313	103942

And, because zero-day worms require only seconds to launch flooding attacks on your servers, using traditional methodssuch as manually creating and storing signatures to defend against these threats is just too slow.Bringing together critical knowledge and research on the subject, Automatic Defense Against Zero-day Polymorphic Worms in Communication Networks details a new approach for generating automated signatures for unknown polymorphic worms. It presents experimental results on a new method for polymorphic worm detection and examines experimental implementation of signature-generation algorithms and double-honeynet systems.If you need some background, the book includes an overview of the fundamental terms and concepts in network security, including the various security models. Clearing up the misconceptions about the value of honeypots, it explains how they can be useful in securing your networks, and identifies open-source tools you can use to create your own honeypot. Theres also a chapter with references to helpful reading resources on automated signature generation systems.The authors describe cutting-edge attack detection approaches and detail new algorithms to help you generate your own automated signatures for polymorphic worms. Explaining how to test the quality of your generated signatures, the text will help you develop the understanding required to effectively protect your communication networks.

However, we show in this paper that more robust and stealthy network covert channels can be devised by exploiting the relationship of the network objects. In particular, we propose a combinatorial approach for devising a wide spectrum of covert channels which can meet different objectives based on the channel capacity and channel undetectability. To illustrate the approach, we design WebLeaks and ACKLeaks, two novel covert channels which can leak information through the data and acknowledgment traffic in a web session. We implement both channels and deploy them on the PlanetLab nodes for evaluation. Besides the channel capacity, we apply the state-of-the-art detection schemes to evaluate their camouflage capability. The experiment results show that their capacity can be boosted up by our combinatorial approach, and at the same time they can effectively evade the detection.	acknowledgment index;algorithm;channel capacity;covert channel;experiment;network packet;planetlab	Xiapu Luo;Peng Zhou;Edmond W.

The observation is that network protocols often have short meaningful status codes saved at the beginning of server responses upon client requests. A successful intrusion that alters the behavior of a network application server often results in an unexpected server response, which does not contain the valid protocol status code. This can be used to verify the result of the intrusion attempt. We then extend this method to verify the result of attacks that still generate valid protocol status code in the server responses. We evaluate this approach by augmenting Snort signatures and testing on real world data. We show that some simple changes to Snort signatures can effectively verify the result of attacks against the application servers, thus significantly improve the quality of alerts	anomaly detection;antivirus software;application server;apply;bro;code;communications protocol;data breach;experiment;hypertext transfer protocol;intrusion detection system;lightweight protocol;list of http status codes;online and offline;server (computing);snort	Jingmin Zhou;Adam J.

The classic way to identify flows, i.e. looking at port numbers, is not effective anymore. On the other hand, state-of-the-art techniques cannot determine the application before the end of the TCP flow. In this editorial, we propose a technique that relies on the observation of the first five packets of a TCP connection to identify the application. This result opens a range of new possibilities for online traffic classification.	network security;on the fly;traffic classification	Laurent Bernaille;Renata Teixeira;Ismael Akodkenou;Augustin Soule;Kavé Salamatian	2006	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/1129582.1129589	traffic generation model;simulation;traffic classification;computer science;network security;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-60.79277049828941	66.92141064209198	104354

The main purpose of IPID is to recover from IP fragmentation. To the best of our knowledge, most existing IPID based information hiding methods assume that the IPID number is a pseudo random number, which is found to be false. In this paper, we propose a steganographic method by exploiting the IPID field while considering the information from the user data field. First, we analyze the IPID distribution of various operating systems. Subsequently, we put forward a simple data embedding method, which is then refined to mimic the ordinary IPID traffic. Experiments are carried out and the results empirically prove that the proposed method is of high undetectability as compared to the existing IPID based steganographic methods.	steganography	Osamah Ibrahiem Abdullaziz;Vik Tor Goh;Huo-Chong Ling;KokSheik Wong	2016	J.

The security of these questions has received limited formal scrutiny, almost all of which predates webmail. We ran a user study to measure the reliability and security of the questions used by all four webmail providers. We asked participants to answer these questions and then asked their acquaintances to guess their answers. Acquaintances with whom participants reported being unwilling to share their webmail passwords were able to guess 17% of their answers. Participants forgot 20% of their own answers within six months. What's more, 13% of answers could be guessed within five attempts by guessing the most popular answers of other participants, though this weakness is partially attributable to the geographic homogeneity of our participant pool.	authentication;backup;geographic information system;outlook.com;password;software deployment;usability testing;webmail	Stuart E.

In particular, the adopted security protection mechanisms often depend on the node state, location, and/or surrounding risk, which need the capability of context-aware security quantification. This paper views the security level as a user's inherent property that is only correlated with the user's behaviours and the situated context and independent of the suffered attack ways. We propose a formalized methodology to especially quantify the security level in real time from the perspective of state transition probability through estimating the stable probability of staying in the security state in inhomogeneous continuous time Markov chain. This paradigm enables users to customize the security protection mechanisms for adapting to the frequently varying context. We conduct the extensive numerical calculations and empirical analysis to comprehensively investigate the response of the proposed security quantification framework to the various combinations of the concerned parameters, e.g., SNR, velocity, and traffic flow. The results show that the proposed framework is capable of capturing the real-time security level adaptively to the vehicular context and provides a dependable decision basis to security protection, which can restrict the security to a target value.	computational hardness assumption;context awareness;hoc (programming language);markov chain;numerical analysis;programming paradigm;protection mechanism;real-time clock;signal-to-noise ratio;situated;velocity (software development)	X.

New countermeasures are necessary, aimed at guaranteeing an early and reliable identification of the compromised network nodes (the botnet). In this work we introduce a formal model for the aforementioned class of attacks, and we devise an inference algorithm that estimates the botnet hidden in the network, converging to the true solution as time progresses. Notably, the analysis is validated over real network traces.	botnet;denial-of-service attack;formal language;randomized algorithm;tracing (software)	Vincenzo Matta;Mario Di Mauro;Maurizio Longo	2016	2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760651	computer science;internet privacy;botnet;world wide web;computer security	Security	-60.40955169805973	65.23584160402295	104601

So far, high usability and dynamic key management with the capability of perfect forward secrecy are very difficult to achieve for wireless devices which have to operate under strict resource constraints. Additionally, previous work has failed to address hybrid systems composed of physical layer security (PHYSEC) and asymmetric cryptography for key establishment. In this work we present the first hybrid system architecture suitable for resource-constrained platforms. As a result, long term deployment due to key diversity and forward/backward secrecy can be achieved while still satisfying the tight timing of an initial setup imposed by high user acceptance. Our design strongly focuses on reusing communication chip components for PHYSEC and makes use of efficient asymmetric cryptography (e.g., ECDH) augmented by physical layer security. Our prototype implementation demonstrates that our approach has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of securing small embedded devices for the Internet of Things, and hence make mass production and deployment viable.	embedded system;forward secrecy;hybrid system;internet of things;key exchange;key management;peer-to-peer;prototype;public-key cryptography;software deployment;systems architecture;usability	Christian T.

Red team/blue team exercises are an invaluable mechanism for security testing. They partition researchers into two competing teams of attackers and defenders, enabling them to create challenging and realistic test scenarios. While such exercises provide valuable insight into vulnerabilities of security systems, they are very expensive and thus rarely performed. In this paper we describe a red team/blue team exercise, sponsored by DARPA's FTN program, and performed October 2002 --- May 2003. The goal of the exercise was to evaluate a collaborative DDoS defense, comprised of a distributed system, COSSACK, and a stand-alone defense, D-WARD. The role of the blue team was played by developers of the tested systems from USC/ISI and UCLA, the red team included researchers from Sandia National Laboratory, and all the coordination, experiment execution, result collection and analysis was performed by the white team from BBN Technologies. This exercise was of immense value to all involved --- it uncovered significant vulnerabilities in tested systems, pointed out desirable characteristics in DDoS defense systems (e.g., avoiding reliance on timing mechanisms), and taught us many lessons about testing of DDoS defenses.	acknowledgement (data networks);aggregate data;baseline (configuration management);conn;denial-of-service attack;distributed computing;hypertext transfer protocol;information sciences institute;security testing;snort;spoofing attack;vulnerability (computing)	Jelena Mirkovic;Peter L.

Expanding impact of cyber attacks aimed at a variety of resources information system initiates creation of special countermeasures that can be effective in the emergence of new types of threats from unknown or ill-defined properties. There are enough effective developments, are used to solve problems of cyber attacks identification, for example, the method of linguistic etalons formation for the detection of intrusion systems, which does not disclose the mechanism of the formation of etalons settings for sniffing attacks. In this work, was developed etalons model of linguistic variables to detect sniffing attacks, which is due to assess the state of the information system and the process of forming the parameters of etalons will allow to formalize the process of obtaining the parameters of etalons for a given linguistic variables in specific environment in solving attacks detection tasks on computer systems.	emergence;information system;malware;packet analyzer	Mikolaj Karpinski;Anna Korchenko;Pavlo Vikulov;Roman V.

Given the evolution of the structures and protocols botnets use, many machine learning approaches have been proposed for botnet analysis and detection. In the literature, intrusion and anomaly detection systems based on unsupervised learning techniques showed promising performances. In this paper, we investigate the capability of employing the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), an unsupervised learning technique as a data analytics system. In doing so, our aim is to understand how far such an approach could be pushed to analyze unknown traffic to detect botnets. To this end, we employed three different unsupervised training schemes using publicly available botnet data sets. Our results show that SOMs possess high potential as a data analytics tool on unknown traffic. They can identify the botnet and normal flows with high confidence approximately 99% of the time on the data sets employed in this work.	anomaly detection;botnet;computer security;machine learning;malware;network traffic control;performance;programming paradigm;self-organizing map;sensor;traffic analysis;unsupervised learning	Duc Canh Le;A.

Moreover, at the time of the earthquake, telephone and Internet could not be used in many cases, although Twitter was still available. In an emergency, such as an earthquake, users take an interest in the network condition and provide information on networks proactively through social media. Therefore, the collective intelligence of Twitter is suitable as a means of information detection complementary to conventional observation. In this paper, we propose a network failure detection system that detects candidates of failures of telephony infrastructure by utilizing the collective intelligence of social networking services. By using this system, more information, which is useful for traffic control, can be detected.	collective intelligence;earthquake early warning (japan);internet;machine learning;network congestion;quake engine;sensor;social media	Chihiro Maru;Miki Enoki;Akihiro Nakao;Shu Yamamoto;Saneyasu Yamaguchi;Masato Oguchi	2015	2015 ITU Kaleidoscope: Trust in the Information Society (K-2015)	10.1109/Kaleidoscope.2015.7383642	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	OS	-62.57097793715337	67.45783194716111	105580
48f01f0d89ea35556cd6fe254d566a092a7453c6	uface: your universal password that no one can see		With the advantage of not having to memorize long passwords, people are more interested in adopting face authentication for use with mobile devices. However, since facial images are widely shared in social networking sites, it becomes a challenging task to securely employ face authentication for web services to prevent attackers from impersonating the legal users by using the users’ online face photos. Moreover, existing face authentication protocols either require users to disclose their unencrypted facial images to the authentication server or require users to execute computationally expensive secure multiparty computation protocols. For mobile devices with limited computational power, this presents a problem that cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we present a novel privacy preserving face authentication system, called UFace, which has users take close-up facial images for authentication to prevent against impersonation attacks of users’ online facial images. UFace also guarantees that the facial images are only seen by the users and not by any other party (e.g., web service providers and authentication servers). UFace was implemented through two facets: an Android client application to obtain and encrypt the feature vector of the user’s facial image, and server code to securely authenticate a feature vector across multiple servers. The experimental results demonstrate that UFace not only can correctly authenticate a user, but also can be done within seconds which is significantly faster than any existing privacy preserving authentication protocol.	analysis of algorithms;android;authentication protocol;authentication server;client (computing);encryption;feature vector;mobile device;password;performance evaluation;plaintext;secure multi-party computation;server (computing);web server;web service	Dan Lin;Nicholas Hilbert;Christian S.

Computer network intrusion detection and prevention system consist of collecting traffic data, analyzing them based on detection rules and generate alerts or dropping them if necessary. However IPS has problems such as accuracy signature, the traffic volume, topology design, monitoring sensors. In this paper, we practically examine the traffic effect on performance of IPS. We first examine the detection of DOS attack on a web server by IPS and then we generate network traffic to see how the behavior of IPS has influenced on detection of DOS attack.	dos;denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection system;network packet;network security;network traffic control;preprocessor;sensor;server (computing);snort;twisted nematic field effect;unavailability;web server	Shahriar Mohammadi;Vahid Allahvakil;Mojtaba Khaghani	2012	J.

f705c9a7e62e4f95d4405db360aa4d9b05032d2d	specification and security analysis of mobile ad-hoc networks		Mobile ad-hoc networks consist of mobile wireless devices which autonomously organise their communication infrastructure. Because of the simple network deployment this networking paradigm offers much convenience, but security turns out to be an important concern when considering the threats implied in using the wireless medium. In order to eliminate such concerns, formal specification and analysis techniques have to be used so that the employed communication protocols can be proved secure or their vulnerabilities exposed. While many such frameworks have been proposed for the analysis of classical security protocols, the challenges of the new setting prevent these from being applied directly. The main complication stems from the fact that the actions of intermediate nodes and their connectivity can no longer be abstracted into a single unstructured adversarial environment as they form an inherent part of the system’s security. In this dissertation we present a framework for modelling and reasoning about mobile ad-hoc networks and their security needs. Communication protocols are specified using a broadcast process calculus which makes a clear distinction between the protocol processes and the network’s connectivity graph, which may change independently from protocol actions. This modelling formalism is complemented by a control flow analysis which yields an overapproximation of the possible behaviour of a network specified with the calculus. The results obtained from the analysis can be used to establish a behavioural equivalence for networks which in turn is used to specify security requirements. We illustrate the usability of the framework by analysing real-world routing protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks using a prototype implementation of the analysis.	control flow analysis;data-flow analysis;formal specification;hoc (programming language);mobile phone;process calculus;programming paradigm;prototype;requirement;routing;semantics (computer science);software deployment;threat (computer);turing completeness;usability	Sebastian Nanz	2006			computer security model;cloud computing security;security information and event management;security service;mobile computing;network access control;network security policy;computer security	Security	-49.538427143105004	74.35410406829716	105730
abd804ca037b361333e279bd09cdfe974b3f516f	genewave: fast authentication and key agreement on commodity mobile devices		Device-to-device (D2D) communication is widely used for mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT). Authentication and key agreement are critical to build a secure channel between two devices. However, existing approaches often rely on a pre-built fingerprint database and suffer from low key generation rate. We present GeneWave, a fast device authentication and key agreement protocol for commodity mobile devices. GeneWave first achieves bidirectional initial authentication based on the physical response interval between two devices. To keep the accuracy of interval estimation, we eliminate time uncertainty on commodity devices through fast signal detection and redundancy time cancellation. Then we derive the initial acoustic channel response (ACR) for device authentication. We design a novel coding scheme for efficient key agreement while ensuring security. Therefore, two devices can authenticate each other and securely agree on a symmetric key. GeneWave requires neither special hardware nor pre-built fingerprint database, and thus it is easy-to-use on commercial mobile devices. We implement GeneWave on mobile devices (i.e., Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P) and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments. Experimental results show that GeneWave efficiently accomplish secure key agreement on commodity smartphones with a key generation rate 10x faster than the state-of-the-art approach.	acoustic cryptanalysis;authentication and key agreement (protocol);detection theory;experiment;fingerprint;internet of things;interval arithmetic;key generation;key-agreement protocol;line code;mobile device;secure channel;smartphone;symmetric-key algorithm	Pengjin Xie;Jingchao Feng;Zhichao Cao;Jiliang Wang	2017	2017 IEEE 25th International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	10.1109/ICNP.2017.8117543	computer network;redundancy (engineering);symmetric-key algorithm;mobile device;computer science;key generation;secure channel;communication channel;nexus (standard);authentication	Mobile	-49.93913995876681	73.6345700585664	105930

While there is a steady stream of news regarding major breaches and millions of user credentials compromised, it is logical to assume that, over time, the applications of the bigger players of the web are becoming more secure. However, as these applications become resistant to most prevalent attacks, adversaries may be tempted to move to easier, unprotected targets which still hold sensitive user data. In this paper, we report on the state of security for more than 22,000 websites that originate in 28 EU countries. We first explore the adoption of countermeasures that can be used to defend against common attacks and serve as indicators of “security consciousness”. Moreover, we search for the presence of common vulnerabilities and weaknesses and, together with the adoption of defense mechanisms, use our findings to estimate the overall security of these websites. Among other results, we show how a website’s popularity relates to the adoption of security defenses and we report on the discovery of three, previously unreported, attack variations that attackers could have used to attack millions of users.	consciousness;countermeasure (computer);credential;monetization;vulnerability (computing);web application;world wide web	Tom van Goethem;Ping Chen;Nick Nikiforakis;Lieven Desmet;Wouter Joosen	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08593-7_8	security through obscurity;computer science;information security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-55.88038980430819	62.288850750954936	106077

For this, we have proceeded with risk-analysis based technical development methodology by which information assets are distinguished in accordance with the input information processing procedure from the keyboard hardware, security vulnerabilities for each step are analyzed, and security alternatives on these from technical aspects are established. Security vulnerabilities for each step in the procedure of keyboard input information processing have been derived from a kernel mode. To secure derived vulnerabilities we have developed a couple of detailed technologies such as debug interrupt exception processing, 'JUMP' code insertion. In order to verify about the result of our study, we established the evaluation criteria in the view of security based on literature review and we designed the experiment environment to measure it and then made an experiment with each items. We've got experiment results better than literature studies in the basic security(confidentiality) experiment and the comparison experiment(regarding authentication and access control) about various information invasion tools. We expect that our research would be able to contribute to follow-up study not only to prevent leaking from keyboard input information but also to secure important information in general application and game program at kernel level.	access control;authentication;computer;information processing;information security;kernel (operating system);network security;plover;protection ring;server (computing);vulnerability (computing)	Hangbae Chang;Sijin Lee;Wonsub Eum	2007	The 2007 International Conference on Intelligent Pervasive Computing (IPC 2007)	10.1109/IPC.2007.42	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;zone routing protocol;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;security service;distributed computing;service discovery;computer security;computer network	HCI	-55.43829922384469	70.69879420618548	106079

One very powerful class of side-channel attacks is power analysis, which tries to extract cryptographic keys and passwords by examining the power consumption of a device. We examine the applicability of this threat to electromagnetically coupled RFID tags. Compared to standard power analysis attacks, our attack is unique in that it requires no physical contact with the device under attack. Power analysis can be carried out even if both the tag and the attacker are passive and transmit no data, making the attack very hard to detect. As a proof of concept, we describe a password extraction attack on Class 1 Generation 1 EPC tags. We also show how the privacy of Class 1 Generation 2 tags can be compromised by this attack. Finally, we examine possible modifications to the tag and its RF front end which help protect against power analysis attacks.	cryptanalysis;cryptography;electronic product code;hyperlink;key (cryptography);password;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;side-channel attack;tracing (software)	Yossef Oren;Adi Shamir	2007	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.2007.1050	radio-frequency identification;power analysis;pre-play attack;telecommunications;computer science;side channel attack;internet privacy;computer security;statistics	Security	-50.243508211929395	72.3438972127065	106469

If they had a tool that could accurately and expeditiously detect these anomalies, they would prevent many of the serious problems caused by them. We conducted experiments in order to study the relationship between interval-based features of network traffic and several types of network anomalies by using two famous machine learning algorithms: the naıve Bayes and k-nearest neighbor. Our findings will help researchers and network administrators to select effective interval-based features for each particular type of anomaly, and to choose a proper machine learning algorithm for their own network system.	anomaly detection;experiment;feature extraction;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;machine learning;naive bayes classifier;network traffic control;sensor;signal processing;support vector machine;testbed;wavelet transform	Kriangkrai Limthong;Thidarat Tawsook	2012	2012 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211951	anomaly detection;computer science;machine learning;signal processing;pattern recognition;data mining;k-nearest neighbors algorithm	Security	-62.06610549773799	66.24871342672131	106688

Source IP Address spoofing in one of the approach to perform Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In this scenario the packet true origin is difficult to identify. Thus the defense against the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is very complex to handle. We propose a novel scheme which is based on a firewall. This firewall can distinguish the attack packets from the packets sent by legitimate users based on the marking value on the packet, and thus filter out most of the attack packets. Compared to other packet-marking based solutions, our scheme is very effective and has a very low deployment cost. In the implementation of this scheme we would require the cooperation of only about 10% of the Internet routers in the marking process, and server to generate encrypted marking for secured transmission. The scheme allows the firewall to Detected and prevents the DDoS attacks from the first packet itself.	denial-of-service attack;encryption;firewall (computing);ip address spoofing;ip traceback;item unique identification;network packet;server (computing);software deployment	M.

A botnet is considered as an important carrier of malicious and undesirable briskness. In this paper, we propose a support vector machine to classify botnet activities according to kmeans, k-Medoids, and neural network clusters. The proposed approach is based on the features of transfer control protocol packets. System performance and accuracy are evaluated using a predefined data set. Results show the ability of the proposed approach to detect botnet activities with high accuracy and performance in a short execution time. The proposed system provides 95.7% accuracy rate with a false positive rate less than or equal to 3%.		Atef A.

On the other hand, there are many growing exploits over children. Motivated by the rising need to shield children's communication channels from obnoxious sources, this paper proposes a framework named SafeChat. SafeChat is the result of aggregating the context based authentication features of 4-CBAF model and the message encryption features from demonstrated SecureString 2.0. SafeChat intercepts children's communication and eradicates explicit words coming into the children's devices. SafeChat filters explicit words without recognizing their meaning. Such an approach hardens the system against malicious attacks. Furthermore, it secures the communication channels against possible man-in-the-middle attacks by employing an encryption mechanism. In addition, it encompasses the tools to authenticate and authorize communications and allows parents to monitor children communication channels in case an intervention is desirable. SafeChat supports to extend it to incorporate essential features including a facility to censor users through building a social network. Such a social network would allow other children to learn about the users with potential threats.	authentication;censoring (statistics);encryption;internet;knowledge acquisition;malware;man-in-the-middle attack;social network	Günter Fahrnberger;Deveeshree Nayak;Martha VenkataSwamy;Srini Ramaswamy	2014	2014 14th International Conference on Innovations for Community Services (I4CS)	10.1109/I4CS.2014.6860557	computer science;cryptography;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-53.631934885295436	66.93096328098181	107136

LDoS attack flows have the characteristics of low average rate and great concealment. It is hard to detect LDoS attack flows from normal traffic due to low rate property. Network traffic measurement shows that aggregate network traffic is multifractal. In order to characterize and analyze network traffic, researchers have developed concise mathematical models to explore complex multifractal structure. Although the LDoS attack flows are very small, it will inevitably lead to the change of multifractal characteristics of network traffic. This paper targets at exploiting and estimating the changes in multifractal characteristics of network traffic for detecting LDoS attack flows. The algorithm of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) is used to explore the change in terms of multifractal characteristics over a small scale of network traffic due to LDoS attacks. Through wavelet analysis, the singularity and bursty of network traffic under LDoS attacks are estimated by using Hölder exponent. The difference values (D-value) of Hölder exponent of network traffic between normal and under LDoS attack situations are calculated. The D-value is used as the basis to determine LDoS attacks. A detection threshold is set based on the statistical results. The presence of LDoS attacks can be confirmed through comparing D-value with detection threshold. Experiments on detection performance have been performed in the test-bed network and simulation platform. The extensive experimental results are congruent with the theoretical analysis.	aggregate data;algorithm;denial-of-service attack;detrended fluctuation analysis;experiment;mathematical model;multifractal system;network packet;network traffic control;pointwise mutual information;quantum fluctuation;sensor;simulation;technological singularity;testbed;wavelet	Zhijun Wu;Liyuan Zhang;Meng Yue	2016	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2015.2443807	d-value;algorithm design;fractal;telecommunications;mathematical model;computer security;bandwidth;statistics;computer network;wavelet transform	Security	-61.73385083264585	67.71501279322447	107311

Since these threats cause an adverse effect on the social and economical activities on the Internet, the technologies for protecting Internet services from the threats are strongly required. Many researchers have analyzed network traffic to detect anomalous one using many packet features (e.g., TCP/IP headers). In this paper, we focus on the Time To Live (TTL) and Identification fields (IPID) of the IP header to understand the anomalous traffic behavior, since source IP addresses are often spoofed. We propose a method to distinguish a plausible spoofed IP address from others based on a sequence of TTL and IPID fields. We show that our method can extract a number of plausible spoofing packets from real dark net traces in which all of the packets were not normal.	computer virus;darknet;denial-of-service attack;ip address spoofing;internet protocol suite;network packet;network traffic control;objref;spoofing attack;time series;time to live;tracing (software);transistor–transistor logic;web service	Masayuki Ohta;Yoshiki Kanda;Kensuke Fukuda;Toshiharu Sugawara	2011	2011 IEEE Workshops of International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/WAINA.2011.111	bogon filtering;the internet;smurf attack;time to live;telecommunications;computer science;ip address spoofing;network security;time series;internet privacy;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer virus;computer network	Networks	-59.53326235597491	66.41135305705622	107357

An attacker performs port scans of IP addresses to find vulnerable hosts to compromise. However, it is also useful for system administrators and other network defenders to detect port scans as possible preliminaries to more serious attacks. It is a very difficult task to recognize instances of malicious port scanning. In general, a port scan may be an instance of a scan by attackers or an instance of a scan by network defenders. In this survey, we present research and development trends in this area. Our presentation includes a discussion of common port scan attacks. We provide a comparison of port scan methods based on type, mode of detection, mechanism used for detection, and other characteristics. This survey also reports on the available datasets and evaluation criteria for port scan detection approaches.	image scanner;internet;port scanner;system administrator	Monowar H.

Our previous reputation-based trust model approach, which is based on the resource chain model (RCM), prevents malicious peers from spreading malicious contents among the open community. Moreover, a study on the malicious behavior over P2P community leads us to recognize a malicious node. The purpose of this paper is to identify malicious nodes based on the new resource chain model. In addition, the research includes the analysis of behavior of malicious peers on P2P networks. The study on various malicious behavior strengthens the existing resource chain model and allows us to keep P2P network much more reliable and stable.	control table;download;malware;peer-to-peer;reliability-centered maintenance;reputation system;tell-tale	Sinjae Lee;Shaojian Zhu;Yanggon Kim;Juno Chang	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-70560-4_8	computer science;peer-to-peer;internet privacy;computer security;computational trust	Web+IR	-59.170357943560234	72.6896160940325	108232

If I send an email unencrypted, for example, I do so because I don't want to bother with encryption; for this convenience, I compromise both security and privacy. If I elect to double-talk around a sensitive subject over an insecure telephone connection rather than going some place with a secure phone, the cost again is compromised security and privacy. The sloppy use of many technologies of convenience reduces our privacy, which, in turn, leaves us more vulnerable to such serious threats as stalking, identity theft, intellectual property theft, and even espionage (both industrial and conventional). The problem is not with the technologies themselves but with our unwillingness to take the requisite precautions when using them. This generally results from a lack of awareness about the risks involved.	computer security;email;encryption;privacy;secure telephone	Michael A.

a32f7cdd2ac43369b3d043baf235d9fee3b7c8b5	hindsight: understanding the evolution of ui vulnerabilities in mobile browsers		Much of recent research on mobile security has focused on malicious applications. Although mobile devices have powerful browsers that are commonly used by users and are vulnerable to at least as many attacks as their desktop counterparts, mobile web security has not received the attention that it deserves from the community. In particular, there is no longitudinal study that investigates the evolution of mobile browser vulnerabilities over the diverse set of browsers that are available out there. In this paper, we undertake the first such study, focusing on UI vulnerabilities among mobile browsers. We investigate and quantify vulnerabilities to 27 UI-related attacks---compiled from previous work and augmented with new variations of our own---across 128 browser families and 2,324 individual browser versions spanning a period of more than 5 years. In the process, we collect an extensive dataset of browser versions, old and new, from multiple sources. We also design and implement a browser-agnostic testing framework, called Hindsight, to automatically expose browsers to attacks and evaluate their vulnerabilities. We use Hindsight to conduct the tens of thousands of individual attacks that were needed for this study. We discover that 98.6% of the tested browsers are vulnerable to at least one of our attacks and that the average mobile web browser is becoming less secure with each passing year. Overall, our findings support the conclusion that mobile web security has been ignored by the community and must receive more attention.	compiler;desktop computer;experiment;file spanning;internet security;mobile device;mobile security;out there;poor posture;snapshot (computer storage);user interface;vulnerability (computing)	Meng Luo;Oleksii Starov;Nima Honarmand;Nick Nikiforakis	2017		10.1145/3133956.3133987	internet privacy;world wide web;mobile search;computer security;hindsight bias;browser security;computer science;mobile device;mobile web;vulnerability assessment;vulnerability;user interface	Security	-55.314051643835	61.47284684134741	108387

Among the key range of attacks that take place, HTTP flood DDoS attacks are on high. In the case of DDoS attacks based on HTTP flood, unusual quantum of requests are sent to the servers within quick time interval and it affects the response and the performance levels of the server . There are numerous solutions in contemporary literature, pertaining to thwarting HTTP flood kind of attacks. It is imperative from the analysis that there are constraints in the existing models since the most of these models are user session based and/or packet flow patterns. The session based evolution models are vulnerable to botnets and packet flow pattern based models are vulnerable if attack sources are equipped with human resource and/or proxy servers. Hence, there is inherent need for improving the solutions towards addressing the HTTP flood kind of attacks over the system. The crux for such system is about ensuring that fast and early detection with minimal false alarming in streaming network transactions, and ensures that the genuine requests are not impacted. To address such a system, the model of Bio-Inspired Anomaly based HTTP-flood detection aimed, and the proposed model depicted in detail along with experimental inputs. Results attained from the process exemplify the significance and robustness of the model towards achieving the objectives considered for the solution.	anomaly detection;hypertext transfer protocol	K.

45fc6f36be5dee736cbbd3e0cf0700cc5a3f53e6	privacy in danger: let's google your privacy		Protection of personal data is a requirement from both ethical and legal perspectives. In the Internet, search engines facilitate our lives by finding any searched information within a single-click time. On the other hand, they threaten our privacy by revealing our personal data to others. In this paper, we give concrete examples of Google personal data exploits against user privacy, discuss the countermeasures to protect our privacy and introduce a penetration testing tool called TrackingDog checking and reporting privacy exploits over Google. 1 Motivation Privacy is both an ethical and legal requirement for the Internet users. Protection of personal data against unauthorized access and exploits is inevitable for the users. Different legacy systems in many countries define strict laws to prevent illegal use of personal data [2,3,13–15]. Unlike legacy systems, safeguarding user privacy is not an easy task from the technical point of view. The users share their personal data with third parties, but they can not control whether their data is used for other purposes or forwarded to others. They need to trust the data receivers. P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences) [12] and Appel (A P3P Preference Exchange Language) [1] projects are two attempts in this direction to build a trust relation between data owners and data receivers. Web crawlers threaten personal privacy by indexing more and more private data for unauthorized access. The biggest threats can result from the “indexing anything” features of the Internet search engines like Google, Yahoo, Lycos, etc. Especially, Google with its huge index size threatens our privacy. Today, a special research area called Google Hacking that focuses on finding vulnerable servers, applications, various online devices, files containing username-password pairs, login forms, etc. exists. We, as the individual users, need to take user-centric countermeasures in order to protect our privacy. In this paper, we illustrate real life examples of privacy exploits via Google hacking, discuss its social aspects and the countermeasures for Google hacking and illustrate our penetration testing tool TrackingDog for the user-centric privacy control. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 focuses on the real life examples of privacy exploits from Google hacking area. Section 3 explains the possible security countermeasures for Google privacy hacking and introduces our privacy penetration testing tool TrackingDog. Finally, Section 4 discusses the privacy policy of Google and proposes some enhancements for better privacy management.	authorization;google hacking;information privacy;internet;legacy system;login;p3p;password;penetration test;personally identifiable information;point and click;privacy policy;real life;test automation;user (computing);web crawler;web search engine	Emin Islam Tatli	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-79026-8_4	information privacy;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-51.85929758266641	62.70275099035568	108724

The inherent weakness of communication technology has exposed the system to numerous security threats. Several survey papers have discussed these problems and their countermeasures. However, most of these papers classified attacks based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but they excluded the accountability. In addition, the existing countermeasures focus on countering some specific attacks or protecting some specific components, but there is no global approach to secure the entire system. In this paper, we review the security requirements, provide descriptions of several severe cyber-attacks, and propose a cyber-security strategy to detect and counter these attacks.

Therefore, the security of AMI is one of the most demanding issues in the smart grid implementation. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) architecture for AMI which will act as a complimentary with other security measures. This IDS architecture consists of three local IDSs placed in smart meters, data concentrators, and central system (AMI headend). For detecting anomaly, we use data stream mining approach on the public KDD CUP 1999 data set for analysis the requirement of the three components in AMI. From our result and analysis, it shows stream data mining technique shows promising potential for solving security issues in AMI.	anomaly detection;cups;data mining;data stream mining;imperative programming;intrusion detection system;sensor;smart meter;transmitter;usage data	Mustafa Amir Faisal;Zeyar Aung;John R.

Novel security architectures and approaches are proposed constantly, to be followed by announcements of sophisticated attack methods that compromise them, while people suspect others, even more sophisticated attack methods never see the daylight. In the present work we propose a novel method for secure end-to-end communication based on biometric evidence to ensure security and integrity of the information exchanged. The traditional approach for securing the communication between two peers is through the use of secret key encryption combined with a public key approach for exchanging the common secret key to be used by the end peers. The public key part of the communication is based on a trusted authority for providing the public keys, a service provided through a public key infrastructure (PKI). Public key infrastructures are vulnerable to man in the middle attacks, among other approaches that compromise their integrity. There has been a lot of work for providing robust PKI infrastructures, the proposed solutions are fairly demanding on network resources, hence public key solutions are not the security approach of choice in several applications that require light weight solutions. Here we propose an approach for providing secure end-to-end communications in environments where it is possible to have biometric based authentication, exploiting the nature of the application; voice communication being the typical example that we use as our paradigm for describing the method. During the establishment of the communication session, the end-peers exchange a challenge/signature token, the integrity of which is confirmed vocally when the voice communication initiates. The security of the method relies on the inability to mechanically impersonate an individual both because of the biometric user specific attributes of the human voice and video as well as the user customized profile of the exchanged information. The method is appropriate for ensuring the security of an encrypted phone conversation, guaranteeing the integrity of the session key exchanged in the beginning of the conversation. It requires minimal resources from the user handsets and no additional support from the network, so it is inherently scalable and readily deployable as it only needs an appropriately enhanced secure handset	authentication;biometrics;daylight;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;in the beginning... was the command line;inbound marketing;information exchange;key (cryptography);key exchange;man-in-the-middle attack;norm (social);programming paradigm;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;scalability;session (computer science);session key	Spyros Kopsidas;Dimitris Zisiadis;Leandros Tassiulas	2006	2006 1st IEEE Workshop on Hot Topics in Web Systems and Technologies	10.1109/HOTWEB.2006.355266	security association;computer science;internet privacy;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Security	-53.67704159163129	67.2935197779704	109373

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with k -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.	computer security;entropy (information theory);exploit (computer security);hidden markov model;intrusion detection system;markov chain;statistical classification;vulnerability (computing)	Karen A.

The idea is quite simple and the method proved to be  surprisingly efficient but there are some issues to be concerned with. One of the most important issues is possible efficiency  decay through a long-term period. Therefore the investigation of the efficiency of the method throughout longer period was  done Also various other factors of the greylisting method application were studied and are discussed.

83bb551d8da44c0dcee39fd50aa96cfd9d2547d7	tinman: eliminating confidential mobile data exposure with security oriented offloading	plug and play;internet of things;device drivers;wireless sensor networks	The wide adoption of smart devices has stimulated a fast shift of security-critical data from desktop to mobile devices. However, recurrent device theft and loss expose mobile devices to various security threats and even physical attacks. This paper presents TinMan, a system that protects confidential data such as web site password and credit card number (we use the term cor to represent these data, which is short for Confidential Record) from being leaked or abused even under device theft. TinMan separates accesses of cor from the rest of the functionalities of an app, by introducing a trusted node to store cor and offloading any code from a mobile device to the trusted node to access cor. This completely eliminates the exposure of cor on the mobile devices. The key challenges to TinMan include deciding when and how to efficiently and transparently offload execution; TinMan addresses these challenges with security-oriented offloading with a low-overhead tainting scheme called asymmetric tainting to track accesses to cor to trigger offloading, as well as transparent SSL session injection and TCP pay-load replacement to offload accesses to cor. We have implemented a prototype of TinMan based on Android and demonstrated how TinMan protects the information of user's bank account and credit card number without modifying the apps. Evaluation results also show that TinMan incurs only a small amount of performance and power overhead.	android;confidentiality;desktop computer;mobile device;overhead (computing);password;prototype;smart device	Yubin Xia;Yutao Liu;Cheng Tan;Mingyang Ma;Haibing Guan;Binyu Zang;Haibo Chen	2015		10.1145/2741948.2741977	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;computer security;internet of things	Mobile	-51.13177304730375	63.722166619308034	110334

In the technical literature only the hit rate of the classifiers is mentioned to justify the effectiveness of the phishing detecting techniques. Aspects such as the accuracy of the classifier results (false positive rate), computational effort and the number of features used for phishing detection are rarely taken into account. In this work we propose a technique that yields the minimum set of relevant features providing reliability, good performance and flexibility to the phishing detection engine. The experimental results reported in this work show that the proposed technique could be used to optimize the detection engine of the anti-phishing scheme.	email;phishing;threat model	Cleber K.

75f9f53b72916e12f51cd661187788d7d6bea38d	hpsipt: a high-precision single-packet ip traceback scheme		Abstract Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack remains a major threat, even in the era of connected devices. Attackers often hide their identity, making defending or identifying and subsequently prosecuting them difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel high-precision single-packet IP traceback (HPSIPT) scheme that facilitates the trace back of each spoofed packet to its origin. Numerous IP trace back techniques for tracing attackers exist; however, they are limited either by the number of packets required or the storage and computational overheads incurred at the routers. By contrast, the proposed technique incurs negligible storage and computational overheads. Simulation results based on real-world Internet topologies (obtained from CAIDA) reveal that the proposed IP traceback scheme has a precision of 0.9751, accuracy of 0.9053, recall of 0.8580 and an F1 score of 0.9128 when tracing 130,000 attackers. The implementation of the proposed scheme requires less than 10 KB of storage in most routers, which is approximately 32 times less than that required by other state-of-the-art single-packet traceback techniques. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is compared with that of other single-packet traceback schemes in terms of computational time, storage, accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. Statistical tests are performed to support the statistical significance of the obtained results.	ip traceback;network packet	Vijayalakshmi Murugesan;Mercy Shalinie Selvaraj;Ming-Hour Yang	2018	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2018.07.013	distributed computing;computer network;spoofing attack;internet topology;f1 score;computer science;ip traceback;overhead (business);network packet;tracing;denial-of-service attack	Security	-57.380763798829655	70.29462717594193	110425

This paper discusses our experiences and issues encountered when we successfully combined anonymization, privacy protection, and Big Data techniques to analyze usage data while protecting the identities of users. Our Human Factors Engineering team wanted to use web page access logs and Big Data tools to improve usability of Intel's heavily used internal web portal. To protect Intel employees' privacy, they needed to remove personally identifying information (PII) from the portal's usage log repository but in a way that did not affect the use of Big Data tools to do analysis or the ability to re-identify a log entry in order to investigate unusual behavior. To meet these objectives, we created an open architecture for anonymization that allowed a variety of tools to be used for both de-identifying and re-identifying web log records. In the process of implementing our architecture, we found that enterprise data has properties different from the standard examples in anonymization literature. Our proof of concept showed that Big Data techniques could yield benefits in the enterprise environment even when working on anonymized data. We also found that despite masking obvious PII like usernames and IP addresses, the anonymized data was vulnerable to correlation attacks. We explored the tradeoffs of correcting these vulnerabilities and found that User Agent (Browser/OS) information strongly correlates to individual users. While browser fingerprinting has been known before, it has implications for tools and products currently used to de-identify enterprise data. We conclude that Big Data, anonymization, and privacy can be successfully combined but requires analysis of data sets to make sure that anonymization is not vulnerable to correlation attacks.	big data;blog;correlation attack;data anonymization;de-identification;device fingerprint;fingerprint (computing);human factors and ergonomics;information privacy;open architecture;operating system;personally identifiable information;usability;usage data;user (computing);user agent;web page	Jeff Sedayao;Rahul Bhardwaj;Nakul Gorade	2014	2014 IEEE International Congress on Big Data	10.1109/BigData.Congress.2014.92	privacy software;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web	Security	-54.154375354396045	62.80266625084399	110453

If a smartphone is stolen, such data are at risk of disclosure. To mitigate this risk, modern smartphones allow users to enable data encryption, which uses a locking password to protect the data encryption key. Unfortunately, users either do not lock their devices at all, due to usability issues, or use weak and easy to guess 4-digit PINs. This makes the current approach of protecting confidential data-at-rest ineffective against password guessing attackers. To address this problem we design, implement and evaluate the Sidekick system — a system that uses a wearable device to decouple data encryption and smartphone locking. Evaluation of the Sidekick system revealed that the proposal can run on an 8-bit System-on-Chip, uses only 4 Kb/20 Kb of RAM/ROM, allows data encryption key fetching in less than two seconds,while lasting formore than a year on a single coin-cell battery. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This analysis is built from two points of view. First, we compare, through the definitions that have been proposed by researchers of the two communities, the goals that are actually pursued in each domain. Then, we compare the techniques that have been developed to reach these goals. In the conclusion, we summarize our analysis and suggest that alert correlation is one way to make the two fields cooperate.	alert correlation;antivirus software;centralized computing;complementarity theory;discretionary access control;holism;host-based intrusion detection system;information security;information system;malware;openness;point of view (computer hardware company);privilege escalation;raid;sensor;technical standard	Benjamin Morin;Ludovic Mé	2007	Journal in Computer Virology	10.1007/s11416-007-0036-2	intrusion detection system;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;world wide web;computer security	SE	-59.05962789320815	62.16441158409978	110984

It is being pushed from both sides: from the bottom up by client distributions and plugins, and from the top down by organisations such as Google. However, there are potential technical hurdles that might lock some clients out of the modern web. This paper seeks to measure and precisely quantify those hurdles in the wild. More than three million measurements provide statistically significant evidence of degradation. We show this through a variety of statistical techniques. Various factors are shown to influence the problem, ranging from the client’s browser, to the locale from which they connect.	elegant degradation;https;lock (computer science);plug-in (computing);reachability;statistical model;top-down and bottom-up design;web server	George Michaelson;Matthew Roughan;Simon Jonathan Tuke;Matthew P.

Mainly, wearable devices are going to have a large impact on our lifestyle, especially in a healthcare scenario. In this framework, it is fundamental to secure exchanged information between these devices. Among other factors, it is important to take into account the link between a wearable device and a smart unit (e.g., smartphone). This connection is generally obtained via specific wireless protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): the main topic of this work is to analyse the security of this communication link. In this paper we expose, via an experimental campaign, a methodology to perform a vulnerability assessment (VA) on wearable devices communicating with a smartphone.

While in recent years many research groups presented solutions offering protection schemes for hosts that receive and run un-trusted, possibly malicious agents, in the field of protecting the agent against malicious hosts, development seems to grow very slowly. This paper discusses a protocol for detecting modifications at the agent’s binary code that, for a particular class of modifications, undoubtedly unmasks the attacking host. Furthermore, it is shown that in co-operation with a special kind of route protection in a lot of scenarios the protocol resists attacks from coaliting malicious hosts as well as from a single malicious host.	binary code;carrier-to-noise ratio;computation;embedded system;fingerprint (computing);malware;mobile agent;run time (program lifecycle phase);sensor	Dirk Westhoff	2001	International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering	10.1142/S0218194001000700	non-repudiation;computer science;engineering;mobile agent;internet privacy;programming language;world wide web;computer security	Security	-53.80424583862788	67.952616069261	112042

However, security threats of malicious applications are rapidly increasing due to the nature of the third party applications where only developers can assign required permissions. For this reason, attackers can inject exploits into a normal application with inappropriately acquired permissions. In this paper, we propose a method to distinguish an application by analyzing permissions set and enhanced user interfaces to improve the chance of making right decisions. The proposed methods are intended for users to make better decisions with more information provided by the system.	android;exploit (computer security);malware;operating system;smartphone;user interface	Sangho Lee;Da Young Ju	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics	10.1109/ISI.2013.6578838	computer science;internet privacy;user interface;world wide web;computer security;linux kernel	SE	-56.71073386894273	60.64277109596969	112105

HTHs are stealthy in nature, and covert communication is their usual means of interaction and information transfer. Previous research has focused on short-range interaction via side-channels and existing IC interfaces, while remote interaction with HTHs across wired computer networks has received less attention. Generalized and non-local HTH interaction can support attacks normally associated with software Trojans. We investigate remote communication with HTHs and provide partial methods to exploit vulnerabilities in media layers of the protocol stack. Specifically, we focus on covert communication over point-to-point physical links in 10 gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) networks by exploiting loose specifications in physical- and link-layer protocols. The developed HTHs are assessed in terms of resource overhead and achieved bit rate, and demonstrate the potential for establishing high bandwidth covert channels using lightweight implanted circuits. We also describe a PUF-based IC or IP tracking attack enabled by HTH interaction across a network.	aurora;autonomic computing;covert channel;functional specification;gigabit;hardware trojan;integrated circuit;interaction;network switch;nonlocal lagrangian;overhead (computing);point-to-point (telecommunications);protocol stack;semiconductor intellectual property core;software portability;trojan horse (computing)	Mohammed M.

ed26b753001d0c66758b4dd4a55f3ce985253571	community-based collaborative intrusion detection		The IT infrastructure of today needs to be ready to defend against massive cyber-attacks which often originate from distributed attackers such as Botnets. Most Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), nonetheless, are still working in isolation and cannot effectively detect distributed attacks. Collaborative IDSs (CIDSs) have been proposed as a collaborative defense against the ever more sophisticated distributed attacks. However, collaboration by exchanging suspicious alarms among all interconnected sensors in CIDSs does not scale with the size of the IT infrastructure; hence, detection performance and communication overhead, required for collaboration, must be traded off. We propose to partition the set of considered sensors into subsets, or communities, as a lever for this trade off. The novelty of our approach is the application of ensemble based learning, a machine learning paradigm suitable for distributed intrusion detection. In our approach, community members exchange data features used to train models of normality, not bare alarms, thereby further reducing the communication overhead of our approach. Our experiments show that we can achieve detection rates close to those based on global information exchange with smaller subsets of collaborating sensors.	anomaly detection;botnet;centralized computing;distributed algorithm;experiment;fingerprint;holism;information exchange;intrusion detection system;machine learning;network traffic control;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;scalability;sensor	Carlos Garcia Cordero;Emmanouil Vasilomanolakis;Max Mühlhäuser;Mathias Fischer	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-28865-9_44	novelty;information technology management;anomaly detection;information exchange;lever;botnet;intrusion detection system;computer science;trade-off;distributed computing	Security	-60.03760910257063	63.811399435750296	112480

These networks provide automated processes that ensure the correct functioning of these infrastructures, in a operation much similar to those of management operations found in traditional Internet Protocol (IP), in particular the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). In this paper we provide a first look into characteristics of SCADA traffic, with the goal of building an empirical foundation for future research, and investigate to what extent the SCADA traffic patterns are similar to SNMP.	baseline (configuration management);data acquisition;exception handling;network traffic control;simple network management protocol;time series	Rafael Ramos Regis Barbosa;Ramin Sadre;Aiko Pras	2012	2012 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211945	internet protocol;communications protocol;the internet;next-generation network;workstation;computer science;information security;operating system;time series;distributed computing;computer security;internet traffic engineering;computer network	Security	-60.616933598687815	66.27596179352597	112568

However, so far little attention has been given to the actual architecture of the in-vehicle network. An approach within in-vehicle network design is to divide the network into domains, where each domain consists of a set of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that handles some united functionality, e.g., body control, powertrain, and telematics. Still, this approach is based on “best engineering practice” and there is room for improvements. In this paper, we study real traffic from a modern car and we try to divide the in-vehicle network into domains using automated partitioning algorithms. To find the optimum division, we select four community detection algorithms, known from social network analysis, and we evaluate their ability to find these domains. We conclude that community detection algorithms can be used to identify in-vehicle domains based on the message types (signals) used in the in-vehicle network and we demonstrate this by applying the algorithms to real data. The approach is not limited to only message types, but domains can also be identified based on other criteria, such as frequency of messages, payload sizes, or Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs). We also conclude that the identification of good domains can facilitate the implementation of security measures. Therefore, we believe that the approach has great potential to help engineers in deriving secure in-vehicle network architectures during the design of a vehicle.	algorithm;bus (computing);inter-process communication;louvain modularity;network architecture;network planning and design;social network analysis;telematics	Pierre Kleberger;Nasser Nowdehi;Tomas Olovsson	2014	2014 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2014.7013311	intelligent computer network;computer science;information security;architecture;operating system;network simulation;distributed computing;network access control;computer security;computer network	Security	-51.373550967450775	69.8413305864803	112687

Data-driven anomaly detection methods can offer an appealing alternative to existing signature-based intrusion detection systems by capturing known and previously unseen attacks. In this paper, we try to develop efficient rules that distinguish between normal and abnormal behavior in a given period and over time that can also adapt to relational and dynamic changes in cyber environment. Specifically, we represent the network flow data as a bipartite graph and then adopt an outlier detection approach for heavy-tailed distributions to develop an adaptive threshold method for node behavior characterization. Further, we introduce a trust management scheme for aggregation of node behaviors over time and evaluation of overall node 'trustworthiness' over full time period. Using the data collected by European Internet Service Provider, we demonstrate superior performance of the proposed adaptive threshold selection method for Trust-based detection systems. Overall, the proposed framework can adjust to changing conditions of the system and can be used for detection of anomalous node behaviors in real-time.	anomaly detection;flow network;intrusion detection system;real-time clock;trust (emotion);trust management (information system)	Younghun Chae;Natallia Katenka;Lisa Cingiser DiPippo	2016	2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)	10.1109/ICDMW.2016.0047	anomaly-based intrusion detection system;intrusion detection system;bipartite graph;computer science;artificial intelligence;adaptive system;machine learning;data mining;distributed computing;computer security	DB	-62.77137882553805	64.82515616901289	112957

The classifier is able to operate in real-time as only the first packet of each flow is processed. The main metric used for classification is an estimation of the entropy of the first packet payload. The approach is evaluated based on encrypted ground truth traces and on real network traces. Encrypted traffic such as Skype, or encrypted eDonkey traffic are detected as encrypted with probability higher than 94%. Unencrypted protocols such as SMTP, HTTP, POP3 or FTP are detected as unencrypted with probability higher than 99.9%. The presented approach, named real-time encrypted traffic detector (RTETD), is well suited to operate as pre-filter for advanced classification approaches to enable their applicability on increased bandwidth.	algorithm;circuit complexity;differential entropy;edonkey network;encryption;entropy estimation;ground truth;hypertext transfer protocol;network packet;network traffic control;plaintext;preprocessor;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor;statistical classification;tracing (software)	Peter Dorfinger;Georg Panholzer;Wolfgang John	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-20305-3_14	entropy estimation;telecommunications;ground truth;computer science;data mining;computer security	Metrics	-62.14249042250534	66.81495546301636	113080

These attacks have pushed away potential business firms and individuals whose aim is to get the best benefit in e-commerce with minimal losses. The attacks occur during interactions between the trading peers as a transaction takes place. In this paper, we propose how to address Sybil attack, an active attack, in which peers can have bogus and multiple identities to fake their owns. Most existing work, which concentrates on social networks and trusted certification, has not been able to prevent Sybil attack peers from doing transactions. Our work exploits the neighbor similarity trust relationship to address Sybil attack. In our approach, duplicated Sybil attack peers can be identified as the neighbor peers become acquainted and hence more trusted to each other. Security and performance analysis shows that Sybil attack can be minimized by our proposed neighbor similarity trust.	e-commerce;sybil attack	Guojun Wang;Felix Musau;Song Guo;Muhammad Bashir Abdullahi	2015	IEEE Trans.

It is commonly used to build VPNs (Virtual Private Networks). For key establishment, the IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocol is used. IKE exists in two versions, each with different modes, different phases, several authentication methods, and configuration options. In this paper, we show that reusing a key pair across different versions and modes of IKE can lead to crossprotocol authentication bypasses, enabling the impersonation of a victim host or network by attackers. We exploit a Bleichenbacher oracle in an IKEv1 mode, where RSA encrypted nonces are used for authentication. Using this exploit, we break these RSA encryption based modes, and in addition break RSA signature based authentication in both IKEv1 and IKEv2. Additionally, we describe an offline dictionary attack against the PSK (Pre-Shared Key) based IKE modes, thus covering all available authentication mechanisms of IKE. We found Bleichenbacher oracles in the IKEv1 implementations of Cisco (CVE-2018-0131), Huawei (CVE2017-17305), Clavister (CVE-2018-8753), and ZyXEL (CVE-2018-9129).

366ffe8b1834fcb1d0a616351d59d370613ee5f7	a double oracle algorithm for allocating resources on nodes in graph-based security games		In the graph-based security game, the defender allocates security resources strategically to protect targets against the adversary. In this paper, firstly, we come up with a new double oracle algorithm for scheduling resources optimally on nodes in graph-based security games. The police scattered on the street can only detect those terrorists on that street, while the police at the intersection place can detect all the terriorists on all the streets crisscrossing the intersection. Secondly, in real world situation, even the police meets the criminals at the same place, criminals still could escape. To match the real world situation, we define a parameter called detection probability, representing the chance the attacker is caught when they are checked by the defenders. Thirdly, we design a double oracle algorithm to find the equilibrium. But the computational complexity of best response oracles are extremely high. We design greedy algorithms and combine them with best response oracles to improve the algorithm efficiency without loss of correctness.	adversary (cryptography);algorithmic efficiency;computational complexity theory;correctness (computer science);greedy algorithm;oracle machine;personal computer;scheduling (computing)	Zhuo Yang;Junwu Zhu;Ling Teng;Jiajie Xu;Zeyu Zhu	2018	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-018-5750-x	game theory;best response;algorithmic efficiency;computational complexity theory;computer science;oracle;correctness;adversary;greedy algorithm;algorithm	AI	-60.843635493707545	70.57701215303142	113653

The so-called single sign-on forms part of this integration whereby a relying website enables a user to use her credentials on a third-party provider (such as Google or Facebook) to authenticate with itself and, if desired, authorize itself to use her resources on the provider. The user benefits by not remembering credentials for different websites separately and by allowing controlled use of her resources with a provider by other website. However, we observe that the current protocols for single sign-on do not have any provision of what we call single sign-off: once the user logs out of a relying website, the user still remains signed into the provider website. This can leave the user vulnerable if she forgets to sign out of the provider website after signing out of the relying website on a shared computer. We manually analyze the top twenty websites using Facebook or Google providers and conclude that the above problem is widespread. All but one website do not even warn the user with regard to this problem.	authentication;credential;single sign-on;user experience	Vaibhav Rastogi;Ankit Agrawal	2015	2015 Eighth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3)	10.1109/IC3.2015.7346717	communications protocol;computer science;authentication;internet security;authorization;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-54.25247523973601	61.87119995097641	113729

To solve the repeated marking problem, we propose in the nRVPPM that one packet is marked by routers only one time with the probability which is varying with the distance the packet has traveled. Besides, the nRVPPM makes the victim receives the packets marked by each router with the same probability. Based on the nRVPPM, we bring forward the CnRVPPM by employing the redundancy brought about by the similarity of IP addresses. Our simulation studies show that the proposed schemes offer high precision and efficiency, and can dramatically reduce the number of packets required for the traceback.	ip traceback;item unique identification	Hanping Hu;Yi Wang;Lingfei Wang;Wenxuan Guo;Mingyue Ding	2006		10.1007/11839569_44	internet protocol;link state packet;traceability;similarity;packet generator;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;similitude;transmission delay;redundancy;packet switch;computer security;computer network	Networks	-57.883442801010965	71.19281897450662	113819
6c153e7ecf615d61788064cf0950f3c5c3afcc4b	droidmark: a lightweight android text and space watermark scheme based on semantics of xml and dex		Android platform induces an open application development framework to attract more developers and promote larger market occupations at the same time. However, the open architecture also makes it easier to reverse engineering and application piracy. These result in the property loss for developers and companies, and increase the risks of mobile malicious code. Copyright protection for android application is thus of significant importance. Currently, many solutions for application copyright protection apply overload methods, assuming the availability of source code, which could be impractical for a large scale application protection. In this paper, we propose a lightweight copyright protection method for android application called DroidMark. The copyright is protected by text and space watermark based on semantics of xml and dex. Functional files are chosen as watermark carriers to increase watermark semi-fragileness and concealment. And the DroidMark can be accomplished without secret keys. Models and algorithms are proposed and analyzed all sidedly. The experiment results and analysis justified that DroidMark is secure and efficient.	algorithm;android;application framework;dex;digital watermarking;experiment;key (cryptography);key distribution;malware;open architecture;reverse engineering;semiconductor industry;xml	Lingling Zeng;Wei Ren;Min Lei;Yu Kyung Yang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59463-7_75	xml;open architecture;watermark;source code;database;android (operating system);reverse engineering;semantics;binary data;computer science	Security	-50.541842842557784	61.94988968166507	113886

The most common schemes used for detection systems include patternor signature-based and anomaly-based. Anomaly-based schemes use a set of metrics, which outline the normal system behavior and any significant deviation from the established profile will be treated as an anomaly. This paper contributes with an anomaly-based scheme that monitors the bandwidth consumption of a subnetwork, at the Universidad Michoacana, in Mexico. A normal behavior model is based on bandwidth consumption of the subnetwork. The presence of an anomaly indicates that something is misusing the network (viruses, worms, denial of service, or any other kind of attack). This work also presents a scheme for an automatic architecture design and parameters optimization of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), based on Evolutionary Programming (EP). The variables to be used by the HMMs are: the bandwidth consumption of network (IN and OUT), and the associated time where the network activity occurs. The system was tested with univariate and bivariate observation sequences to analyze and detect anomaly behavior. The HMMs, designed and trained by EP, were compared against semirandom HMMs trained by the Baum-Welch algorithm. On a second experiment, the HMMs, designed and trained by EP, were compared against HMMs created by an expert user. The HMMs outperformed the other methods in all cases. Finally, we made the HMMs time-aware, by including time as another variable. This inclusion made the HMMs capable of detecting activity patterns that are normal during a period of time but anomalous at other times. For instance, a heavy load on the processor may be completely normal during working times, but anomalous at nights or weekends.	anomaly detection;automatic parallelization;bandwidth (signal processing);baum–welch algorithm;behavior model;berlekamp–welch algorithm;bivariate data;computer virus;converge;curse of dimensionality;denial-of-service attack;evolutionary programming;expectation propagation;experiment;fitness function;heuristic;hidden markov model;information security;local optimum;markov chain;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;microsoft windows;sensor;server (computing);statistical model;subnetwork;time series;welch's method	Juan J.

The modern technology of mobile Internet devices and smart phones such as the iPhone series and Galaxy phone series has revealed the development of information technology of input and output devices as high-definition multimedia interface. The development of information technology requires novel biometric verification for personal identification or authentication in mobile security, especially in Internet banking and mobile Internet access. Our study deals with a biometric verification based on facial profile images for mobile security. Design/methodology/approach – The product of cellphones with built-in cameras gives us the opportunity of the biometric verification to recognize faces, fingerprints and biological features without any other special devices. Our study focuses on recognizing the left and right facial profile images as well as the front facial images as a biometric verification of personal identification and authentication for mobile security, which can be captured by smart phone devices such as iPhone 4 and Galaxy S2. Findings – As the recognition technique of the facial profile images for a biometric verification in mobile security is a very simple, relatively easy to use and inexpensive, it can be easily applied to personal mobile phone identification and authentication instead of passwords, keys or other methods. The biometric system can also be used as one of multiple verification techniques for personal recognition in a multimodal biometric system. Our experimental data are taken from persons of all ages, ranging from children to senior citizens. Originality/value – As the recognition technique of the facial profile images for a biometric verification in mobile security is very simple, relatively easy to use and inexpensive, it can be easily applied to personal mobile phone identification and authentication instead of passwords, keys or other methods.

However, in practical implementations, an IDS is a complex work and needs investing in the new infrastructure or in training new personnel. Therefore, it is inconsistent with the users who has a small network system. In this paper, we introduce an IDSCloud model as a solution to implementing a network IDS based on cloud computing. The IDSCloud provides network IDS as a service over the internet which can be simple in deployment, maintenance, scalability without investing in the new infrastructure.	cloud computing;computer;intrusion detection system;malware;scalability;software deployment	Dang Duy Thang;Le Hoai Nam;Khoi Nguyen-Tan	2016		10.1145/2938559.2948834	intrusion detection system;host-based intrusion detection system;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;intrusion prevention system	Security	-60.49912854879216	63.390048958746895	114124
8bde69c3017f13d8c7d3125dc5f0139a7a66ad22	integrating self-efficacy into a gamified approach to thwart phishing attacks		Security exploits can include cyber threats such as computer programs that can disturb the normal behavior of computer systems (viruses), unsolicited e-mail (spam), malicious software (malware), monitoring software (spyware), attempting to make computer resources unavailable to their intended users (Distributed Denial-of-Service or DDoS attack), the social engineering, and online identity theft (phishing). One such cyber threat, which is particularly dangerous to computer users is phishing. Phishing is well known as online identity theft, which targets to steal victims sensitive information such as username, password and online banking details. Automated anti-phishing web browser plugin tools have been developed and used to alert users of potential fake emails and websites. However, these tools are not completely reliable in detecting and protecting people from phishing attacks. This is because the “humans are the weakest link” in information security. It is not possible to completely circumvent the end-user, for example, in personal computer use, one mitigating approach for computer and information security is to educate the end-user in security prevention. Educational researchers and industry experts talk about well-designed user security education can be effective. However, we know to our cost no-one talks about how to better design security education (i.e. user-centered security education) for end-users. Therefore, this paper focuses on designing an innovative and gamified approach to educate individuals about phishing attacks. The study asks how one can integrate “selfefficacy”, which has a co-relation with the user’s knowledge, into an anti-phishing educational game to thwart phishing attacks? One of the main reasons would appear to be a lack of user knowledge to prevent from phishing attacks. Therefore, this research investigates the elements that influence (in this case, either conceptual or procedural knowledge or their interaction effect) and then integrate them into an anti-phishing educational game to enhance people’s phishing prevention behaviour through their motivation.	browser extension;computer program;denial-of-service attack;email;gamification;information security;information sensitivity;malware;online banking;online identity;password;personal computer;phishing;sensor;social engineering (security);spamming;spyware;user (computing);user-centered design	Nalin Asanka Gamagedara Arachchilage;Mumtaz Abdul Hameed	2017	CoRR		password;computer security;malware;internet privacy;computer science;online identity;information sensitivity;phishing;social engineering (security);exploit;denial-of-service attack	Security	-56.82182869032345	62.194872875566986	114181
b2f9ebee9c2072cf9b8bd63eeadf1c2ad8b7373b	data evolution method in the procedure of user authentication using keystroke dynamics		Due to the rapid development of Internet and web-based application the number of system which an ordinary user needs to interact grows almost proportionally. People are expected to make bank transfers, send emails using multiple mailboxes, send tax declarations, send birthday wishes solely online. What is more, sometimes only this way being available. The sensitivity of information created using online tools is unquestionable and the highest possible level of data security is therefore expected not only on a corporate level, but also it should be guaranteed to ordinary users. That is the reason why a convenient solution, that do not require any additional expensive equipment (e.g. RFID cards, fingerprint readers, retinal scanners), can assure such security is highly wanted. Therefore, a number of publications have been devoted to methods of user authentication based on their biometrical characteristics (that are obviously individual and can be easily used to encrypt users’ credentials) and one potentially most accessible group of methods is build on top of analysis of users’ personal typing styles. This paper is a presentation of a data evolution method used in our novel biometrical authentication procedure and contains a statistical analysis of the conducted experimental verification.	authentication;event (computing);keystroke dynamics	Adrianna Kozierkiewicz-Hetmanska;Aleksander Marciniak;Marcin Pietranik	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-45243-2_35	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Vision	-50.43487648023235	64.34515481838619	114315
3ebed9a596557f606829f8d97a594ed924c434b3	multi-context features for detecting malicious programs		Malware detection is still an open problem. There are numerous attacks that take place every day where malware is used to steal private information, disrupt services, or sabotage industrial systems. In this paper, we combine three kinds of contextual information, namely static, dynamic, and instruction-based, for malware detection. This leads to the definition of more than thirty thousand features, which is a large features set that covers a wide range of a sample characteristics. Through experiments with one million files, we show that this features set leads to machine learning based models that can detect both malware seen roughly at the time when the models are built, and malware first seen even months after the models were built (i.e., the detection models remain effective months ahead of time). This may be due to the comprehensiveness of the features set.	experiment;machine learning;malware;personally identifiable information;sensor	Moustafa Saleh;Tao Li;Shouhuai Xu	2017	Journal of Computer Virology and Hacking Techniques	10.1007/s11416-017-0304-8	open problem;obfuscation (software);private information retrieval;malware;computer security;cryptovirology;computer science	ML	-58.30654782626935	60.780493531803444	114329
4769c9b85d5040e381b9661b6578977605135434	dismantling megamos crypto: wirelessly lockpicking a vehicle immobilizer		The Megamos Crypto transponder is used in one of the most widely deployed electronic vehicle immobilizers. It is used among others in most Audi, Fiat, Honda, Volkswagen and Volvo cars. Such an immobilizer is an antitheft device which prevents the engine of the vehicle from starting when the corresponding transponder is not present. This transponder is a passive RFID tag which is embedded in the key of the vehicle. In this paper we have reverse-engineered all proprietary security mechanisms of the transponder, including the cipher and the authentication protocol which we publish here in full detail. This article reveals several weaknesses in the design of the cipher, the authentication protocol and also in their implementation. We exploit these weaknesses in three practical attacks that recover the 96bit transponder secret key. These three attacks only require wireless communication with the system. Our first attack exploits weaknesses in the cipher design and in the authentication protocol. We show that having access to only two eavesdropped authentication traces is enough to recover the 96-bit secret key with a computational complexity of 256 cipher ticks (equivalent to 2 encryptions). Our second attack exploits a weakness in the key-update mechanism of the transponder. This attack recovers the secret key after 3× 2 authentication attempts with the transponder and negligible computational complexity. We have executed this attack in practice on several vehicles. We were able to recover the key and start the engine with a transponder emulating device. Executing this attack from beginning to end takes only 30 minutes. Our third attack exploits the fact that some car manufacturers set weak cryptographic keys in their vehicles. We propose a time-memory trade-off which recovers such a weak key after a few minutes of computation on a standard laptop.	authentication protocol;cipher;computation;computational complexity theory;embedded system;emulator;immobiliser;key (cryptography);laptop;passive optical network;reverse engineering;space–time tradeoff;tracing (software);transponder;weak key	Roel Verdult;Flavio D.

Therefore, network intrusion detection becomes a great challenge to the security issue both in industry and academy. In this paper, we present network attacks detection and prediction method based on threat model, and then the network security trend is analyzed. The security situation of the entire network is analyzed by a quantitative situation evaluating model, cooperating with the network topology. The experiment results shows that, during its running in an intranet security guard system of a large enterprise in 2010, the next-step attack can be predicted by our algorithm, and the security situation of the entire network can be accurately evaluated as well.

As user passwords were not encrypted, the online security crisis has caused prevailing panic among many Internet users in China. On the other hand, this online security disaster also provides researchers priceless data with which to study users' password patterns, especially when comparing those patterns across various relevant websites. Lessons thusly learned can help Chinese online service providers improve their service security in the future. This paper reports the findings from the exploratory study of the datasets from the affected websites with more than 60 million records, including (1) users might choose less secure passwords for their convenience and ease of memorization, though their primary concern is online security; (2) for the same reasons, password reuse is common, as users tend to use the same passwords for multiple online accounts; and (3) passwords usually contain common words, or personal information, such as birthdays and family member names.	email;encryption;internet;online service provider;password;personally identifiable information;user (computing)	Cheng Yang;Jui-Long Hung;Zhang-Xi Lin	2012		10.1145/2346536.2346558	cognitive password;password policy;business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-53.00402059117845	62.88251886722572	114716
47ea8bc3aadfb48f8aadb2e69a1561c68ff71b9e	unsupervised network anomaly detection in real-time on big data		Network anomaly detection relies on intrusion detection systems based on knowledge databases. However, building this knowledge may take time as it requires manual inspection of experts. Actual detection systems are unable to deal with 0-day attack or new user's behavior and in consequence they may fail in correctly detecting intrusions. Unsupervised network anomaly detectors overcome this issue as no previous knowledge is required. In counterpart, these systems may be very slow as they need to learn tra c's pattern in order to acquire the necessary knowledge to detect anomalous ows. To improve speed, these systems are often only exposed to sampled tra c, harmful tra c may then avoid the detector examination. In this paper, we propose to take advantage of new distributed computing framework in order to speed up an Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detector Algorithm, UNADA. The evaluation shows that the execution time can be improved by a factor of 13 allowing UNADA to process large traces of tra c in real time.	algorithm;anomaly detection;big data;database;distributed computing;intrusion detection system;machine learning;ontic;real-time web;run time (program lifecycle phase);sensor;software deployment;testbed;tracing (software);unsupervised learning;zero-day (computing)	Juliette Dromard;Gilles Roudière;Philippe Owezarski	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-23201-0_22	real-time computing;computer science;data mining;database;computer security	Security	-61.652311744346804	63.00160959588596	114717
e05e0d87d84d2af6e7797542306288d5c8accbeb	practical extensions to countermeasure dos attacks in software defined networking		In this paper, we propose two simple and practically feasible countermeasures to address the Route Spoofing and Resource Exhaustion attacks in Software Defined Networking (SDN) scenarios. For Route Spoofing attack, we introduce a new technique called “selective blocking” which blocks an adversary node to use a genuine user's active routes, and for Resource Exhaustion attack, we propose a “periodic monitoring” technique that detect adversary nodes based on the traffic analysis statistics gathered over a period of time at SDN data plane switches. We perform the implementation of the aforementioned attacks and their proposed countermeasures. With our proposed countermeasures installed in the target SDN scenarios, the simulation results indicate 35% reduction in bandwidth consumption, 60% gain in packet delivery rate, and 50% reduction in processing delay.	adversary (cryptography);blocking (computing);countermeasure (computer);dos;denial-of-service attack;forwarding plane;network packet;network switch;processing delay;resource exhaustion attack;simulation;software-defined networking;spoofing attack;traffic analysis	Reza Mohammadi;Reza Javidan;Manijeh Keshtgari;Mauro Conti;Chhagan Lal	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)	10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169839	resource exhaustion attack;traffic analysis;software-defined networking;spoofing attack;adversary;forwarding plane;computer network;computer science;processing delay;denial-of-service attack	Security	-57.598458585577006	69.43897047014107	114863

Wireless Networks have grown significantly since their introduction. Security protocols supplied with the wireless equipment have reached a level of strong and robust security. However, security remains a problem; this study aims to answer two questions. What is the status of wireless network growth and security in Tonga? and what can be done to improve wireless network security in Tonga. The war-drive results of Nuku'alofa produced comprehensive data which clearly shows the number of networks, both company and home networks. An exploratory research approach is employed to guide the design of the study. The results show that there is a significant growth in terms of WLAN usage since the implementation of the fiber optic network.

It provides its clients with an inexpensive means to communicate worldwide via the internet through wired and wireless networks. In the past this application was limited strictly to computers, yet with continuous advancements in mobile communication, Skype phones and other mobile devices have recently hit the market in an attempt to capitalize on Skype's reliable connection algorithms. However, despite the success of this application, it is important to note that due to Skype's connection algorithm and the nature of P2P, a number of vulnerabilities emerge that threaten both users and their networks. This paper outlines how to block the Skype application through the use of Deep Packet Inspection. This novel approach is completely scalable to networks of any size as a means of blocking one of the largest threats to commercial and government networks today.	algorithm;blocking (computing);computer;deep packet inspection;information sensitivity;internet;mobile device;online chat;peer-to-peer;scalability;threat (computer)	Peter Renals;Grant A.

The impact of attacks has allowed financial damage on the business or individual. The FBI estimates that losses incurred in 2016 will top US$ 3 billion. Meanwhile, cyber criminals use malware: Trojans, Spyware, and Keyloggers, all of which require long tremendous effort to transfer benefits into their bank accounts; while Ransomware makes the process automatic and easy by using a business model of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS).

099d940cc25b69893361945efd1c51b61ee6ecdd	improving evidence acquisition from live network sources	digital evidence;network forensics	The pervasiveness of network technology is causing a shift in the location of digital evidence. What was once largely found on individual disks tied to single individuals is now becoming distributed across remote networked machines, under the control of multiple organizations, and scattered over multiple jurisdictions. The network interactions between these machines are also becoming recognized as a source of network evidence. These live network sources of evidence bring additional challenges which need to be addressed. This paper discusses these issues and suggests some improvements in the methods used for the collection of evidence from live network sources. a 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Many applications of mobile clouds deploy GPS (Global Positioning System) to find locations and to synchronize clocks. Though security starts to draw scrutiny from academy, industry, and government, authentication in GPS-directed mobile clouds has not been brought to the table. Authentication of GPS acts as the first responder against security breaches. This paper, among the first, examines the vulnerabilities in GPS-directed mobile clouds. By systematic analysis, an attack model is devised to demonstrate the existing threats and to predict futuristic attack tactics. The paper proposes a novel defense approach, namely vertical-horizontal design of authentication. Vertical-horizontal design extends cross-layer design of cloud and device stacks (vertical) with interface design between sections of the system (horizontal). The solutions will be validated with event-driven simulation that complements incidental dangers and legal/regulation restrictions associated in experimenting with GPS-dependent systems.	academy;attack model;authentication;cloud computing;event-driven programming;experiment;global positioning system;mobile computing;semantics (computer science);simulation	Jonathan A.

8220d0d87e593ec19195bd7464f8ba1a6e300677	preventing phishing attacks using one time password and user machine identification	international journal of computer applications ijca	Phishing is a type of attack in which cyber criminals tricks the victims to steal their personal and financial data. It has become an organized criminal activity. Spoofed emails claiming to be from legitimate source are crafted in a way to lead victims to reveal their personal, financial data by misdirecting them to the counterfeit website. This research paper presents a novel approach to combat the Phishing attacks. An approach is proposed where user will retrieve the one time password by SMS or by alternate email address. After receiving the one time password the web server will create an encrypted token for the user’s computer/device for authentication. The encrypted token will be used for identification, any time user wishes to access the website he/she must request the new password. The one time password as name implies will expire after single use. The one time password and encrypted token is a smart way to tackle this problem.

The constantly increasing Internet traffic rate challenges DNS services and their attack detection methods to handle actual queries while being flooded by tens of millions of malicious requests per second. Moreover, state of the art on hostile actions evolve fast. DNS administrators continuously face new kinds of attacks and they regularly need to evaluate their detection systems. We have studied different approaches to develop a tool able to reproduce state-of-the-art attacks, aiming to make it easy to evaluate countermeasure strategies. We have focused on commodity-hardware, DPDK and MoonGen to build a flexible flood query generator. The described tool can saturate a 10Gbps link, sending more than 12 million attack-like random DNS requests per second.	commodity computing;dpdk / dpdk.org;fast flux;system administrator;web server	Santiago Ruano Rincón;Sandrine Vaton;Stephane Bortzmeyer	2016	2016 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577110	computer science;information security;operating system;flooding;irrigation;internet privacy;computer security;domain name system;server;computer network	Security	-58.448585721197645	66.81197429023345	115452

This is accompanied with background advances in wireless link bandwidth and rapid growth deployment of wireless network. As one of the main security threats MHWN faces, jamming attack has attracted much attention since it is easy to launch and can cause severe damages to the network. Accurate jammer localization plays an essential role in applying various anti-jamming countermeasures and it has been a hot topic in recent years. This survey overviews the major recent works done in the field of jammer localization for MHWN. The major contribution of this paper is to present all the typical jammer localization schemes in a single literature along with comprehensive performance comparison by simulation with respect to time complexity, location accuracy, and communication overhead in various MHWN deployment environments. Besides, directions for future research are outlined. We hope this survey can provide insight into different research directions to improve jammer localization accuracy for future developments.	electronic counter-countermeasure;hop;internationalization and localization;overhead (computing);radio jamming;simulation;software deployment;time complexity	Xianglin Wei;Qiping Wang;Tongxiang Wang;Jianhua Fan	2017	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2016.2631146	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;wireless wan;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.82851718563288	73.11722894616227	115467
4c49ba2f8eeb82084e2521d5f593b1632f3ed5dd	systematic literature review on usability of firewall configuration		Firewalls are network security components that handle incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of rules. The process of correctly configuring a firewall is complicated and prone to error, and it worsens as the network complexity grows. A poorly configured firewall may result in major security threats; in the case of a network firewall, an organization’s security could be endangered, and in the case of a personal firewall, an individual computer’s security is threatened. A major reason for poorly configured firewalls, as pointed out in the literature, is usability issues. Our aim is to identify existing solutions that help professional and non-professional users to create and manage firewall configuration files, and to analyze the proposals in respect of usability. A systematic literature review with a focus on the usability of firewall configuration is presented in the article. Its main goal is to explore what has already been done in this field. In the primary selection procedure, 1,202 articles were retrieved and then screened. The secondary selection led us to 35 articles carefully chosen for further investigation, of which 14 articles were selected and summarized. As main contributions, we propose a taxonomy of existing solutions as well as a synthesis and in-depth discussion about the state of the art in firewall usability. Among the main findings, we perceived that there is a lack (or even an absence) of usability evaluation or user studies to validate the proposed models. Although all articles are related to the topic of usability, none of them clearly defines it, and only a few actually employ usability design principles and/or guidelines.	network security;network traffic control;personal firewall;projection screen;systematic review;taxonomy (general);usability testing	Artem Voronkov;Leonardo H.

841e123408d3dd8eda2e5d2a8c371b63901e7edc	detection of bot infected pc using destination-based ip address and domain name whitelists		As a bot communicates with a malicious controller over a normal communication or an encrypted channel and updates its code frequently, it becomes difficult to detect an infected personal computer (PC) using a signature-based intrusion detection system (IDS) and an antivirus system (AV). As sending control and attack packets from the bot process are independent of the user operation, a behavior monitor is effective in detecting an anomaly communication. In this paper, we propose a bot detection technique that checks outbound packets with destination-based whitelists. If any outbound packets during the non-operating duration do not match the whitelists, the PC is considered to be infected by the bot. The whitelists are a set of legitimate IP addresses (IPs) and/or domain names (DNs). We implement the proposal system as a host-based detector and evaluate false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) performance.	video game bot	Keisuke Takemori;Takahiro Sakai;Masakatsu Nishigaki;Yutaka Miyake	2011	JIP	10.2197/ipsjjip.19.169	embedded system;operating system;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-58.57332734705868	64.48397261327398	115646

One of the most critical is determining the authenticity of the parties wishing to communicate. An existing method of enabling authenticated key agreement involves using a two-dimensional visual code system with digital camera enabled devices as a way of demonstratively identifying entities. This paper seeks to extend that solution by colorizing the code system, thereby extending the amount of data which can be carried by a visual tag, and thus reducing the necessary size of such tags. This create images more easily recognized by the devices establishing secure communication in wireless pervasive computing environments.

It dramatically changes the way of communication for human beings in the past decade in all aspects. However, WLM is like a sharp double-edge sword, especially the exploited vulnerabilities concerning information security. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity for Digital Forensics (DF) to be strongly enforced within the organizations in order to specifically identify the real causes of the information breaches when utilize WLM. Few researches have formally incorporated the DF of WLM into generic guidelines for the associate personnel to follow. In this paper, we provide the system architecture of the experiment accompanied with our proposed Check Point (CP) methodology trying to disclose the possible digital evidences that could be explicitly collected and scientifically presented as probative evidences with respect to the persistently mushrooming information security incidents in the next generation wireless communication networks.

Most of work has been done in GSM to secure message from person who can eavesdrop the GSM Channel, from the hacker who can perform replay attacked using his historical messages and from the hacker who can disclose the message secrecy. Eavesdropping in a radio channel is easy but due to a lot of traffic there is a very less chances to find the correct information and the desired SMS however in today's GSM system still have two problems. The easiest way to read the text message from any person is the mobile operator network entities so there is a need to make it possible that our sent SMS is not in the format that should be easily read, so Protection of message text, its readability at operators end at different network entities like, SMSC, MSC and Lawful Interception System, and the second problem is message non-repudiation, this term is used for the behavior of an attacker such that it impersonates as some other genuine user. Because in today's network it is possible that at operator end messages can be sent using any sender number and receiver cannot confirm that this message is generated from the specified number or from any other network operator.	authentication;confidentiality;digital signature;encryption;entity;non-repudiation;regular expression;replay attack;simpletext	Mhair Kashif	2014	2014 IEEE 17th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/CSE.2014.269	gsm;gsm 03.38;file transfer protocol;concatenated sms;mobile telephony;logic gate;computer science;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;computer security;protein kinase c;encryption;computer network;short message service center;short message service	DB	-53.29074101990613	68.96099589667172	115939

Designing security protocols for secure group communications in wireless networks faces many technical challenges due to unique characteristics of wireless networks including resource-constrained environments in bandwidth, memory size, battery life and computational power, openness to eavesdropping and security threats, and unreliable communication. Further, for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) with no infrastructure support, rapid changes in network topology due to user mobility could cause group merge/partition events to occur dynamically. While satisfying security requirements is crucial for secure group communications in wireless systems, mobile group applications often have application-specific performance requirements in terms of timeliness, reliability, and system reconfigurability. Often there exists a tradeoff between security versus performance goals since security protocols may introduce undue computational and network overheads which may prevent performance goals from being met.	hoc (programming language);intrusion detection system;key management;mobile app;mobile commerce;network topology;openness;quality of service;reconfigurability;requirement	Jin-Hee Cho	2008			computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-51.81725975640186	74.2925424611282	116039

Recent researches have pointed out that epidemic worms can propagate similar payloads rapidly. It was shown that it is possible to evaluate similarities between these payloads in terms of a 256-dimensional vector based on histograms of the appearance frequencies of 256 character codes. This observation has also been confirmed by our earlier works. However, this method, if applied to flows from only one network, which means a network managed by an independent organization, is prone to a high rate of false positives in cases such as when normal emails are sent through a mailing list. To overcome this problem, we propose a new scheme which checks for any similarity between flows detected at several IDSs in a distributed environment. The proposed scheme is based on the fact that normal payloads propagating from different networks are different, whereas in the case of epidemic worms payloads even propagated through different networks but generated by the same worm exhibit similarity. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through extensive experiments using real network traffic that contains worms.	code;email;experiment;internet;network packet	Yuji Waizumi;Masashi Tsuji;Hiroshi Tsunoda;Nirwan Ansari;Yoshiaki Nemoto	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.236	simulation;character encoding;telecommunications;computer science;social issues;operating system;computer security;computer network	DB	-59.3060775508496	67.44775749902337	116184

7e691402424a8d615647e5b2746184e376d6391c	an experimental study of secret key generation for passive wi-fi wearable devices		Passive Wi-Fi is a technology to generate 802.11b transmissions using backscatter communication, with power consumption 10000× lower than existing Wi-Fi chipsets. Since wearable devices are typically limited in resources such as power and storage, classical cryptographic security schemes are problematic for them. We instead propose to use wireless channel characteristics to secure data transfer. It has been shown that communicating wireless transceivers are able to generate shared secret keys by measuring channel characteristics at a single frequency. These methods are not applicable to passive Wi-Fi, which uses two different frequencies. In this paper, we describe a method to generate a shared secret key based on wireless channel characteristics in the passive Wi-Fi scenario where the two parties are using dual frequencies.	backscatter (email);chipset;cryptography;experiment;key (cryptography);key generation;passive wi-fi;rss;randomness;shared secret;transceiver;universal software radio peripheral;wearable technology;wireless router	Mohammad Hossein Chinaei;Vijay Sivaraman;Diethelm Ostry	2017	2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974298	computer network;wireless sensor network;shared secret;computer science;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;data transmission;key generation;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;communication channel	Mobile	-50.32282876285264	72.75643190897475	116433

Modern platforms have turned away from the traditional user-based permission model and begun adopting application permission systems in an attempt to shield users from these threats. This dissertation evaluates modern permission systems with the goal of improving the security of future platforms. rnIn platforms with application permission systems, applications are unprivileged by default and must request permissions in order to access sensitive API calls. Developers specify the permissions that their applications need, and users approve the granting of permissions. Permissions are intended to provide defense in depth by restricting the scope of vulnerabilities and user consent by allowing users to control whether third parties have access to their resources. rnIn this dissertation we investigate whether permission systems are effective at providing defense in depth and user consent. First, we perform two studies to evaluate whether permissions provide defense in depth: we analyze applications to determine whether developers request minimal sets of permissions, and we quantify the impact of permissions on real-world vulnerabilities. Next, we evaluate whether permissions obtain the useru0027s informed consent by surveying and interviewing users. We use the Android application and Google Chrome extension platforms for our studies; at present, they are popular platforms with extensive permission systems. rnOur goal is to inform the design of future platforms with our findings. We argue that permissions are a valuable addition to a platform, and our study results support continued work on permission systems. However, current permission warnings fail to inform the majority of users about the risks of applications. We propose a set of guidelines to aid in the design of more user-friendly permissions, based on our user research and relevant literature.

The scheme establishes the source and destination IP address database by observing the normal traffic and storages it in a Bloom Filter table. The Netflow statistics is mainly used to allocate the weights for traffic routing by routers. A new algorithm is thus proposed to get efficiently maximum traffic by GA with the traffic filtered by routers, and its feasibility and validity have been verified in real network circumstances.	algorithm;bloom filter;denial-of-service attack;router (computing);routing;software release life cycle	Shen Yun Wang;Rui Guo	2008	2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2008.555	traffic generation model;network traffic control;call-second;floating car data;computer science;distributed computing;traffic shaping;computer security;computer network	Networks	-60.328417048778974	67.43101726699858	116551
adfdbe9469fbb0590557248e6b8abb21ca780b4f	an autonomous dynamic trust management system with uncertainty analysis		Abstract In order to help users select a reliable service in the open and complicated network, an autonomous dynamic trust management system is put forward based on collaborative recommendation mechanism and uncertainty analysis of satisfaction data. Any user in the network can store and update autonomously his trust table which contains direct interaction experience, find easily the reliable referrers according to collaborative recommendation, and collect valuable trust data and calculate the satisfaction and its reliability based on uncertainty analysis. Then the direct, recommended and self-recommended trusts can be calculated and finally be used to compute the global trust which will help the user to make a trust decision. A complicated network environment which includes quite a part of malicious nodes is built for investigating the robustness and effectiveness of the trust system. The experimental results show that the quality of service selection can be improved with the increase of interaction; the system can keep stable even though there are 50% malicious nodes initially in the network or a large number of malicious nodes join the network after stability; the system can resist the collusion attack more effectively and has lower computation and storage overhead than contrastive models.	autonomous robot;trust management (information system)	Jing You;Jinglun Shangguan;Lihua Zhuang;Ning Li;Yinhai Wang	2018	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2018.07.036	data mining;collusion;uncertainty analysis;management system;quality of service;robustness (computer science);computation;computer science	SE	-59.91502517139562	72.73590537767214	116755

M-banking is thus become more convenient, effective and timely through the new mobile communication systems. In order to raise the security of M-banking, some banks adopt the one-time password (OTP) to remedy the possible M-banking stealing risk. In the past, the OTP is sent to personal mobile phone. But, currently most of the smart mobile phone can performing M-banking easily. Thus, it gains higher risk of information security due to mobile phone hacking. In order to provide a reliable and secure M-banking process without decrease the convenience concurrently, in the paper one-time password (OTP) and personal biometric have been combined with personal identification and password for verification while M-banking. As the client side initiates a request for M-banking to the server side of a bank that provides M-banking service, the server side will generate an OTP with limited period for registration the M-banking and transmit to the client side. After receiving the OTP message, the client side must verify if the OTP message is validation and provided by the desired real server side. After then, the client side will register the on-line M-banking with the OTP in the specified short period. After receiving the service request, the server side will then request the client side to capture personal biometric such as fingerprint, iris, photo, and etc. immediately for further verification with the existed data stored in the server side to prevent the M-banking embezzling. If the personal biometric has been verified as an old one, the M-banking will immediately terminated by the server side. As the verification is finally done by the server side, the client side then can perform transaction via M-banking smoothly. The proposed scheme not only can provide secure M-banking, but also can clearly define the process. Therefore, if there are any M-banking arguments occurred due to Internet hacking or mobile phone stealing for M-banking, both of the server side and client side could protect their rights and interests.	authentication;biometrics;client-side;e-commerce;fingerprint;hash function;information security;internet;mobile banking;mobile phone;one-time password;online and offline;page hijacking;phone hacking;randomness;scheme;server (computing);server-side;smoothing;tablet computer;telecommunications network;upload	Chang-Lung Tsai;Chun-Jung Chen;Deng-Jie Zhuang	2012	2012 Third FTRA International Conference on Mobile, Ubiquitous, and Intelligent Computing	10.1109/MUSIC.2012.31	business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-48.65416462246952	65.54980806021784	116815
178fe706e9f19ef4021249d4f897ae0e316be15f	ad-hoc messaging infrastructure for peer-to-peer communication		Traditional means of communication rely on a centralized service provider in order to function. With a traditional cellular service provider, when somebody (Alice) wants to send a text message to someone else (Bob), the message is sent from Alice’s phone to a cellular network and then finally to Bob. This process happens regardless if they are located on opposite sides of the world or are in the same room. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that will route text messages along the shortest reliable path. By “shortest path” we mean that if Alice and Bob’s phones are in wireless range of each other, the message passes only through their phones over the wireless link. If Alice and Bob are located further apart and their wireless radios are out of range, then a repeater node which can be reached by both Alice and Bob can be deployed and the message will pass through this node, again taking the shortest path. The network can be deployed with inexpensive off-the-shelf microcomputers, such as the Raspberry Pi, which can run off batteries in the event of a power outage. These nodes can be easily deployed and need not be trusted as the messages are encrypted and signed. In our tests, we were able to send text messages across a building over our mesh-network of Raspberry Pi microcomputers running our software and using ad-hoc Wi-Fi for neighbour-to-neighbour links. In addition, our simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed protocol.		Michael Lescisin;Qusay H.

At the recipient’s end, the mail reading software will distinguish it from normal mail, and executes it upon confirmation by the recipient. If appropriate, output from the program can be channelled back to the sender automatically for further processing. Despite its potential for many applications, it has however, not taken off in a big way. A major reason stems from security concerns amongst users. This paper examines security issues associated with computational electronic mail systems and suggest some techniques and approaches for improving the security of such systems.	artificial intelligence;email;embedded system	Schubert Foo;Peng-Chor Leong;Yee Nam Sng	1997	Inf.

Examples of applications for this device include portable medical record systems, inventory tracking systems, communication devices, and portable gaming systems. Security for these devices typically takes one of three forms: 1) a password or code, 2) a key or token lock, 3) a biometric user authentication system. These security measures are intended to protect the device against unauthorized access, but do not generally protect the device against threats to its intellectual property. Even if a password is required to use a device, it is still possible to duplicate the device, leaving out the authorization control. This paper presents a secure user interface that not only controls device access, but also allows for user-based device hardware customization while protecting against reverse engineering.	authentication;authorization;biometrics;data-centric security;encryption;key management;password;reverse engineering;threat (computer);tracking system;user interface	Scott J.

Phishing attacks abuse trust with the help of deceptive e-mails, fraudulent web sites and malware. In order to prevent phishing attacks some organizations have implemented Internet browser toolbars for identifying deceptive activities. However, the levels of usability and user interfaces are varying. Some of the toolbars have obvious usability problems, which can affect the performance of these toolbars ultimately. For the sake of future improvement, usability evaluation is indispensable. We will discuss usability of five typical anti-phishing toolbars: built-in phishing prevention in the Internet Explorer 7.0, Google toolbar, Netcraft Anti-phishing toolbar and SpoofGuard. In addition, we included Internet Explorer plug-in we have developed, Anti-phishing IEPlug. Our hypothesis was that usability of anti-phishing toolbars, and as a consequence also security of the toolbars, could be improved. Indeed, according to the heuristic usability evaluation, a number of usability issues were found. In this article, we will describe the anti-phishing toolbars, we will discuss anti-phishing toolbar usability evaluation approach and we will present our findings. Finally, we will propose advices for improving usability of anti-phishing toolbars, including three key components of anti-phishing client side applications (main user interface, critical warnings and the help system). For example, we found that in the main user interface it is important to keep the user informed and organize settings accordingly to a proper usability design. In addition, all the critical warnings an anti-phishing toolbar shows should be well designed. Furthermore, we found that the help system should be built to assist users to learn about phishing prevention as well as how to identify fraud attempts by themselves. One result of our research is also a classification of anti-phishing toolbar applications.	canonical account;client-side;e-commerce;email;heuristic;internet explorer 7;malware;phishing;plug-in (computing);usability;user interface	Linfeng Li;Marko Helenius	2007	Journal in Computer Virology	10.1007/s11416-007-0050-4	e-commerce;usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;cognitive walkthrough;usability;computer science;internet privacy;user interface;heuristic evaluation;world wide web;computer security;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-56.60340406087721	61.79402009440349	117181

While mobile devices are equipped with numerous sensors which offer context-awareness to their installed apps, they can be also exploited to reveal sensitive information when correlated with other data or sources. Companies have introduced a plethora of privacy invasive methods to harvest user’s personal data for profiling and monetizing purposes. Nonetheless, up to now, these methods were constrained by the environment they operate, e.g. browser vs mobile app, and since only a handful of businesses could have access to both of these environments, the conceivable risks can be calculated and the involved enterprises can be somehow monitored and regulated. This work introduces some novel user deanonymisation approaches for device fingerprinting in Android. Having Android AOSP as our baseline, we prove that web pages, by using several inherent mechanisms, can cooperate with installed mobile apps to identify which sessions operate in specific devices and consequently to further expose users’ privacy.	android;radio fingerprinting	Efthymios Alepis;Constantinos Patsakis	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-72389-1_9	internet privacy;web page;android (operating system);information sensitivity;profiling (computer programming);mobile device;computer science	Security	-53.85651952016971	61.01668866837599	117184
5f41c4846fd6fdf0f81b36c49228156697c1eeb9	sequential keystroke behavioral biometrics for mobile user identification via multi-view deep learning		With the rapid growth in smartphone usage, more organizations begin to focus on providing better services for mobile users. User identification can help these organizations to identify their customers and then cater services that have been customized for them. Currently, the use of cookies is the most common form to identify users. However, cookies are not easily transportable (e.g., when a user uses a different login account, cookies do not follow the user). This limitation motivates the need to use behavior biometric for user identification. In this paper, we propose DEEPSERVICE, a new technique that can identify mobile users based on user’s keystroke information captured by a special keyboard or web browser. Our evaluation results indicate that DEEPSERVICE is highly accurate in identifying mobile users (over 93% accuracy). The technique is also efficient and only takes less than 1 ms to perform identification.	biometrics;deep learning;event (computing);http cookie;ibm notes;login;multi-user;real life;router (computing);sensor;smartphone	Lichao Sun;Yuqi Wang;Bokai Cao;Philip S.

As we know that Enhanced ARP (MITM-Resistant Address Resolution Protocol (MR-ARP)) is the prevention of ARP poisoning in which two tables are used, for cross checking any ARP request and if any new request arises then it uses voting process. First table is long term table which is updated for 60 minutes and other one is short term table which is same as normal ARP table. In some cases update policy of the long term table of MR-ARP causes the attack over LAN and ARP poisoning can be possible. MITM is quite possible over MR-ARP when any node become offline for some time and any other node wants to perform attack over that node. Here we will discuss the attack over MR-ARP and some corrective measures.	arp spoofing	Mukul Tiwari;Sumit Kumar	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-44966-0_35	computer network;man-in-the-middle attack;local area network;arp spoofing;computer science;address resolution protocol;vulnerability	ML	-57.341861747445584	67.96176124436536	117547

In the fast-paced lifestyle, it is very difficult to maintain multiple keys for traditional mechanical locks. Electromagnetic smart locks are a possible solution to this problem. To connect a smart lock with a key, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol can be used. BLE protocol is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. Ensuring security over BLE is an ongoing challenge. This paper aims to analyze the MITM vulnerability of BLE and develop a possible solution for designing smart-locks with an increased level of security. The observation shows that the combination of Image Steganography and Cryptography helps to overcome the vulnerabilities of BLE protocol.		Chaitanya Bapat;Ganesh Baleri;Shivani Inamdar;Anant V.

Google built Google Play Store as its official Android market for Android users to search and install apps. However, with the increasingly growth of the number of apps in Android marketplaces, some undesirable apps began to turn up. Plagiarisms and malware are two main kinds of those undesirable applications. For plagiarisms, they pirate other developers' work. As for malware, one of the most common way of spread is inducing users to install by their graphical user interface (GUI) similarity. Therefore, in this paper, we put forward a method to detect plagiarisms or malware which conceal themselves as a legitimate pre-existed app in Android marketplaces by their appearance. The main method we design is to compare the GUI similarity among Android apps and pick up some apps with high similarity on their appearance. In detail, we extract some features of apps and compute their similarity by their feature vectors. At last, we evaluate our design with 2,000 apps in both official and alternative Android marketplaces to find out such appearance similar apps in our dataset.	android;feature vector;graphical user interface;malware;mobile operating system;play store	Jiawei Zhu;Zhengang Wu;Zhi Guan;Zhong Chen	2015	2015 Seventh International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)	10.1109/ICACI.2015.7184722	computer science;internet privacy;android beam;world wide web;computer security;android	SE	-55.604569076200555	61.9298570742804	117739
f04696167cdc82bea088526106c4c0b886af95bb	source authentication and path validation in networks using orthogonal sequences		Verifying the authenticity of the source of network traffic and the path that this traffic has traversed is an important building block for secure network protocols and defense mechanisms. We investigate these problems of in-network source authentication and path validation. Existing approaches are either unable to satisfy security requirements or need significant computational resources due to cryptographic operations, thus limiting their suitability in practice where potentially every packet needs to be checked at line rate. We present Orthogonal Sequence Verification (OSV), a lightweight and scalable technique to address this problem. OSV uses orthogonal capabilities to enable source authentication and path verification simultaneously. The verification of these orthogonal capabilities is based on inner product computations, which can be easily realized by basic bitwise operations in a processor. Therefore, OSV significantly reduces computational cost, while achieving the necessary security properties. We present evaluation results which show that OSV is three orders of magnitude faster than the current approaches based on cryptographic operations. Therefore, we believe that our work presents an important contribution toward realizing high-performance, secure network protocols and network attack defenses in practice.	algorithmic efficiency;authentication;bitwise operation;communications protocol;computation;computational resource;cryptography;network packet;network traffic control;osv;requirement;scalability	Hao Cai;Tilman Wolf	2016	2016 25th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2016.7568576	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-56.06850168095669	71.66504255440434	117937

Two factor authentication is a process used to authenticate or verify the identity of a person or other entity requesting access under security constraints. It is a system wherein two different factors are used in conjunction to authenticate. Using two factors as opposed to one factor generally delivers a higher level of authentication assurance. With One-time password (OTP) a factor makes it more difficult to gain unauthorized access to restricted resources, like a computer account, bank account etc. In this paper, we propose a new approach in implementing the two factor authentication with one of the factor as one time password key generation using mobile phones.	mobile phone;multi-factor authentication	Abdulaziz S.

Unfortunately, unreliable and malicious behaviour is becoming a major obstacle for Internet communication. In order to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of the network infrastructure, we propose a novel trust model to be incorporated into BGP routing. In our approach, trust model is defined by combining voting and recommendation to direct trust estimation for neighbour routers located in different autonomous systems. We illustrate the impact of our approach with cases that demonstrate the indication of distrusted paths beyond the nearest neighbours and the detection of a distrusted neighbour advertising a trusted path. We simulated the impact of weighting voted and direct trust in a rectangular grid of 15*15 nodes (autonomous systems) with a randomly connected topology.	autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);border gateway protocol;future internet;randomness;regular grid;router (computing);routing;simulation;trust (emotion);trust metric;trusted path	Pekka Rantala;Seppo Virtanen;Jouni Isoaho	2011	CoRR	10.5121/ijcnc.2011.3301	computer science;ip forwarding;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Networks	-58.422571214924645	71.05652095543944	118088

It exposes the logical structure of a network, simplifies network management tasks such as policy checking and network segmentation, and can be used to improve the accuracy of network monitoring and analysis algorithms such as intrusion detection. This paper defines the role classification problem and introduces two practical algorithms that group hosts based on observed connection patterns while dealing with changes in these patterns over time. The algorithms have been implemented in a commercial network monitoring and analysis product for enterprise networks. Results from grouping two enterprise networks show that the number of groups identified by our algorithms can be two orders of magnitude smaller than the number of hosts and that the way our algorithms group hosts highly reflect the logical structure of the networks.	algorithm;intrusion detection system;network segmentation;provisioning;server (computing);time complexity;web server;xslt/muenchian grouping	Godfrey Tan;Massimiliano Poletto;John V.

While offering an extremely large full password space (256 bits for the most basic scheme), our scheme provides acceptable usability, as empirically demonstrated by, to the best of our knowledge, the largest user study (167 subjects involved) on graphical passwords, conducted in the fall semester of 2005 in two university classes. Our scheme supports most application environments and input devices, rather than being limited to small mobile devices (PDAs), and can be used to derive cryptographic keys. We study the memorable password space and show the potential power of this scheme by exploring further improvements and variation mechanisms.	cryptography;input device;key (cryptography);mobile device;password;personal digital assistant;usability testing	Hai Tao;Carlisle M.

Those filters are either implemented on the client, on a local network server or on a proxy system, depending on how the respective data is transmitted over the network. Where mail and file server are often locally installed, web servers are usually remote and require a proxy for filtering. A proxy however takes over communication for the client and thus might change important communication parameters such as the remote machine's identification when using SSL. We have developed several application level content filters running on bridges, i.e. ISO/OSI level 2 devices filtering ISO/OSI level 7 content. This papers gives an overview of our research and discusses advantages of application level filtering on bridges.	cpu cache;computer virus;file server;osi model;proxy server;remote computer;server (computing);spamming;trojan horse (computing);web server	Tobias Eggendorfer	2008	Seventh International Conference on Networking (icn 2008)	10.1109/ICN.2008.14	filter;proxy;arsenic;file server;beryllium;reverse proxy;the internet;computer science;information security;operating system;internet privacy;indium;world wide web;computer security;bridge;web server;server;computer virus;computer network	Networks	-57.53562134603728	66.36910024934193	118453

Recent security incidents have shown that criminals can get these authentication tokens or cards either by pickpocketing or through fake magnetic card readers. Furthermore, PINs may also be captured through shoulder-surfing or by the use of concealed miniature cameras. Upon obtaining both authentication factors, criminals can easily break into users' accounts which presents a high security risk. In this paper, we propose a new spinwheel-like PIN entry scheme which is resilient against shoulder-surfing attacks even if the shoulder-surfer can record the entire PIN entry procedure for one time with a video device. This scheme has two variants, both of which achieve a good balance between security and usability.	authentication;magnetic stripe card;personal identification number;point of sale;rotary woofer;usability	Peipei Shi;Bo Zhu;Amr M.

In the NFC-based payment system, close proximity between devices will increase the security of transactions. The disadvantage is the interaction between devices requires more physical activity of device owners because the device must be brought near to other devices some times. Besides requiring more physical activity, NFCbased interaction also takes a longer time because the device needs to be moved from one position to another. This paper proposed secure and efficient protocol that will reduce the physical activity of the device owners and reducing transaction time. The data exchange between merchant and payer will be executed without waiting for each other and one transaction will require two data transmissions are performed by the merchant and payer. Transactions are secured by the use of encryption on each data which sent by the merchant and payer. In addition, the protocol also guarantees the security of offline micro transactions and online macros transactions.

Secondly, we can get all data from bit-by-bit copy of entire physical memory using a low level access method. In this paper, we describe a forensic tool to acquire cell phone flash memory data using a logical level approach.

In particular, the profiles of two teenagers, one male and one female, with fake names were created. Using a suitable software tool, friend requests were sent massively. As a result, two networks of friends were created and access was granted to a significant amount of users’ personal information. Both profiles received requests for friendship and personal chat by adults aged up to 53 years old. In general the survey leads to results that reveal several hazards for children and critical issues about privacy of social network users.	internet privacy;personally identifiable information;programming tool;social network	Dimitrios Michalopoulos;Ioannis Mavridis	2010	2010 14th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics	10.1109/PCI.2010.31	information privacy;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;social network	Web+IR	-55.1744827441556	63.118613739157055	119104
31c31a206489143c64bbfc82de3dade09b740ba5	enhancement of vpn authentication using gps information with geo-privacy protection		VPN (Virtual Private Network) technology is well used for remote access to the internal server in order to mitigate intrusion attacks and data breaches. In the current VPN technologies, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) based certificate authentication and user ID/Password authentication are well used. However, in case of password leakage and lost of mobile devices, those authentication methods cannot effectively prevent the malicious accesses. In this paper, we propose an enhancement method of VPN authentication using GPS (Global Positioning System) information with geo-privacy protection. In this method, the GPS information of the client is used for VPN authentication without leaking the raw GPS coordinates of the client. Specifically, the hash values of GPS coordinate ranges will be registered on the VPN authentication server in order to protect the user geo-privacy. By using the proposed method, the remote access via VPN tunnel can be controlled within all designated areas so that the risk of intrusion attacks can be mitigated significantly. We achieved the GPS coordinates in our lab for one month and checked their hit rates in the GPS coordinate ranges achieved from the Google Maps. The results showed about 99.29% and 92.96% hit rates in the latitude and longitude respectively which are acceptable for real operation.	authentication server;data breach;global positioning system;hash function;mobile device;password;privacy;prototype;public key infrastructure;radius;remote access service;server (computing);spectral leakage;user identifier;virtual private network	Yong Jin;Masahiko Tomoishi;Satoshi Matsuura	2016	2016 25th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2016.7568518	telecommunications;operating system;multi-factor authentication;internet privacy;computer security;gps tracking server;computer network	Mobile	-53.09958331713005	65.28292842683834	119616

This is in part owing to the fact that malicious worms can rapidly scan networks for vulnerable hosts, but is further exacerbated by the fact that network topologies are becoming more fluid and vulnerable hosts may only be visible intermittently for environments such as virtual machines or wireless edge networks. In this paper we therefore describe and evaluate an agent-based mechanism which uses the spanning tree protocol (STP) to gain knowledge of the underlying network topology to allow both rapid and resource-efficient traversal of the network by agents as well as residual scanning and mitigation techniques on edge nodes. We report performance results, comparing the mechanism against a random scanning worm and demonstrating that network immunity can be largely achieved despite a very limited warning interval. We also discuss mechanisms to protect the agent mechanism against subversion, noting that similar approaches are also increasingly deployed in case of malicious code.	agent-based model;algorithm;authentication;cognitive dimensions of notations;confidentiality;file spanning;key (cryptography);malware;network topology;public-key cryptography;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;spanning tree protocol;subversion;tree traversal;virtual machine;window of opportunity	Ziyad S.

However, a problem has been pointed out that when a vehicle is connected with an external network, the safety of the vehicle is threatened. As a result, the security of vehicle control systems, which greatly affects vehicle safety, has become more important than ever. Ensuring the security of in-vehicle systems becomes an important priority, similar to ensuring conventional safety. The present study proposes a controller area network (CAN) communications method that uses a lightweight cipher to realize secure in-vehicle systems. The present study also constructs an evaluation system using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board and a radio-controlled car.

Almost each and every organization and financial institutes prefers electronic transaction in lieu of pen-paper based banking approach, which depends on high speed internet technology. However, this online monetary transaction is a long cherished blessing for the developed countries. In developing and underdeveloped countries, SMS banking gets rapid popularity over the internet banking via mobile phone, since internet based m-banking suffers from several limitations of internet connectivity, such as inaccessibility, slow speed, intermittent disruptions, and need for costly handset. In this paper, we propose a scheme where even without having an internet connection within the mobile handset, a client can virtually get the advantage of high speed internet banking via a GSM incorporated SMS transaction. Moreover, security over internet is a burning issue irrespective of the type of transaction, especially when the internet based transactions are operated at the user end. In the proposed scheme, we also offer a newly dimensioned security protocol using digital watermarking technique.	algorithm;digital watermarking;discrete cosine transform;electronic funds transfer;high-level programming language;information security;internet access;internet protocol suite;mobile banking;mobile phone;online banking;procedural programming;sms banking;tokenization (data security)	Syed Bahauddin Alam;Md.

af01ac27739fc5a4babe77b230d9d35ce2896ba7	security shortcomings and countermeasures for the sae j1939 commercial vehicle bus protocol		In the recent years, countless security concerns related to automotive systems were revealed either by academic research or real life attacks. While current attention was largely focused on passenger cars, due to their ubiquity, the reported bus-related vulnerabilities are applicable to all industry sectors where the same bus technology is deployed, i.e., the CAN bus. The SAE J1939 specification extends and standardizes the use of CAN to commercial vehicles where security plays an even higher role. In contrast to empirical results that attest such vulnerabilities in commercial vehicles by practical experiments, here, we determine that existing shortcomings in the SAE J1939 specifications open road to several new attacks, e.g., impersonation, denial of service (DoS), distributed DoS, etc. Taking the advantage of an industry-standard CANoe based simulation, we demonstrate attacks with potential safety critical effects that are mounted while still conforming to the SAE J1939 standard specification. We discuss countermeasures and security enhancements by including message authentication mechanisms. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the impact of employing these mechanisms on the overall network communication.	can bus;countermeasure (computer);denial-of-service attack;experiment;message authentication;real life;sae j1939;selective area epitaxy;simulation;vehicle bus	Pal-Stefan Murvay;Bogdan Groza	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2795384	can bus;sae j1939;vehicle bus;computer network;message authentication code;computer science;denial-of-service attack;countermeasure;authentication;automotive industry	Security	-51.477769750987775	69.91765691242895	120340

With the logical centralization of controllers and a global network overview, SDN brings us a chance to strengthen our network security. However, SDN also brings us a dangerous increase in potential threats. In this paper, we apply a deep learning approach for flow-based anomaly detection in an SDN environment. We build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for an intrusion detection system and train the model with the NSL-KDD Dataset. In this work, we just use six basic features (that can be easily obtained in an SDN environment) taken from the forty-one features of NSL-KDD Dataset. Through experiments, we confirm that the deep learning approach shows strong potential to be used for flow-based anomaly detection in SDN environments.	algorithm;anomaly detection;centralized computing;data mining;deep learning;denial-of-service attack;experiment;future internet;global network;intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic control;principle of good enough;sensor;software-defined networking;throughput	Tuan A.

Among the most significant research difficulties in such networks safety is intrusion detection, whose target is to distinguish between misuse and abnormal behavior so as to ensure secure, reliable network operations and services. Intrusion detection is best delivered by multi-agent system technologies and advanced computing techniques. To date, diverse soft computing and machine learning techniques in terms of computational intelligence have been utilized to create Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), yet the literature does not report any state-ofthe-art reviews investigating the performance and consequences of such techniques solving wireless environment intrusion recognition issues as they gain entry into cloud computing. The principal contribution of this paper is a review and categorization of existing IDPS schemes in terms of traditional artificial computational intelligence with a multi-agent support. The significance of the techniques and methodologies and their performance and limitations are additionally analyzed in this study, and the limitations are addressed as challenges to obtain a set of requirements for IDPS in establishing a collaborative-based wireless IDPS (Co-WIDPS) architectural design. It amalgamates a fuzzy reinforcement learning knowledge management by creating a far superior technological platform that is far more accurate in detecting attacks. In conclusion, we elaborate on several key future research topics with the potential to accelerate the progress and deployment of computational intelligence based Co-WIDPSs. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

48ebeefece16095443c6266463f13325300567da	a traffic signature-based algorithm for detecting scanning internet worms	internet worms;tk electrical engineering electronics nuclear engineering	Internet worms that spread autonomously from one host to another cause major problem in today’s networks. On 25th January 2003, “Slammer” was released into the internet and after ten minutes the worm infected more than 90% of vulnerable hosts. Worms cause damage to the network by consuming its resources such as bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting traffic signature for unknown internet worm. The proposed method has two algorithms. The first part is an Intelligent Failure Connection Algorithm (IFCA) using Artificial Immune System; IFCA is concerned with detecting the internet worm and stealthy worm. In order to reduce the number of false alarm, the impact of normal network activities is involved but TCP failure and ICMP unreachable connection on same IP address are not calculated because the internet worm strategic attack on the different IP address. The second algorithm Traffic Signature Algorithm (TSA) is concerned with capturing traffic signature of the scanning internet worm. In this paper, we show that the proposed method can detect traffic signature for MSBlaster worm.	algorithm;anti-worm;artificial immune system;autonomous robot;bandwidth (signal processing);experiment;internet;sql slammer;sensor;unreachable memory	Mohammad M.

0eaf7bbb9ad506a2998c3b2ecbb0057b1e288cf7	the ring of gyges: investigating the future of criminal smart contracts	ethereum;criminal smart contracts	Thanks to their anonymity (pseudonymity) and elimination of trusted intermediaries, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have created or stimulated growth in many businesses and communities. Unfortunately, some of these are criminal, e.g., money laundering, illicit marketplaces, and ransomware. Next-generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum will include rich scripting languages in support of smart contracts, programs that autonomously intermediate transactions. In this paper, we explore the risk of smart contracts fueling new criminal ecosystems. Specifically, we show how what we call criminal smart contracts (CSCs) can facilitate leakage of confidential information, theft of cryptographic keys, and various real-world crimes (murder, arson, terrorism).  We show that CSCs for leakage of secrets (a la Wikileaks) are efficiently realizable in existing scripting languages such as that in Ethereum. We show that CSCs for theft of cryptographic keys can be achieved using primitives, such as Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (SNARKs), that are already expressible in these languages and for which efficient supporting language extensions are anticipated. We show similarly that authenticated data feeds, an emerging feature of smart contract systems, can facilitate CSCs for real-world crimes (e.g., property crimes).  Our results highlight the urgency of creating policy and technical safeguards against CSCs in order to realize the promise of smart contracts for beneficial goals.	authentication;bitcoin;confidentiality;cryptocurrency;cryptography;ecosystem;ethereum;key (cryptography);linear algebra;pseudonymity;scripting language;smart contract;spectral leakage;wikileaks	Ari Juels;Ahmed E.

In this paper, we present and formulate the Inte r et host profiling problem using the header data from public packet traces to select relevant features of frequently-se en hosts for profile creation, and using hierarchical clusteri ng techniques on the profiles to build a dendrogram containing all the hosts. The well-known agglomerative algorithm is us ed to discover and combine similarly-behaved hosts into clust ers, and domain-knowledge is used to analyze and evaluate clustering results. In this paper, we show the results of applyin g the proposed clustering approach to a data set from NLANRPMA Internet traffic archive with more than 60,000 active hosts. On this dataset, our approach successfully identifie s clusters with significant and interpretable features. We ne xt use the created host profiles to detect anomalous behavior durin g the Slammer worm spread. The experimental results show that our profiling and clustering approach can successfully dete ct Slammer outbreak and identify majority of infected hosts.	algorithm;archive;botnet;ct scan;cluster analysis;computer virus;dendrogram;denial-of-service attack;entity;host (network);internet security;network packet;profiling (computer programming);sql slammer;tracing (software);whole earth 'lectronic link	Songjie Wei;Jelena Mirkovic;Ezra Kissel	2006			internet traffic;world wide web;profiling (computer programming);cluster analysis;domain knowledge;hierarchical clustering;internet hosting service;internet privacy;internet security;computer science	Metrics	-61.411884971613155	65.1985515296951	121652

This revolutionary paradigm creates a new dimension that removes the boundaries between the real and the virtual worlds. The Wireless Sensor Networks are a masterpiece of the success of this technology, using limited capacity sensors and actuators, industrial, medical, agricultural and many other environments can be covered and managed automatically. This autonomous interacting things should authenticate each other, and communicate securely. Otherwise malicious users can cause serious damages on such systems. In this paper we propose a robust, transparent, flexible and energy efficient blockchain-based authentication mechanism called BCTrust, which is designed especially for devices with computational, storage and energy consumption constraints. In order to evaluate our approach, we realized a real implementation with C programming language, and Ethereum Blockchain.	as-interface;authentication;autonomous robot;bitcoin;cpan;computation;ethereum;interaction;internet of things;malware;performance;programming language;programming paradigm;robustness (computer science);scalability;secure communication;sensor;virtual world	Mohamed Tahar Hammi;Patrick Bellot;Ahmed Serhrouchni	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8376948	wireless sensor network;computer network;cryptography;energy consumption;efficient energy use;blockchain;metaverse;internet of things;authentication;computer science	Mobile	-51.96172510352205	74.21827412425225	121831

To perform this study, a data set with more than 800 games available in the Google Play store was defined. The backup utility, provided by the Android Operating System (OS), was used to backup the app files into a Personal Computer (PC) in order to find and manipulate sensitive data. In the cases where sensitive data was found, the applications were restored and the games tested to assess if the manipulation was successful and if it could be used to the benefit of the user. The results included show that a significant percentage of the analyzed games save the user and app information in plaintext and do not include mechanisms to detect or prevent data from being modified.	android	Francisco Vigário;Miguel Neto;Diogo Fonseca;Mário M.

Therefore, it is important to secure the transfer of medical information from the patient to the recording system. We consider a portable, wireless device transferring medical information to a remote server. We decompose this problem into two sub-problems and propose security solutions to each of them: (1) to secure the link between the patient and the portable device, and (2) to secure the link between the portable device and the network. Thus we push the limits of the network security to the edge by authenticating the user using their biometric information; authenticating the device to the network at the physical layer; and strengthening the security of the wireless link with a key exchange mechanism. The proposed authentication methods can be used for recording the readings of medical data in a central database and for accessing medical records in various settings.	access network;authentication;authorization documentation;biometrics;biometry and biostatistics (occupation or discipline);cessation of life;code;communications protocol;confidentiality;consortium;contain (action);diffie–hellman key exchange;fingerprint;high- and low-level;html link type - copyright;key exchange;malware;markov chain;mobile commerce;mobile device;network access point;network security;password;patients;personally identifiable information;protocols documentation;prototype;reading (activity);server (computer);server (computing);telecommunications network;telemedicine;theft;trusted platform module;usability;wireless access point;disclaimer;notation;topiramate	Vladimir I.

Two detectors, one based on Tsallis and the other one based on Shannon's entropy, have been applied in several attack simulations, and their properties have been compared. The simulated attack is Synchronize packet SYN flood. A simple packet distribution, that is, entropy of source addresses are considered. In both cases, cumulative sum control chart algorithm is used for change point detection. Properties of two detectors that are compared are detection delay and rate of true and false positives. The results show that Tsallis entropy-based detector can outperform with respect to false positive rate Shannon-based one but that requires careful tuning of Tsallis Q parameter that depends on characteristics of network traffic. The detection delay of two detectors is approximately the same.

This poses the most complex challenges in security we have ever faced. The detection of malicious domains and Internet protocol (IP) addresses has been a hot topic in cyber security. We present a scalable and effective graph inference system for detecting malicious domains and IP addresses. The goal is to protect Internet users from network threats. Based on the loopy belief propagation algorithm, the system infers every domain or IP reputation, flagging it with high reputation as malicious one. We have evaluated the system with 75 million-node graph constructed from the huge dataset (500 gigabytes). The system attains performance with 86% and 87% area under receiver operating curves for inferring domain and IP reputations respectively. We demonstrate that the graphical solution provides rapid assessment of safe or risky sites on McAfee's data. It provides an automatic tool for web reputation inference in the field and serves as an assisting tool for “first pass” classification and triaging.	algorithm;belief propagation;blacklist (computing);casio loopy;computer security;gigabyte;graphical user interface;inference engine;internet;malware;scalability;sensor;software propagation;structure mining	Yonghong Huang;Paula Greve	2015	2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)	10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324374	reserved ip addresses;bogon filtering;computer science;data mining;world wide web;computer security	Security	-59.294257673353506	62.91434443788876	122980
1f713deb7dd0a50b2ffd438c57ccf35a324786e9	power analysis based side-channel attack on visible light communication		Abstract Visible light communication (VLC) technology has emerged as a significant and necessary improvement to the wireless communication technologies; VLC systems are considered to be more secure than wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) systems by design, since light cannot penetrate most walls and obstacles. This paper presents a design for a bidirectional VLC system, and it also introduces a method to jeopardize the security aspect of this system. The methodology in this paper is side-channel attack which is defined as exploiting data based on the information gained from physical implementation. It is not a cyber attack on the theoretical weaknesses in the algorithms, but rather is a sideway approach to a fully-functioning physical system. Thus, the authors became the attackers and implemented a current sensor on the power lines from the power supply to the VLC system; the instantaneous power consumed by the communication system has become their main source to obtain the binary data transmitted by visible light. The work has resulted in effective attacks which could successfully extract the information and it has demonstrated side channel attacks on VLC systems through their instantaneous power consumption analysis.

6db77d07eaff48880c417d7aae11de9ca41cdac0	on the security issues in wireless body area networks	wireless body area network	The emerging Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have great potential to revolutionize the future of ubiquitous health technologies. They provide unprecedented opportunities to monitor the patient’s health status with real-time updates to the physician. Since WBAN devices are used to collect sensitive (lifecritical) information and may operate in hostile environments, they require strict security mechanisms to prevent the malicious interaction with the system. However, unlike Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) devices, these devices are limited in terms of power efficiency and communication, and therefore pose numerous security challenges than traditional WSNs. In this paper, we first highlight major security requirements and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in a WBAN. Then we discuss different security modes (originally proposed for IEEE 802.15.4) for a WBAN that include AES-CTR, AES-CBC-MAC, and AESCCM modes.

As a first step towards tackling this problem, in this paper we propose a novel, graph-theoretic abstraction, dubbed the evolution of attacker-victim relation graphs, for characterizing cyber attackers' reconnaissance behaviors. The framework is centered at describing the similarity between two graphs at adjacent time windows of a certain resolution (e.g., per second vs. per minute). We also conduct a case study focusing on the number of time resolutions that need to be considered in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of attack-victim relation graphs.

To avoid constant manual intervention in allowing access (voluntary) to the system and monitor the activities; token based access can be granted, however the tokens can be replayed and attackers may also extract the token and use it to impersonate as authentic users. In this paper we use concept of digital token for remote authentication of an authorized user without man-in-the-loop approach. The proposed method will not only mitigate replay attack, but also prevent impersonation attempts. It can also be attached to a user account, so as to control permissions and subsequent authorizations during the remote session.

BlueEar features a novel dual-radio architecture where two Bluetooth-compliant radios coordinate with each other on learning the hopping sequence of indiscoverable Bluetooth networks, predicting adaptive hopping behavior, and mitigating the impacts of RF interference. Experiment results show that BlueEar can maintain a packet capture rate higher than 90% consistently in real-world environments, where the target Bluetooth network exhibits diverse hopping behaviors in the presence of dynamic interference from coexisting Wi-Fi devices. In addition, we discuss the privacy implications of the BlueEar system, and present a practical countermeasure that effectively reduces the packet capture rate of the sniffer to 20%. The proposed countermeasure can be easily implemented on the Bluetooth master device while requiring no modification to slave devices like keyboards and headsets.	algorithm;bluetooth;experiment;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);network packet;packet analyzer;privacy;radio frequency	Wahhab Albazrqaoe;Jun Huang;Guoliang Xing	2016		10.1145/2906388.2906403	telecommunications;bluesnarfing;ant;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.40331972499325	70.9102293540337	123470
7e1f05f2e350a82693d23d0fb8386610bdecd062	survey of peer-to-peer botnets and detection frameworks.		Botnet is a network of compromised computers controlled by the attacker(s) from remote locations via Command and Control (C&C) channels. The botnets are one of the largest global threats to the Internet-based commercial and social world. The decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets have appeared in the recent past and are growing at a faster pace. These P2P botnets are continuously evolving from diverse C&C protocols using hybrid structures and are turning to be more complicated and stealthy. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the evolution, functionalities, modelling and the development life cycle of P2P botnets. Further, we investigate the various P2P botnet detection approaches. Finally, discuss the key research challenges useful for the research initiatives. This paper is useful in understanding the P2P botnets and gives an insight into the usefulness and limitations of the various P2P botnet detection techniques proposed by the researchers. The study will enable the researchers toward proposing the more useful detection techniques.	botnet;cluster analysis;computer;internet;online and offline;peer-to-peer;requirement;sensor;social network;social reality;software development process	Ramesh Singh Rawat;Emmanuel S.

b0e4a58af7d78b24a75b1c6d561d4f335c13478d	surviving unpatchable vulnerabilities through heterogeneous network hardening options		The administrators of a mission critical network usually have to worry about non-traditional threats, e.g., how to live with known, but unpatchable vulnerabilities, and how to improve the network’s resilience against potentially unknown vulnerabilities. To this end, network hardening is a well-known preventive security solution that aims to improve network security by taking proactive actions, namely, hardening options. However, most existing network hardening approaches rely on a single hardening option, such as disabling unnecessary services, which becomes less effective when it comes to dealing with unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities. There lacks a heterogeneous approach that can combine different hardening options in an optimal way to deal with both unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose such an approach by unifying multiple hardening options, such as service diversifcation, frewall rule modifcation, adding, removing, and relocating network resources, and access control, all under the same model. We then apply security metrics designed for evaluating network resilience against unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities, and consequently derive optimal solutions to maximize security under given cost constraints. Finally, we study the effectiveness of our solution against unpatchable vulnerabilities through simulations.	access control;genetic algorithm;hardening (computing);heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;mission critical;network model;network security;relocation (computing);simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;vulnerability (computing)	Daniel Borbor;Lingyu Wang;Sushil Jajodia;Anoop Singhal	2018	Journal of Computer Security	10.3233/JCS-171106	theoretical computer science;distributed computing;heterogeneous network;computer science;hardening (computing);vulnerability	Security	-60.295160905091954	70.12582019878117	123640
19ad60483f16c8fc6ca2c07a38411dabc396f462	dbf: a general framework for anomaly detection in rfid systems		RFID technologies are making their way into numerous applications, including inventory management, supply chain, product tracking, transportation, logistics, etc. One important application is to automatically detect anomalies in RFID systems, such as missing tags, unknown tags, or cloned tags due to theft, management error, or targeted attacks. Existing solutions are all designed to detect a certain type of RFID anomalies, but lack a general functionality for detecting different types of anomalies. This paper attempts to propose a general framework for anomaly detection in RFID systems, thereby reducing the complexity for readers and tags to implement different anomaly-detection protocols. We introduce a new concept of differential Bloom filter (DBF), which turns physical-layer signal data into a segmented Bloom filter that encodes the IDs of abnormal tags. As a case study, we propose a protocol that builds DBF for identifying all missing tags in an efficient way. We implement a prototype for missing-tag identification using USRP and WISP tags to verify the effectiveness our protocol, and use large-scale simulations for performance evaluation. The results show that our solution can significantly improve time efficiency, when comparing with the best existing work.	anomaly detection;bloom filter;coexist (image);inventory;logistics;performance evaluation;prototype;radio-frequency identification;run time (program lifecycle phase);sensor;simulation;tag (metadata);universal software radio peripheral;wisp	Min Chen;Jia Liu;Shigang Chen;Yan Qiao;Yuanqing Zheng	2017	IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8056986	universal software radio peripheral;anomaly detection;distributed computing;supply chain;computer science;wireless;bloom filter	Mobile	-54.38236270280182	71.19842110850904	124070

To mitigate this problem, several trust management systems in the form of online ratings have been developed. The basic idea is that the system maintains reputation or trust-level of the buyers and sellers, and makes them available to other interested parties to make decisions to engage in a transaction. One of the reasons is the lack of trust that users have in Internet-enabled exchange of goods. The quality of the reputation value depends on the quality of the feedback provided by transacting partners. However, feedback is susceptible to various threats that render the trust management systems untrustworthy. This paper examines the vulnerabilities of feedback-related issues of trust management systems and suggests a mechanism to mitigate these threats.	e-commerce payment system;feedback;internet;management system;threat (computer);trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Soon-Keow Chong;Jemal H.

d2347755d3c73186c1a9a060e48279fa995989ae	video: enabling public cameras to talk to the public		"""This video presents a real-time end-to-end system which enables cameras to send personalized messages to people in a public area without knowing any addresses of their mobile phones. For facilitating this communication, we solve the problem of digitally associating people in the camera view with their smartphones without prior knowledge of the phones' IP/MAC addresses. The system doesn't need any dedicated devices and doesn't request people to wear digital tags. It utilizes users' motion patterns and leverages the diversity in motion features as the address for communication. The cameras broadcast a message to all the phones in the camera view using the target's motion features as the destination. Then a user's phone can locally compare the """"motion address"""" of the packet against its own sensor data and will accept the packet if it's a """"good"""" match. To protect the privacy of users' sensor data, we keep the users' personal sensing data on their phones instead of asking them to upload the data to server. Moreover, to prevent users' walking behavior from being revealed to public, we transform the raw motion features via principal component analysis (PCA) while maintaining their distinguishing power. On the whole, our system achieves 98%, 95%, 90%, 90%, 87% matching correctness for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 users respectively."""	correctness (computer science);end system;end-to-end encryption;mobile phone;network packet;personalization;principal component analysis;real-time clock;server (computing);smartphone;upload	Siyuan Cao;Habiba Farrukh;Junyu Wang	2018		10.1145/3210240.3211118	computer science;real-time computing;phone;broadcasting;upload;network packet;correctness	HCI	-52.30453455999827	67.37677323252748	124468

Therefore, we have designed a detection system which consists of four engines: network behavior analysis engine, host domain reputation analysis engine, critical API call pattern analysis engine, and Android permissions use analysis engine. Each of them monitors its specific part from Android apps and independently detects malicious behavior and, given the information from four engines, the correlator determines a final decision.

ed6be718944673ceff049aea658cf32bc5db0cb7	discovering abnormal behaviors via http header fields measurement	measurement;http header fields;abnormal behaviors;protocol	SummaryrnIn recent years, more and more intrusion detection systems and firewalls have been used to detect and block malicious applications or unknown protocols in order to enhance the security of systems. Therefore, some malicious applications begin to shape themselves as common ones to escape malicious protocol detection. Being an important protocol for many Internet services, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is responsible for nearly 10% of the traffic volume on the Internet. Therefore, many malicious applications pretend their traffic to be HTTP protocol to go into hiding their malicious behaviors. In the paper, we study the problem of discovering these abnormal behaviors in HTTP protocol traffic. We find that the characteristics of many abnormal behaviors are performed in the header fields of their shaping HTTP such as Tor and malicious web crawlers, and the information of HTTP header fields of HTTP traffic generated by normal application is also discussed. And then, a method based on the measurement of HTTP header fields proposed three patterns that make them specific to detect abnormal behaviors of shaping HTTP protocol. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective for abnormal behaviors by shaping to be HTTP on large-scale traffic of one Internet service provider. The experimental results also show that the proposed method could be extended to large-scale and high-speed network environment for detecting abnormal behaviors of shaping HTTP protocol.

In this research, we conduct autocorrelation analysis of traffic generated by several financial botnets, and we show that periodicity in the network traces can be used to distinguish these botnets from each other.	antivirus software;artificial neural network;autocorrelation;basic stamp;botnet;computer;hidden markov model;hypertext transfer protocol;machine learning;markov chain;network traffic control;quasiperiodicity;sensor;server (computing);support vector machine;tracing (software);word lists by frequency	Prathiba Nagarajan;Fabio Di Troia;Thomas H.

While VANETs are exposed to different sort of assault, there is require to accomplish the protection needs like message confidentiality, reliability, and validation. The validation procedure is assumed to be competent if it distinguishes negotiation nodes precisely by means of less complication, condensed validation postponement, and keying transparency. In this document, a trust-oriented validation format for cluster-oriented VANETs is projected.

b8998321a28407b1efb0db57acc269426b3f85c3	examination of a new defense mechanism: honeywords		Past experiences show us that password breach is still one of the main methods of attackers to obtain personal or sensitive user data. Basically, assuming they have access to list of hashed passwords, they apply guessing attacks, i.e., attempt to guess a password by trying a large number of possibilities. We certainly need to change our way of thinking and use a novel and creative approach in order to protect our passwords. In fact, there are already novel attempts to provide password protection. The Honeywords system of Juels and Rivest is one of them which provides a detection mechanism for password breaches. Roughly speaking, they propose a method for password-based authentication systems where fake passwords, i.e., “honeywords” are added into a password file, in order to detect impersonation. Their solution includes an auxiliary secure server called “honeychecker” which can distinguish a user’s real password among her honeywords and immediately sets off an alarm whenever a honeyword is used. However, they also pointed out that their system needs to be improved in various ways by highlighting some open problems. In this paper, after revisiting the security of their proposal, we specifically focus on and aim to solve a highlighted open problem, i.e., active attacks where the adversary modifies the code running on either the login server or the honeychecker.	adversary (cryptography);authentication;brute-force attack;graphics processing unit;https;key derivation function;password;server (computing)	Ziya Alper Genç;Süleyman Kardas;Mehmet Sabir Kiraz	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-93524-9_8	computer security;open problem;password;authentication;adversary;login;computer science	Security	-53.437913044682816	64.5427431978148	126191
26758a98172dfcaedb2b1026b73d9c0fa44ddd5d	understanding tor usage with privacy-preserving measurement		The Tor anonymity network is difficult to measure because, if not done carefully, measurements could risk the privacy (and potentially the safety) of the network's users. Recent work has proposed the use of differential privacy and secure aggregation techniques to safely measure Tor, and preliminary proof-of-concept prototype tools have been developed in order to demonstrate the utility of these techniques. In this work, we significantly enhance two such tools---PrivCount and Private Set-Union Cardinality---in order to support the safe exploration of new types of Tor usage behavior that have never before been measured. Using the enhanced tools, we conduct a detailed measurement study of Tor covering three major aspects of Tor usage: how many users connect to Tor and from where do they connect, with which destinations do users most frequently communicate, and how many onion services exist and how are they used. Our findings include that Tor has ~8 million daily users, a factor of four more than previously believed. We also find that ~40% of the sites accessed over Tor have a torproject.org domain name, ~10% of the sites have an amazon.com domain name, and ~80% of the sites have a domain name that is included in the Alexa top 1 million sites list. Finally, we find that ~90% of lookups for onion addresses are invalid, and more than 90% of attempted connections to onion services fail.	botnet;differential privacy;download;failure rate;heuristic;malware;network packet;prototype;proxy server;tor messenger;user experience	Akshaya Mani;T.

c0b5a9d1e2bc85ce2158567882ba2979f4b0aa7a	a machine learning model for classifying unsolicited iot devices by observing network telescopes		The Internet of Things [IoT] promises to revolutionize the way we interact with our surroundings. Smart cars, smart cities, smart homes are now being realized with the help of various embedded devices that operate with little to no human interaction. However these embedded devices bring forth a plethora of security challenges as most manufacturers still assign higher importance to the three Ps (prototyping, production and performance) than security. This inherent flaw has manifested itself in the form of various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks orchestrated with the help of unsolicited IoT devices on the Internet. We are even seeing massive throughputs without the need for amplifications affecting large scale infrastructures on the Internet. Thus, understanding the nature of these attacks and quickly identifying infected devices becomes imperative to combat this situation. In this paper we present a model to classify unsolicited IoT devices in enterprises using machine learning (ML). Namely IP header information from darknet data is collected for analysis. We then consider multiple supervised ML algorithms to classify these Layer 3 headers. We evaluate these algorithms and compare their performances in terms of accurately identifying activities of malicious IoT devices on the Internet. Our results show that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting have high recall and precision scores whereas NaiveBayes has the worst performance. We believe our model can be used by enterprises as a part of their intrusion detection system to quickly identify infected IoT devices within their own environment as well as identify scanning activities directed towards them.	algorithm;darknet;denial-of-service attack;embedded system;emulator;flaw hypothesis methodology;gradient boosting;imperative programming;internet of things;intrusion detection system;machine learning;malware;network telescope;parametric stereo;patch (computing);performance;precision and recall;random forest;san diego supercomputer center;smart city;supervised learning	Farooq Shaikh;Elias Bou-Harb;Jorge Crichigno;Nasir Ghani	2018	2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450404	ip header;computer network;gradient boosting;feature extraction;the internet;network layer;intrusion detection system;machine learning;darknet;denial-of-service attack;computer science;artificial intelligence	Security	-59.27388543485203	63.195966611729624	126680

Automatic means of achieving this verification has been studied for several decades. Indeed, a talking face offers many features to achieve a robust verification of identity. The current deployment of videophones drives new opportunities for a secured access to remote servers (banking, certification, call centers, etc.). The synchrony of the speech signal and lip movements is a necessary condition to check that the observed talking face has not been manipulated and/or synthesized. This overview addresses face, speaker and talking face verification, as well as face and voice transformation techniques. It is demonstrated that a dedicated impostor needs limited information from a client to fool state of the art audio-visual identity verification systems.	algorithm;biometrics;digital identity;identity verification service;information sensitivity;replay attack;software deployment	Bouchra Abboud;Hervé Bredin;Guido Aversano;Gérard Chollet	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-71505-4_8	speech recognition;computer science;multimedia;communication	Security	-50.53473859012172	67.4267188294338	127199

In this paper, we present a redundant channel model based on spatial correlation in IOT. The proposed model is mainly for attacks which could increase the traffic of the network such as DDos. Firstly, redundant channel is introduced systematically, including the spatial correlation. Then, a control mechanism is put forward for the model. A Matlab simulation is performed to test the availability of the model at last. And the results verify that this model is feasible to a certain degree. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.	channel (communications)	Fangjiao Zhang;Wei Guo;Jincui Yang;Fangfang Yuan;Lidong Zhai	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-35795-4_84	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Vision	-51.633140429638964	72.85927432186188	127204

Contrary to such approaches, we advocate proactively detecting and identifying botnets prior to their being used as part of a cyber-attack (Strayer et al., 2006). In this paper, we present our work on using machine learning-based classification techniques to identify the command and control (C2) traffic of IRC-based botnets - compromised hosts that are collectively commanded using Internet relay chat (IRC). We split this task into two stages: (I) distinguishing between IRC and non-IRC traffic, and (II) distinguishing between botnet and real IRC traffic. For stage I, we compare the performance of J48, naive Bayes, and Bayesian network classifiers, identify the features that achieve good overall classification accuracy, and determine the classification sensitivity to the training set size. While sensitive to the training data and the attributes used to characterize communication flows, machine learning-based classifiers show promise in identifying IRC traffic. Using classification in stage II is trickier, since accurately labeling IRC traffic as botnet and non-botnet is challenging. We are currently exploring labeling flows as suspicious and non-suspicious based on telltales of hosts being compromised	bayesian network;botnet;experiment;film-type patterned retarder;internet relay chat;machine learning;naive bayes classifier;network traffic control;sensor;test set;testbed;tracing (software)	Carl Livadas;Robert Walsh;David E.

Due to the deficiencies of permission mechanism of Android OS, an Android privacy protection system called Protectedroid is presented in this paper which is a model based on grey list and enables the design of security strategies more easily. Protectedroid adds an enforcing privacy protection module between App and private data. When an application is added to the grey list and intends to access sensitive data and resources, Protectedroid will intercept data access request and return false objects for the grey applications. Experimental results show that: Protectedroid can effectively throttle the privacy leakage and ensure the effectiveness and stability of the entire system.	android;data access;greylisting;information privacy;openness;operating system;personally identifiable information;spectral leakage;usability;user experience;visual intercept	Dapeng Wang;Guang Jin;Jiaming He;Xianliang Jiang;Zhijun Xie	2014	JSW		computer science;operating system;database;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;android	Security	-51.5970680651307	62.801640701386276	127669

In this cross-disciplinary paper, the authors survey some 160.000 HTTPS-enabled servers among popular web sites over a time period of three years. The research question is what effect the introduction of best practices and vulnerability publication have on web server security in the form of protocol support. Main findings include that (i) insecure configurations, although well known, can remain widespread for over a decade, (ii) the introduction of best practices affect the decline of insecure configurations only moderately, whereas highly publicized security flaws have a significant impact, and (iii) economic incentives for website owners to provide secure services are weak, motivating such other levers of influence as legislation or blocking of noncompliant sites."""	best practice;blocking (computing);cryptography;ecosystem;end-to-end encryption;goto;https;hypertext transfer protocol;internet security;server (computing);web server	Emil Larsson;Johan Sigholm	2016	2016 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427064	computer security model;cloud computing security;web application security;critical security studies;communications protocol;hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer;ecosystem;the internet;security through obscurity;security information and event management;security association;security convergence;asset;web standards;computer science;network security;information security standards;internet security;security service;internet privacy;network security policy;world wide web;computer security;best practice;computer network	Security	-53.60625546658438	62.25804492535883	127956

fa28f8a7ad15a32c5e332e54b679a3984236e148	leveraging sdn and webrtc for rogue access point security		Rogue access points (RAPs) are unauthorized devices connected to a network, providing unauthorized wireless access to one or more clients. Such devices pose significant risk to organizations, since they provide a convenient means for hackers and insiders to hide malicious or unsanctioned activities on industry, government, and campus networks. Yet, limitations inherent in traditional networks make detecting and removing such devices expensive, time consuming, and difficult to implement. For software-defined networks (SDNs), the risk of a network compromise due to RAPs is equally concerning, and methods for detecting RAPs within SDN architectures are needed. Hence, this paper leverages the capabilities of an SDN along with a trusted agent to detect and deny RAPs access to networks by using both generic and novel methods with minimal impact to performance. Three other contributions are included in this paper. They include: 1) utilizing an emerging Web architecture to detect hidden subnets; 2) developing the first, security-based, use case for Mininet-WiFi, a software-defined wireless network emulator; and 3) enhancing Ryuretic, a modular programming language for SDN application development.	authorization;emulator;hybrid testing;malware;modular programming;network address translation;network emulation;network switch;programming language;rapid refresh;redirection (computing);rogue access point;sensor;software-defined networking;subnetwork;testbed;webrtc;wireless access point;wireless router;wireless security	Jacob H.

There are numerous botnets, and some of them control millions of computers. Cyber criminals use botnets to launch spam e-mails and denial of service attacks; and commit click fraud and data theft. Governments use botnets for political purposes or to wage cyber warfare. The purpose of this paper is to review the botnet threats and the responses to the botnet threats. Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes how botnets are created and operated. Then, the paper discusses botnets in terms of architecture, attacking behaviors, communication protocols, observable botnet activities, rally mechanisms, and evasion techniques. Finally, the paper reviews state-of-the-art techniques for detecting and counteracting botnets, and also legal responses to botnet threats. Findings – Botnets have become the platform for many online threats such as spam, denial of service attacks, phishing, data thefts, and online frauds. Security researchers must develop technology to detect and take down botnets, and governments must develop capacity to crack down on botmasters and botnets. Individual computer owners must diligently take measures to keep their computers from becoming members of botnets. Originality/value – The paper provides a review of current status of botnets and a summary of up-to-date responses to botnets in both technical and legal aspects, which can be used as a stepping stone for further research.	botnet;click fraud;computer;crack down;cyberwarfare;data theft;denial-of-service attack;email;evasion (network security);observable;phishing;robot;sensor;spamming;stepping level	Ok-Ran Jeong;Chulyun Kim;Won Young Kim;Jungmin So	2011	IJWIS	10.1108/17440081111125635	cutwail botnet;communications protocol;the internet;mariposa botnet;design methods;srizbi botnet;rustock botnet;computer science;information security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;denial-of-service attack	Security	-57.32923016828189	63.89012922554502	128332
f6f1c5d0718c4cafa7c848d61cd308009a8d6ec7	evaluating itu-t g.9959 based wireless systems used in critical infrastructure assets		ITU-T G.9959 wireless connectivity is increasingly incorporated in the critical infrastructure. However, evaluating the robustness and security of commercially-available products based on this standard is challenging due to the closed-source nature of the transceiver and application designs. Given that ITU-T G.9959 transceivers are being used in smart grids, building security systems and safety sensors, the development of reliable, open-source tools would enhance the ability to monitor and secure ITU-T G.9959 networks. This chapter discusses the ITU-T G.9959 wireless standard and research on ITU-T G.9959 network security. An open-source, software-defined radio implementation of an ITU-T G.9959 protocol sniffer is used to explore several passive reconnaissance techniques and deduce the properties of active network devices. The experimental results show that some properties are observable regardless of whether or not encryption is used. In particular, the acknowledgment response times vary due to differences in vendor firmware implementations.		Christopher W. Badenhop;Jonathan D. Fuller;Joseph Hall;Benjamin W. P.

However, wireless communication faces several security threats. Consequently, several security efforts have been exerted to combat the wireless attacks, but unfortunately complete attack prevention is not realistically attainable. Thus, the emphasis on detecting intrusions through a second line of defense, in the form of Intrusion Detection System (IDS), is increasing. Selecting an effective and appropriate IDS system should take its functionality and performance evaluation into account. Unbiased and reliable evaluation necessarily depends on a well-engineered evaluation methodology. Dealing with this challenge, this paper proposed a holistic methodology for IDSs evaluation in wireless networks. Our methodology includes all necessary and sufficient tasks for IDSs evaluation. Also, we present holistic taxonomies of wireless IDSs and wireless security attacks from the perspective of the IDS evaluator.	holism;information security;intelligent decision support system;interpreter (computing);intrusion detection system;network security;performance evaluation;sensor;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;wireless router;wireless security	Khalid Nasr;Anas Abou El Kalam;Christian Fraboul	2011	2011 5th International Conference on Network and System Security	10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059954	wireless ad hoc network;wireless wan;telecommunications;computer science;information security;wireless network;security service;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;network access control;computer security;wireless intrusion prevention system;taxonomy;computer network	Mobile	-54.359543036629645	73.13160825267617	128552
9fc9487097ce40cf0e2261ca65b8e4dcea1b7738	towards improving service accessibility by adaptive resource distribution strategy		Along with the rapid development of Internet, accessibility has become one of the most basic and important requirements for Internet service. Service resource, the knowledge that can help users get access to the service finally, is the focus of accessibility confrontation between the adversary and Internet services. Most of current resource distribution strategies adopt the “many access points” design and limit the number of service resources distributed to any user. However, current design is vulnerable to enumeration attack where an adversary can enumerate many service resources under the disguise of many pseudonyms (Sybil identities). To mitigate this challenge, an adaptive resource distribution strategy based on trust management is proposed in this paper. Under this strategy, user’s trust is adjusted according to his behavior. Both client puzzle and the resources assigned to the user are dynamically generated according to his trust value. Simulation result indicates that, this strategy can distinguish honest users from adversary Sybils, thus increasing the difficulty for an attacker to enumerate service resources while ensuring access to service for honest users.	accessibility	Jinqiao Shi;Xiao Wang;Binxing Fang;Qingfeng Tan;Li Guo	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-23829-6_39	knowledge management;management science	HPC	-58.79692308317906	72.59029702471192	128672
0b5a3f5200e3e79f4ad3579738b9e9a7c7aed428	iritrack: liveness detection using irises tracking for preventing face spoofing attacks		Face liveness detection has become a widely used technique with a growing importance in various authentication scenarios to withstand spoofing attacks. Existing methods that perform liveness detection generally focus on designing intelligent classifiers or customized hardware to differentiate between the image or video samples of a real legitimate user and the imitated ones. Although effective, they can be resource-consuming and detection results may be sensitive to environmental changes. In this paper, we take iris movement as a significant liveness sign and propose a simple and efficient liveness detection system named IriTrack. Users are required to move their eyes along with a randomly generated poly-line, and trajectories of irises are then used as evidences for liveness detection. IriTrack allows checking liveness by using data collected during user-device interactions. We implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The results show that IriTrack can fend against spoofing attacks with a moderate and adjustable time overhead.	authentication;experiment;interaction;liveness;overhead (computing);procedural generation;prototype;spoofing attack	Meng Shen;Maria Dolores Borr&#x00E1;s;Liehuang Zhu;Rashid Mijumbi;Xiaojiang Du;Jiankun Hu	2018	CoRR		theoretical computer science;real-time computing;spoofing attack;computer science;authentication;liveness	Security	-52.6634647891078	65.56203920360164	128703
012414678c5df105950361c4a0a3908f5d2c4cdb	a data mining approach using transaction patterns for card fraud detection.		Credit and debit cards, rather than actual money, have becom the universal payment means. With these cards, it has becom e possible to buy expensive items easily without an additiona l complex authentication procedure being conducted. Howev er, card transaction features are targeted by criminals seeking to u se a lost or stolen card and looking for a chance to replicate i t. Accidents, whether caused by the negligence of users or not, that lead to a transaction being performed by a criminal rather than the a uthorized card user should be prevented. Therefore, card companies ar e providing their clients with a variety of policies and stan d rds to cover this eventuality. Card companies must therefore be ab le to distinguish between the rightful user and illegal user s according to these standards in order to minimize damage resulting fro m unauthorized transactions. However, there is a limit to applying the same fixed standards to all card users, since the transaction patterns of people d iffer and even individuals’ transaction patterns may change frequen tly due to changes income and consumption preference. There for , when only a specific threshold is applied, it is di fficult to distinguish a fraudulent card transaction from a leg itimate one.

9f0d3d28cebb1576010992d89139f9e5ef55f13f	network traffic identification with convolutional neural networks		Network traffic identification plays a major role in modern-day network monitoring systems. Most network systems identify traffic based on features such as, flow statistics, static signatures and port numbers. Identifying network traffic is essential, because plenty of information regarding a network flow can be learned by knowing the application protocol associated with it. However, the challenge for traffic classification is to identify features in the network flow data. This paper explores the issue of network traffic identification with neural network and deep learning. A convolutional neural network (CNN) with different optimization algorithms is trained to identify application protocols based on network flow data. The image and text processing hypothesis of the CNN model is extended to naturally fit to the curated dataset. Protocol labels with a high frequency distribution are easily detected by the model, and the results show that the CNN model works equally well on network flow data. A discussion on the performance of different optimization algorithms used with the CNN model is presented.	algorithm;artificial neural network;convolutional neural network;deep learning;flow network;mathematical optimization;network packet;network traffic control;signature;traffic classification	M.

Although recent efforts have shed light on particular security issues, there remains little insight into broader security characteristics of smartphone applications. This paper seeks to better understand smartphone application security by studying 1,100 popular free Android applications. We introduce the ded decompiler, which recovers Android application source code directly from its installation image. We design and execute a horizontal study of smartphone applications based on static analysis of 21 million lines of recovered code. Our analysis uncovered pervasive use/misuse of personal/phone identifiers, and deep penetration of advertising and analytics networks. However, we did not find evidence of malware or exploitable vulnerabilities in the studied applications. We conclude by considering the implications of these preliminary findings and offer directions for future analysis.	android;application security;decompiler;identifier;malware;mobile app;mobile security;smartphone;static program analysis	William Enck;Damien Octeau;Patrick D.

In order to make data and information omnipresent, it needs to be shared anywhere and anytime. However the reliance of user on a PC or laptop for the same is not efficient. This paper is about the innovative way to overcome this restriction. This paper discusses the development of a portable device with the use of wired and wireless communication applications to share data and information among distinct storage devices without relying on a PC or a laptop. The proposed device is compact, comprises of a touch screen, power source and is capable of transferring all types of files. Hence, it eliminates the dependence on a PC or a laptop for transferring data.	an/cyz-10	Darshana Rarath;Mayank Sharma;Akshay Mane;Pooja Dabral;Roshani Raut	2017	iJES		computer science;laptop;computer hardware;wireless;embedded system;data transmission	ML	-49.369631452242935	65.09611914308	129216

First of all, what threat models are we assuming, and what kind of censors are we talking about. In this paper we are assuming a passive global censor, that basically means there is some well-founded organization who would be able to sit at the backbone of some internet communication, possibly on the outgoing router of some internet infrastructure, and watch all communication going in and out of the domain. And what they do is, they will inspect the packet contents, possibly deep-packet inspection on the TCP session, etc, and detect any content which is in blacklist. If any of the blacklisted keywords is being detected in that TCP session, then the adversary will try to block the connection by various means. What the censor will not do is trying to actively modify the communication channel, it will only observe passively. One readily available example in the real world is the Great Firewall project of the Chinese government. Basically it observes all traffic goes in and out of China, uses deep-packet inspection techniques to detect any blacklist keywords, and if any of them is detected then it will inject a malformed packet to disrupt the TCP session, and cause the connection to reset.

High popularity and availability of Internet and intranets enables easy designing of distributed control systems which has to fulfill signal transmission security requirements in order to protect transmitted data from unprivileged access or change. There are several approaches to transmission security problem. This paper focuses on low cost solution - TCP connections tunneling using well known SSH protocol. In opposition to commercial solutions, the use of SSH client application requires almost no user privileges on client system. To accomplish this task LVST-universal tool for TCP/IP data tunneling has been built. The tool is used for securing measurement/control data transmission, SCADA system connection as well as secure operation on remote PLCs and data acquisition servers. Application of created tool for laboratory scale heat distribution plant is presented.	automatic control;client (computing);data acquisition;distributed control system;download;internet;intranet;requirement;transmission security;tunneling protocol	Przemyslaw Plesowicz;Piotr Laszczyk	2013	2013 18th International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR)		embedded system;computer science;tunneling protocol;computer security;computer network;scada	Embedded	-51.4026533351905	67.98853965058828	129775

This success is largely due to the APIs and support offered by prominent social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google, on the basis of new open standards such as the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol. A formal analysis of these protocols must account for malicious websites and common web application vulnerabilities, such as cross-site request forgery and open redirectors. We model several configurations of the OAuth 2.0 protocol in the applied pi-calculus and verify them using ProVerif. Our models rely on WebSpi, a new library for modeling web applications and web-based attackers that is designed to help discover concrete website attacks. Our approach is validated by finding dozens of previously unknown vulnerabilities in popular websites such as Yahoo and WordPress, when they connect to social networks such as Twitter and Facebook.	application programming interface;authorization;cross-site request forgery;oauth;proverif;social network;surface web;web application;wordpress;π-calculus	Chetan Bansal;Karthikeyan Bhargavan;Antoine Delignat-Lavaud;Sergio Maffeis	2014	Journal of Computer Security	10.3233/JCS-140503	π-calculus;formal verification;computer science;internet security;internet privacy;cross-site request forgery;threat model;world wide web;computer security	Security	-54.45290934154667	60.99427245222366	130096

While the research community has started to investigate a diverse set of Bluetooth security issues, little is known about the feasibility and the propagation dynamics of a worm in a Bluetooth environment. This paper is an initial attempt to remedy this situation.We start by showing that the Bluetooth protocol design and implementation is large and complex. We gather traces and we use controlled experiments to investigate whether a large-scale Bluetooth worm outbreak is viable today. Our data shows that starting a Bluetooth worm infection is easy, once a vulnerability is discovered. Finally, we use trace-drive simulations to examine the propagation dynamics of Bluetooth worms. We find that Bluetooth worms can infect a large population of vulnerable devices relatively quickly, in just a few days.	bluetooth;communications protocol;experiment;malware;simulation;software propagation;tracing (software)	Jing Su;Kelvin K.

Often, a trusted hardware device is used to decide if a provided biometric feature is sufficiently close to the features stored by the legitimate user during enrollment. In this paper, we address the question whether the stored features can be extracted with side-channel attacks. We consider several models for types of leakage that are relevant specifically for fingerprint verification, and show results for attacks against the Bozorth3 and a custom matching algorithm. This work shows an interesting path for future research on the susceptibility of biometric algorithms towards side-channel attacks.	algorithm;authentication;fingerprint;hardware restriction;side-channel attack;spectral leakage	Markus Dürmuth;David Oswald;Niklas Pastewka	2016		10.1145/2995289.2995294	fingerprint verification competition;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-48.54475820835846	68.263869333662	130821
850892ba365bf5cb9fb9b847bb692ad1f23c6492	sensor-based user authentication		We study the feasibility of leveraging the sensors embedded on mobile devices to enable a user authentication mechanism that is easy for users to perform, but hard for attackers to bypass. The proposed approach lies on the fact that users perform gestures in a unique way that depends on how they hold the phone, and on their hand’s geometry, size, and flexibility. Based on this observation, we introduce two new unlock gestures that have been designed to enable the phone’s embedded sensors to properly capture the geometry and biokinetics of the user’s hand during the gesture. The touch sensor extracts the geometry and timing of the user hand, while the accelerometer and gyro sensors record the displacement and rotation of the mobile device during the gesture. When combined, a sensor fingerprint for the user is generated. In this approach, potential attackers need to simultaneously reproduce the touch, accelerometer, and gyro sensor signatures to falsely authenticate. Using 5000 gestures recorded over two user studies involving a total of 70 subjects, our results indicate that sensor fingerprints can accurately differentiate users while achieving less than 2.5% false accept and false reject rates. Attackers that directly observe the true user authenticating on a device, can successfully bypass authentication only 3% of the time.	antivirus software;authentication;displacement mapping;embedded system;fingerprint;gyro;mobile device;sim lock;sensor	Junyu Wang;Dimitrios Lymberopoulos;Jie Liu	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-15582-1_11	data authentication algorithm;ntlmssp;chip authentication program;challenge–response authentication;authentication protocol;internet authentication service;generic bootstrapping architecture;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;email authentication;challenge-handshake authentication protocol	Mobile	-51.886602819785196	66.21021534666772	131121

This service enables groups of people in geographically remote locations to share les using an untrusted network. For example, distribution of an organization's software to all the organization's sites can be accomplished using this service. Distribution of les in an untrusted network is complicated by two issues: (1) location of les and (2) veri cation of le integrity. ftp and World-wide Web (WWW) services require some user intervention to locate a le, so they cannot be embedded in automated systems. Distributed systems have mechanisms for automated le location and retrieval, but they require trust in all system principals and do not provide an appropriate balance between availability of les and retrieval cost for our applications. Veri cation of the integrity of a le retrieved from an untrusted network is necessary because the le is subject to malicious modi cation attacks. Our service provides the capability to automatically locate, retrieve, and verify les speci ed by a client using a single trusted principal. We demonstrate our service by building a system shell that automatically downloads remote software when needed.	ampersand;authentication;certificate authority;cryptographic hash function;cryptography;download;embedded system;server (computing);spoofing attack;www;world wide web	Trent Jaeger;Aviel D.

One of the most serious threats to cloud computing itself comes from Denial of Service attacks, especially HTTP or XML-Based Denial of Service attacks. These types of attacks are simple and easy to implement by the attacker, but to security experts they are twice as difficult to stop. In this paper, we introduced a security service called Cloud Tracing & Filtering (CTF), which is like a service broker within a SOA model, and a back propagation neutral network called Cloud Shield, which was trained to detect and filter DoS attack traffic. And we also presented a solution to detect and trace through CTF to find the source of those attacks. The experimental results show that CTF is able to detect and filter most of the attack messages and to identify the source of the attack within a short period of time.	backpropagation;charge trap flash;cloud computing;computer;denial-of-service attack;hypertext transfer protocol;information;internet;security service (telecommunication);service-oriented architecture;software propagation;xml	Fan Lin;Wenhua Zeng;Yi Jiang	2010	JDCTA		filter (signal processing);internet privacy;computer science;tracing;computer security;cloud computing;denial-of-service attack	Security	-59.75789974450841	66.60954019452052	131311

Thus, it is of paramount importance to protect the networks from attackers. Consequently, the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are quickly becoming a popular requirement in building a network security infrastructure. Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT. Carried out experiments showed that our proposed system presents better performance as well as a good scalability compared to the pioneer known centralized IDS SNORT system over real traffic and a set of simulated attacks.	agent-based model;anomaly detection;centralized computing;data mining;distributed computing;distributed web crawling;experiment;extensibility;intrusion detection system;misuse detection;mobile agent;network security;programming paradigm;response time (technology);scalability;snort;whole earth 'lectronic link	Imen Brahmi;Sadok Ben Yahia;Pascal Poncelet	2011	Proceedings of the International Conference on Security and Cryptography		anomaly-based intrusion detection system;intrusion detection system;embedded system;host-based intrusion detection system;mobile telephony;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;intrusion prevention system	Security	-61.103525202193694	66.7335359571336	131368
068e70ebfa69cbd0bdef26f365bb4a6d0d14a93d	from big data to knowledge: a spatio-temporal approach to malware detection		Abstract The deployment of endpoint protection has been gradually migrated from individual clients to remote cloud servers, which is termed as cloud based security service. The new paradigm of security defense produces a large amount of data and log files, and motivates data-driven techniques for detecting malicious software. This paper conducts an empirical study on the log of a real cloud based security service to characterize the occurrence of executable files in end hosts, which concerns 124,782 benign and 113,305 malicious executable files occurred in 165,549,417 end hosts. The end hosts and the timestamps that an executable file occurs in provide insights into the distribution of software in wild from spatial and temporal perspectives, respectively. Meanwhile, we investigate the strategies behind the characterizations, and observe the preferential attachment process and the periodicity of file occurrence in end hosts. The observed different occurrence patterns of benign and malicious files in end hosts inspire us a new scalable approach to malware detection. We learn from the characterizations that, the associated files shared more spatial and temporal information in common are more likely to be same in their labels, either benign or malicious. Thus, we devise a graph based semi-supervised learning algorithm for real-time malware detection by taking into account the spatio-temporal information of the distribution of executable files. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach increases the performance on malware detection by 14.7% over previous techniques on average.	big data;malware	Weixuan Mao;Zhongmin Cai;Yuan Yang;Xiaohong Shi;Xiaohong Guan	2018	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2017.12.005	computer science;internet privacy;malware;cloud computing;software deployment;scalability;big data;distributed computing;server;security service;executable	ML	-60.35223140952975	63.9151848309789	131436

In this paper, we introduce a third approach: we present a system for filtering spam that takes into account how messages are sent by spammers. More precisely, we focus on the email delivery mechanism, and analyze the communication at the SMTP protocol level. We introduce two complementary techniques as concrete instances of our new approach. First, we leverage the insight that different mail clients (and bots) implement the SMTP protocol in slightly different ways. We automatically learn these SMTP dialects and use them to detect bots during an SMTP transaction. Empirical results demonstrate that this technique is successful in identifying (and rejecting) bots that attempt to send emails. Second, we observe that spammers also take into account server feedback (for example to detect and remove non-existent recipients from email address lists).

a815e57b3ff05e5230b1f3e95e9fa8d9c8690785	introduction to this issue	introduction	This issue of the Information Security Technical Report (ISTR) is on the subject of smart card applications and security. It is almost certain that the readers of this journal will have a number of different smart cards (chip cards) in their wallets, such as ‘‘chip & PIN’’ debit and credit cards, a transport card, identity card, perhaps loyalty cards, and so on. The SIM card in a mobile phone is simply a ‘‘reduced’’ smart card. Given the importance of many of these cards, it is not surprising that fraudsters have made constant efforts to compromise them and that chip manufacturers are always trying to improve the security of their products. Recent highprofile examples include the compromise of the MIFARE Classic transport card and the compromise of bank cards at retail outlets, although to be fair this second example is more to do with system failures than chip weaknesses. In recent years there has been a move towards the use of multi-application smart cards – imagine the convenience of having just a single smart card that can be used for banking, transport, identity, passport control, storing health records, etc! Only one PIN to remember – fantastic! The more pessimistic amongst us will be thinking ‘‘What if I forget the PIN?’’, ‘‘What if I lose the card – will I become a non-person?’’, ‘‘What if a fraudster is able to use my card – will I become a nonperson, with no money?’’. For the future, could such issues be addressed by the use of biometrics? The eight articles in this issue of the ISTR fall into two separate categories, namely those primarily concerned with smart card security and those mainly concerned with the security of smart card applications. The first article, by Xuefei Leng, introduces the subject of smart cards, smart card attacks and some countermeasures. This is followed by an article by Konstantinos Markantonakis et al., which explores smart card attacks and defences in depth, with specific examples of attacks on cards used in satellite TV systems, EMV (chip & PIN) bank cards and proximity identification cards. They also make the very relevant point that the smart card is only part of the system and that the security of the overall system must be considered. Tony Boswell also looks at the security of smart cards, but the main thrust of his article relates to the evaluation and certification of smart card security and the issues surrounding these topics. Damien Sauveron considers in detail the security of multiapplication cards and points out that while most of the technological issues have been solved there are still many other concerns that need to be addressed, including social and business issues. The article by Wolfgang Rankl looks at the security of a fundamental smart card application, namely the PIN verification routine on the card. The next two articles consider specific smart card applications. Keith Mayes et al. investigate transport ticketing security and fraud, with a fascinating case study of the MIFARE Classic card, whilst Ingo Liersch considers the highly topical subject of the security of machine-readable travel documents (e-passports). The final article, by Serge Chaumetteand Damien Sauveron, investigates the use of smart cards in grid computing, or (in their words) how smart cards, which are among the smallest computing systems, could help secure remote computing platforms, which are among the biggest computing systems. The security of smart cards and smart card applications is clearly a huge and highly relevant topic and we have only just scratched its surface in the eight articles in this journal. There is something for everybody in this issue of the Information Security Technical Report – I hope you enjoy reading it.	biometric passport;biometrics;cloud computing;damien doligez;grid computing;human-readable medium;information security;mobile phone;money;sega card;smart card;subscriber identity module;thrust;while	Michael J.

e3b2e9ac66d8d1f69aba883fa32d0e8df825e770	5g-vrsec: secure video reporting service in 5g enabled vehicular networks		Despite an imminent arrival of the 5G communication technology, there are only a few research works done using such technology in the field of vehicular networks. One of the pioneers in proposing a service for 5G enabled vehicular networks is the Eiza-Ni-Shi Scheme. In such scheme, the authors present an innovative systemmodel for 5G vehicular networks that enables a secure real-time video reporting service with privacy awareness. Even though the proposed service is very important since it aims to improve the road safety, it cannot be considered secure enough. This work found that the scheme has serious security flaws and functionality limitations. First, it is vulnerable to Department of Motor Vehicles and Law Enforcement Agency impersonation attacks, it allows forged video upload, there is no separation of responsibilities between Law Enforcement Agency and trusted authority, and it is susceptible to privileged insider attack. In addition, it does not contemplate themanagement of multiple geographic/administrative regions (multiple trusted authorities) which is important in real implementations. In this situation, the present work proposes an extended scheme that eliminates the identified security flaws and implements new features that make the implementation across several geographic/administrative regions possible.

0b2e2d60e1d15c4f476d6f93ce2239265ccd3bd0	location privacy breach: apps are watching you in background		Smartphone users can conveniently install a set of apps that provide Location Based Service (LBS) from markets. These LBS-based apps facilitate users in many application scenarios, but they raise concerns on the breach of privacy related to location access. Smartphone users can hardly perceive location access, especially when it happens in background. In comparison to location access in foreground, location access in background could result in more serious privacy breach because it can continuously know a user's locations. In this paper, we study the problem of location access in background, and especially perform the first measurement of this background action on the Google app market. Our investigation demonstrates that many popular apps conduct location access in background within short intervals. This enables these apps to collect a user's location trace, from which the important personal information, Points of Interest (PoIs), can be recognized. We further extract a user's movement pattern from the PoIs, and utilize it to measure the extent of privacy breach. The measurement results also show that using the combination of movement pattern related metrics and the other PoI related metrics can help detect the privacy breach in an earlier manner than using either one of them alone.	information privacy;location-based service;personally identifiable information;point of interest;privacy law;smartphone	Dachuan Liu;Xing Gao;Haining Wang	2017	2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	10.1109/ICDCS.2017.227	computer science;location-based service;point of interest;internet privacy;personally identifiable information;computer security;mobile telephony	Mobile	-50.45247543782287	62.9598611495673	132646

e3975f0ecd2d013f836f6c1d6205b9008086d0e2	side-channel attack on a protected rfid card		Side-channel attack is a known security risk to smart cards, and there have been efforts by smart card manufacturers to incorporate side-channel attack countermeasures. In this paper, we study a widely used smart card that uses the 3DES algorithm. First, a platform is setup to extract the power consumption information from the electromagnetic wave. Based on the findings from the initial analysis, we determine that the card is equipped with a “head and tail protection” mechanism. Second, a chosen-plaintext power analysis with a complexity of 216 is proposed, which is designed to recover the second round key from the power leakage in the third round. Then, a slicing-collision-algebraic attack is presented, which decreases the complexity to 26 rapidly. The experiments show that after collecting 20000 power traces (in approximately 200 s), only  $2^{6} \times 8$  key guesses and another 177 searches (about 300 seconds) are sufficient in recovering the 56-bit source keys of DES successfully. In other words, we demonstrate how the security of the 3DES card can be easily compromised, using side-channel attacks. Finally, we recommend that the head and tail protection should extend to the first and last four rounds, at the minimal, in order to be side-channel attack resilience.	algorithm;experiment;key schedule;linear algebra;plaintext;side-channel attack;smart card;spectral leakage;tracing (software);triple des	Rixin Xu;Liehuang Zhu;An Wang;Xiaojiang Du;Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo;Guoshuang Zhang;Keke Gai	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870663	power analysis;smart card;computer network;key (lock);encryption;side channel attack;computer science;leakage (electronics);countermeasure	Security	-50.0395754156976	70.79863605911574	132858

This paper proposes that the experience and expertise of creating simulator-defined false naval targets is very beneficial to the field of security by obscurity for computer network warfare. The conceptual modelling electronic warfare methodology can be applied to the creation of false Registration Authorities. Moreover Public Key Infrastructure database maintenance actions can be conducted by using modularity and increased complexity techniques acquired again from the electronic warfare simulator duality. Many common parts are detected and clearly identified leading to the conclusion that research in one discipline is very beneficial to the other in terms of design time overhead, maintenance time turnover and return on investment.	network security policy;network-centric warfare;overhead (computing);public key infrastructure;security through obscurity;simulation;stored procedure;systems concepts	Theodoros G.

d4641bd059611be73e570d8eda1da3dd8dec7b1d	an efficient intrusion alerts miner for forensics readiness in high speed networks		Intrusion Detection System is considered as a core tool in the collection of forensically relevant evidentiary data in real or near real time from the network. The emergence of High Speed Network (HSN) and Service oriented architecture/Web Services (SOA/WS) putted the IDS in face of a typical big data management problem. The log files that IDS generates are very enormous making very fastidious and both compute and memory intensive the forensics readiness process. Furthermore the high level rate of wrong alerts complicates the forensics expert alert analysis and it disproves its performance, efficiency and ability to select the best relevant evidences to attribute attacks to criminals. In this context, we propose Alert Miner (AM), an intrusion alert classifier, which classifies efficiently in near real-time the intrusion alerts in HSN for Web services. AM uses an outlier detection technique based on an adaptive deduced association rules set to classify the alerts automatically and without human assistance. AM reduces false positive alerts without losing high sensitivity (up to 95%) and accuracy up to (97%). Therefore AM facilitates the alert analysis process and allows the investigators to focus their analysis on the most critical alerts on near real-time scale and to postpone less critical alerts for an off-line log analysis.

Thus, with decentralized network management, service discovery becomes an important part of maintaining and protecting computer networks.  We explore two approaches to service discovery: active probing and passive monitoring. Active probing finds all services currently on the network, except services temporarily unavailable or hidden by firewalls; however, it is often too invasive, especially if used across administrative boundaries. Passive monitoring can find transient services, but misses services that are idle. We compare the accuracy of passive and active approaches to service discovery and show that they are complimentary, highlighting the need for multiple active scans coupled with long-duration passive monitoring. We find passive monitoring is well suited for quickly finding popular services, finding servers responsible for 99% of incoming connections within minutes. Active scanning is better suited to rapidly finding all servers, which is important for vulnerability detection - one scan finds 98% of services in two hours, missing only a handful. External scans are an unexpected ally to passive monitoring, speeding service discovery by the equivalent of 9-15 days of additional observation. Finally, we show how the use of static or dynamic addresses changes the effectiveness of service discovery, both due to address reuse and VPN effects.	ct scan;computer;firewall (computing);linear probing;privacy;provisioning;service discovery;virtual private network	Genevieve Bartlett;John S.

ca0f6f4fa68c2a685b3217108ec88da78a9c7552	eavesdropping of magnetic secure transmission signals and its security implications for a mobile payment protocol		Magnetic secure transmission (MST) is a technology that emulates the action of swiping a magstripe card in a card reader in that it artificially generates the magnetic signal produced when a card is swiped. MST provides extremely high backward compatibility, i.e., mobile payment using an MST device is possible through most conventional magstripe readers. However, MST devices transmit magnetic signals to a remote magstripe card reader. Hence, it is possible to eavesdrop on such signals. We developed a device that can remotely eavesdrop on magnetic signals emitted by MST devices. Thus, we could obtain the one-time payment token contained in such signals at a maximum distance of 2.7 m. We successfully performed a wormhole attack against Samsung Pay, a widely used MST-based mobile payment service, and we were able to execute payment a few kilometers from where the eavesdropped one-time token was actually created.	backward compatibility;card reader;emulator;magnetic stripe card;mobile payment;secure transmission	Daeseon Choi;Younho Lee	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2859447	mobile payment;computer science;secure transmission;backward compatibility;computer network;payment;security token;card reader;eavesdropping	Security	-52.92360011255763	69.29804650663115	133759

Usually these attacks exploit security flaws in the implementation of the ARP protocol at hosts. Up to now, detecting such attacks required setting up a machine with special-purpose software for this task. As an additional problem, few intrusion detection systems (IDS) are able to prevent MitM attacks. In this work we present a low-cost embedded IDS which, when plugged into a switch or hub, is able to detect and/or prevent MitM attacks automatically and efficiently. Since our system is limited to a micro-controller and a network interface, it can be produced at a very low cost, which is attractive for large scale production and deployment.	embedded system;intrusion detection system;man-in-the-middle attack;microcontroller;network interface controller;packet analyzer;sensor;software deployment;usb hub	Jorge Belenguer;Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate	2007	The International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems, and Technologies (SECUREWARE 2007)	10.1109/SECUREWARE.2007.4385321	man-in-the-middle attack;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-57.95124553424466	66.89133702896218	133781

It needs only a few seconds to take their machines to hotspots and do a little configuration in order to have Internet access. However, this portability becomes a double-edged sword for ignorant network users. Network protocol analyzers are typically developed for network performance analysis. Nonetheless, they can also be used to reveal user’s privacy by classifying network traffic. Some characteristics in IEEE 802.11 traffic particularly help identify users. Like actual human fingerprints, there are also unique traffic characteristics for each network user. They are called network user fingerprints, by tracking whichmore than half of network users can be connected to their traffic even with medium access control (MAC) layer pseudonyms. On the other hand, the concept of network user fingerprint is likely to be a powerful tool for intrusion detection and computer/digital forensics. As with actual criminal investigations, comparison of sampling data to training datamay increase confidence in criminal specification. This article focuses on a survey on a user fingerprinting technique of IEEE 802.11wireless LAN traffic.We also summarize some of the researches on IEEE 802.11 network characteristic analysis to figure out rogue APs and MAC protocol misbehaviors. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

cfc6e81bbfb366cc684001897c5c0160a5fa3ee8	the impact of dnssec on the internet landscape		In this dissertation we investigate the security deficiencies of the Domain Name System (DNS) and assess the impact of the DNSSEC security extensions. DNS spoofing attacks divert an application to the wrong server, but are also used routinely for blocking access to websites. We provide evidence for systematic DNS spoofing in China and Iran with measurement-based analyses, which allow us to examine the DNS spoofing filters from vantage points outside of the affected networks. Third-parties in other countries can be affected inadvertently by spoofing-based domain filtering, which could be averted with DNSSEC. The security goals of DNSSEC are data integrity and authenticity. A point solution called NSEC3 adds a privacy assertion to DNSSEC, which is supposed to prevent disclosure of the domain namespace as a whole. We present GPU-based attacks on the NSEC3 privacy assertion, which allow efficient recovery of the namespace contents. We demonstrate with active measurements that DNSSEC has found wide adoption after initial hesitation. At server-side, there are more than five million domains signed with DNSSEC. A portion of them is insecure due to insufficient cryptographic key lengths or broken due to maintenance failures. At client-side, we have observed a worldwide increase of DNSSEC validation over the last three years, though not necessarily on the last mile. Deployment of DNSSEC validation on end hosts is impaired by intermediate caching components, which degrade the availability of DNSSEC. However, intermediate caches contribute to the performance and scalability of the Domain Name System, as we show with trace-driven simulations. We suggest that validating end hosts utilize intermediate caches by default but fall back to autonomous name resolution in case of DNSSEC failures.

This paper presents an empirical study of bogon route announcements, as observed at eight vantage points on the Internet. On average, we observe several bogon routes leaked every few days; a small number of ASes also temporarily leak hundreds of bogon routes. About 40% of these bogon routes are not withdrawn for at least a day. We observed 110 different ASes originating routes for bogon prefixes and a few ASes that were responsible for advertising a disproportionate number of these routes. We also find that some ASes that do filter unallocated prefixes continue to filter them for as long as five months after they have been allocated, mistakenly filtering valid routes. Both of these types of delinquencies have serious implications: the failure to filter valid prefixes can could make nefarious activities such as denial of service attacks difficult to trace; failure to update filters when new prefixes are allocated prevents legitimate routes from being globally visible."""	address space;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);bogon filtering;denial-of-service attack;ianal;inter-domain;internet;private network;routing	Nick Feamster;Jaeyeon Jung;Hari Balakrishnan	2004	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/1052812.1052826	border gateway protocol;telecommunications;computer science;empirical research;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Metrics	-57.542630376588065	68.84940408707378	134057

The ability to obfuscate the adversary's view of an organization's internal network is thought to confound the adversary's network reconnaissance steps, causing certain inefficiencies in nation state actors' attack processes. Novel Moving Target Network (MTN) techniques have been proposed specifically to hide communicating endpoint identities, blinding the adversary's view of the nodes in the network. To date, however, no published work has evaluated identity-only obfuscation approaches against using IPsec ESP tunnels as a way of hiding endpoint identities. The question is, are there some network configurations where identity-only obfuscation techniques work better than IPsec ESP tunnels? We present arguments that low-overhead MTN identity-only obfuscation approaches may work more efficiently on wireless mobile, tactical, peer-to-peer networks where processing energies and transmission bandwidth are constrained and we also discuss features of metrics for measuring the success of moving target network approaches, helping to guide future research in this area.	adversary (cryptography);blinding (cryptography);communication endpoint;ipsec;intranet;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;vulnerability scanner	Russell A.

MCPS greatly impact the society with high-quality medical services and low-cost ubiquitous healthcare. The major component that integrates the physical world with the cyber space is wireless body area network WBAN of medical sensors and actuators worn or implanted in a patient. The life-critical nature of MCPS mandates safe and effective system design. MCPS must operate safely under malicious attacks. Authentication ensures that a medical device is what it claims to be and does what it declares to do, the first line of MCPS defense. Traditional authentication mechanisms, relied on cryptography, are not applicable to MCPS because of the constraints on computing/communication/energy resources. Recent innovations to secure mobile wireless sensor networks, with multi-sensor fusion to save power consumption, are not adequate. Besides challenges, MCPS present grand opportunities with the unique physical features of WBAN for non-cryptographic authentication and human-aided security. This paper proposes an authentication framework for MCPS. By studying medical processes and investigating healthcare adversaries, the novel design crosses physical world and cyber space. With uneven resource allocation, resource-scarce WBAN utilizes no encryption for authentication. Evaluation of this authentication protocol shows promising aspects and ease of adaptability.

However, this development creates new vulnerabilities when these protocols are designed to solely rely on existing security solutions of existing protocols such as TCP and UDP. It is clear that not all security protocols (such as TLS) can be used to protect UDT, just as security solutions devised for wired networks cannot be used to protect the unwired ones. The development of UDT, similarly in the development of TCP/UDP many years ago, lacked a well-thought security architecture to address the problems that networks are presently experiencing. This paper proposes and analyses practical security mechanisms for UDT.		Danilo Valeros Bernardo;Doan B.

Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) solutions are one of such applications that have dramatically been transformed. This is mainly due to increasing number of attacks as well as sophisticated nature of today's intrusions. Moreover, it has been shown that various critical components of a system can be targeted. This is further exasperated by the fact that most DIDS models do not consider attacks that targets the collaborative network itself. We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion. We call our proposed DIDS model Consultative Trusted Computing-based Collaborative IDS (CTC IDS). We utilize the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for integrity evaluation and to fine-tune peer evaluation.	categorization;collaborative network;intrusion detection system;simulation;trust management (information system);trusted computing;trusted platform module	Hadi KhorasaniZadeh;Norbik Bashah Idris;Jamalul-lail Ab Manan	2012	Proceedings Title: 2012 International Conference on Cyber Security, Cyber Warfare and Digital Forensic (CyberSec)	10.1109/CyberSec.2012.6246102	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-60.2541776511524	73.27369201989454	134353

Because crime is thriving, avoiding malicious behavior and protecting property becomes an important issue. To prevent malicious behavior, many proposals have been put forth. The subliminal channel is the most popular method, which notifies the designated receiver to transmit secret messages. Simmons was the first to propose this concept in 1983. Now, more and more digital signature applications use a subliminal channel to transfer secret messages.

The definition of 5G is to provide adequate RF coverage, more bits/Hz and to interconnect all wireless heterogeneous networks to provide seamless, consistent telecom experience to the user. In this paper we have surveyed 5G network architecture and proposed a multi-tier security architecture and a lightweight authentication measure for 5G.

Up until a few years back password based authentication was the most common form of authentication to any secure network. But with the advent of more sophisticated technologies this form of authentication although still widely used has become insecure.

872105cab2d019dbc3adca8d1f576f705886af77	a first look at firefox os security		With Firefox OS, Mozilla is making a serious push for an HTML5-based mobile platform. In order to assuage security concerns over providing hardware access to web applications, Mozilla has introduced a number of mechanisms that make the security landscape of Firefox OS distinct from both the desktop web and other mobile operating systems. From an application security perspective, the two most significant of these mechanisms are the the introduction of a default Content Security Policy and code review in the market. This paper describes how lightweight static analysis can augment these mechanisms to find vulnerabilities which have otherwise been missed. We provide examples of privileged applications in the market that contain vulnerabilities that can be automatically detected. In addition to these findings, we show some of the challenges that occur when desktop software is repurposed for a mobile operating system. In particular, we argue that the caching of certificate overrides across applications—a known problem in Firefox OS—generates a counter-intuitive user experience that detracts from the security of the system.	application security;content security policy;desktop computer;firefox os;mobile operating system;static program analysis;user experience;vulnerability (computing);web application	Daniel DeFreez;Bhargava Shastry;Hao Chen;Jean-Pierre Seifert	2014	CoRR		computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-54.73424093610595	60.86610813579011	134508

600251f4d1165754a91edc160524605d5912d947	securing the smart home via a two-mode security framework		The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) is contributing to the rise in cyber attacks on the Internet. Unfortunately, the resource-constrained IoT devices and their networks make many traditional security systems less effective or inapplicable. We present TWINKLE, a framework for smart home environments that considers the unique properties of IoT networks. TWINKLE utilizes a two-mode adaptive security model that allows an IoT device to be in regular mode for most of the time which incurs a low resource consumption rate and only when suspicious behavior is detected, switch to vigilant mode which potentially incurs a higher overhead. We show the efficacy of TWINKLE in two case studies that address two types of attacks: distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and sinkhole attacks. We examine two existing intrusion detection and prevention systems and transform both into new, improved systems using TWINKLE. Our evaluations show that TWINKLE is not only friendly to resource-constrained devices, but can also successfully detect and prevent the two types of attacks, with a significantly lower overhead and detection latency than the existing systems.	c10orf2 gene;denial (psychology);denial-of-service attack;dental intrusion;evaluation;face;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;home automation;illness behavior;internet of things;intrusion detection system;overhead (computing);twinkle;version	Devkishen Sisodia dsisodia	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-01701-9_2	computer security model;latency (engineering);computer security;resource consumption;the internet;home automation;intrusion prevention system;computer science;denial-of-service attack;internet of things	Security	-59.08342343445152	62.44246662787672	134722
bda3c907464dae1f3bfe62ec4de9d89f2e37d229	towards a security monitoring plane for named data networking and its application against content poisoning attack		Named Data Networking (NDN) is the most mature proposal of the Information Centric Networking paradigm, a clean-slate approach for the Future Internet. Although NDN was designed to tackle security issues inherent to IP networks natively, newly introduced security attacks in its transitional phase threaten NDN's practical deployment. Therefore, a security monitoring plane for NDN is indispensable before any potential deployment of this novel architecture in an operating context by any provider. We propose an approach for the monitoring and anomaly detection in NDN nodes leveraging Bayesian Network techniques. A list of monitored metrics is introduced as a quantitative measure to feature the behavior of an NDN node. By leveraging the hypothesis testing theory, a micro detector is developed to detect whenever the metric significantly changes from its normal behavior. A Bayesian network structure that correlates alarms from micro detectors is designed based on the expert knowledge of the NDN specification and the NFD implementation. The relevance and performance of our security monitoring approach are demonstrated by considering the Con­tent Poisoning Attack (CPA), one of the most critical attacks in NDN, through numerous experiment data collected from a real NDN deployment.	anomaly detection;bayesian network;future internet;generic programming;internet protocol suite;mpeg media transport;programming paradigm;relevance;sensor;software deployment;software metric;testbed	Hoang Long Mai;Tan N.

In digital forensics, data recoverability is one of the most important problems and has drawn increasingly more attention. This is because data may contain the information about important events, making it indispensable digital evidence. In this paper, according to some special characteristics of YAFFS2, we discuss the possibility of recovering multiple versions of YAFFS2 files and then propose a method to recover multiple versions of YAFFS2 files. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform some experiments to show that our method is more effective on the recovery of multiple versions of files than some other existing methods.	android;experiment;mobile device;serializability	Yameng Li;Jingsha He;Na Huang;Chengyue Chang	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)	10.1109/CIS.2016.0160	embedded system;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;internet privacy;computer security	SE	-51.06462035497172	63.621413954284456	134854

Most existing approaches focus on capturing relationship between individual system calls (or system audit events). In this paper, we add one additional dimension to the problem domain by also taking into consideration the overlap relationship between patterns. We first present a pattern extraction algorithm to generate maximal patterns from system call trails. Overlap relationship between patterns is subsequently investigated and stored. Finally, both maximal patterns and their relationships are exploited to detect deviations from normal application behavior. We test this idea using the popular sendmail data set and the login data set obtained from the University of New Mexico. Experimental results indicate that our scheme achieves a much higher detection rate than systems that only consider intra-pattern relationship while maintaining a very low false alarm rate with similar space and time efficiency.	algorithm;intrusion detection system;login;maximal set;overlap–add method;pattern recognition;problem domain;system call;unix	Ning Jiang;Kien A.

However, the security of the electronic ticket has to be strongly guaranteed, as well as the privacy of their users. We present an electronic ticketing system that considers these security requirements and includes the exculpability as a security requirement for these systems, i.e. users and the service provider can not falsely accuse each other of misbehavior. The system ensures that either both parties receive their desired data from other or neither does (fair exchange). Another interesting property is reusability. Thanks to reusability the tickets can be used a predefined number of times with the same security as single tickets. Furthermore, this scheme takes special care of the computational requirements on the users side by using light-weight cryptography. We show that the scheme is usable in practice by means of its implementation using mobile phones with Near Field Communication (NFC) capabilities. key words: security, privacy, electronic commerce, e-commerce, electronic ticketing, e-ticketing	care-of address;cryptography;digital data;e-commerce;electronic ticket;issue tracking system;mobile phone;near field communication;privacy;requirement	Arnau Vives-Guasch;Magdalena Payeras-Capellà;Macià Mut Puigserver;Jordi Castellà-Roca;Josep Lluís Ferrer-Gomila	2012	IEICE Transactions		e-commerce;telecommunications;computer science;cryptography;operating system;reuse;electronic component;near field communication;implementation;privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-48.301805572964376	66.26322282149923	135090
74cea520f9ecc9ed3304eb434559d1a2173708e3	providing authentication in delay/disruption tolerant networking (dtn) environment		DTN environment is characterized by intermittent connectivity, high/variable delay, heterogeneity, high error rate and asymmetric data rate amongst others. These characteristics accounts for the poor behavior of Internet protocols in this environment. To address these problems, DTN was conceived and designed together with specialized protocols to carry out its services. Its emergence called for a new concept in security that was considered at the design stage. The main aim of this paper is to propose a traditional cryptography based authentication scheme that does not depend on network administrator’s availability during post network authentication communication and facilitates bundle processing by the recipient in the absence of connectivity. In this paper, we present and discuss the system model, the proposed credential and the propose authentication scheme. A simulation framework is developed for the implementation of the proposed and referenced schemes. From the simulation results, the proposed scheme was observed to be independent of network administrator’s availability during post network authentication communication and facilitates bundle processing in the absence of connectivity.	authentication;c++;communications satellite;credential;cryptography;data rate units;delay-tolerant networking;emergence;internet protocol suite;microsoft visual studio;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;qualitative comparative analysis;server (computing);simulation	Enyenihi Johnson;Haitham S.

Both past incidents and research studies show that a well-engineered Internet worm can disable such systems in a fairly simple way and, most notably, in a matter of a few minutes. This indicates the need for defenses against worms but their speed rules out the possibility of manually countering worm outbreaks. We present a platform that emulates the epidemic behavior of Internet active worms in very large networks. A reactive control system operates on top of the platform and provides a monitor/analyze/respond approach to deal with infections automatically.

Biometric Authentication is usually permanent and is highly difficult to forge. Biometrics is used to enhance the privacy and security issues which exist in the current techniques such as using password and remembering pin authentication. By using biometrics, a person could be identified based on 'who she/he is 'rather than 'what she/he has' (card, token, key) or 'what she/he knows' (pin, password). Considering all these advantages of biometric system along with the need for such security in the Mobile Devices such as Tablets and Smart phones, this paper surveys some of the biometric traits for Mobile device authentication.	authentication;biometrics;fingerprint;forge;mobile device;password;personal identification number;smartphone;tablet computer	M.

Dealing with unfair ratings in such systems has been recognized as an important problem and many unfair rating detection approaches have been developed. Currently, these approaches are evaluated against simple attack models, but complicated attacking strategies can be used by attackers in the real world. The lack of unfair rating data from real human users and realistic attack behavior models has become an obstacle toward developing reliable rating systems. To solve this problem, we design and launch a rating challenge to collect unfair rating data from real human users. In order to broaden the scope of the data collection, we also develop a comprehensive signal-based unfair rating detection system. Based on the analysis of real attack data, we discover important features in unfair ratings, build attack models, and develop an unfair rating generator. The models and generator developed in this paper can be directly used to evaluate current rating aggregation systems, as well as to assist the design of future rating systems.	attack model;queueing theory;vii;yang	Qinyuan Feng;Yafei Yang;Yan Lindsay Sun;Yafei Dai	2008	2008 The 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops	10.1109/ICDCS.Workshops.2008.37	behavioral modeling;attack;reputation;computer science;feedback;internet privacy;trustworthy computing;world wide web;computer security;data collection	DB	-58.455522099214136	64.11002670113514	135811
1606452499c43df51fc5138ebaa85a250d9ad39c	detection and mitigation of attacks on transportation networks as a multi-stage security game		In recent years, state-of-the-art traffic-control devices have evolved from standalone hardware to networked smart devices. Smart traffic control enables operators to decrease traffic congestion and environmental impact by acquiring real-time traffic data and changing traffic signals from fixed to adaptive schedules. However, these capabilities have inadvertently exposed traffic control to a wide range of cyber-attacks, which adversaries can easily mount through wireless networks or even through the Internet. Indeed, recent studies have found that a large number of traffic signals that are deployed in practice suffer from exploitable vulnerabilities, which adversaries may use to take control of the devices. Thanks to hardware-based failsafes, adversaries cannot cause traffic accidents directly by setting compromised signals to dangerous configurations. Nonetheless, an adversary could cause disastrous traffic congestion by changing the schedule of compromised traffic signals, thereby effectively crippling the transportation network. To provide theoretical foundations for the protection of transportation networks from these attacks, we introduce a game-theoretic model of launching, detecting, and mitigating attacks that tamper with traffic-signal schedules. We show that finding optimal strategies is a computationally challenging problem, and we propose efficient heuristic algorithms for finding near optimal strategies. We also introduce a Gaussian-process based anomaly detector, which can alert operators to ongoing attacks. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms and the proposed detector using numerical experiments based on the SUMO traffic simulator.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;anomaly detection;experiment;game theory;gaussian process;heuristic;internet;network congestion;numerical analysis;real-time locating system;sensor;simulation;smart device;smart traffic light;traffic exchange	Aron Laszka;Waseem Abbas;Yevgeniy Vorobeychik;Xenofon D.

As protocols SSL/TLS are considered secure. However, SSL/TLS’s protection ends at the “transport/session layer” and it is up to the application (here web browsers) to preserve the security offered by SSL/TLS. In this paper we provide evidence that most web browsers have severe weaknesses in the browser-to-user communication (graphical user interface), which attackers can exploit to fool users about the presence of a secure SSL/TLS connection and make them disclose secrets to attackers. These attacks, known as “Visual Spoofing”, imitate certain parts of the browser’s user interface, pretending that users communicate securely with the desired service, while actually communicating with the attacker. Therefore, most SSL/TLS protected web applications can not be considered secure, due to deficiencies in browser’s user interfaces. Furthermore, we characterise Visual Spoofing attacks and discuss why they still affect today’s WWW browsers. Finally, we introduce practical remedies, which effectively prevent these attacks and which can easily be included in current browsers or (personal) firewalls to preserve SSL/TLS’s security in web applications.	authentication;countermeasure (computer);firewall (computing);graphical user interface;html;proxy server;server (computing);spoofing attack;transport layer security;www;web application;world wide web	André Adelsbach;Sebastian Gajek;Jörg Schwenk	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-31979-5_18	the internet;transaction processing;computer science;electronic countermeasure;operating system;graphical user interface;database;distributed computing;internet privacy;user interface;world wide web;computer security;information system	Security	-54.54896390323392	65.0086312210001	135935
3f66d1ac76511dcc913968e41252d3f40338faf9	dealing with public ethernet jacks: switches, gateways, and authentication		This paper describes the tools and techniques developed and deployed to address the problem of blocking unauthorized users on unprotected Ethernet jacks. Our solution is being deployed to control public labs at the University of Alberta during the summer of 1999. In this environment, we have a mix of ‘‘walk up’’ Ethernet connections used for laptop computers, and public Windows 95 and 98 workstations with fixed Ethernet connections. By themselves, none of these provide adequate facilities for preventing unauthorized Internet usage and enabling us to track Internet abuses originating from these networks. Prior to the deployment of our new access control system, these networks were not routed off of our campus due to these problems. Our access control system consists of MAC-locked switches behind a gateway at which an IP filter only allows Internet access when authenticated. Now we allow the authenticated users full access to the Internet, while preventing unauthorized people from plugging in for free Internet access. This also provides a record of Internet activity by authenticated users so that abuses can be easily tracked. We also have several transparent proxies on the gateway machine to assist us in handling particularly troublesome security and configuration issues relating to the internal lab. This allows us to selectively proxy out bound IMAP, SMTP, and HTTP requests, as well as answering IDENT requests coming in to the lab with the real user. The solution is inexpensive and easy to deploy, using off-the-shelf switches and a gateway router running a free operating system and software. The Problem of Public Labs and Unsecure Ethernet Jacks Public labs and their use by students in a university environment have always raised several issues for network managers and those concerned about security. The first goal of the labs is always to allow students to learn, and offer them every amount of freedom possible to do so. At the same time, there is great potential for abuse where public lab hosts can be used to attack other sites. If there are no access restrictions and no monitoring, people off the street can walk in and obtain free Internet access. University students can also usually be counted on to take advantage of a chance to cause mischief. This is especially problematic if it is unlikely that they can be held accountable for their actions. Before the days of laptops, this problem had been addressed in our environment by allowing unrestricted net access only via hosts running multiuser operating systems such as Unix, assigning logins, and using a variety of tools to enable the behavior of the users to be monitored to some degree. This also ensured that only someone in possession of a legitimate login id and password could use the facilities. In this traditional model, system administrators maintained administrative control of the hosts, and ran an Operating System (OS) allowing them to limit and monitor the activities of the users. Access to the Internet was controlled by access to the machine. With the more common use of laptops and the requirement to run unsecure PC desktop operating systems like Windows 95/98 in public places, this solution was no longer feasible. A new solution was needed that preserved the freedom of users to access the Internet, but maintained the ability to associate specific network traffic with specific users, if necessary. This solution also had to accommodate users plugging their own computers into the network. The Requirements for a Solution We decided early on that a solution for us would need to have the following properties: • It must be easy and inexpensive to deploy • It must work with a default configuration of Windows 95 preferably with no additional software required, and as little user education as possible. • It should work with our existing authentication methods on campus (Unix and AFS/Kerberos [3, 7, 10]) – We don’t want to hand out another 50,000 login accounts. • It should not allow unauthenticated users to use the Internet • It should be as unrestrictive as possible to the users once they are authenticated. • It should give us the ability to track the user id behind Internet abuse at least as well as we can 1999 LISA XIII – November 7-12, 1999 – Seattle, WA 149 Dealing with Public Ethernet Jacks – Switches, Gateways, and Authentication Beck track the same for the users of our multiuser UNIX hosts. • It should work both for locations with unsecure Ethernet jacks and for public PC labs. Other sites have approached a similar problems by having students register MAC addresses through some mechanism before the user can receive an IP address via DHCP [11], or by the use of commercial firewall software [12, 13, 14]. The commercial firewall solution used by many locations was examined and found wanting for several reasons. The foremost reason was cost – every product we examined was prohibitively expensive for us. Secondarily, the solutions we looked at required either one of two things: • The user had to do something (usually a telnet and authenticate) to actively ‘‘log in’’ to the firewall to authenticate from an IP address then had to do something else (telnet and authenticate again) to actively ‘‘log out’’. This was a problem for us both from a user training point of view, and from a security point of view (session spoofing prevention is difficult). • If the above issue was addressed, it was usually by means of a custom modification to the client host’s operating system. We could not support these on the scale that our campus would require. The DHCP MAC registration techniques used by other sites were also considered. Again, we had some difficulties with implementing this at our site, Specifically: • We now would have to register and support the MAC addresses for all our users, in addition to our existing support for 50,000 campus-wide login ID’s – this was a big support issue to us. • MAC addresses are broadcast for DHCP requests, even on a switch – they are hardly secrets – an attacker can simply configure their computer to use another user’s MAC address which they have seen before on a broadcast thereby effectively becoming that user, with us being none the wiser unless the attacker and the victim are attempting to use the system at the same time. • Our policy, for better or worse, tells our users that they are responsible for keeping their password from anyone else or suffer the potential consequences. We felt it would be unreasonable to add their Ethernet MAC address to the list of secrets that a user was responsible for protecting. • This solution does not work for labs of PC workstations, so we would need to deploy a different solution there. Once we decided these solutions did not fit our needs we then looked at implementing our own solution. Our Solution Our solution uses the following key pieces: • An authenticating gateway router. One of these sits in front of each lab. • A switched Ethernet network consisting of cabling and Ethernet switches. • Our central Kerberos servers for user authentication. Figure 1: Authenticating gateway. Figure 1 shows the typical setup in our environment, with the authenticating gateway located at the perimeter of the Lab network. The authenticating gateway router is configured using packet filters to by default block all traffic from the lab network. The switches in the lab allow the user to connect to the gateway router.

Both security and service quality are equally important for an effective electronic-ticket system. Traditional account based and many smart card based electronic-ticket systems are not adequate to strike a proper balance between these two requirements. To this end, we have presented a secure and flexible e-ticket system in this paper. At the core of our system lies the tamper-resistant eTRON chip which is equipped with functions for mutual authentication, encrypted communication and strong access control mechanism. The IC chip supports dual-interface in a single card that is compliant with ISO/IEC 7816 and ISO/IEC 14443 for contact and contactless interfaces respectively.

eef05b80b9371134f863eb7462000ae7b17d3954	towards privacy preserving threat intelligence		Abstract As modern threats become more sophisticated, it is imperative for organizations to defend with the global context. Many cloud based services provide threat intelligence pertaining to modern advanced persistent threats (APTs). Cloud services such as: Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank, and Malwr offer black lists of known malicious URLs, domains, emails etc . Querying such services require users to share their browsing history and files in order to know whether their machines got infected or not. One of the major concerns/hindrances remained to be addressed to benefit from such services is the users’ privacy. In this paper, we concretely identify various privacy concerns in different threat intelligence services. We introduce the general notion of Privacy Preserving Threat Intelligence (PPTI) to address such concerns. As one of the major efforts towards addressing the users’ privacy concerns while querying public databases, Private Information Retrieval (PIR) techniques have been proposed. They enable a User to retrieve an element from a public database privately. Many of the traditional PIR techniques assume that User is aware of the address of the element to be retrieved. In this paper, we identify two major advancements that are needed for PIR in designing the privacy preserving threat intelligence services: (i) private retrieval of the elements using keyword(s), and (ii) private retrieval of matching documents. In doing so, we introduce relevant schemes needed and propose a generic architecture. We also identify a specific use case for privacy preserving spam intelligence and present our experimental results. Although our experimental evidence show some limitations, we believe our work aides in formulating and advancing the technology and we present our future direction towards addressing the limitations presented. All our source code is open sourced and publicly available.		Sashank Dara;Saman Taghavi Zargar;V. N. Muralidhara	2018	J. Inf. Sec.

66f964570c86d3e34c62d5e434ad975fada53d67	revealing the feature influence in http botnet detection		Botnet are identified as one of most emerging threat s due to Cybercriminals work diligently to make most o f the part of the users’ network of computers as their target. In co junction with that, many researchers has conduct a lot of study r egarding on the botnets and ways to detect botnet in network traffi c. Most of them only used the feature inside the system without men tioni g the feature influence in botnet detection. Selecting a significant feature are important in botnet detection as it can increas e the accuracy of detection. Besides, existing research focusses more on the technique of recognition rather than uncovering the purpose b ehind the selection. Therefore, this paper will reveal the in fluence feature in botnet detection using statistical method. The resu lt obtained showed the accuracy is about 91% which is approxima tely acceptable to use the influence feature in detectin g botnet activity.	botnet;computer;http cookie;hypertext transfer protocol;kai's power tools;qualitative comparative analysis;sensor	Nur Hidayah Mohd Saudi;M.

The authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) protocols are being used successfully, in unicast communication scenarios, to control access to network resources. AAA protocols can be used for multicast applications in a similar way. However, without an effective sender access control, an adversary may exploit the existing IP multicast model, where a sender can send multicast data without prior authentication and authorization. Even a group key management protocol that efficiently distributes the encryption and the authentication keys to the receivers will not be able to prevent an adversary from spoofing the sender address and hence, flooding the data distribution tree. This can create an efficient Denial of Service attack. In previous work, we have proposed a framework for the use of AAA protocols to manage IP Multicast group membership. To prevent DoS attacks and other known attacks (e.g., replay attack), we propose in this paper an extension for sender access control. Our solution will authenticate and authorize each sender, and account for sender behavior by deploying AAA protocols. Moreover, a multicast packet will be forwarded to the distribution tree only if it is cryptographically authenticated at the entry point by the Access Router. The proposal we have presented provides a flexible authentication framework, supporting different authentication mechanisms, and is independent of the underlying routing protocol. Finally, we have extended our model to support inter-domain multicast groups.	aaa (video game industry);access control;adversary (cryptography);authentication;authorization;denial-of-service attack;encryption;entry point;group key;inter-domain;key management;multicast;network packet;replay attack;routing;simulation;software deployment;unicast	Salekul Islam;J.

A computer network defense-oriented scheme description language (CNDSDL) was designed to describe actions of protection (i.e., access control, encryption communication, backup), detection (i.e., intrusion detection, vulnerability detection), analysis (i.e., log auditing), response (i.e., system rebooting, shutdown), recovery (i.e., rebuild, patch making), and relationship among actions (i.e., sequence-and, sequence-or, concurrent-and, concurrent-or, and xor). The Extend Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) of CNDSDL was provided. At last, we provided an implementation mechanism of CNDSDL. A task deadlock detection algorithm was given for the defense scheme. The simulation was completed in simulation platform of GTNetS. Three simulation experiments verified the description capability and effectiveness of CNDSDL. The results of the experiments show that the defense scheme described by CNDSDL can be transformed to detailed technique rules and realize the defense effect of expression.	simulation	Zhao Wei;Chunhe Xia;Yang Luo;Xiaochen Liu;Weikang Wu	2014	JCP	10.4304/jcp.9.2.388-395	extended backus–naur form;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;deadlock prevention algorithms	AI	-60.87771311797369	60.45028802841651	137179

The transmission, being of a broadcast nature, is vulnerable to security threats and hence, the aspect of security provisioning in these networks has assumed an important dimension. The security of the transmitted data over a wireless channel aims at protecting the data from unauthorized access. The objective is achieved by providing advanced security mechanisms. Implementing strong security mechanisms however, affects the throughput performance and increases the complexity of the communication system. In this paper, we investigate the security performance of a WLAN based on IEEE 802.11b/g/n standards on an experimental testbed in congested and uncongested networks in a single and multi-client environment. Experimental results are obtained for a layered security model encompassing nine security protocols in terms of throughput, response time, and encryption overhead. The performance impact of transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol traffic streams on secure wireless networks has also been studied. Through numerical results obtained from the testbed, we have presented quantitative and realistic findings for both security mechanisms as well as network performance. The tradeoff between the strength of the security protocol and the associated performance is analyzed through computer simulation results. The present real time analysis enables the network designers to make intelligent choices about the implementation of security features and the perceived network performance for a given application scenario.	authorization;computer simulation;cryptographic protocol;datagram;download;encryption;information access;layered security;network performance;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);provisioning;response time (technology);software deployment;testbed;throughput	Poonam Jindal;Brahmjit Singh	2016	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-016-9384-x	computer security model;wireless transport layer security;security association;covert channel;internet security;security service;distributed computing;network access control;computer security;transmission security;computer network	Security	-52.541268371788455	71.71156746515055	137229

Yet this protection is short-lived and comparatively weak. The absence of a fool-proof solution against man-in-the-middle, or active phishing, attacks have resulted in an avalanche of security practitioners painting bleak scenarios where active phishing attacks cripple the growth of Web-based transactional systems. Even with vigilant users and prudent applications, no solutions seem to have addressed the attacks comprehensively. In this article, we propose the new two-factor interlock authentication protocol (TIAP), adapted from the interlock protocol with two-factor authentication, which is able to defend successfully against active phishing attacks. We further scrutinize the TIAP by simulating a series of attacks against the protocol and demonstrate how each attack is defeated.	authentication protocol;interlock (engineering);interlock protocol;man-in-the-middle attack;multi-factor authentication;phishing;simulation	Xin Luo;Tan Teik Guan	2007	IJISP	10.4018/jisp.2007070104	encrypted key exchange;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-56.64468622345637	62.826285384232	137449

The growing popularity of WiFi-enabled devices and the increasing number of WiFi networks guarantees that this trend will continue in the future. Since a single network provider is usually not able to ensure WiFi coverage for its own users across many geographic locations the WiFi roaming technology appears to be the promising solution. A special attention upon the practical deployment of WiFi roaming should be paid to possible threats coming from the misuse of technology. In this light we analyze various legal implications that might become relevant due to the deployment of WiFi roaming and discuss several risks and problems related to the security during the establishment of roaming connections between mobile devices and the Internet. 1 Centre de Recherche Informatique et Droit, FUNDP, Namur, Belgium. 2 UCL Crypto Group, DICE, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. 3 Centre de Recherche Informatique et Droit, FUNDP, Namur, Belgium. 4 IP Networking Lab, Dept CSE, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. 5 Centre de Recherche Informatique et Droit, FUNDP, Namur, Belgium. 6 UCL Crypto Group, DICE, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. 7 Centre de Recherche Informatique et Droit, FUNDP, Namur, Belgium. 8 Centre de Recherche Informatique et Droit, FUNDP, Namur, Belgium. 9 Centre de Recherche Informatique et Droit, FUNDP, Namur, Belgium. 10 IP Networking Lab, Dept CSE, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. 11 UCL Crypto Group, DICE, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. 5		Romain Robert;Mark Manulis;Florence De Villenfagne;Damien Leroy;Julien Jost;François Koeune;Caroline Ker;Jean-Marc Dinant;Yves Poullet;Olivier Bonaventure;Jean-Jacques Quisquater	2007	I.

We propose FACT, a system that helps network operators to track connectivity problems with remote autonomous systems, networks, and hosts. In contrast to existing solutions, our approach relies solely on flow-level information about observed traffic, is capable of online data processing, and is highly efficient in alerting only about those events that actually affect the studied network or its users. We evaluate FACT based on flow-level traces from a medium-sized ISP. Studying a time period of one week in September 2010, we explain the key principles behind our approach. Ultimately, these can be leveraged to detect connectivity problems and to summarize suspicious events for manual inspection by the network operator. In addition, when replaying archived traces from the past, FACT reliably recognizes reported connectivity problems that were relevant for the studied network.	archive;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);fact;internet;subnetwork;tracing (software)	Dominik Schatzmann;Simon Leinen;Jochen Kögel;Wolfgang Mühlbauer	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19260-9_22	data processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;computer security	Metrics	-59.998930166547915	65.1425466490529	137829

The system consists of a bank of servers providing service to incoming requests. Malicious intruders generate fake traffic to the servers attempting to degrade service provisioning. Legitimate traffic may be balanced using available mechanisms in order to mitigate the damage from the attack. We characterize the guaranteed region, i.e. the set of legitimate traffic intensities that are sustainable given specific intensities of the fake traffic, under the assumption that the fake traffic is routed using static policies. This assumption will be relaxed, allowing arbitrary routing policies, in the full version of this work.	global serializability;malware;provisioning;routing;server (computing)	Georgios S.

It calculates weight factor to determine anomaly in the payload. In the 1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data set, we conduct several tests for limited attacks on port 80 and port 25.

Thus it is acknowledged that web-based tools are essential to prevent cyber criminals hacking into online networks to comprise their services and gain access to confidential data for improper purposes. We consider the concept of Ethical Hacking where authorized hackers attempt to infiltrate a business's systems/networks on behalf of the owners with the intention of finding security weaknesses. However such security measures are costly and many SMEs lack the knowledge and resources to accomplish this.  Utilizing an SME case study we provide insights into how Ethical Hacking, in the form of Penetration Testing using free open source tools, can be used by SMEs to protect their network's services/operations. Using Nmap, Google Hacking, Nessus and Brutus we uncovered 232 network vulnerabilities. Thus measures were put in to place to resolve these vulnerabilities and prevent the case study's sensitive data from future cyber threats.	authorization;computer security;confidentiality;cybercrime;google hacking;nessus vulnerability scanner;nmap security scanner;open-source software;penetration test;threat (computer);web application	Hilary Berger;Andrew Jones	2016		10.1145/2925995.2926016	public relations;engineering;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-57.22428718428975	62.8886749565364	138094

This problem is growing at a fast rate with no signs of abating. Another form of spam that has just surfaced is VoIP spam called SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony). Currently, VoIP has seen an increasing number of users due to the cheap rates. With the introduction of the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem), the number of VoIP users are expected to increase dramatically. Recent solutions proposed to block SPIT have the following shortcomings: restricting the users to trusted senders, causing delays in voice call set-up, reducing the efficiency of the system, and requiring dramatic changes in the protocols being used. We propose a decoying system to ban SPIT senders. This decoying system for the IMS, fits well with the existing protocol structure, and customers are oblivious of its operation. Additionally, the decoying method causes no delays in voice call set-up. Further, we will implement a test bed for proof of concept and test robustness of the design.	data dredging;email;fits;ip multimedia subsystem;network performance;no silver bullet;overhead (computing);spamming;testbed	S.

The proposed solution enables users to access websites, services and applications without the need to remember passwords, responses or support of any equipment. The proposed method is evaluated from the users’ perspective as well as from the security viewpoint. Moreover, we compare it with the two most popular existing authentication schemes i.e. static passwords and SMS OTP (one time password). In order to evaluate user’s view on various authentication methods a questionnaire was prepared and distributed among 40 participants. Obtained results revealed that the new authentication scheme yielded better results than the existing methods. Finally, we also performed a security analysis with respect to all abovementioned authentication solutions to assess whether there are any major risks related to the proposed method.	authentication	Pawel Laka;Wojciech Mazurczyk	2018	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-018-0437-1	password;computer network;smart card;computer science;user experience design;security analysis;subscriber identity module;one-time password;authentication	EDA	-50.3469134749883	65.88480007967983	138369
a26627010919dc37c76d5ac20b1da1331033df0d	exploiting unreliability of the puf to secure remote wireless sensing		Wireless sensors attracts increasingly attention from both academia and industry owing to emerging applications built upon them such as Internet of Things, smart home, E-Health, and etc. It becomes a concern that the sensed value should be trusted in such applications scenarios. The security of the sensor used to resort to traditional cryptographic techniques, which, however, only provides limited protection by virtue of its vulnerability to physical attacks and may not economically viable. In this paper, we propose a new sensing methodology making remote sensing highly secure. In particular, we facilitate the susceptibility of physical unclonable function (PUF) to ambient environment variations, acting as a PUF sensor, to grantee the veracity of the sensing value even the PUF sensor is located in an untrusted remote location and the communication channel is also insecure without implementing relatively expensive crypto module. The PUF sensor is costefficient and most importantly anti-counterfeiting, while offers high level security. We demonstrate the practicability of the PUF sensor based on experimental implementations. In addition, we show that the extended sensing functionality of a PUF is actually improving PUF’s resistance against modeling attacks.	adversary (cryptography);authentication protocol;channel (communications);cryptography;high-level programming language;home automation;internet of things;norm (social);physical unclonable function;sensor;spoofing attack;veracity	Yansong Gao;Hua Ma;Damith Chinthana Ranasinghe;Said F.

Their key operation relies on collecting, processing, and disseminating the feedback about some peers' past behavior in order to boost their cooperation, albeit this is susceptible to collusion and bashing. Additionally, estimating reputation generally relies on a partial assessment of the behavior of peers only, which might delay the detection of selfish peers. This situation is rendered even worse in self-organized storage applications, since storage is not an instantaneous operation and data are vulnerable throughout their entire storage lifetime. This paper compares reputation to an audit-based approach where peer observations are carried out through the periodic verification of a proof of data possession, and shows how the latter approach better addresses the aforementioned issues of inciting cooperation in P2P storage.	peer-to-peer;reputation system;self-organization;social network	Nouha Oualha;Yves Roudier	2008		10.1145/1461469.1461472	public relations;business;internet privacy;computer security	Metrics	-59.12210661697607	72.98236420871089	138447

In this context, phishing attacks are among the most important challenges e-commerce is faced with. On the other hand, it is one of the mostly used methods for password stealing. In phishing attacks, the attacker redirects the victim to their fake web pages in order to steal their sensitive information such as passwords. Numerous methods have been devised to defeat such attacks. Web pages, e-mails and URLs used for phishing attacks have some features which can be used to identify fake pages.

In addition, two DDoS tools, TFN2K and Trinoo, are adopted and integrated into SSFNet to create virtual DDoS networks to simulate the attacks. Then, simulation experiments are used to evaluate the performance of the active DDoS defense system. At last, we set up a model to describe the interactions between DDoS attack and defense party, which allows us to have a deep insight of the interactions between the attack and defense parties. Experiment results shows that the model can precisely estimate the defense effectiveness of the system when it encounters attacks.	denial-of-service attack;simulation	Zhongwen Li;Yang Xiang;Dongsheng He	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-74377-4_92	trinoo;computer science;internet privacy;application layer ddos attack;world wide web;computer security;denial-of-service attack	Networks	-59.22724675108741	66.61452915328375	138792

The widespread use inevitably produces malicious peers who try to disrupt the network by flooding it with in authentic files. This necessitates the need for a robust reputation system to identify bad peers and files. The former has been extensively studied and many peer based reputations already exist. In this paper we present a novel framework for a Hybrid P2P Reputation System (HPRS) using peer and file rating. This combined rating enables good peers to judge individual files and thus eliminate any in authentic downloads. It also helps a peer extract the maximum from the system by enabling him to get those occasional good files from bad peers and reject accidental bad files from good peers.

While such an attack is not difficult to launch, defending a network resource against it is disproportionately difficult, and despite the extensive research in recent years, DoS attacks continue to harm. The first goal of any protection scheme against DoS is the detection of its existence, ideally long before the destructive traffic build-up. In this paper we propose a generic approach which uses multiple Bayesian classifiers, and we present and compare four different implementations of it, combining likelihood estimation and the random neural network (RNN). The RNNs are biologically inspired structures which represent the true functioning of a biophysical neural network, where the signals travel as spikes rather than analog signals. We use such an RNN structure to fuse real-time networking statistical data and distinguish between normal and attack traffic during a DoS attack. We present experimental results obtained for different traffic data in a large networking testbed.	analog signal;approximation;artificial neural network;bayesian network;denial-of-service attack;experiment;high-level programming language;naive bayes classifier;random neural network;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor;testbed	Gülay Öke Günel;George Loukas;Erol Gelenbe	2007	2007 IEEE International Fuzzy Systems Conference	10.1109/FUZZY.2007.4295666	computer science;machine learning;data mining;computer security;denial-of-service attack;artificial neural network	ML	-61.820067724855356	66.27108143354936	139273

A diverse set of possible attacks, including node compromise, false data injection, malware propagation, and denial of service have been identified and studied in isolation. Currently, however, there is no framework for composing multiple attacks, mounted by one or more adversaries, and designing a system defense that guarantees stability and allows flexible performance. In this paper, we introduce a passivity framework for modeling and mitigating multiple, interdependent attacks on networked control systems. Under our framework, multiple adversaries are modeled as passive individual blocks, either in parallel or negative feedback interconnections depending on the interdependencies between the attacks, leading to an overall system that is passive and stabilizable. We present two case studies within this framework, namely joint node capture and malware propagation, as well as joint node capture and control channel jamming, and derive a stabilizing network response to the attacks. Our results are illustrated through a numerical study.	adversary (cryptography);adversary model;communications protocol;control system;denial-of-service attack;dynamical system;emoticon;existential quantification;interconnection;interdependence;malware;negative feedback;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;radio jamming;replay attack;routing;software propagation	Andrew Clark;Linda Bushnell;Radha Poovendran	2012	2012 50th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483442	networked control system;engineering;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-55.25608786280704	71.91057269436337	139278

However, existing biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprints and voice recognition have some drawbacks. For example, many biometric authentication methods require special devices to collect biometric features. This paper proposes an authentication method based on inputs from the touchscreen of a smartphone. Our proposed authentication system uses 48 features from the touch gestures to authenticate the owner of a smartphone. We tested our proposed system and its EER was about 0.7%, and we claim that our system can be effective to authenticate smartphone owners.	authentication;biometrics;enhanced entity–relationship model;fingerprint;smartphone;speech recognition;touchscreen	JunGyu Park;TaeGuen Kim;Eul Gyu Im	2016		10.1145/2987386.2987410	chip authentication program;engineering;authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-50.33417272180759	65.96893064233535	139448

Sensor networks have emerged as a platform for deployment and sustenance of critical applications that require real-time sensing and data acquisition for decision-making purposes. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security of such networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of distributed attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based approach towards achieving demarkation in the values of specific parameters of an attack detection scheme for detecting distributed node-exhaustion attacks in wireless sensor networks. Using the Unified And-Or (UAO) aggregation operator, we model and formulate a mechanism to achieve a tradeoff between frequent attack detection and sensor node energy utilization. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the issue of computing the optimal parameter values for achieving a reasonable tradeoff between attack detection rate and sensor node energy utilization rate.	collision detection;computation;data acquisition;data aggregation;embedded system;fuzzy logic;malware;next-generation network;real-time transcription;sensor node;simulation;software deployment;systems design;ubiquitous computing	Salman A.

Accurate identification of P2P traffic is especially important for network management. The simplest method is based on port mapping. But dynamic port technique makes it ineffective. Signature-based approach is useless when facing encrypted traffic. Recently, some approaches use more complex machine learning and data mining algorithms relying on flow statistics or host behaviors. Due to the sophisticated algorithms, they need a time-consuming process for training or calculating, they can hardly be used in real-time identification. In this paper, we propose a cocktail approach consists of three sub-methods to identify BitTorrent (BT) traffic. We apply application signatures to identify unencrypted traffic. And for those encrypted flows, we propose the message-based method according to the features of the message stream encryption (MSE) protocol. At last, we propose a pre-identification method based on signaling analysis. It can predict BT flows and distinguish them even at the first packet with SYN flag only. And we use modified Vuze clients to label BT traffic in real traffic traces, which help us to make high accuracy benchmark datasets to evaluate our approach. The results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially for those un- or semi- established flows, which have no obvious signatures or flow statistics.

This paper gives a theoretical overview of the GSM network architecture, describes different attack vectors, as well as both hardware and software tools available.

Protection is afforded by authenticating users of the network and encrypting communication which travels through the wireless medium. However, WPA is limited in the amount protection offered in networks which use a pre-shared key (WPA-PSK) for authentication, as anyone holding the PSK may eavesdrop on other authorized users. We present a lightweight enhancement to the WPA four-way handshake which removes this limitation, providing confidentiality even in a shared-key environment.

However, attack graphs are generally too large and complex to be understood and interpreted by security administrators. This paper proposes an analysis framework for security attack graphs for a given IT infrastructure system. First, in order to facilitate the discovery of interconnectivities among vulnerabilities in a network, multi-host multi-stage vulnerability analysis (MulVAL) is employed to generate an attack graph for a given network topology. Then a novel algorithm is applied to refine the attack graph and generate a simplified graph called a transition graph. Next, a Markov model is used to project the future security posture of the system. Finally, the framework is evaluated by applying it on a typical IT network scenario with specific services, network configurations, and vulnerabilities.	algorithm;markov chain;markov model;network security;network topology;poor posture;vulnerability (computing)	Mehdi Yousefi;Nhamo Mtetwa;Yan Zhang;Huaglory Tianfield	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI)	10.1109/ISI.2017.8004866	computer security;data mining;connectivity;graph database;computer science;network security;theoretical computer science;network topology;markov model;vulnerability assessment;markov process;server;distributed computing	Security	-62.13433050878166	60.530383264594484	140424
06e3efe7d4ea0085fa2a00de627d36d3fdb91041	machine learning aided traffic tolerance to improve resilience for software defined networks		Software Defined Networks (SDNs) have gained prominence recently due to their flexible management and superior configuration functionality of the underlying network. SDNs, with OpenFlow as their primary implementation, allow for the use of a centralised controller to drive the decision making for all the supported devices in the network and manage traffic through routing table changes for incoming flows. In conventional networks, machine learning has been shown to detect malicious intrusion, and classify attacks such as DoS, user to root, and probe attacks. In this work, we extend the use of machine learning to improve traffic tolerance for SDNs. To achieve this, we extend the functionality of the controller to include a resilience framework, ReSDN, that incorporates machine learning to be able to distinguish DoS attacks, focussing on a neptune attack for our experiments. Our model is trained using the MIT KDD 1999 dataset. The system is developed as a module on top of the POX controller platform and evaluated using the Mininet simulator.	centralisation;dos;data mining;denial-of-service attack;experiment;machine learning;malware;neptune;openflow;routing table;simulation	Siddharth Gangadhar;James P.

Governments and business organisations around the world are providing enormous effort to secure their data. They are using various types of tools and techniques to keep the business running, while adversaries are trying to breach security and send malicious software such as botnets, viruses, trojans etc., to access valuable data. Everyday the situation is getting worse because of new types of malware emerging to attack networks. It is important to understand those attacks both before and after they happen in order to provide better security to our systems. Understanding attack models provide more insight into network vulnerability, which in turn can be used to protect the network from future attacks. In the cyber security world, it is difficult to predict a potential attack without understanding the vulnerability of the network. So, it is important to analyse the network to identify top possible vulnerability list, which will give an intuitive idea to protect the network. Also, handling an ongoing attack poses significant risk on the network and valuable data, where prompt action is necessary. Proper utilisation of attack modelling techniques provide advance planning, which can be implemented rapidly during an ongoing attack event. This paper aims to analyse various types of existing attack modelling techniques to understand the vulnerability of the network, and the behaviour and goals of the adversary. The ultimate goal is to handle cyber attack in efficient manner using attack modelling techniques.	adversary (cryptography);attack patterns;botnet;computer security;computer virus;honeypot (computing);internet security;kill chain;malware;trojan horse (computing)	Hamad Al-Mohannadi;Qublai Khan Ali Mirza;Anitta Patience Namanya;Irfan-Ullah Awan;Andrea J.

According to popular perception, public-key cryptography is beyond the capabilities of such devices. We show that elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) not only makes public-key cryptography feasible on these devices, it allows one to create a complete secure Web server stack including SSL, HTTP and user application that runs efficiently within very tight resource constraints. Our small footprint HTTPS stack needs less than 4 KB of RAM and interoperates with an ECC-enabled version of the Mozilla Web browser.

This is because (1) the switching nodes and concentrators are distributed physically and cannot be considered secure, and (2) the network protocols, if not properly designed, can be used by an intruder to gain access to the network data or have it misrouted. This special issue describes many developments in the above-mentioned aspects of data security in networks. The first article surveys digital signatures. Both private-key and public-key encryption techniques can be used to generate digital signatures. Since an unauthorized party can counterfeit public keys or use private keys that have been compromised, the use of public-key encryption alone does not ensure secrecy or a correct digital signature. The next article discusses the protection of public keys and signature keys. A protocol is a set of rules to be followed by users to ensure orderly communication. The next work describes several issues in protocol design and implementation. The importance of arbitrators in the design of secure protocols is explained and some implementations are described. An application of the RSA digital signature to electronic mail is described in the last article.	data security	Subhash C.

The model relies on randomization and replication techniques against unhelpful devices that do not execute their assigned code segments and malicious ones that try to reveal the overall application.

As these devices communicate using wireless medium, the communication must be protected from eavesdropping by using shared secret keys for data encryption. In many applications, it is essential to use a common secret key for secured communication among multiple devices. In this paper, we present our novel secret key generation and distribution protocol exploiting accelerometer data collected from smart wearable devices. We propose (i) source separation method for processing accelerometer sensor data, and (ii) key distribution protocol based on Fuzzy vault.

The need for RIAs to retrieve content hosted on different domains, in order to enrich user experience, led to the use of cross-domain policies by content providers. Cross-domain policies define the list of RIA hosting domains that are allowed to retrieve content from the content provider's domain. Misinterpretation or misconfigurations of the policies may give the opportunity to malicious RIAs to access and handle users' private data.  In this paper we present an extensive study on the deployment and security issues of cross-domain policies in the web. Through the examination of a large set of popular and diverse (both geographically and content-wise) websites, we reveal that about 50% (more than 6.500 websites) of the websites that have adopted such policies are vulnerable to attacks. Furthermore, we find such policies in more than 50% of the top 500 websites, examined both globally and per-country. Additionally, we examine local sets of e-shopping websites and find that up to 83% implement weak policies. Interestingly, we observe that the less popular a website is, the higher the probability that it will have a weak policy. Compared to previous studies there is an obvious increasing trend in the adoption of RIA but, at the same time, a decreasing trend regarding secure implementations. Through a proof-of-concept attack implementation and a number of real-world examples, we highlight the security impacts of these policy misconfigurations.	adobe flash;adversary (cryptography);cross-domain solution;group policy;information privacy;malware;microsoft silverlight;online shopping;rich internet application;software deployment;top500;user experience;world wide web	Georgios Kontaxis;Demetres Antoniades;Iasonas Polakis;Evangelos P.

As a result, mobile network operators have been facing challenges to provide needed capacity expansion in their congested network. Therefore to reduce the load on the network, mobile network operators are adapting and deploying key data offloading technologies such as femtocells not only to boost their network capacity but also to increase indoor cellular coverage. These low cost devices interconnect a new femtocell network architecture to evolving telecommunication core network via standardized interface protocols. However, consequences of such integration of two architectures over the Internet together with an array of security threats that originating through a rogue femtocell have not fully analysed. In this thesis, we investigate security architecture of femtocell-enabled cellular network that facilitate integration of these two architectures by evaluating impact of compromised femtocells on the fundamental security aspects of cellular systems integrity, confidentiality, authenticity, and availability. The goal of this research work is twofold; first to increase understanding of more feasible and disruptive attacks against both the end-users and the femtocellenabled cellular communication architecture from a rogue femtocell, such that more efficient detection and mitigation techniques can be developed to improve the overall security architecture; and secondly to identify security weaknesses of the femtocell architecture from a system-design perspective.

As thermal cameras become ubiquitous and affordable, we foresee a new form of threat to user privacy on mobile devices. Thermal cameras allow performing thermal attacks, where heat traces, resulting from authentication, can be used to reconstruct passwords. In this work we investigate in details the viability of exploiting thermal imaging to infer PINs and patterns on mobile devices. We present a study (N=18) where we evaluated how properties of PINs and patterns influence their thermal attacks resistance. We found that thermal attacks are indeed viable on mobile devices; overlapping patterns significantly decrease successful thermal attack rate from 100% to 16.67%, while PINs remain vulnerable (>72% success rate) even with duplicate digits. We conclude by recommendations for users and designers of authentication schemes on how to resist thermal attacks.	attack rate;knowledge-based authentication;mobile device;password;tracing (software)	Yomna Abdelrahman;Mohamed Khamis;Stefan Schneegaß;Florian Alt	2017		10.1145/3025453.3025461	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-51.27915543793607	64.96865267171067	143159

Many researchers believe that it would be best to handle DDoS attacks closer to the computers which host these attacks and have propounded various strategies for packet filtering at edge-routers. This paper makes three contributions over earlier work. First, we propose that it is best to track illegitimate packets suspected to cause a DDoS at the source computer itself. Secondly, we come up with a secure and efficient implementation (ADVOS: Anti-DDoS Virtualized Operating System) for packet filtering at the source computer itself. Security dependency on the integrity of the source operating system is removed by using virtualization to isolate the modules providing the protection capabilities. Different models of traffic characterization could possibly be used in curtailing malicious traffic, we justify the effectiveness of symmetry based model at source computers. Thirdly, we demonstrate that such an anti-DDoS operating system using virtualization can be implemented practically and efficiently. In our prototype over native Linux system 2.4% overhead was observed in the attained network throughput. Less than 1% of the total attack traffic generated was allowed to pass through on attack. Finally, we discuss the scalability and deployment issues for ADVOS.	computer;denial-of-service attack;firewall (computing);hardware virtualization;linux;malware;network packet;operating system;overhead (computing);prototype;scalability;software deployment;throughput	Sanjam Garg;Huzur Saran	2008	2008 Third International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	10.1109/ARES.2008.120	application virtualization;computer science;operating system;application layer ddos attack;computer security;computer network	Security	-57.82914365457085	67.1520416849444	143326

5ec87cd6df3824b18fc71b7b5dc4906586eede60	modeling framework for developing and testing network security techniques against ddos attacks		In the paper we introduce a hybrid system for simulating DDoS attacks and computer network protection techniques. The developed system makes it possible to create various network topologies, perform experiments with DDoS attack simulation, develop new protection methods and test the existing ones. The suggested system not only allows us to design virtual networks, but also makes it possible to connect real network nodes for improving the accuracy of the experiments. Massive DDoS attacks often affect websites of governments and government bodies of various countries, websites of leading IT-corporations. The world leaders in the area of information security consider DDoS detection and DDoS resistance as a primary task in their research and developments. To study DDoS attacks and to develop new defense mechanisms researchers mostly use simulation methods. However, DDoS attack simulation often causes problems of the accuracy of the attack simulation on application level. Furthermore, depending on the software installed on a server this server can function in a different way. Also multi-level network construction in reality often requires dozens of time and resources Thus, we suggest to integrate simulation and testbed methods. Using simulation, we create attacking network and connect it to the real server. A virtual network is very similar to a real one. In case of using DDoS attack traffic generators defense can be placed only on attacked server. Our approach allows to develop defense mechanisms, which can be placed anywhere in the attacking network. Furthermore protection mechanisms can be architecture-dependent, which is important for performing experiments in a way very close to a real network. An important advantage is the possibility of connecting real nodes to a virtual network, which will improve the accuracy of our experiments and allow us to test different settings and types of servers. System development was performed using the discreteevent simulation system OMNeT++. The INET library was used for making network settings and packet switching. The ReaSE library was completed for creating topology settings. The system has special network interface, which allows to redirect traffic from the simulated network to real network and vice versa. The verification of the system was successfully made. Comparison was made between system and networks constructed using Planetlab. Authors have made series of experiments with different attack scenarios: SYN-Flooding attack, HTTP attack. Experiments were made without any defense methods and with filtering methods (Ingress, Egress). The network topology for conducting experiments consisted of 7 routers, 204 clients and 1 real server. The delays between network nodes are equal to 1 microsecond. Now consider the analysis of scenario experiments for SYN Flooding using the Egress Filtering method and without using protection techniques. During SYN-Flooding attack, 20% of the total number of network clients (40 computers) participated in the attack. SYN cookies were switched off on the server for a successful SYN Flooding attack. At the beginning of the attack, at the 10 second, the number of server applications is increasing because more and more virtual clients are starting to take part in an attack. Till the 15 second the server is coping with the task of processing all requests and then the TCP stack is overflowed and the server is unable to process the increasing flow of applications. In the period from the 15th second till the 57th second the server provided no response to all arriving SYN-packets. A series of experiments has been performed with the use of a filter with 2, 3, or 4 routers in a virtual network. At the same time the clients attacking the server continuously were located in the local network of a router that did not use Egress Filtering. With the increase of the number of filters the power of a server attack decreased. The developed system can be used for studying DDoSattacks and the protection techniques against them. Network administrators can quickly and precisely reproduce a network they are servicing, execute load testing, estimate server stableness to attacks, network capacity, and the quality of protection mechanism performance.

Graphical passwords are classified into two groups: picture based password and userdrawn based password. To pass the authentication, in the picture based graphical password, users have to choose right photos whereas in the user-drawn based graphical password, users have to draw correct pictures. In this paper, we propose a new user-drawn based graphical password. The proposed scheme requires users to create their secret by selecting individual points or by connecting points into curves from a given set of points. Compared to textual password and existing graphical password such as DAS, our proposed password gives larger memorable password space with sufficiently large number of given points.	authentication;biometrics;graphical user interface;password	Thanh An Nguyen;Yong Zeng	2010	Transactions of the SDPS		zero-knowledge password proof;cognitive password;password policy;s/key;rainbow table;computer science;password psychology;passphrase;salt;internet privacy;key derivation function;one-time password;key stretching;syskey;world wide web;password;computer security;password strength	Security	-51.10260513550678	65.60059279490278	143848

This approach uses sequential rules that characterize a user's behavior over time. A rulebase is used to store pattems of user activities, and anomalies are reponed whenever a user's activity deviates significantly from those specified in the rules. The rules in the rulebase characterize either the sequential relationships between security audit records, or the temporal properties of the records. The rules are created in two ways: they are either dynamically generated and modified by a time-based inductive engine in order to adapt to changes in a user's behavior, or they are specified by the security management to implement a site security policy. This approach allows the correlation between adjacent security events to be exploited for the purpose of greater sensitivity in anomaly detection against seemingly intractable (or """"erratic"""") activities using statistical approaches.

Considering the research activities around BGP, anomalies turned out to be one major issue of iBGP: But even if the trouble iBGP anomalies induce in practice is well known for nearly a decade [2], [3], new iBGP extensions still define highly problematic protocol modifications. Apparently, protocol designers are either not aware of the conceptual defects that induce anomalies or validating correctness appears to be too complex. In this paper, we provide a basis to solve both problems. Focussing the basic correctness properties of routing protocols, we will show that iBGP anomalies are caused by five root causes.

704aeb933948e3810f06500da0914aadfd291247	advanced random time queue blocking with traffic prediction for defense of low-rate dos attacks against application servers		Among many strategies of Denial of Services, low-rate traffic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are more significant. This strategy denies the services of a network by detection of the vulnerabilities in performance of the application. In this research, an efficient defence methodology is developed against low-rate DoS attack in the application servers. Though, the Improved Random Time Queue Blocking (IRTQB) technique can eliminate the vulnerabilities in the network and also avoiding the attacker from capturing all the server queue positions by defining a spatial similarity metric (SSM). However, the differentiation of the attack requests from the legitimate users’ is not always efficient since only the source IP addresses and the record timestamp are considered in the SSM. It was improved by using Advanced Random Time Queue Blocking (ARTQB) scheme that employed Bandwidth utilization of attacker in IRTQB to detect the DoS attack that normally consumes a huge number of resources of the server. However, this method becomes ineffective when the attack consumes more network traffic. In this paper, an efficient detection technique called Advanced Random Time Queue Blocking with Traffic Prediction (ARTQB-TP) is proposed for defining SSM which contains, Source IP, timestamp, Bandwidth between two requests and the difference between the attack traffic and legitimate traffic. The ARTQB-TP technique is utilized to reduce the attack efficiency in 18 different server configurations which are more vulnerable to the DoS attacks and where the attacks may also have a chance to improve its effectiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed system performs better protection of application servers against the LRDoS attacks by solving its impacts on any kind of server architectures and reduced the attack efficiencies of all the types of attack strategies.	denial-of-service attack	R Kavitha;G Padmavathi	2017	IJCNIS		robust random early detection;pre-play attack;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-57.915513889805496	68.14194233633611	144101

In 2004, Pang et al. stepped beyond these targeted uses and provided one of the first generic characterizations of this non-productive traffic, demonstrating both its significant size and diversity. However, the six years that followed this study have seen tremendous changes in both the types of malicious activity on the Internet and the quantity and quality of unused address space. In this paper, we revisit the state of Internet """"background radiation"""" through the lens of two unique data-sets: a five-year collection from a single unused 8 network block, and week-long collections from three recently allocated 8 network blocks. Through the longitudinal study of the long-lived block, comparisons between blocks, and extensive case studies of traffic in these blocks, we characterize the current state of background radiation specifically highlighting those features that remain invariant from previous measurements and those which exhibit significant differences. Of particular interest in this work is the exploration of address space pollution, in which significant non uniform behavior is observed. However, unlike previous observations of differences between unused blocks, we show that increasingly these differences are the result of environmental factors (e.g., misconfiguration, location), rather than algorithmic factors. Where feasible, we offer suggestions for clean up of these polluted blocks and identify those blocks whose allocations should be withheld."""	address space;denial-of-service attack;internet background noise	Eric Wustrow;Manish Karir;Michael Bailey;Farnam Jahanian;Geoff Huston	2010		10.1145/1879141.1879149	simulation;telecommunications;world wide web;computer security;background radiation;statistics;computer network;data collection	Metrics	-58.90169864082851	65.56489855204542	144243

Unfortunately, malicious ASes can advertise false routes that do not exist in the Internet. Many extensions of BGP have been proposed to allow each AS to check whether the received routes are false. It turns out that none of these extensions can defend against collusions among malicious ASes. In this paper, we present an extension of BGP that can defend against collusions. In our extension, each listed AS in an advertised route supplies a certified full list of all its peers, i.e. neighbors. Because full peer lists can be very large, we develop an optimization where each AS in an advertised route supplies a balanced peer list that is much smaller than its full peer list. Using real Internet topology data, we demonstrate that the average, or largest, balanced peer list is 92% smaller than the average, or largest respectively, full peer list.	autonomous system (internet);border gateway protocol;internet topology;malware;mathematical optimization	Yan Li;Mohamed G.

c0013ea71079874196f66409abe0a9d1025cb980	tapping on my network door	network door	"""R eaders of this column are familiar with the risks of illegal monitoring of Internet traffic. Less familiar, but perhaps just as serious, are the risks intro duced when law enforcement taps that same traffic legally. Ironically, as insecure as the Internet may be in general, monitoring a particular user's traffic as part of a legal wire-tap isn't so simple, with failure modes that can be surprisingly serious. Packets from one user are quickly mixed in with those of others; even the closest thing the Internet has to a telephone number—the IP address—often changes from one session to the next and is generally not authenticated. An Internet wiretap by its nature involves complex software that must reliably capture and reassemble the suspect's packets from a stream shared with many other users. Sometimes an Internet service provider (ISP) is able to provide a properly filtered traffic stream; more often, there is no mechanism available to separate out the targeted packets. Enter Carnivore. If an ISP can't provide exactly the traffic covered by a court order, the FBI offers its own packet sniffer, a PC running special software designed especially for wiretap interception. The Carnivore computer (so named, according to press reports, for its ability to """" get to the meat """" of the traffic) is connected to the ISP's network segment expected to carry the target's traffic. A dial-up link allows FBI agents to control and configure the system remotely. Needless to say, any wiretapping system (whether supplied by an ISP or the FBI) relied upon to extract legal evidence from a shared, public network link must be audited for correctness and must employ strong safeguards against failure and abuse. The stringent requirements for accuracy and operational robustness provide especially fertile ground for many familiar risks. First, there is the problem of extracting exactly (no more and no less) the intended traffic. Standard network monitoring techniques provide only an approximation of what was actually sent or received by any particular computer. For wiretaps, the results could be quite misleading. If a single packet is dropped, repeated, or miscategorized (common occurrences in practice), an intercepted message could be dramatically misinterpreted. Nor is it always clear """" who said what. """" Dynamic IP addresses make it necessary to capture and interpret accurately not only user traffic, but also the messages that identify the address currently in use by the target.

The Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocols used in static networks do not perform well in a dynamically changing mobile environment. Mobile commerce and related applications are necessary for wireless networks. There are numerous properties in a wireless network that play important roles. For example, the processors in a wireless network have highly mobile capabilities. Processors can immigrate into or move away from the network at any time. Although mobile technology has brought greater convenience, it is comparatively more dangerous. Wireless systems are susceptible to security flaws such as attacks by hackers. The number of allowable faulty components within the system is also decreased. To increase the number of allowable faulty components and ensure network security, a simple, secure and efficient protocol, BAM, is proposed to handle the BA problem. The fault symptoms include malicious and dormant faults. Furthermore, the proposed protocol uses the minimum number of message exchange rounds to make all healthy processors agree on a common value and can tolerate the maximum number of allowable faulty components. The proposed method will also ensure message security and increase the system’s fault tolerant capability. D 2005 Elsevier B.V.

HANIDPS employs a model-based intrusion detection mechanism as well as a machine learning-based intrusion prevention system to protect the network against a wide range of attack types. The detection module extracts network features and analyzes them to decide whether the network is in a normal state. We use smart energy profile 2.0 specification as well as IEEE 802.15.4 standard to precisely characterize the expected normal behavior. A set of defensive actions are defined for the prevention system which are effective in stopping various attack types. HANIDPS uses Q-learning and through interactions with environment learns the best strategy against an attack. Use of model-based approach for intrusion detection and dynamic learning for intrusion prevention, as well as employment of effective mechanisms to stop the attacks, provide a high performance for HANIDPS without the need for prior knowledge of the attacks. Soundness of the proposed method is evaluated through extensive analysis and experiments.	data loss prevention software;energy profile (chemistry);experiment;interaction;interference (communication);intrusion detection system;machine learning;q-learning;simulation	Paria Jokar;Victor C.

077a4a077ab660bbece2dfcd088ebfc23d20f4b1	analysis of interaction trace maps for active authentication on smart devices		The availability and affordability of handheld smart devices have made life easier by enabling us to do work on the go. Their widespread use brings with it concerns relating to data security and privacy. The rising demand to secure private and highly confidential data found on smart devices has motivated researchers to devise means for ensuring privacy and security at all times. This kind of continuous user authentication scheme would add an additional layer of much needed security to smart devices. In this context, touch screen interactions have recently been studied as an effective modality to perform active user authentication on mobile devices. In this paper, a visual analysis based active authentication framework has been presented. Considering the touch screen as a canvas, interaction trace maps are constructed as a result of user interactions within various applications. The user touch gestures are captured and represented as drawing strokes on the canvas. The behavioral and physiological characteristics of users are modeled as signatures by combining texture and shape features from the interaction trace maps. A two-step mechanism with support vector machines exploit this signature to perform active user authentication. Experiments conducted with various datasets show that the proposed framework compares favorably with other state-of-the-art methods.	antivirus software;authentication;computer vision;confidentiality;data security;experiment;handheld game console;interaction;map;mobile device;modality (human–computer interaction);privacy;scrolling;smart device;support vector machine;touchscreen;usb on-the-go;verification and validation	Jamil Ahmad;Muhammad Sajjad;Zahoor Jan;Irfan Mehmood;Seungmin Rho;Sung Wook Baik	2016	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-016-3450-y	computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-51.286478687683875	64.56850456348783	145037

P2P-based anonymous publish-subscribe (pub-sub) is a highly-scalable approach to protect anonymity while enabling efficient many-to-many communication between services and users. However, churn and the resulting overlay degradation in P2P-based pub-sub systems require repairs and optimizations to maintain anonymity and efficiency. This paper analyzes attacks on such repair and optimization functions to disclose participants. For that, we apply a strong attacker model that combines large-scale traffic monitoring with malicious insiders. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate heuristic countermeasures. Our findings indicate that some attacks can be mitigated at reasonable costs. However, churn seems to remain a major threat to anonymity.	aerovironment global observer;elegant degradation;heuristic;malware;many-to-many;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;program optimization;publish–subscribe pattern;scalability;spamming;video overlay	Jörg Daubert;Tim Grube;Max Mühlhäuser;Mathias Fischer	2016	2016 13th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2016.7444871	attack;anonymity;computer science;overlay;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-57.79008315085752	64.58191872346005	145060

Embedding in these untrusted clients, however, requires secure embedding methods that do not leak unmarked contents or the watermarking secrets. In this work, we propose a look-up-table (LUT) based cipher, similar to Andersen's Chameleon cipher, for securely embedding spread-spectrum watermarks, which are noise robust and detectable without the original content. We also develop fast detection mechanisms that make the watermark detection feasible for tracking systems with large number of clients.

A specific instance of a collaborative environment for detecting malicious inter-domain port scans is introduced. This instance uses the open source Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine ESPER to correlate massive amounts of network traffic data exhibiting the evidence of those scans. The paper presents two inter-domain SYN port scan detection algorithms we designed, implemented in ESPER, and deployed on the collaborative environment; namely, Rank-based SYN (R-SYN) and Line Fitting. The paper shows the usefulness of the collaboration in terms of detection accuracy. Finally, it shows how Line Fitting can both achieve a higher detection accuracy with a smaller number of participants than R-SYN, and exhibit better detection latencies than R-SYN in the presence of low link bandwidths (i.e., less than 3Mbit/s) connecting the organizations to Esper.	algorithm;complex event processing;curve fitting;esper_(software);inter-domain;internet;line fitting;network packet;open-source software;port scanner;sensor;synergy	Leonardo Aniello;Giuseppe Antonio Di Luna;Giorgia Lodi;Roberto Baldoni	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24270-0_23	embedded system;engineering;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security	Security	-59.981842379803396	64.7683991345089	145430

The introduction of the IBM 4767 cryptographic coprocessor continues IBM leadership in marketplace security. The IBM 4767/Crypto Express5S is a versatile solution, offering three modes of operations on the IBM z13™ System: 1) Accelerator, 2) Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) Coprocessor, and 3) Enterprise PKCS #11 (public-key cryptography standard) Coprocessor. The highly programmable cryptographic coprocessor environment features a new ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), FPGA (field-programmable gate array), and enhanced performance. The innovative internal hardware and firmware can be easily updated to achieve new security standards and requirements as well as new customer-specific functionality. The secure APIs (application programming interfaces) are designed to support standard cryptographic functions as well as specialized banking and financial functions. This is done in a way that allows the sensitive key material never to be exposed outside the physical secure boundary in a clear format. Performance benefits include the incorporation of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and format preserving encryption (FPE) in the hardware. For the z13, the number of logical domains has been increased from 16 to 85, allowing more system versatility. This new design also supports SRIOV (single root I/O virtualization) and the ability to customize arbitration to target SRIOV or quality of service.	encryption;next-generation network	Todd W.

c416c0e4395c3f631b99e1609af5044d8420aa01	predicting signatures of future malware variants		One of the challenges of malware defense is that the attacker has the advantage over the defender. In many cases, an attack is successful and causes damage before the defender can even begin to prepare a defense. The ability to anticipate attacks and prepare defenses before they occur would be a significant scientific and technological development with practical applications in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a method to augment machine learning-based malware detection systems by predicting signatures of future malware variants and injecting these variants into the defensive system as a vaccine. Our method uses deep learning to learn patterns of malware evolution from family histories. These evolution patterns are then used to predict future family developments. Our experiments show that a detection system augmented with these future malware signatures is able to detect future malware variants that could not be detected by the detection system alone. In particular, it detected 11 new malware variants without increasing false positives, while providing up to 5 months of lead time between prediction and attack.	antivirus software;computer security;deep learning;experiment;machine learning;malware	Michael Howard;Avi Pfeffer;Mukesh Dalai;Michael Reposa	2017	2017 12th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE)	10.1109/MALWARE.2017.8323965	computer security;computer science;data mining;deep learning;cluster analysis;feature extraction;malware;artificial intelligence	SE	-59.42698904346952	60.78326967605394	146056

While many anti-drone systems have been proposed to take them down, such systems often rely on a fundamental assumption that the presence of the drone has already been detected and is known to the defender. However, there is a lack of an automated cost-effective drone detection system. In this paper, we investigate a drone detection system that is designed tao autonomously detect and characterize drones using radio frequency wireless signals. In particular, two technical approaches are proposed. The first approach is active tracking where the system sends a radio signal and then listens for its reflected component. The second approach is passive listening where it receives, extracts, and then analyzes observed wireless signal. We perform a set of preliminary experiments to explore the feasibility of the approaches using WARP and USRP software-defined platforms. Our preliminary results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed system and identify the challenges for future research.	experiment;radio frequency;radio wave;universal software radio peripheral;unmanned aerial vehicle	Phuc Nguyen;Mahesh Ravindranathan;Anh Tuan Le Nguyen;Richard Han;Tam Vu	2016		10.1145/2935620.2935632	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Robotics	-53.66750083345774	71.20350116426326	146104
8fedcfd870d111a706f247e5ff06205bd5ec3728	defending against malicious insiders: a conceptual framework for predicting, detecting, and deterring malicious insiders		Malicious insiders are posing unique security challenges to organisations owing to their knowledge, capabilities, and authorised access to information systems. Data theft and IT sabotage are two of the most recurring themes among crimes committed by malicious insiders. This paper has two aims: first, we investigate the scale and scope of malicious insider risks and explore the impact of such threats on business operations. Secondly, we present a conceptual design of the insider threat security framework (ITSF) that is able to provide self-protection capabilities. Our objective is to propose protection mechanisms that could minimise risk and battle unique threats posed by potential malicious insiders.

Wireless communications (i.e. radio frequency) are often used to remotely pilot the UAV and stream data back to the operator. The characteristics of the wireless communication channel allows attackers to monitor and manipulate the operation of the UAV through passive and active attacks. Cryptography is selected as a countermeasure to mitigate these threats; however, a drawback of using cryptography is the impact on the real-time operation and performance of the UAV. This paper proposes the Permutation Substitution Network (PSN) design paradigm with an instance presented which is the Alternative Advanced Encryption Standard (AAES) and analysis of its performance against the standardised Substitution Permutation Network (SPN) design paradigm the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Results indicate that using the PSN paradigm is a feasible approach in comparison to the SPN design paradigm.		Robert D. Sparrow;Andrew A. Adekunle;Robert J. Berry;Richard J.

Knowledge of new vulnerabilities gives cyber criminals a free pass to attack any target of their choosing, while remaining undetected. Unfortunately, these serious threats are difficult to analyze, because, in general, data is not available until after an attack is discovered. Moreover, zero-day attacks are rare events that are unlikely to be observed in honeypots or in lab experiments.  In this paper, we describe a method for automatically identifying zero-day attacks from field-gathered data that records when benign and malicious binaries are downloaded on 11 million real hosts around the world. Searching this data set for malicious files that exploit known vulnerabilities indicates which files appeared on the Internet before the corresponding vulnerabilities were disclosed. We identify 18 vulnerabilities exploited before disclosure, of which 11 were not previously known to have been employed in zero-day attacks. We also find that a typical zero-day attack lasts 312 days on average and that, after vulnerabilities are disclosed publicly, the volume of attacks exploiting them increases by up to 5 orders of magnitude.	binary file;cybercrime;experiment;honeypot (computing);internet;rare events;zero-day (computing)	Leyla Bilge;Tudor Dumitras	2012		10.1145/2382196.2382284	full disclosure;vulnerability;computer science;internet privacy;secure coding;zero-day attack;world wide web;computer security	Security	-57.31297868424094	61.83741449756277	146504
836da19c614d74b16db37951ea1df5ab2c98c846	secured miniaturized system-in-package contactless and passive authentication devices featuring nfc		Abstract RFID/NFC technology is widely spread nowadays and applications can be found in our everyday life, for example, in payment, transportation, logistics, healthcare, and access control. State-of-the-art contactless and passive authentication solutions implement relatively large coils outside of the chip. Therefore, the minimum size is in the order of a few square centimeters, which limits their use for tagging of certain small-sized goods. On top of that, those miniaturized solutions which are available today provide only limited security measures. Here we introduce miniaturized system-in-package contactless authentication devices. This novel solution integrates Infineon Technologies’ CIPURSE TM move IC, which is a state-of-the-art security solution featuring an open security standard, into embedded Wafer Level Ball Grid Array (eWLB) packages, together with HF-antennas, ferrites, as well as discrete elements that improve HF-coupling characteristics. The presented devices provide better HF-coupling characteristics than Coil-on-Chip approaches, which also enable verification of authenticity of tagged products through NFC-enabled smart phones. Thanks to the miniaturized package sizes of 3 × 3 mm, integration into high-priced products, casings, consumable materials, etc., can be achieved in a discreet way. Furthermore, the integrated CIPURSE TM chip enables not only the anti-counterfeiting use-case, but also micropayment, ticketing, access control, and password storage in a secured way. Therefore, this miniaturized contactless authentication solution will open up whole new fields of applications.	authentication;contactless smart card;near field communication;system in package	Norbert Druml;Jürgen Schilling;Walther Pachler;Bernhard Roitner;Thomas Ruprechter;Holger Bock;Gerald Holweg	2017	Microprocessors and Microsystems - Embedded Hardware Design	10.1016/j.micpro.2017.07.011	embedded wafer level ball grid array;access control;chip;password;computer science;system in package;cipurse;embedded system;micropayment;authentication	EDA	-48.897427220544486	66.98311877757348	146600

In fact, mobile phishing is particularly dangerous due to the hardware limitations of mobile devices and the habits of mobile users. In this paper, we did a comprehensive study on the security vulnerabilities caused by mobile phishing attacks, including web page phishing attacks, application phishing attacks, and account registry phishing attacks. Existing schemes designed for web phishing attacks on personal computers (PCs) cannot effectively address the various phishing attacks on mobile devices. Hence, we propose MobiFish, which is a novel automated lightweight antiphishing scheme for mobile platforms. MobiFish verifies the validity of web pages, applications, and persistent accounts by comparing the actual identity to the claimed identity. MobiFish has been implemented on a Nexus 4 smartphone running the Android 4.2 operating system. We experimentally evaluate the performance of MobiFish with 100 phishing URLs and corresponding legitimate URLs, as well as phishing apps. The results show that MobiFish is very effective in detecting phishing attacks on mobile phones.	android version history;experiment;html;heuristic (computer science);login;machine learning;mobile computing;mobile device;mobile phone;operating system;personal computer;phishing;screenshot;sensor;smartphone;vulnerability (computing);web page;web search engine	Longfei Wu;Xiaojiang Du;Jie Wu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2472993	mobile search;mobile web;mobile telephony;html;phishing;spoofed url;computer science;engineering;web page;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-55.750329791527456	61.45533523269816	146987

Regardless of the target, upon successful infiltration into a target system an attacker will commonly deploy a backdoor to maintain persistent access as well as a rootkit to evade detection on the infected machine. If the attacked system has access to classified or sensitive material, virus eradication may not be the best response. Instead, a counter-intelligence operation may be initiated to track the infiltration back to its source. It is important that the counter-intelligence operations are not visible to the infiltrator.#R##N##R##N#Rootkits can not only hide the malware, they can also be used to hide the detection and analysis operations by the defenders from the malware.

Unfortunately, computer networks (including mesh networks) are frequently being exploited by increasingly profit-driven and insidious attackers, which can affect their utility for legitimate use. In response to this, a number of countermeasures have been developed, including intrusion detection systems that aim to detect anomalous behaviour caused by attacks. We present a set of socio-technical challenges associated with developing an intrusion detection system for a community wireless mesh network. The attack space on a mesh network is particularly large; we motivate the need for and describe the challenges of adopting an asset-driven approach to managing this space. Finally, we present an initial design of a modular architecture for intrusion detection, highlighting how it addresses the identified challenges.	countermeasure (computer);intrusion detection system;mesh networking;sociotechnical system;software deployment;wireless mesh network	Dwight J.

58166900ffb63f8fe09c4b36def15c94e1208e99	identifying remnants of evidence in the cloud		With the advent of cloud computing, law enforcement investigators are facing the challenge that instead of the evidence being on a device that they can seize, the evidence is likely located in remote data centers operated by a service provider; and may even be in multiple locations (and jurisdictions) across the world. The most practical approach for an investigator when cloud computing has been used is to execute a warrant that requires the service provider to deliver the evidence. However, to do this, the investigator must be able to determine that a cloud application was used, and then must issue a warrant with reasonable scope (e.g. the subject’s username at the cloud provider, the name of the documents, the dates accessed, etc). Fortunately, most cloud applications leave remnants (e.g. cached web sites, cookies, registry entries, installed files, etc) on the client devices. This paper describes the process for identifying those remnants and parsing them to generate the data required by law enforcement to form warrants to cloud service providers. It illustrates the process by obtaining remnants from: Google Docs accessed by Internet Explorer, Dropbox, and Windows Live Mesh.	android;cache (computing);case preservation;cloud computing;data center;digital data;dropbox;google chrome;http cookie;internet explorer;microsoft windows;mobile device;parsing;software as a service;user (computing);windows live mesh;ios	Jeremy Koppen;Gerald Gent;Kevin Bryan;Lisa Cingiser DiPippo;Jillian Kramer;Marquita Moreland;Victor Fay Wolfe	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-39891-9_3	service provider;the internet;warrant;internet privacy;law enforcement;cache;cloud computing;business;digital forensics	Security	-53.10871751591662	60.93052880869208	148142

In particular, it describes the design and operation of an information-centric, graphics-oriented tool called ICMAP. ICMAP enables an analyst without any theoretical background to apply CAGs to answer security questions about vulnerabilities and likely attack scenarios, as well as to monitor network nodes.

The last two are the biggest advantages over snail mail. However, with e-mail comes the threat of a genuine user being compromised through key loggers, social engineering, shoulder surfing, password guessing and other similar, though less technical, methods. This passive espionage can have a direct impact on the genuine user in terms of denial of information, loss of money, loss of time, mental harassment and an attack of personal privacy. To enable digital forensic analysis of e-mails, we propose behavioral biometric based authentication, which is analogous to a signature in paper documents. In the proposed system, if someone other than a genuine user tries to authenticate himself, then detection and fixing is possible. Introduction Most countries recognize e-mail as legitimate document evidence. E-mails have been used as substantial sources of evidence in cases of homicide, cyber stalking, harassment, spoofed identity and espionage. The digital forensic aspect of e-mails (email forensics) requires urgent attention, due to its impact in solving most of the cases of Computer Frauds and Cyber Crimes (CFCC). To make things worse, investigative and law enforcement agencies are under-prepared to tackle the explosion of this new unseen, unheard, and innovative way of committing crime. Technologies such as quantum computing, DNA computing, and “Adaptive or Reconfigurable Computing,” [1], [16] make hardware behave flexibly and can be tailored to imitate various stipulations. The latest Wi-Fi technology and migration of wireless standards 802.11b to five times faster 802.11g [1], [16] has forced rethinking about security and authentication systems.	authentication;biometrics;cyberstalking;dna computing;digital identity;email;keystroke logging;password cracking;privacy;quantum computing;reconfigurable computing;snail mail;social engineering (security);software portability	Gaurav Gupta;Chandan Mazumdar;M.

3f498aa2a963765474bc6826cced25398e8e802c	sonar: detecting ss7 redirection attacks with audio-based distance bounding		The global telephone network is relied upon by billions every day. Central to its operation is the Signaling System 7 (SS7) protocol, which is used for setting up calls, managing mobility, and facilitating many other network services. This protocol was originally built on the assumption that only a small number of trusted parties would be able to directly communicate with its core infrastructure. As a result, SS7 — as a feature — allows all parties with core access to redirect and intercept calls for any subscriber anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, increased interconnectivity with the SS7 network has led to a growing number of illicit call redirection attacks. We address such attacks with Sonar, a system that detects the presence of SS7 redirection attacks by securely measuring call audio round-trip times between telephony devices. This approach works because redirection attacks force calls to travel longer physical distances than usual, thereby creating longer end-to-end delay. We design and implement a distance bounding-inspired protocol that allows us to securely characterize the round-trip time between the two endpoints. We then use custom hardware deployed in 10 locations across the United States and a redirection testbed to characterize how distance affects round trip time in phone networks. We develop a model using this testbed and show Sonar is able to detect 70.9% of redirected calls between call endpoints of varying attacker proximity (300–7100 miles) with low false positive rates (0.3%). Finally, we ethically perform actual SS7 redirection attacks on our own devices with the help of an industry partner to demonstrate that Sonar detects 100% of such redirections in a real network (with no false positives). As such, we demonstrate that telephone users can reliably detect SS7 redirection attacks and protect the integrity of their calls.	end-to-end principle;sensor;signalling system no. 7;sonar;system 7;testbed;url redirection;visual intercept	Christian Peeters;Hadi Abdullah;Nolen Scaife;Jasmine Bowers;Patrick Traynor;Bradley Reaves;Kevin R.

The first attack is an improved key recovery attack on WEP, which reduces the average number of packets an attacker has to intercept to recover the secret key. The second attack is (according to our knowledge) the first practical attack on WPA secured wireless networks, besides launching a dictionary attack when a weak pre-shared key (PSK) is used. The attack works if the network is using TKIP to encrypt the traffic. An attacker, who has about 12-15 minutes access to the network is then able to decrypt an ARP request or response and send 7 packets with custom content to network.	countermeasure (computer);device driver;dictionary attack;encryption;high-level programming language;key (cryptography);key escrow;key-recovery attack;password strength;pre-shared key;symmetric-key algorithm;temporal key integrity protocol;visual intercept;wi-fi protected access;wired equivalent privacy	Erik Tews;Martin Beck	2008	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1145/1514274.1514286	man-in-the-middle attack;packet drop attack;wired equivalent privacy;cryptanalysis;chosen-ciphertext attack;related-key attack;telecommunications;wi-fi protected access;computer science;fluhrer, mantin and shamir attack;wireless network;ciphertext-only attack;rc4;temporal key integrity protocol;brute-force attack;computer security;dictionary attack;computer network	Security	-53.07935715482301	69.51694275409204	148552

Despite enormous effort put in spam identification and elimination, spam is still dominating our inbox. We seek a novel and complementary approach to force spammers stop sending unsolicited messages. Our approach is to artificially inflate the number of available recipients by contaminating spammers' databases with addresses not monitored by human beings. Thus, we aim to drastically reduce the number of messages delivered to human beings as to reduce the response rate.	database;email;inbox by gmail;internet;net neutrality;software deployment;spamming	Alexandros Antonopoulos;Kyriakos Stefanidis;Artemios G.

To defend against the attackers, their public key certificates should be revoked by certificate authority. Thus, each MANET node before conducting any secure communications, should check the status of communicating parties’ certificates. Inconsistency of the certificate status information is one of the critical problems which reduce the correctness and effectiveness of the whole certificate validation process. In this paper, we conduct a Markov-chain based analysis and evaluation of the OCSP-based certificate validations in the hybrid MANETs. In particular, we focus on the ADOPT and PS-ADOPT protocols and present four absorbing Markov-chain models, three for online states whose OCSP responder is available to the MANET and the other to support offline cases where MANET may be disconnected from the OCSP responder occasionally. Finally, the results of absorbing Markov models are verified by the extensive simulations of the ADOPT and PS-ADOPT protocols in the OMNeT++ simulator.	markov chain	Mohammad Masdari	2017	J.

The symmetric ciphers are often considered as a best way to encrypt the communication in the limited devices. Despite the fact that there are many hardware optimized solutions, there are still areas where these solutions cannot be used i.e. due to the limiting price or power. This paper focus on a software optimization of the symmetric cipher on limited micro-controller. Two main implementation are introduced. Further, we provide experimental measurements and possible suggestions for time consumption and memory use reduction.	encryption;program optimization;ti msp430	Radek Fujdiak;Petr Mlynek;Jiri Misurec;Janko Slacik	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-57141-6_50	software construction;aes implementations;disk encryption theory;computer engineering;encryption;program optimization;disk encryption hardware;symmetric-key algorithm;theoretical computer science;encryption software;computer science	Theory	-51.443883111011175	72.8030851536799	148690

This paper analyzes several of the more widespread worms and develops a general life-cycle for them. The lifecycle, from the point of view of the victim host, consists of four stages: target selection, exploitation, infection, and propagation. While not all worms fall into this framework perfectly, by understanding them in this way, it becomes apparent that the majority of detection techniques used today focus on the first three stages. This paper presents a technique that is used in the fourth stage to detect the class of worms that use a horizontal scan to propagate. An argument is also made that detection in the fourth stage is a viable, but under-used technique.	firewall (computing);honeypot (computing);inbound marketing;internet;intrusion detection system;network packet;programming paradigm;software propagation	Florian P.

Although several fully decentralized peer-to-peer systems h ave been proposed in the literature, most existing systems still employ a centralized architecture. The Kad network is a notable exception. Since the demise of the Overnet network, the Kad network has b ecome the most popular peer-topeer system based on a distributed hash table. It is likely th at its user base will continue to grow in numbers over the next few years due to the system’s scalabili ty and reliability. The contribution of the article is twofold. First, we compar e the two networks accessed by eMule: the centralized paradigm of the eDonkey network and the stru ctu ed, distributed approach pursued by the Kad network. We re-engineer the eDonkey server software and integrate two modified servers into the eDonkey network in order to monitor traffic. Additio nally, we implement a Kad client exploiting a design weakness to spy on the traffic at arbitrar y locations in the ID space. The collected data provides insights into the spacial and temporal distri butions of the peers’ activity. Moreover, it allows us to study the searched content. The article also dis cusses problems related to the collection of such data sets and investigates techniques to verify the r epr sentativeness of the measured data. Second, this article shows that today’s Kad network can be at tacked in several ways. Our simple attacks could be used either to hamper the correct functioni ng of the network itself, to censor content, or to harm other entities in the Internet not participating i the Kad network, such as ordinary web ∗Address for correspondence: Ernst Reuter Platz 7 (TEL 16), D 10587 Berlin, Germany 384 S. Schmid et al. / eDonkey & eMule’s Kad: Measurements & Attac ks servers. While there are heuristics to improve the robustne s of Kad, we believe that the attacks cannot be thwarted easily in a fully decentralized peer-topeer system, i.e., without some kind of a centralized certification and verification authority. This re ult may be relevant in the context of the current debate on the design of a clean-slate network archit ecture for the Internet which is based on concepts known from the peer-to-peer paradigm.	authentication;censoring (statistics);centralized computing;certificate authority;computational resource;dictionary attack;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;distributed hash table;edonkey network;entity;future internet;heuristic (computer science);kad network;limbo;overnet;peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;server (computing);spamming;the european library;threat (computer);throughput;emule	Thomas Locher;Stefan Schmid;Roger Wattenhofer	2011	Fundam.

This is especially true today as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks constitute one of the largest threats faced by Internet users and cloud computing services. DDoS attacks target the resources of these services, lowering their ability to provide optimum usage of the network infrastructure. Due to the nature of cloud computing, the methodologies for preventing or stopping DDoS attacks are quite different compared to those used in traditional networks. In this paper, we investigate the effect of DDoS attacks on cloud resources and recommend practical defense mechanisms against different types of DDoS attacks in the cloud environment.	cloud computing;denial-of-service attack	Marwan Darwish;Abdelkader H.

This paper presents lessons learned from investigations involving encryption in various contexts. By presenting successful and unsuccessful case examples, this paper gives forensic examiners a clearer understanding of the feasibility and limitations of various approaches to dealing with encryption. Additionally, by demonstrating how encryption has been successfully dealt with in past investigations, this paper provides examiners with techniques that we can apply in our work and encourages us to aggressively confront encryption. 1.0 Introduction As criminals become more aware of the capabilities of forensic examiners to recover digital evidence they are making more use of encryption technology to conceal incriminating data. Organized criminals use readily available encryption software (United States v. Scarfo) and online child pornographers encrypt their communications and the files they exchange (McAuliffe, 2001).

2a31ba2b4f5026a96191d0b1660828c9e9041959	rads: real-time anomaly detection system for cloud data centres		Cybersecurity attacks in Cloud data centres are increasing alongside the growth of the Cloud services market. Existing research proposes a number of anomaly detection systems for detecting such attacks. However, these systems encounter a number of challenges, specifically due to the unknown behaviour of the attacks and the occurrence of genuine Cloud workload spikes, which must be distinguished from attacks. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and investigate the issues with the existing Cloud anomaly detection approaches. Then, we propose a Real-time Anomaly Detection System (RADS) for Cloud data centres, which uses a one class classification algorithm and a window-based time series analysis to address the challenges. Specifically, RADS can detect VM-level anomalies occurring due to DDoS and cryptomining attacks. We evaluate the performance of RADS by running lab-based experiments and by using real-world Cloud workload traces. Evaluation results demonstrate that RADS can achieve 90-95% accuracy with a low false positive rate of 0-3%. The results further reveal that RADS experiences fewer false positives when using its windowbased time series analysis in comparison to using state-of-the-art average or entropy based analysis.	algorithm;anomaly detection;central processing unit;cloud computing;computer security;data center;denial-of-service attack;experiment;f1 score;optimistic concurrency control;platform as a service;real-time clock;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;sensor;time series;tracing (software)	Sakil Barbhuiya;Zafeirios C.

176cfa7830ea60d818a2d13f0cbce8795a112839	dandelion - revealing malicious groups of interest in large mobile networks		There are an enormous number of security anomalies that occur across the Internet on a daily basis. These anomalies are typically viewed as individual security events that are manually analyzed in order to detect an attack and take action. Important characteristics of an attack may go unnoticed due to limited manual resources. Mobile attacks introduce further complexity by typically traversing multiple types of networks making correlation and detection even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a system Dandelion, which aims to automatically correlate individual security anomalies together to reveal an entire mobile attack campaign. The system also identifies previously unknown malicious network entities that are highly correlated. Our prototype system correlates thousands of network anomalies across both the SMS and IP networks of a large US tier-1 mobile service provider, reducing them to approximately (20sim 30) groups of interest a day. To demonstrate Dandelion’s value, we show how our system has provided the critical information necessary to human analysts in detecting and mitigating previously unknown mobile attacks.

This practice exposes sensitive page content to confidentiality and integrity attacks launched by advertisements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for addressing security threats posed by third-party advertisements. The heart of our framework is an innovative isolation mechanism that enables publishers to transparently interpose between advertisements and end users. The mechanism supports finegrained policy specification and enforcement, and does not affect the user experience of interactive ads. Evaluation of our framework suggests compatibility with several mainstream ad networks, security from many threats from advertisements and acceptable performance overheads.	confidentiality;personally identifiable information;user experience;web page	Mike Ter Louw;Karthik Thotta Ganesh;V.

Toward this goal, PBS takes a hybrid approach: a proactive approach of explicit permissions and a reactive approach of monitoring and countering attacks. PBS uses a concept similar to existing capability-based systems in the manner in which the sender should get authorization (permission) from a receiver for flows. However, PBS introduces new and practical approaches to overcome the deficiencies (the difficulty of obtaining permission and incompatibility with current network architecture) of those systems. On-path signaling enables easy installation and management of the permission state. Working on current network protocols supports compatibility and allows PBS to be deployed in existing networks. In addition, a monitoring mechanism provides a second line of defense against attacks. Our analysis and performance evaluation show that PBS is an effective and scalable solution to prevent several kinds of attacks, and improves the resilience of the system against network failure by using soft-state mechanisms.	algorithm;authorization;communications protocol;dos;datagram transport layer security;denial-of-service attack;ipsec;network architecture;network traffic control;performance evaluation;personal digital assistant;proactive parallel suite;public-key cryptography;scalability;soft state;software incompatibility	Se Gi Hong;Henning Schulzrinne	2013	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2013.6553683	network traffic control;intelligent computer network;telecommunications;computer science;network security;network simulation;computer security;computer network	Security	-58.20337508398753	67.08836197444887	149381
c6db2b33072ea4623882e56703b183d502a41ce4	how secure are computers in the u.s.a.?: an analysis of a series of attacks on milnet computers		For 10 months, we monitored a systematic attack on 450 computers attached to the Defense Data Network. By analyzing the success of these attacks, we can estimate the vulnerability of nodes on the Milnet and (by extrapolation) civilian computers. We analyzed a particular type of attack: an outsider who attempts to log in by guessing at commonly used account name/password combinations. An outsider can expect some degree of access into about 13% of Milnet computers. Access to a programming environment is possible in at least 4%, and system manager privileges can be obtained by strangers in 2% of the sampled sites. Since this is only one of several methods used to enter these systems, these estimates are lower limits; other methods of entry can permit access to still more systems. These weaknesses are due to poor administration of computers, as well as systems distributed by vendors with security features disabled.	computer	Cliff Stoll	1988	Computers & Security	10.1016/0167-4048(88)90003-X	computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	Crypto	-52.767542529459526	62.05834905214609	149527
8daa8bd9244e92836f29b55b0a99dfaf1eab7e61	proactive defense against physical denial of service attacks using poisson signaling games		While the Internet of things (IoT) promises to improve areas such as energy efficiency, health care, and transportation, it is highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks overload the bandwidth of a server. But many IoT devices form part of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Therefore, they can be used to launch “physical” denial-of-service attacks (PDoS) in which IoT devices overflow the “physical bandwidth” of a CPS. In this paper, we quantify the population-based risk to a group of IoT devices targeted by malware for a PDoS attack. In order to model the recruitment of bots, we develop a “Poisson signaling game,” a signaling game with an unknown number of receivers, which have varying abilities to detect deception. Then we use a version of this game to analyze two mechanisms (legal and economic) to deter botnet recruitment. Equilibrium results indicate that (1) defenders can bound botnet activity, and (2) legislating a minimum level of security has only a limited effect, while incentivizing active defense can decrease botnet activity arbitrarily. This work provides a quantitative foundation for proactive PDoS defense.	botnet;cell signaling;cyber-physical system;denial-of-service attack;internet of things;malware;server (computing)	Jeffrey Pawlick;Quanyan Zhu	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68711-7_18	deception;computer security;botnet;efficient energy use;signaling game;malware;computer science;population;computer network;bandwidth (signal processing);denial-of-service attack	Security	-56.69254863478073	72.31582673041557	149611

In this paper, we propose a “Hardened Network” system, which is based on intelligent routers. This network can be incrementally deployed on the Internet to make the Internet secure and resilient to DDoS attacks. This Hardened Network does not need modifications to the endhosts. It can detect a DDoS attack before it severely slows down the target machine or the network. Then it can selectively drop packets close to the sources and hence it can stop the attack at points closer to the attack origin. This research is partially supported by grants from AFOSR, DARPA and NSF.	denial-of-service attack;ibm notes;internet;router (computing)	Zhang Shu;Partha Dasgupta	2003			trinoo;internet privacy;application layer ddos attack;computer security;computer network	Security	-58.13426508429215	69.16348273018815	149615

The attackers usually use IP spoofing to conceal their real location. The current Internet protocols and infrastructure do not provide intrinsic support to traceback the real attack sources. The objective of IP Traceback is to determine the real attack sources, as well as the full path taken by the attack packets. Different traceback methods have been proposed, such as IP logging, IP marking and IETF ICMP Traceback (ITrace). In this paper, we propose an enhancement to the ICMP Traceback approach, called ICMP Traceback with Cumulative Path (ITrace-CP). The enhancement consists in encoding the entire attack path information in the ICMP Traceback message. Analytical and simulation studies have been performed to evaluate the performance improvements. We demonstrated that our enhanced solution provides faster construction of the attack graph, with only marginal increase in computation, storage and bandwidth.	computation;denial-of-service attack;ip address spoofing;ip traceback;item unique identification;marginal model;overhead (computing);performance;ping (networking utility);requirement;simulation;time of arrival	Henry C.

As an application of the WSN, the wireless medical sensor network (WMSN) could improve health-care quality and has become important in the modern medical system. In the WMSN, physiological data are collected by sensors deployed in the patient’s body and sent to health professionals’ mobile devices through wireless communication. Then health professionals could get the status of the patient anywhere and anytime. The data collected by sensors are very sensitive and important. The leakage of them could compromise the patient’s privacy and their malicious modification could harm the patient’s health. Therefore, both security and privacy are two important issues in WMSNs. Recently, Kumar et al. proposed an efficient authentication protocol for health-care applications using WMSNs and claimed that it could withstand various attacks. However, we find that their protocol is vulnerable to the off-line password guessing attack and the privileged insider attack. We also point out that their protocol cannot provide user anonymity. In this paper, we will propose a robust anonymous authentication protocol for health-care applications using WMSNs. Compared with Kumar et al.’s protocol, the proposed protocol has strong security and computational efficiency. Therefore, it is more suitable for health-care applications using WMSNs.	algorithmic efficiency;anytime algorithm;authentication protocol;communications protocol;computation;malware;mobile device;online and offline;password cracking;privacy;semiconductor;sensor;spectral leakage	Debiao He;Neeraj Kumar;Jianhua Chen;Cheng-Chi Lee;Naveen K.

The forensic science is striving to find new methodologies to analyze the massive quantity of data normally present in a medium-sized workstation, which can have up to several terabytes of storage devices. As a result, the live forensic approach seems to be the only one which can guarantee promptness in obtaining evidential data to be used in the investigative process. The current approach of volatile forensic analysis does not consider the pagefile as an important element to be used in the analysis. Therefore, we have developed a solution which permits to correlate evidential data within the pagefile to the relative process located in the RAM dump.

At the early stage of a DDoS attack, some traffic fluctuations are detectable at Internet routers or at the gateways of edge networks. We develop a distributed change-point detection (DCD) architecture using change aggregation trees (CAT). The idea is to detect abrupt traffic changes across multiple network domains at the earliest time. Early detection of DDoS attacks minimizes the floe cling damages to the victim systems serviced by the provider. The system is built over attack-transit routers, which work together cooperatively. Each ISP domain has a CAT server to aggregate the flooding alerts reported by the routers. CAT domain servers collaborate among themselves to make the final decision. To resolve policy conflicts at different ISP domains, a new secure infrastructure protocol (SIP) is developed to establish mutual trust or consensus. We simulated the DCD system up to 16 network domains on the Cyber Defense Technology Experimental Research (DETER) testbed, a 220-node PC cluster for Internet emulation experiments at the University of Southern California (USC) Information Science Institute. Experimental results show that four network domains are sufficient to yield a 98 percent detection accuracy with only 1 percent false-positive alarms. Based on a 2006 Internet report on autonomous system (AS) domain distribution, we prove that this DDoS defense system can scale well to cover 84 AS domains. This security coverage is wide enough to safeguard most ISP core networks from real-life DDoS flooding attacks.	aggregate data;autonomous system (internet);denial-of-service attack;emulator;experiment;information science;real life;router (computing);sensor;server (computing);testbed	Yu Chen;Kai Hwang;Wei-Shinn Ku	2007	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2007.1111	trinoo;computer science;network security;operating system;database;distributed computing;internet privacy;application layer ddos attack;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Security	-60.19646331886055	67.4710032981045	150515

Some of them can detect a mixture of assortative and disassortative structures in networks. All these methods are based on the fact that the entire network is observable. However, in the real world, the entities in networks, for example a social network, may be private, and thus, cannot be observed. We focus on private peer-to-peer networks in which all vertices are independent and private, and each vertex only knows about itself and its neighbors. We propose a privacy-preserving Gibbs sampling for clustering these types of private networks and detecting their mixed structures without revealing any private information about any individual entity. Moreover, the running cost of our method is related only to the number of clusters and the maximum degree, but is nearly independent of the number of vertices in the entire network.	assortativity;cluster analysis;cryptocurrency tumbler;entity;gibbs sampling;observable;peer-to-peer;personally identifiable information;privacy;private network;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor industry;sensor;social network;vertex (geometry)	Bin Yang;Issei Sato;Hiroshi Nakagawa	2011	2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining	10.1109/ICDM.2011.127	sampling;private information retrieval;evolving networks;gibbs sampling;computer science;network security;machine learning;data mining;generalized complex structure;internet privacy;cluster analysis;privacy;world wide web;social network	DB	-58.4686109630152	62.991817951466814	150585
7a9c63f3d735dcdc7bdb4d3e649f3d414f8b6e62	a survey on security vulnerabilities in channel assignment algorithms of multi-interface wireless mesh networks	multi radio multi channel;wireless mesh networks;channel assignment attacks;secure channel assignment algorithms	Wireless mesh network (WMN) has been deployed as a key and progressing technology all around the world to provide the end-to-end users with high quality of service. Regarding of its major design concern as network throughput, WMN has been evolved based on multi-channel multi-radio strategy to make simultaneous transmissions possible. The advent of this significant improvement has introduced other challenging issues such as channel assignment (CA). Its core strategy applied in multi-radio multi-channel WMNs to promote achievable capacity using properly mapping the available channels to the radio interfaces. Although, in recent years, there are a number of research studies on CA’s improvement, there are some security drawbacks that should be addressed. Most of CA schemes assume all nodes involved in CA techniques are trustworthy. This unrealistic assumption and misbehavior of those nodes makes the network susceptible to various security attacks which lead to performance degradation. This paper presents an in-depth survey of the CA’s attacks as well as detection or prevention mechanism found in the literature. The attacks are classified into two groups: attacks imposed by the malicious neighbor as well as by the assigner or the assignee. In addition, a comparative and analytical discussion is provided on current solutions and their open problems. According to conducted analysis, the current knowledge gap leading to most of these attacks is lack of accurate verification because of implicit trust in nodes in CA procedure. Although, there are some research studies proposing kinds of case-specific verification, they cannot close the gap properly, and there is a need to comprehensive approach. Finally, reviewing state-of-the-art of related works shows, there are more possible attacks such as collusion or multistage attacks that have not taken into account so far.

b3e56ef0fe1d962669036f7d6aca9d893321314c	fine-grained fingerprinting threats to software-defined networks		Thanks to its flexibility and programmable features, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been attracting more and more attention from the academia and the industry. Unfortunately, the fundamental characteristic of SDN that decouples control plane from data plane becomes a potential attack surface as well, which enables adversaries to fingerprint and attack the SDNs. Existing work showed the possibility of fingerprinting an SDN with time-based features. However, they are coarse grained. This paper proposes a fine-grained fingerprinting approach and reveals the much more severe threats to SDN Security. By analyzing network packets, the approach digs out match fields of SDN flow rules innovatively. Being sensitive and control-related information in SDN, the match fields of flow rules can be used to infer the type of an SDN controller and the security policy of the network. With these sensitive configuration information, adversaries can launch more targeted and destructive attacks against an SDN. We implement our approach in both simulative and physical environments. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with different kinds of SDN controllers to verify the effectiveness of our concept. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility to obtain highly sensitive, fine-grained information in SDN, and hence reveal the high risk of information disclosure in SDN and severe threats of attacks against SDN.	attack surface;complex network;control plane;experiment;fingerprint (computing);forwarding plane;information sensitivity;network packet;software-defined networking;testbed;threat (computer)	Minjian Zhang;Jianwei Hou;Ziqi Zhang;Wenchang Shi;Bo Qin;Bin Liang	2017	2017 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS	10.1109/Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS.2017.229	computer network;computer security;process control;control theory;forwarding plane;computer science;attack surface;security policy;software-defined networking;network packet;distributed computing;control system	Security	-58.16915636401174	67.25489426784706	150822

Today, network administrators need to be able to investigate and analyse the network traffic to understand what is happening and to deploy immediate response in case of an identified attack. Wireshark proves to be an effective open source tool in the study of network packets and their behaviour. In this regard, Wireshark can be used in identifying and categorising various types of attack signatures. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how Wireshark is applied in network protocol diagnosis and can be used to discover traditional network attacks such as port scanning, covert FTP and IRC channels, ICMP-based attacks, BitTorrent-driven denial service, and etc. In addition, the case studies in this paper illustrate the idea of using Wireshark to identify new attack vectors.	wireshark	Vivens Ndatinya;Zhifeng Xiao;Vasudeva Rao Manepalli;Ke Meng;Yang Xiao	2015	IJSN	10.1504/IJSN.2015.070421	network packet;computer science;network security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;network forensics	Logic	-59.991326642857885	65.0473791806016	151438

Indeed, a typical CDN with its vast resources can absorb these attacks without noticeable effect. This paper uncovers a vulnerability which not only allows an attacker to penetrate CDN’s protection, but to actually use a content delivery network to amplify the attack against a customer Web site. We show that leading commercial CDNs – Akamai and Limelight – and an influential research CDN – Coral – can be recruited for this attack. By mounting an attack against our own Web site, we demonstrate an order of magnitude attack amplification though leveraging the Coral CDN. We present measures that both content providers and CDNs can take to defend against our attack. We believe it is important that CDN operators and their customers be aware of this attack so that they could protect themselves accordingly.	cache pollution;content delivery network;denial-of-service attack;digital distribution;emoticon;self-replication;server (computing)	Sipat Triukose;Zakaria Al-Qudah;Michael Rabinovich	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04444-1_23	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;denial-of-service attack	Security	-55.45349845546757	62.20989626522869	151726

First, we introduce the notion of a mimicry attack, which allows a sophisticated attacker to cloak their intrusion to avoid detection by the IDS. Then, we develop a theoretical framework for evaluating the security of an IDS against mimicry attacks. We show how to break the security of one published IDS with these methods, and we experimentally confirm the power of mimicry attacks by giving a worked example of an attack on a concrete IDS implementation. We conclude with a call for further research on intrusion detection from both attacker's and defender's viewpoints.	anomaly detection;dictionary attack;evasion (network security);experiment;intrusion detection system	David A.

346dc614296524faa91cd32a534fdb2228fcf7f8	designed to fail: a usb-connected reader for online banking	part of book or chapter of book	We present a security analysis of an internet banking system used by one of the bigger banks in the Netherlands, in which customers use a USB-connected device – a smartcard reader with a display and numeric keyboard – to authorise transactions with their bank card and PIN code. Such a set-up could provide a very strong defence against online attackers, notably Man-in-the-Browser attacks, where an attacker controls the browser and host PC. However, we show that the system we studied is seriously flawed: an attacker who controls an infected host PC can get the smartcard to sign transactions that the user does not explicitly approve, which is precisely what the device is meant to prevent. The flaw is not due to a simple implementation bug in one of the components (e.g. the device or the software components on the PC). It is a more fundamental design flaw, introduced in assigning responsibilities to the different components and designing the protocols between them. The system we studied, used by the Dutch bank ABN-AMRO, was developed by the Swedish company Todos AB. This company has since been acquired by Gemalto. ABN-AMRO is one of the three biggest banks in the Netherlands, with 6.8 million customers. Given the popularity of internet banking in the Netherlands, this means that millions of these devices are in the field. The manufacturer claims this device is “the most secure sign-what-you-see end-user device ever seen” ; this paper demonstrates this claim to be false.	algorithm;antivirus software;australian bibliographic network;authorization;card reader;component-based software engineering;cryptogram;cryptography;device driver;digital signature;flaw hypothesis methodology;man-in-the-browser;online banking;rsa (cryptosystem);reverse engineering;sha-1;smart card;software bug;swift (programming language);the superficial;triple des;usb	Arjan Blom;Gerhard de Koning Gans;Erik Poll;Joeri de Ruiter;Roel Verdult	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34210-3_1	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-50.3880215025549	64.44656646973057	152370

The features of the mobile agent are too big when compared with the static agent and conventional communication system. However, the security issues of the mobile agent and mobile agent platform lags its usage. Even though the protection models are available for the mobile agent environment, the vulnerabilities still exist or the models need more computational time. To mitigate these issues related with the agent platform, this paper proposed an artificial immune system (AIS) based model. The proposed model will give the separation of duties and clones to handle multiple foreign agents simultaneously to achieve the computational efficiency. The experimental results and the constructed results from the experimental results have proved that this proposed model will consume less computational time when compared with the existing models. It will detect the malicious agent by extracting and matching the patterns with the available malicious patterns and also it can identify the new malicious patterns through monitoring the agent process.	artificial immune system;mobile agent	S.

049dd73a6b3d84517483fb5f8c5fe36221f9597e	off-path tcp exploit: how wireless routers can jeopardize your secrets.		In this study, we discover a subtle yet serious timing side channel that exists in all generations of half-duplex IEEE 802.11 or Wi-Fi technology. Previous TCP injection attacks stem from software vulnerabilities which can be easily eliminated via software update, but the side channel we report is rooted in the fundamental design of IEEE 802.11 protocols. This design flaw means it is impossible to eliminate the side channel without substantial changes to the specification. By studying the TCP stacks of modern operating systems and their potential interactions with the side channel, we can construct reliable and practical off-path TCP injection attacks against the latest versions of all three major operating systems (macOS, Windows, and Linux). Our attack only requires a device connected to the Internet via a wireless router, and be reachable from an attack server (e.g., indirectly so by accessing to a malicious website). Among possible attacks scenarios, such as inferring the presence of connections and counting exchanged bytes, we demonstrate a particular threat where an off-path attacker can poison the web cache of an unsuspecting user within minutes (as fast as 30 seconds) under realistic network conditions.	byte;duplex (telecommunications);flaw hypothesis methodology;interaction;internet;linux;microsoft windows;modern operating systems;operating system;patch (computing);router (computing);server (computing);side-channel attack;vulnerability (computing);web cache;wireless router;macos	Weiteng Chen;Zhiyun Qian	2018			computer security;wireless;computer science;exploit	Security	-54.80761381078571	64.4367517132838	152555

510db3184e93451a669d00aae9ace7940bffeaf7	increasing the effectiveness of packet marking schemes using wrap-around counting bloom filter	bloom filter;network security;ip traceback;deterministic packet marking;probabilistic packet marking;distributed denial of service attack	Latest variants of denial-of-service attack like low-rate denial-of-service attack require very few packets for launching an attack. As a result, reducing the number of packets required for IP traceback has gained considerable importance. In packet marking schemes, routers probabilistically mark the packets. Therefore, a large number of packets is required by the victim to reconstruct the complete attack path. In this paper, we introduce an efficient data structure known as wrap-around counting Bloom filter (WCBF) to minimize the required number of packets. WCBF maintains a set of cyclic counters to decide which particular mark needs to be sent to the victim for faster IP traceback. We prove the efficacy of our technique by performing detailed theoretical analysis and confirm it using extensive experimental results. In case of probabilistic packet marking, the proposed scheme reduces the number of packets by 5–10 times. Likewise, in case of deterministic packet marking, the number of packets required is reduced by 2–4 times. We also show that WCBF can be incorporated with different variants of probabilistic packet marking and deterministic packet marking to obtain effective results. Finally, we highlight the benefits of WCBF over the other traceback schemes like logging and hybrid traceback.

Therefore, the security of smartphones turns to a great concern. Recently, Android as the most popular smartphone platform has been targeted by the attackers. Many severe attacks to Android are caused by malicious applications which acquire excessive privileges at install time. Moreover some applications are able to collude together in order to increase their privileges by sharing their permissions. This paper proposes a mechanism for preventing this kind of collusion attack on Android by detecting the applications which are able to share their acquired permissions. By applying the proposed mechanism on a set of 290 applications downloaded from the Android official market, Google Play, the number of detected applications which potentially are able to conduct malicious activities increased by 12.90% in compare to the existing detection mechanism. Results showed that there were 4 applications among the detected applications which were able to collude together in order to acquire excessive privileges and were totally ignored by the existing method.	android;malware;play store;privilege (computing);sensor;smartphone	Iman Kashefi;Maryam Kassiri;Mazleena Salleh	2015	Int.

1cac4cd925fa43f96dae448f0e73b94b918045f2	a robust and efficient birthmark-based android application filtering system	filtering;piracy and security;birthmark;robustness;android application	Since it is very easy to decompile and repackage Android applications (or apps), many paid apps in the official Android Market are exposed to software piracy such as illegal copy, license cracking, and illegal distribution. To address this problem, we can employ app filtering systems that can prevent OSP servers from distributing illegally copied or tampered apps. In this paper, we propose a birthmark-based Android app filtering system. The system extracts birthmarks from APK files, and compares the birthmarks to examine if a given APK file is actually identical to one of (paid) original apps, that is, the APK file is a duplicated or tampered one. The experimental results show that the system is efficient and robust in the sense that the birthmark size is very small and the tampered apps can be identified effectively.	android;decompiler;password cracking	SeongWook Kang;Hyungjoon Shim;Seong-je Cho;Minkyu Park;Sangchul Han	2014		10.1145/2663761.2664231	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-55.64840220402628	60.88369865761505	153021

Thus, it is crucial to study and analyze botnets, to take them down. For this, an extensive monitoring is a pre-requisite for preparing a botnet takedown, e.g., via a sinkholing attack. However, every new monitoring mechanism developed for botnets is usually tackled by the botmasters by introducing novel antimonitoring countermeasures. In this paper, we anticipate these countermeasures by proposing a set of lightweight techniques for detecting the presence of crawlers in P2P botnets, called BoobyTrap. For that, we exploit botnet-specific protocol and design constraints. We evaluate the performance of our BoobyTrap mechanism on two real-world botnets: Sality and ZeroAccess. Our results indicate that we can distinguish many crawlers from benign bots. In fact, we discovered close to 10 crawler nodes within our observation period in the Sality botnet and around 120 in the ZeroAccess botnet. In addition, we also describe the observable characteristics of the detected crawlers and suggest crawler improvements for enabling monitoring in the presence of the BoobyTrap mechanism.	bt managed security solutions;database;denial-of-service attack;internet;observable;sality;sensor;takedown: red sabre;vii;web crawler;zeroaccess botnet	Shankar Karuppayah;Emmanouil Vasilomanolakis;Steffen Haas;Max Mühlhäuser;Mathias Fischer	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7510885	maintenance engineering;cutwail botnet;srizbi botnet;rustock botnet;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;server;computer network	DB	-59.57775221214952	65.87704221225255	153139
1d05d016eadb8f333172c7dfc8eadcbaf7dfa3b2	blinc: multilevel traffic classification in the dark	transport layer;traffic classification;traffic flow	We present a fundamentally different approach to classifying traffic flows according to the applications that generate them. In contrast to previous methods, our approach is based on observing and identifying patterns of host behavior at the transport layer. We analyze these patterns at three levels of increasing detail (i) the social, (ii) the functional and (iii) the application level. This multilevel approach of looking at traffic flow is probably the most important contribution of this paper. Furthermore, our approach has two important features. First, it operates in the dark, having (a) no access to packet payload, (b) no knowledge of port numbers and (c) no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. These restrictions respect privacy, technological and practical constraints. Second, it can be tuned to balance the accuracy of the classification versus the number of successfully classified traffic flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three real traces. Our results show that we are able to classify 80%-90% of the traffic with more than 95% accuracy.	emoticon;network packet;privacy;tracing (software);traffic classification	Thomas Karagiannis;Konstantina Papagiannaki;Michalis Faloutsos	2005		10.1145/1080091.1080119	simulation;traffic classification;telecommunications;computer science;traffic flow;computer security;transport layer;computer network	Networks	-60.38659909003629	67.07319548302445	153227

The state-of-the-art practice in securing wireless networks is based on the technique of authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) framework where an AAA server is adopted to authenticate mobile users (MUs), handle authorization requests, and collect accounting data. However, the traditional AAA framework is by way of a single authentication server, and cannot tolerate AAA server failure due to various malicious attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) attack, or any other failure event such that the authentication server is compromised due to misuse, misconfiguration and malicious access, etc. Thus, a more resilient approach is to adopt multiple authentication servers, where any authentication request is handled by more than one authentication servers in order to resist any compromise event of an authentication server. To meet this design objective, we introduce a novel compromise-resilient authentication system based on (t, n) threshold signature technique. With the proposed system, only t or more out of n authentication servers can cooperatively allow a MU to have network access, and any t-1 or less cannot. Case study of reliability analysis is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system. The proposed authentication system is expected to particularly contribute to wireless mesh networking (WMN) in metropolitan areas where thousands of nodes may coexist and are managed under a single control plane such that duplicated AAA servers are necessary.	aaa (video game industry);access network;authentication server;authorization;bilinear filtering;coexist (image);control plane;denial-of-service attack;login;malware;mesh networking;radius;server (computing);service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;telecommunications network;wireless mesh network	Xiaodong Lin;Rongxing Lu;Pin-Han Ho;Xuemin Shen;Zhenfu Cao	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.649	data authentication algorithm;ntlmssp;chip authentication program;computer access control;challenge–response authentication;computer science;authentication protocol;internet authentication service;generic bootstrapping architecture;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;internet privacy;computer security;email authentication;denial-of-service attack;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;computer network	Security	-54.0956304943137	70.625885539703	153387

We propose intelligent technique to visualize and extract threats from logs files using D3.js modules with standard RegEx API, called """"FLUKES"""". In this paper we investigate the text-based ASCII format FTP, Snort, Apache and IIS server logs. When a content of a file type .json, .csv, .log, and .txt format is loaded into FLUKES, a representative summary is executed with least significant attack traces. FLUKES will formalize and generate a new signature pattern that eases the process of detection and analysis of threat anomalies in log files. Forensic investigators can then determine a set of certain fields relevant to the attack according to the corresponding target. We present an example investigation comparison based on FTP and Apache server logs collected and managed using Snort. The ultimate contribution is to forensically determine the summary of authentication (failed and successful) attempts to secure systems and traces found without altering the log evidence."""	algorithm;antivirus software;authentication;data logger;data-driven documents (d3.js);graphical user interface;internet information services;json;machine learning;pa-risc;parsing;regular expression;server (computing);server log;snort;software development kit;text-based (computing);tracing (software);warez	Monther Aldwairi;Hesham H.

However, the major problems currently faced by the research community is the lack of availability of any realistic evaluation dataset and systematic metric for assessing the quantified quality of realism of any intrusion detection system dataset. It is difficult to access and collect data from real-world enterprise networks due to business continuity and integrity issues. In response to this, in this paper, firstly, a metric using a fuzzy logic system based on the Sugeno fuzzy inference model for evaluating the quality of the realism of existing intrusion detection system datasets is proposed. Secondly, based on the proposed metric results, a synthetically realistic next generation intrusion detection systems dataset is designed and generated, and a preliminary analysis conducted to assist in the design of future intrusion detection systems. This generated dataset consists of both normal and abnormal reflections of current network activities occurring at critical cyber infrastructure levels in various enterprises. Finally, using the proposed metric, the generated dataset is analyzed to assess the quality of its realism, with its comparison with publicly available intrusion detection system datasets for verifying its superiority.

While previous work has looked at the libraries' abilities to extract private information from the system, advertising libraries also include APIs through which a host application can deliberately leak private information about the user. This study, considering a corpus of 114,000 apps, is the first to focus on those APIs. We reconstruct the APIs for 103 ad libraries used in the corpus, and study how the privacy leaking APIs from the top 20 ad libraries are used by the 64,000 applications in which they are included. Notably, we have found that app popularity correlates with privacy leakage; the marginal increase in advertising revenue, multiplied over a larger user base, seems to incentivize these app vendors to violate their users' privacy.	android;application programming interface;data theft;internet privacy;library (computing);marginal model;personally identifiable information;spectral leakage;text corpus	Theodore Book;Dan S.

These devices can be connected to the Internet through both physical and wireless connections, and sensitive data transferred to and from these devices are subject to interception by a third party. Real-time encryption/decryption of data in handheld computers is complicated by the limited computing power available in these devices. In this paper we describe a method for secure transmission of data between remote handheld devices and other users (including other handheld devices) on the Internet. The system relies on one-time-pad technology which is ideally suited for handheld computing. The process of encrypting/decrypting data requires very little computation, and the generation of the random pads can be accomplished outside of the handheld devices. A prototype system is described which permits secure transmission of data through IR, radio Ethernet, or physical connection.	internet;secure communication	Michael R. M. Jenkin;Patrick W.

This study proposes an analysis tool to visualize segment-based firewall rules to facilitate verification of the current control conditions. The proposed visualization tool analyzes the current control conditions of packets automatically, thereby eliminating the need for manual inspection as before, and displays the conditions with a visualization model to allow them to be easily verified. This enables managers to perform fast and accurate verification to assess whether packets are allowed or denied. This present study involved implementing the proposed visualization tool, and simulations were conducted to verify that the proposed approach was achievable. The present study also included conducting interviews with firewall experts whose feedback was positive.

ee70ea8458873429bb9f151eae1bd2d61de59814	use of data visualisation for zero-day malware detection		With the explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) worldwide, there is an increasing threat from malicious software (malware) attackers that calls for efficient monitoring of vulnerable systems. Large amounts of data collected from computer networks, servers, and mobile devices need to be analysed for malware proliferation. Effective analysis methods are needed to match with the scale and complexity of such a data-intensive environment. In today’s Big Data contexts, visualisation techniques can support malware analysts going through the time-consuming process of analysing suspicious activities thoroughly. This paper takes a step further in contributing to the evolving realm of visualisation techniques used in the information security field. The aim of the paper is twofold: to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing visualisation techniques for detecting suspicious behaviour of systems and to design a novel visualisation using similarity matrix method for establishing malware classification accurately. The prime motivation of our proposal is to identify obfuscated malware using visualisation of the extended x86 IA-32 (opcode) similarity patterns, which are hard to detect with the existing approaches. Our approach uses hybrid models wherein static and dynamic malware analysis techniques are combined effectively along with visualisation of similarity matrices in order to detect and classify zero-day malware efficiently. Overall, the high accuracy of classification achieved with our proposed method can be visually observed since different malware families exhibit significantly dissimilar behaviour patterns.

The amount of malware is increasing faster every year and poses a serious security threat. Thus, malware detection is a critical topic in computer security. Currently, signature-based detection is the most extended method for detecting malware. Although this method is still used on most popular commercial computer antivirus software, it can only achieve detection once the virus has already caused damage and it is registered. Therefore, it fails to detect new malware. Applying a methodology proven successful in similar problem-domains, we propose the use of ngrams (every substring of a larger string, of a fixed lenght n) as file signatures in order to detect unknown malware whilst keeping low false positive ratio. We show that n-grams signatures provide an effective way to detect unknown malware.	antivirus software;computer security;grams;malware;n-gram;sensor;substring;threat (computer);while	Igor Santos;Yoseba K.

Because of its complex nature, electronic fraud detection is typically impractical to solve without automation. However, the creation of automated systems to detect fraud is very difficult as adversaries readily adapt and change their fraudulent activities which are often lost in the magnitude of legitimate transactions. This study reviews the most popular types of electronic fraud and the existing nature-inspired detection methods that are used for them. The common characteristics of electronic fraud are examined in detail along with the difficulties and challenges that these present to computational intelligence systems. Finally, open questions and opportunities for further work, including a discussion of emerging types of electronic fraud, are presented to provide a context for ongoing research.	computation;computational intelligence	Mohammad Behdad;Luigi Barone;Mohammed Bennamoun;Tim French	2012	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)	10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2215851	artificial intelligence;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	SE	-54.925588263289804	65.46107303657597	153934

This article presents a secure and accessible multimodal authentication method to log in to an Internet banking service. The method uses a one-time-password (OTP) client installed on a mobile phone that replaces dedicated OTP generators. The client provides both visual and auditory output, and is based on an application approved for secure log-in to sensitive online services. It allows usage by people whose functional impairments adversely affect their ability to use existing solutions.

Given the unceasing efforts of attackers worldwide such trustworthiness is increasingly not a given. A variety of technical solutions, such as utilising multiple devices/channels and verification protocols, has the potential to mitigate the threat of untrusted communications to a certain extent. Yet such technical solutions make two assumptions: (1) users have access to multiple devices and (2) attackers will not resort to hacking the human, using social engineering techniques. In this paper, we propose and explore the potential of using human-based computation instead of solely technical solutions to mitigate the threat of untrusted devices and channels. ZeTA (Zero Trust Authentication on untrusted channels) has the potential to allow people to authenticate despite compromised channels or communications and easily observed usage. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose the ZeTA protocol with a formal definition and security analysis that utilises semantics and human-based computation to ameliorate the problem of untrusted devices and channels. (2) We outline a security analysis to assess the envisaged performance of the proposed authentication protocol. (3) We report on a usability study that explores the viability of relying on human computation in this context.	authentication protocol;human-based computation;microsoft word for mac;password manager;single sign-on;social engineering (security);trust (emotion);usability testing;magnussoft zeta	Andreas Gutmann;Karen Renaud;Joseph Maguire;Peter Mayer;Melanie Volkamer;Kanta Matsuura;Jörn Müller-Quade	2016	2016 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P)	10.1109/EuroSP.2016.35	communications protocol;usability;computer science;authentication protocol;authentication;semantics;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;server	Security	-52.28515949595789	69.10122092764058	154294

bcc340b1ae36376e64862b5f482638ac548f4bf2	defending against the advanced persistent threat: detection of disguised executable files		Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is one of the most serious types of cyber attacks, which is a new and more complex version of multi-step attack. Within the APT life cycle, the most common technique used to get the point of entry is spear-phishing emails which may contain disguised executable files. This paper presents the disguised executable file detection (DeFD) module, which aims at detecting disguised exe files transferred over the connections. The detection is based on a comparison between the MIME type of the transferred file and the file name extension. This module was experimentally evaluated and the results show successful detection of disguised executable files.

2477dc3e3599239319fd1651ca3e5a24ed1eb90e	on the performance evaluation of vehicular pki protocol for v2x communications security		Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (CITS) is an ongoing technology that will change our driving experience in the near future. In such systems, vehicles and Road-Side Units (RSU) cooperate by broadcasting V2X messages over the vehicular network (802.11p). Safety applications use these data to detect dangerous situations on time and avoid them. The security of V2X communications is based on the use of a vehicular Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that delivers digital certificates to vehicles and RSU. Vehicles frequently change their certificate in order to make tracking more difficult and thus preserve drivers privacy. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of our PKI regarding the reloading of certificates by comparing two communication profiles (with and without V2X security). We developed a Proofof- Concept (PoC) with real implementation of the PKI protocol and the embedded system. The obtained results show that the end-to-end latency between a requesting vehicle and the PKI is non-negligible. We then discuss and propose optimizations that can be done to improve the performance of the system.	communications security;cryptography;embedded system;end-to-end principle;interrupt latency;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;program optimization;public key certificate;public key infrastructure;testbed	Farah Haidar;Arnaud Kaiser;Brigitte Lonc	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288286	latency (engineering);computer network;public key certificate;certificate;public key infrastructure;communications security;computer science;the internet;intelligent transportation system;broadcasting	Mobile	-48.948166267630036	73.86616994145325	154680

By allowing wireless communication, real-time information exchange between vehicles as well as between infrastructure and vehicles becomes a reality. This communication allows for road condition reporting, decision making, and remote diagnostics and firmware updates over-the-air, creating a complex critical infrastructure involving vehicles, road-side equipment, and firmware issuers. Allowing external parties wireless access to the vehicle creates a potential entry-point for cyber attacks. Since the safety of the driver depends on correct vehicle operation it is of utmost importance that the in-vehicle network is sufficiently protected against attacks. If we can learn the attackers' preferences, techniques, and weaknesses in existing systems, we can use this information to design security solutions for the in-vehicle network. In this paper, we present and discuss the use of honeypots as a means of collecting such attacker information. We show how to design a vehicle honeypot, how to gather data from attackers, and discuss how to process and analyze the gathered data. Furthermore, we provide a discussion where we highlight important issues related to using honeypots in vehicles.	critical infrastructure protection;device driver;firmware;honeypot (computing);information exchange;real-time data;wireless gateway;wireless router	Vilhelm Verendel;Dennis K.

Since IMS uses Session Initiation Protocol as the main protocol to control a signal, it inherits numerous known security vulnerabilities. One of the most severe issues is the Denial of Service attack. To address this problem, we introduce an anomaly-based detection system using the Tanimoto distance to identify deviations in the traffic. A modified moving average is applied to compute an adaptive threshold. To overcome a drawback of the adaptive threshold method, we present a momentum oscillation indicator to detect a gradually increasing attack. Generally, anomaly-based detection systems trigger many alarms and most of them are false positives that impact the quality of the detection. Therefore, we first present a false positive reduction method by using a trust model. A reliable trust value is calculated through the call activities and the human behavior of each user. The system performance is evaluated by using a comprehensive synthetic dataset containing various malicious traffic patterns. The experimental results show that this system accurately identified attacks and has the flexibility to deal with many types of attack patterns with a low false alarm.	algorithm;anomaly detection;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;attack patterns;computation;ip multimedia subsystem;information processing;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;simulation;software deployment;stateless protocol;synthetic intelligence;vulnerability (computing);window function	Noppawat Chaisamran;Takeshi Okuda;Youki Kadobayashi;Suguru Yamaguchi	2014	JIP	10.2197/ipsjjip.22.118	computer science;information security;internet privacy;trustworthy computing;ip multimedia subsystem;computer security;computer network	Security	-62.1004713155694	66.10567194112343	154746

Key feature of packetized traffic exploited to that purpose are packet lengths, inter-packet times, direction of packets. This work aims at assessing the overhead and delay implied by traffic masking algorithms that conceal the information leakage exploited by statistical traffic analysis. Traffic masking is obtained by reshaping packet lengths and inter-arrival times in a masking device. It is shown that the overhead-delay trade-off of the masking device is optimized by using circuit like traffic shaping, under the constraint of removing information leakage entirely (full privacy). Numerical examples are provided with real traffic traces both for full privacy and for a relaxed heuristic masking algorithm that leaks some information on packet lengths to mitigate the overhead.	algorithm;encryption;heuristic;information leakage;network packet;noise shaping;overhead (computing);privacy;spectral leakage;tracing (software);traffic analysis;traffic shaping;unsharp masking	Alfonso Iacovazzi;Andrea Baiocchi	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2013.6649446	traffic generation model;traffic policing;information privacy;telecommunications;computer science;cryptography;traffic shaping;computer security;internet traffic engineering;statistics;computer network	EDA	-56.64263041703971	69.74831394173731	154822
cb9bfaf0f129c00fa4566476c1bf43fae08a09ee	(in)secure configuration practices of wpa2 enterprise supplicants		WPA2 Enterprise is a fundamental technology for secure communication in enterprise wireless networks. A key requirement of this technology is that WiFi-enabled devices (i.e., supplicants) be correctly configured before connecting to the enterprise wireless network. Supplicants that are not configured correctly may fall prey of attacks aimed at stealing the network credentials very easily. Such credentials have an enormous value because they usually unlock access to all enterprise services.  In this work we investigate whether users and technicians are aware of these important and widespread risks. We conducted two extensive analyses: a survey among approximately 1000 users about how they configured their WiFi devices for enterprise network access; and, a review of approximately 310 network configuration guides made available by enterprise network administrators. The results provide strong indications that the key requirement of WPA2 Enterprise is violated systematically and thus can no longer be considered realistic.	access network;credential;enterprise integration;ieee 802.11i-2004;prey;sim lock;secure communication;wi-fi protected access	Alberto Bartoli;Eric Medvet;Andrea De Lorenzo;Fabiano Tarlao	2018		10.1145/3230833.3230838	enterprise private network;wireless network;computer security;evil twin;network security;computer science;authentication;secure communication	Security	-52.135598257473575	70.81158203502167	154945

However, the way ICN caching and interest fulfillment work pose a great privacy risk; the time difference between response for interest of cached and uncached contents can be used as an indicator to infer whether or not a near-by user previously requested the same contents requested by the adversary.

However, most users access the web with only one browser. We explain the security benefits that using multiple browsers provides in terms of two concepts: entry-point restriction and state isolation. We combine these concepts into a general app isolation mechanism that can provide the same security benefits in a single browser. While not appropriate for all types of web sites, many sites with high-value user data can opt in to app isolation to gain defenses against a wide variety of browser-based attacks. We implement app isolation in the Chromium browser and verify its security properties using finite-state model checking. We also measure the performance overhead of app isolation and conduct a large-scale study to evaluate its adoption complexity for various types of sites, demonstrating how the app isolation mechanisms are suitable for protecting a number of high-value Web applications, such as online banking.	chromium (web browser);model checking;online banking;overhead (computing);value network;web application	Eric Yawei Chen;Jason Bau;Charles Reis;Adam Barth;Collin Jackson	2011		10.1145/2046707.2046734	cross-site scripting;model checking;web application security;browser security;chromium;isolation;comet;computer science;internet privacy;client-side scripting;world wide web;computer security	Security	-54.55897563166435	60.88086667695058	155352

Also, there is increasing number of attacks targeting such mobile devices. The term mobile botnet refers to group of mobile devices that are compromised and controlled by the attacker that can be used for generating distributed denial-of-service attacks. The security protocols that have been proposed for wireless and mobile networks have several weaknesses that can be exploited by the attacker to obtain unauthorized access and generate attacks. Also, there is growing number of malicious applications that are aimed to compromise smartphones and using them for generating different types of attacks. In this paper, we propose techniques to counteract distributed denial-of-service attacks on wireless mobile devices. We describe the operation and architectural components of our model. We will show that our model is able to efficiently deal with the attacks by dropping the attack traffic before it targets the victim mobile node, can prevent the attack traffic at the upstream nodes, and also deal with the attack cases that involve mobility of the attacking and victim nodes.

Unfortunately, DNSSEC is not without problems. DNSSEC adds digital signatures to the DNS, significantly increasing the size of DNS responses. This means DNSSEC is more susceptible to packet fragmentation and makes DNSSEC an attractive vector to abuse in amplification-based denial-of-service attacks. Additionally, key management policies are often complex. This makes DNSSEC fragile and leads to operational failures. In this paper, we argue that the choice for RSA as default cryptosystem in DNSSEC is a major factor in these three problems. Alternative cryptosystems, based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA and EdDSA), exist but are rarely used in DNSSEC. We show that these are highly attractive for use in DNSSEC, although they also have disadvantages. To address these, we have initiated research that aims to investigate the viability of deploying ECC at a large scale in DNSSEC.	antivirus software;cryptosystem;denial-of-service attack;digital signature;domain name system security extensions;ecc memory;elliptic curve cryptography;fork (software development);key management;network packet;strong cryptography	Roland van Rijswijk-Deij;Anna Sperotto;Aiko Pras	2015	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/2831347.2831350	elliptic curve digital signature algorithm;computer science;distributed computing;fragmentation;elliptic curve cryptography;internet privacy;computer security;denial-of-service attack;domain name system	Security	-55.38641334056235	69.85053730597753	155809
5c53bffa437f7773bf86ded51866535e7fb06cc4	an investigation of the classifiers to detect android malicious apps		Android devices are growing exponentially and are connected through the internet accessing billion of online websites. The popularity of these devices encourages malware developer to penetrate the market with malicious apps to annoy and disrupt the victim. Although, for the detection of malicious apps different approaches are discussed. However, proposed approaches are not suffice to detect the advanced malware to limit/prevent the damages. In this, very few approaches are based on opcode occurrence to classify the malicious apps. Therefore, this paper investigates the five classifiers using opcodes occurrence as the prominent features for the detection of malicious apps. For the analysis, we use WEKA tool and found that FT detection accuracy (∼79.27%) is best among the investigated classifiers. However, true positives rate i.e. malware detection rate is highest (∼99.91%) by RF and fluctuate least with the different number of prominent features compared to other studied classifiers. The analysis shows that overall accuracy is majorly affected by the false positives of the classifier.	android;malware;opcode;radio frequency;weka	Ashu Sharma;Sanjay K.

19e116ddcb944f482380210f29d341b865b9a8fc	a first look at certification authority authorization (caa)		Shaken by severe compromises, the Web’s Public Key Infrastructure has seen the addition of several security mechanisms over recent years. One such mechanism is the Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record, that gives domain name holders control over which Certification Authorities (CAs) may issue certificates for their domain. First defined in RFC 6844, adoption by the CA/B forum mandates that CAs validate CAA records as of September 8, 2017. The success of CAA hinges on the behavior of three actors: CAs, domain name holders, and DNS operators. We empirically study their behavior, and observe that CAs exhibit patchy adherence in issuance experiments, domain name holders configure CAA records in encouraging but error-prone ways, and only six of the 31 largest DNS operators enable customers to add CAA records. Furthermore, using historic CAA data, we uncover anomalies for already-issued certificates. We disseminated our results in the community. This has already led to specific improvements at several CAs and revocation of mis-issued certificates. Furthermore, in this work, we suggest ways to improve the security impact of CAA. To foster further improvements and to practice reproducible research, we share raw data and analysis tools.	certificate authority;cognitive dimensions of notations;dns certification authority authorization;experiment;public key certificate;public key infrastructure;world wide web	Quirin Scheitle;Taejoong Chung;Jens Hiller;Oliver Gasser;Johannes Naab;Roland van Rijswijk-Deij;Oliver Hohlfeld;Ralph Holz;David R.

An insecure authentication system will become a great threat for users' privacy. Beside security, usability is also very important for the design of an authentication system. Traditional password-based authentication solutions are often susceptible to various attacks due to the weak passwords chosen by incautious users. This paper illustrates a secure yet simple implementation, which uses digital signature algorithm to authenticate user identities. The proposed design brings usability and convenience to the authentication scheme by taking advantage of the increasingly widespread mobile devices. Full comparisons with existing systems in terms of their security, usability and deploy ability will also be presented in this paper.	algorithm;android;authentication;credential;digital signature;mobile device;near field communication;password strength;privacy;usability;web service	Haw Lee;Wei-Chih Hong;Chia-Hung Kao;Chen-Mou Cheng	2014	2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications	10.1109/SOCA.2014.16	password policy;chip authentication program;challenge–response authentication;computer science;authentication protocol;operating system;generic bootstrapping architecture;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;internet privacy;near field communication;world wide web;computer security;email authentication;challenge-handshake authentication protocol	Mobile	-49.78269479322965	65.8717594685335	156065

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to detect stepping-stone insider attacks through comparing outgoing and incoming connections. We modify the existing packet matching algorithm by introducing sliding window to make the algorithm more efficient and practicable. The algorithm to compute the similarity between two time-pair sequences through finding the longest common sub sequence is proposed. The stepping-stone insider attacks detection algorithm is easy to be implemented and to use since there is no threshold needed.

To counter this movement, new advanced tools and techniques are needed to detect cyberattacks in their early stages such that defensive actions may be taken to avert or mitigate potential damage. From a cybersecurity analysis perspective, detecting cyberattacks may be cast as a problem of identifying patterns in computer network traffic. Logically and intuitively, these patterns may take on the form of a directed graph that conveys how an attack or intrusion propagates through the computers of a network.  We are researching and developing graph-centric approaches and algorithms for dynamic cyberattack detection and packaging them into a streaming network analysis framework we call StreamWorks. With StreamWorks, a scientist or analyst may detect and identify precursor events and patterns as they emerge in complex networks. This analysis framework is intended to be used in a dynamic environment where network data is streamed in and is appended to a large-scale dynamic graph. Specific graphical query patterns are decomposed and collected into a graph query library. The individual decomposed subpatterns in the library are continuously and efficiently matched against the dynamic graph as it evolves to identify and detect early, partial subgraph patterns.	algorithm;complex network;computer security;directed graph;network traffic control;sensor;streaming media	George Chin;Sutanay Choudhury;John Feo;Lawrence B.

Previous research works have proposed several methods to automatically select possible countermeasures capable of ending the detected attack, but without taking into account their side effects. In fact, countermeasures can be as harmful as the detected attack. Moreover, sometimes selected countermeasures are not adapted to the attackerpsilas actions and/or knowledge. In this paper, we propose to turn the reaction selection process intelligent by giving means to (i) quantify the effectiveness and select the countermeasure that has the minimum negative side effect on the information system by adopting a risk assessment and analysis approach, and (ii) assess the skill and knowledge level of the attacker from a defensive point of view.	countermeasure (computer);information system;intrusion detection system;knowledge level;point of view (computer hardware company);risk assessment;side effect (computer science)	Wael Kanoun;Nora Cuppens-Boulahia;Frédéric Cuppens;Jose Denes Lima Araujo	2008	2008 Third International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems	10.1109/CRISIS.2008.4757471	intrusion detection system;simulation;risk management;computer science;engineering;information security;data mining;computer security	Security	-62.846755026999425	61.85570230244075	156520

Steganographic communication is one such avenue. Hiding secret messages in digital data such as images using steganographic software tools is becoming easier. These digital images posted in public Web sites can then be downloaded at the receiver and the hidden messages may be extracted securely. To thwart covert channels on the Internet new types of search engines that can identify, detect and track these channels are necessary. Traditional search algorithms will fail to identify these channels. In this paper, we discuss various key issues involved in developing a stego (forensic) Web search engine. We also propose approaches to address some of these issues. Finally, we discuss a prototype forensic search engine that we developed called STEALTH and discuss in detail its architecture.

It is considered as a major deficiency while handling heterogeneous and non-stationary data stream to uncover anomaly in the online operational mode. This paper proposes a novel online method that constructs connections from the massive data flow for evaluating IDS models. The proposed method overcomes this challenge by using a queuing concept of dynamic window size. It captures network traffic and hosts events constantly and handles them synchronously within time slot windows inside the queue in order to construct connection vectors based on certain features. We have evaluated the method in offline mode using DARPA dump data flow and in online mode using a simulated network at the university campus. In addition, we have evaluated our IDS model using the constructed connections to proof the feasibility and plausibility of the proposed method in IDS area. The performance evaluation confirms that, the proposed method is able to operate in offline as well online modes efficiently. Moreover, constructed connections are very adequate for training and evaluating IDS models.	airplane mode;angular defect;anomaly detection;dataflow;intrusion detection system;microsoft windows;network security;network traffic control;online and offline;performance evaluation;plausibility structure;stationary process	Maher Salem;Ulrich Bühler	2013	8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2013)	10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750267	real-time computing;engineering;world wide web;computer security	SE	-61.79045228828565	66.38445441094166	157274

The latter applications involve contactless technology (e.g., NFC) that is known to be vulnerable to mafia fraud attacks. In this work we show that a secret message inside an appropriately folded piece of paper (fortune cookie) can be used to effectively mitigate the mafia fraud attack. Fortune cookies implement a weakly unrelayable channel that, in combination with smartphones, provides a provable protection against those attacks.

DHTs, due to their fully distributed nature, are known to be vulnerable to certain kinds of attacks and different kinds of defenses have been proposed against these attacks. In this paper, we consider two kinds of attacks on a DHT, one already known attack and one new kind of an attack, and show how they can be targeted against Mainline DHT. We complement them by an extensive measurement study using honeypots which shows that both attacks have been going on for a long time in the network and are still happening. We present numbers showing that the number of sybils in the Mainline DHT network is increasing and is currently around 300,000. We analyze the potential threats from these attacks and propose simple countermeasures against them.	bittorrent;countermeasure (computer);distributed hash table;honeypot (computing);sybil attack	Liang Wang;Jussi Kangasharju	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503215	bittorrent;bittorrent protocol encryption;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-58.65534250405012	65.97122360309751	157801

Unlike Card Space that relies on a fat desktop client (the identity selector) in which the user can only select a single card per session, our model uses a standard web browser with a simple plugin that connects to a trusted attribute aggregation web service (TAAS). TAAS supports the aggregation of attributes from multiple identity providers (IdPs) and allows the user to select multiple single attribute """"cards"""" in a session, which more accurately reflects real life in which users may present several plastic cards and self-asserted attributes in a single session. Privacy protection, user consent, and ease of use are critical success factors. Consequently TAAS does not know who the user is, the user consents by selecting the attributes she wants to release, and she only needs to authenticate to a single IdP even though attributes may be aggregated from multiple IdPs. The system does not limit the authentication mechanisms that can be used, and it protects the user from phishing attacks by malicious SPs."""	authentication;desktop computer;federated identity;identity management system;identity provider;information card;internet privacy;malware;microsoft windows;phishing;real life;usability;web service;windows cardspace	David W.

8cc2eb9fb1ed55360f23e5fc4d435033581a96b7	a new mechanism for mutual authentication in sip		The greatest threat in the new generation network which is called NGN is unsafe authentication. Communication between new servers in NGN world is done based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). SIP is an application-layer control operating on top of a transport protocol which allows creating, modifying, and terminating sessions among more agents. For authentication, SIP relies on HTTP Digest by default; the client is authenticated to the SIP proxy server, called one way authentication, because in this approach we can authenticate client to server and the client can’t do any authentication in server side. In this paper we propose a mutual authentication mechanism that is not based on HTTP Digest and then, we implement our method in IMS and start to do authentication client to server is done in first step and server to client next. By this solution, we found that our proposed mechanism has more stability against intruder and unauthorized access to system. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for user authentication or server authentication by using OPTIONAL SIP’s header. In our solution we can increase necessary steps for intruder to decode authentication, compilation time and encoding time and save our system from some attack such as offline attack and replay	authorization;compiler;digest access authentication;hypertext transfer protocol;mutual authentication;network security;newman's lemma;next-generation network;online and offline;password cracking;proxy server;server (computing);server-side;throughput	Maisam Mohammadian	2012	CoRR		data authentication algorithm;ntlmssp;chip authentication program;challenge–response authentication;computer science;authentication protocol;internet authentication service;generic bootstrapping architecture;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;email authentication;challenge-handshake authentication protocol	Security	-48.3400728292059	70.31150993132835	158156

If the web is to reach its maximum utility, this Prisoner's Dilemma of the Web must be resolved.

Secondly, we concentrated on web applications, which are the main interface to modern computing: Because of their immense popularity, they have indeed become the most targeted entry point of intrusions. Last, we developed novel techniques with the aim of identifying related events (e.g., alerts reported by intrusion detection systems) to build new and more compact knowledge to detect malicious activity on large-scale systems. During our research we enhanced existing anomaly detection tools and also contributed with new ones.

Root polar coordinates overcome two important problems of normal polar coordinates: plot density distortion and severe occlusion near the origin. We discuss several approaches we took while investigating this problem and provide empirical data from experiments we conducted comparing root polar coordinates against both normal polar and Cartesian coordinates. In any application where a polar plot would be useful but distortion of the data must be avoided, or where it is important to avoid some markers from being occluded by others, root polar coordinates may be useful. Our approach provides: (1) a novel adaptation of polar coordinates that overcomes plotting distortion; (2) a means of plotting network data in near real-time without complex layout optimization; (3) an algorithm that reduces occlusion of plotted points while maintaining consistent placement; and (4) an empirical comparison of Cartesian vs. polar plots.	algorithm;cartesian closed category;computer security;distortion;experiment;mathematical optimization;pixel;real-time clock;real-time computing	Glenn A.

The security structure model consists of application layer, business layer, data layer and security control layer. The security control layer is mainly used to provide safety services, such as integrity and secrecy of data, undeniable service, two-way certification, algorithm of digital signature and security key distribution etc. The paper also defines functions for each layer and describes authentication, encryption, decryption and transmitting data flow for the new structure.

Wireless sensor networks have facilitated our life using the remote sensing ability. However, these systems could be taken advantage by the malicious parties to mislead users since they are often not physically secured and are used in hostile environments. We have proposed theoretical and statistical framework for creating data integrity attacks and corresponding security defenses. The data integrity attack is defined as a type of attack that targets to mislead the system by altering some collected data of the system in such a way that to achieve the goal of attackers. We use the Intel lab sensor data and demonstrate that it is easy to attack only a few essential sensors values to change the behavior of system, such as the control of air conditioner. To be more specific, by changing the temperature and humidity data measured by a group of sensors, the attacker can control the air conditioner turning on and off without being detected by correlation check. On the top of data integrity attacks, we have further developed low overhead defense schemes.	data integrity;home automation;ibm notes;malware;overhead (computing);robotics;sensor	Renchi Yan;Teng Xu;Miodrag Potkonjak	2015	2015 IEEE 2nd World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)	10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389143	embedded system;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Security	-52.16405366863062	73.75549229247684	159064

(gi), 19.-21. märz 2014, wien, österreich		Smartphones have become the standard personal device to store private or sensitive information. Widely used as every day gadget, however, they are susceptible to get lost or stolen. To protect information on a smartphone from being physically accessed by attackers, a lot of authentication methods have been proposed in recent years. Each one of them suffers from certain drawbacks, either they are easy to circumvent, vulnerable against shoulder surfing attacks, or cumbersome to use. In this paper, we present an alternative approach for user authentication that is based on the smartphone’s sensors. By making use of the user’s biometrical behavior while entering text into the smartphone, we transparently authenticate the user in an ongoing-fashion. In a field study, we asked more than 300 participants to enter some short sentences into a smartphone while all available sensor events were recorded to determine a typing motion fingerprint of the user. After the proper feature extraction, a machine learning classifier based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to identify the authorized user. The results of our study are twofold: While our approach is able to continuously authenticate some users with high precision, there also exist participants for which no accurate motion fingerprint can be learned. We analyze these difference in detail and provide guidelines for similar problems.	authentication;authorization;feature extraction;field research;fingerprint;gesellschaft für informatik;information sensitivity;machine learning;sensor;smartphone;support vector machine	Stefan Katzenbeisser;Volkmar Lotz;Edgar R.

da352a57d447e16e2b0be386292677f61ab52170	a new approach for ddos attacks to discriminate the attack level and provide security for ddos nodes in manet		Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) enable versatile hosts to frame a correspondence arrange without a prefixed framework. In military applications portable specially appointed system assumes essential part since it is particularly planned network for on request necessity and in circumstances where set up of physical network isn't conceivable. Despite the fact that it gives high adaptability, it likewise conveys more difficulties for MANETs to battle against malicious assaults. In any case, the property of mobility and excess additionally motivates new plans to outline safeguard procedure. In this paper, we propose a procedure to relieve DDoS assaults in MANETs. Expect that a malicious attacker ordinarily targets particular victims. The attacker will surrender if the assault neglected to accomplish the coveted objectives after a specific length of assaulting time. In our assurance system, we exploit high excess and select a protection node. Once a DDoS attack has been identified, the suspicious movement will be diverted to the protection node. The victim will work typically, and it is sensible to expect that the attacker will stop the trivial endeavors.

In this framework, we propose a new look-up-table-based secure client-side embedding scheme properly designed for the spread transform dither modulation watermarking method. A theoretical analysis of the detector performance under the most known attack models is presented and the agreement between theoretical and experimental results verified through several simulations. The experimental results also prove that the advantages of the informed embedding technique in comparison to the spread-spectrum watermarking approach, which are well known in the classical embedding schemes, are preserved in the client-side scenario. The proposed approach permits us to successfully combine the security of client-side embedding with the robustness of informed embedding methods.	client-side;digital distribution;dither;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;lookup table;modulation;simulation	Alessandro Piva;Tiziano Bianchi;Alessia De Rosa	2010	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2009.2038761	fingerprint;detector;lookup table;digital watermarking;computer science;theoretical computer science;service-oriented architecture;internet privacy;spread spectrum;world wide web;bandwidth;web server	Security	-48.616262498650876	69.42701259729476	159553
1d80de948ddcf8f3524763ed3d5f4485f46d70fb	the good, the bad, and the differences: better network diagnostics with differential provenance	debugging;network diagnostics;provenance	In this paper, we propose a new approach to diagnosing problems in complex distributed systems. Our approach is based on the insight that many of the trickiest problems are anomalies. For instance, in a network, problems often affect only a small fraction of the traffic (e.g., perhaps a certain subnet), or they only manifest infrequently. Thus, it is quite common for the operator to have “examples” of both working and non-working traffic readily available – perhaps a packet that was misrouted, and a similar packet that was routed correctly. In this case, the cause of the problem is likely to be wherever the two packets were treated differently by the network.  We present the design of a debugger that can leverage this information using a novel concept that we call differential provenance. Differential provenance tracks the causal connections between network states and state changes, just like classical provenance, but it can additionally perform root-cause analysis by reasoning about the differences between two provenance trees. We have built a diagnostic tool that is based on differential provenance, and we have used our tool to debug a number of complex, realistic problems in two scenarios: software-defined networks and MapReduce jobs. Our results show that differential provenance can be maintained at relatively low cost, and that it can deliver very precise diagnostic information; in many cases, it can even identify the precise root cause of the problem.	causal filter;debugger;distributed computing;mapreduce;network packet;routing;subnetwork	Ang Chen;Yang Wu;Andreas Haeberlen;Wenchao Zhou;Boon Thau Loo	2016		10.1145/2934872.2934910	real-time computing;computer science;operating system;data mining;distributed computing;debugging;computer security	Networks	-61.43326447642172	65.84238067078984	159783

This content is primarily presented in the form of emails, social media posts, and phishing websites. User training initiatives seek to minimize the impact of malicious content through improved vigilance. Training works best when tailored to specific user deficiencies. However, tailoring training requires understanding how malicious content victimizes users. In this paper, we link a set of malicious content design factors, in the form of degradations and sophistications, to their potential to form a victimization prediction metric. The design factors examined are developed from an analysis of over 100 pieces of content from email, social media and websites. We conducted an experiment using a sample of the content and a game-based simulation platform to evaluate the efficacy of our victimization prediction metric. The experimental results and their analysis are presented as part of the evaluation.	email;malware;phishing;simulation;social media	Matthew L. Hale;Rose F.

To come ahead of this threat, we propose an economic measure to deter attacks and various service abuses in cloud computing applications. Our proposed defense is based on requiring a service user to pay a small deposit, using digital currency, before invoking the service. Once they are done using the service, and there has been no detected abuse or attack, the deposit is paid back by the service provider to the service user. If an attack or an abuse is detected, the service user is not paid back and the service provider gets to keep the deposit. We propose the use of micro payments with a decentralized nature and small transaction fees, such as the Bit coin digital currency. Moreover, thanks to the existence of money exchanges which convert the Bit coin currency to real world currency, service providers can recoup loses when they exchange the confiscated deposits for real world currency.	bitcoin;cloud computing;dependability;digital currency;money;pseudonymity	Jakub Szefer;Ruby B.

With the phenomenal growth of smartphone use, smartphone theft is also increasing. This paper proposes a model to secure smartphones from theft as well as provides options to access a smartphone through other smartphone or a normal mobile via Short Message Service. This model provides option to track and secure the mobile by locking it. It also provides facilities to receive the incoming call and sms information to the remotely connected device and enables the remote user to control the mobile through SMS.

cd3db77d7e58ab181acf7e1a7a432e72be3cc3ee	efficient authorization authority certificate distribution in vanets		Car-to-X communication systems are about to enter the mass market in upcoming years. Security in these networks depends on digital signatures managed by a multi-level certificate hierarchy. Thereby, certificate distribution is critical in regard to channel utilization and data reception delay via security caused packet loss. These issues are even more significant in case not only pseudonym certificates but also authorization authority certificates have to be exchanged between nodes in the VANET. Prior work has not studied distribution of the elements of a multi-level certificate chain in detail. Hence, this work provides an analysis of the currently standardized mechanisms and identifies several drawbacks of the straight forward solution proposed so far. Thereby, we find a severe denial of service attack on that solution. Moreover, the distribution problem is found to be similar to the packet forwarding problem encountered in position-based routing. Thus, we study several strategies for efficient distribution of a certificate chain in regard to channel load, which are adapted from their counterparts in position-based routing. Thereby, we find that by combining pseudonym certificate buffering with requester based responder selection the requirement for certificate chain distribution in VANETs can be removed completely. Hence, the proposed design avoids the identified denial of service weakness and reduces the worst case size of the security envelope of VANET messages by more than a third.	advanced audio coding;antivirus software;authorization;best, worst and average case;certificate authority;dos;denial-of-service attack;digital signature;geographic routing;greedy algorithm;network packet;overhead (computing);public key certificate;root certificate;throughput;trusted system;velocity (software development)	Sebastian Bittl;Karsten Roscher	2016		10.5220/0005685600850096	authorization certificate;public key certificate;internet privacy;root certificate;computer security	Security	-57.4350150604479	70.86180937175449	160258

Our hypothesis is that when viewed collectively, malicious activities originating from a network are indicative of the general cleanness of a network and how well it is run, and that furthermore, collectively they exhibit fairly stable and thus predictive behavior over time. To test this hypothesis, we utilize two datasets in this study: (1) a collection of commonly used IP address-based/host reputation blacklists (RBLs) collected over more than a year, and (2) a set of security incident reports collected over roughly the same period. Specifically, we first aggregate the RBL data at a prefix level and then introduce a set of features that capture the dynamics of this aggregated temporal process. A comparison between the distribution of these feature values taken from the incident dataset and from the general population of prefixes shows distinct differences, suggesting their value in distinguishing between the two while also highlighting the importance of capturing dynamic behavior (second order statistics) in the malicious activities. These features are then used to train a support vector machine (SVM) for prediction. Our preliminary results show that we can achieve reasonably good prediction performance over a forecasting window of a few months.	aggregate data;computer security;dnsbl;entity;machine learning;malware;phishing;reputation;spamming;support vector machine;window function;x image extension	Yang Liu;Jing Zhang;Armin Sarabi;Mingyan Liu;Manish Karir;Michael Bailey	2015		10.1145/2713579.2713582	prediction;computer science;network security;time series;data mining;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-60.56650452122529	64.63100654505524	160279

A handheld reader is used together with the customer’s debit card to generate one-time codes for both login and transaction authentication. The CAP protocol is not public, and was rolled out without any public scrutiny. We reverse engineered the UK variant of card readers and smart cards and here provide the first public description of the protocol. We found numerous weaknesses that are due to design errors such as reusing authentication tokens, overloading data semantics, and failing to ensure freshness of responses. The overall strategic error was excessive optimisation. There are also policy implications. The move from signature to PIN for authorising point-of-sale transactions shifted liability from banks to customers; CAP introduces the same problem for online banking. It may also expose customers to physical harm.	code;debit card;failure;function overloading;handheld game console;login;mathematical optimization;online banking;point of sale;punched card input/output;replay attack;reverse engineering;semantic data model;smart card;transaction authentication	Saar Drimer;Steven J.

0b1ba795583e80e18c9dface4bc5e24626e3dead	a light-weight hardware/software co-design for pairing-based cryptography with low power and energy consumption		Embedded electronic devices and sensors such as smartphones, smart watches, medical implants, and Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN) are making the “Internet of Things” (IoT) a reality. Such devices often require cryptographic services such as authentication, integrity and non-repudiation, which are provided by Public-Key Cryptography (PKC). As these devices are severely resource-constrained, choosing a suitable cryptographic system is challenging. Pairing Based Cryptography (PBC) is among the best candidates to implement PKC in lightweight devices. In this research, we present a fast and energy efficient implementation of PBC based on Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curves and optimal Ate pairing using hardware/software co-design. Our solution consists of a hardware-based Montgomery multiplier, and pairing software running on an ARM Cortex A9 processor in a Zynq-7020 System-on-Chip (SoC). The multiplier is protected against simple power analysis (SPA) and differential power analysis (DPA), and can be instantiated with a variable number of processing elements (PE). Our solution improves performance (in terms of latency) over an open-source software PBC implementation by factors of 2.34 and 2.02, for 256- and 160-bit field sizes, respectively, as measured in the Zynq-7020 SoC.	128-bit;arm cortex-a9;arm architecture;authentication;computation;cryptosystem;embedded system;emoticon;field-programmable gate array;hardware acceleration;internet of things;lagrange multiplier;mpsoc;microprocessor;montgomery modular multiplication;non-repudiation;open-source software;pkc (conference);pairing-based cryptography;periodic boundary conditions;public-key cryptography;scalability;sensor;smartphone;smartwatch;system on a chip	Ahmad Salman;William Diehl;Jens-Peter Kaps	2017	2017 International Conference on Field Programmable Technology (ICFPT)	10.1109/FPT.2017.8280149	field-programmable gate array;real-time computing;power analysis;latency (engineering);computer science;computer hardware;cryptography;software;arm architecture;pairing;pairing-based cryptography	EDA	-50.504576075620015	74.03281634894843	160444

In this paper, we present an intrusion detection system (IDS) for detecting the anomaly behaviors in Android mobile devices. The IDS continuously monitors the network traffic of the mobile device and collects various features of the NetFlows.

In each case, there is significant evidence that there is an increasing financial motivation behind the writing and distribution of these programs. In this paper, the concept of using our knowledge of these financial motivators to combat malicious software is introduced. Can attacks on business models actually provide relief that technology alone cannot? Can we deploy our technology differently, in order to receive direct benefits of this indirect attack on revenue streams? Our conclusion is that not only is this a possible solution, but that it may be an extremely effective one. This is illustrated by a description of our business model attack generator, MARK - the Multihost Adware Revenue Killer. Using MARK, we demonstrate simple but effective attacks against Malicious-code generated revenue streams. However, the creation and deployment of MARK raises thorny legal and ethical questions, as the impact of the technology is widespread and could easily be targeted at legitimate online marketing models.

This same method of obfuscation can be used by legitimate users to transmit messages over hostile networks. A promising area for covert channels is wireless networks employing carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) (e.g., 802.11 networks). These schemes introduce randomness in the network that provides good cover for a covert timing channel. Hence, by exploiting the random back-off in distributed coordination function (DCF) of 802.11, we realize a relatively high bandwidth covert timing channel for 802.11 networks, called Covert-DCF. As opposed to many works in the literature focusing on theory and simulations, Covert-DCF is the first fully implemented covert timing channel for 802.11 MAC using off-the-self wireless cards. In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of Covert-DCF that is transparent to the users of the shared medium. We also evaluate the performance of Covert-DCF and provide discussions on the feasibility of this technique in a real world scenario.	bit error rate;channel (communications);chipset;code;covert channel;design rule for camera file system;ecc memory;emoticon;error detection and correction;laptop;obfuscation (software);password;personal identification number;randomness;simulation;throughput;timing channel;uncompressed video;x.690	Sakthi Vignesh Radhakrishnan;A.

By contrast, the Internet offers a much more ambiguous environment; hence many users are unable to distinguish a scam from a legitimate Web page. To help address this problem, we explore how to train classifiers that can automatically identify malicious Web pages based on clues from their textual content, structural tags, page links, visual appearance, and URLs. Using a contemporary labeled data feed from a large Web mail provider, we extract such features and demonstrate how they can be used to improve classification accuracy over previous, more constrained approaches. In particular, by analyzing the full content of individual Web pages, we more than halve the error rate obtained by a comparably trained classifier that only extracts features from URLs. By training classifiers on different sets of features, we are further able to assess the strength of clues provided by these different sources of information.	data feed;internet;rife;statistical classification;web page	Sushma Nagesh Bannur;Lawrence K.

The system of the present invention generates a default control module for a first device coupled to the network by using a second device coupled to the network. The the default control module is configured to ensure at least a minimum degree of interoperability between the first device and the second device. The second device access the first device via the default control module, wherein the default control module enables the first device to respond to a default set of commands from the second device. When an updated control module for the first device is received, the default control module is replaced with the updated control module by unlinking the default control module and linking the updated control module using a registry. The updated control module can be received from a wide variety of sources (e.g., the internet, satellite broadcast, cable TV provider, disk from the manufacture, etc.). The second device subsequently accesses the first device via the updated control module, wherein the updated control module enables the first device to respond to an updated set of commands from the second device.	authentication	Manuel Graña	2009			pseudorandom binary sequence;the internet;computer hardware;interoperability;digital watermarking;pseudorandom number generator;orthogonality;authentication;broadcasting;computer science	Crypto	-50.0456020041773	68.82724392362772	161040
356091aa89dd61f3a3e9cf33ec616ae7020f9bab	attacking and improving received signal strength ratio for secure localization and proximity-based authentication		The cheap versatility of modern embedded systems is being harnessed to attack sprawling tasks with teams of cooperating machines - infrastructure monitoring, automated patient health monitoring, and the management of cyber-physical systems are some prime examples. Parallel advances in networking technology, particularly MIMO signal processing capabilities,facilitate wireless tracking and localization for coordination of physical activities among independent nodes. As these technologies enter wider markets, they inevitably become targets of malicious adversaries, and the ability to detect and mitigate attacks becomes necessary. In many applications, the ability to securely determine the location or proximity of one entity relative to another is important for maintaining system security. This work concentrates on a specific and relatively new RF-based localization scheme called Received Signal Strength Ratio (RSSR). Derived from a more primitive signal-strength-based localization technique, RSSR takes the ratio of signal strength measurements at 2 (or more) receivers to determine the distance of a transmitter from the device. This construct has attracted interest for its potential utility in securing ad-hoc networks and body-area networks. However, researchers proposing RSSR as the backbone of proximity-based authentication systems have not thoroughly considered certain realistic attacker capabilities. In this work, we present a threat model that characterizes the security of an RSSR-based proximity authentication system in more detail than previous research; describe a generic attack on the security of such systems; and discuss a set of mitigation strategies that ultimately restore the effectiveness of RSSR as a secure distance and proximity verification scheme.	authentication	Joshua Marxen	2016			mimo;prime (order theory);wireless;signal processing;transmitter;threat model;electromagnetics;authentication;engineering;distributed computing	Crypto	-52.22433922661539	73.65767921361295	161046

The particular features of the proposed protocol lie at: (1) negotiation for agent-based trading is performed through a novel pattern of electronic auction. (2) negotiation results between two hosts are ensured to be valid with their signatures. (3) malicious actions can be detected and the breeder can be dug out by the help of sociological factors. (4) information gathering and negotiation process are combined together while few communications are needed.	agent-based model;antivirus software;auction algorithm;communications protocol;malware;online shopping;test data	Xun Yi;Xiao Feng Wang;Kwok-Yan Lam;Eiji Okamoto;D.

Since the inception of elections and election technologies, all segments of the voting population have never been granted equal access, privacy and security when voting. Voting technology today has not addressed the issues that disabled voters are confronted with at the polls. Because approximately 17% of the voting population is disabled, their issues should be handled with a solution geared towards their needs. Disabled voters need to be able to cast their vote without the assistance of others. The Prime III multimodal voting system addresses these issues. The video illustrates the use of the Prime III system and how it allows disabled voters to use the same system as those without disabilities.	multimodal interaction;privacy	Juan E. Gilbert;Joshua I.

9d27a99b900e42714394c7d93054a7fbd12137b9	automatic backdoor analysis with network intrusion detection system and integrated service checker	alarm filtering;automation;intrusion detection	In this paper we examine how a network intrusion detection system can be used as a trigger for service checking and reporting. This approach reduces the amount of false alerts (false positives) and raises the quality of the alert report. A sample data over the Christmas period of year 2002 is analyzed as an example and detection of unauthorized SSH servers used as the main application. Unauthorized interactive backdoors to a network belong to the most dangerous class of intrusions (1). These backdoors are usually installed by root-kits, to hide the system compromise activity. They are a gateway to launch exploits, gain super-user access to hosts in the internal network and to use the attacked network as a stepping stone to attack other networks. In this research we have developed software and done statistical analysis to assess and prevent such situations.	backdoor (computing);intrusion detection system	Jukka Juslin;Teemupekka Virtanen	2003			computer security;backdoor;integrated services;intrusion detection system;computer science	Security	-59.316749267131165	65.1195108750811	161367
634730948e5f454613e14659cd35bef9ec1fabf7	on the attack-and-fault tolerance of intrusion detection systems in wireless mesh networks		Intrusion detection in Wireless Mesh Networks WMN has recently emerged as an important research area. The diversity in WMN hardware and applications has generated extremely diverse network types, with diverse resource levels and system and threat models. Consequently, a variety of intrusion detection systems IDS have been proposed by the research community, each applicable to a specific type of WMN. Although the design and implementation of specific intrusion detection mechanisms have received considerable attention, little effort has been dedicated to the attack-and-fault tolerance of IDS themselves. In this paper we propose a taxonomy that categorizes state-of-the-art IDS solutions in WMN and we investigate the attack-and-fault tolerance of IDS in this taxonomy. We first survey a series of administrative mechanisms for attack-and-fault tolerant AFT IDS design. Then we propose modified designs for state-of-the-art IDS solutions that are AFT. Finally, through extensive simulations, we evaluate and compare AFT designed IDS with their original designs, with respect to the IDS performance and costs.

This paper presents attacks on such projects—taking Firefox as a case-study—that exploit patch metadata to efficiently search for security patches prior to shipping. Using access-restricted bug reports linked from patch descriptions, security patches can be immediately identified for 260 out of 300 days of Firefox 3 development. In response to Mozilla obfuscating descriptions, we show that machine learning can exploit metadata such as patch author to search for security patches, extending the total window of vulnerability by 5 months in an 8 month period when examining up to two patches daily. Finally we present strong evidence that further metadata obfuscation is unlikely to prevent information leaks, and we argue that open-source projects instead ought to keep security patches secret until they are ready to be released.

80952b9262a74c3e62b07d7f8641969e14a7c9f1	dmips - defensive mechanism against ip spoofing	anonymity;network security;ip spoofing;hop count	The usage of internet has increased in all fields of the globe and its size is increasing at a high rate. The network providers are not able to afford enough resources like computation power and bandwidth which are needed to maintain their quality of service. This inability is exploited by the attackers in the form of Denial of Service attacks (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS). The systems trying to mitigate DoS attacks should focus on the technique called IP spoofing. IP Spoofing refers to the creation of IP packets with forged source address. IP spoofing aids the DoS attackers in maintaining their anonymity. IP spoofing is beneficial when the systems use source address for authentication of the packets. Previously, an anti-spoofing method called HCF (Hop Count Filtering) was proposed which could effectively filter the spoofed packets. The HCF works on the basis that the attacker cannot falsify the Hop count (HC), the number of hops an IP packet takes to reach the destination. This HC value can be inferred from the TTL (Time To Live) field in the IP packet. However, the working of HCF has the following problems: 1) Multiple path possibility is ignored. 2) The method of building the HC tables must be more secure. 3) Lack of good renew procedure which can detect network changes. In this paper, we propose a 2 level filtering scheme called DMIPS, based on HCF. DMIPS is secure, resolves the multiple path problem and can filter the spoofed packets effectively. The present scheme can detect the changes in the network and can update the HC values. DMIPS improve the quality of service of the network by minimizing the number of false positives. The network under discussion is of the type server and clients and the server is the point of attack.	authentication;autonomous system (internet);collegehumor;computation;denial-of-service attack;dhrystone;halt and catch fire;hop;ip address spoofing;internet;network architecture;network congestion;network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);quality of service;retransmission (data networks);server (computing);software deployment;spoofing attack;time to live	Shashank Lagishetty;Pruthvi Reddy Sabbu;K.

In this paper we present a novel efficient algorithm that learns to detect such kind of spam. We have used a bipartite graph with two types of nodes, each representing a layer in the graph: web-sites and file hostings (FH), connected with edges representing the fact that a file can be downloaded from the hosting via a link on the web-site. The performance of this spam detection method was verified using two set of ground truth labels: manual assessments of antivirus analysts and automatically generated assessments obtained from antivirus companies. We demonstrate that the proposed method is able to detect new types of malware even before the best known antivirus solutions are able to detect them.	algorithm;anti-spam techniques;antivirus software;ground truth;malware;spamming	Andrei Venzhega;Polina Zhinalieva;Nikolay Suboch	2013		10.1145/2487788.2488136	computer science;cryptovirology;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-58.99249831323662	62.27297014911985	161588

Such attacks severely affect the trust relationships a victim has built with other users if no active protection is applied. In this paper, we first analyze and characterize the behaviors of ICAs. Then we propose a detection framework that is focused on discovering suspicious identities and then validating them. Towards detecting suspicious identities, we propose two approaches based on attribute similarity and similarity of friend networks. The first approach addresses a simpler scenario where mutual friends in friend networks are considered; and the second one captures the scenario where similar friend identities are involved. We also present experimental results to demonstrate flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Finally, we discuss some feasible solutions to validate suspicious identities.	authentication;experiment;malware;personally identifiable information;sensor;social network	Lei Jin;Hassan Takabi;James B.

The mobile phone was used to replace the traditional physical authentication devices. Not only does it reduce the cost of manufacturers, but also is easier for users to use. The system is transparent to the people that they do not need to learn new knowledge before using the authentication system. Besides, compared to the traditional two-factor authentication, the system has reached the same security. Our system can resist the man-in-the-middle attacks, phishing attacks, replay attacks and others effectively. The system that we present is reliable and easy to manage, moreover, it has the good portability and the advantages above have important significance to the improvement of the identity authentication.	multi-factor authentication;password;smartphone	Lin Hou;Laiwen Wei;Chen Wang;Andi Wang;Jian Xu	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-00018-9_63	computer science;password;computer security;web server;cryptography;mobile phone;phishing;bluetooth;software portability;authentication;distributed computing	Security	-49.657589024505995	66.06490046308198	162139

The attacker sends an attack vector commonly in the form of an email, chat session, blog post etc., which contains a link (URL) to a malicious website hosted to elicit private information from the victims. We focus on building a system for URL analysis and classification to primarily detect phishing attacks. URL analysis is attractive to maintain distance between the attacker and the victim, rather than visiting the website and getting features from it. It is also faster than Internet search, retrieving content from the destination website and network-level features used in previous research.  We investigate several facets of URL analysis, e.g., performance analysis on both balanced and unbalanced datasets in a static as well as live experimental setup and online versus batch learning.	blog;chat room;digital identity;email;feature extraction;personally identifiable information;phishing;social engineering (security);unbalanced circuit;vector (malware)	Rakesh M.

However, characteristics of social graphs could be utilized by attackers to re-identify target entities of social networks. In this paper, we first analyze a new attack model named bin-based attack, which re-identifies social individuals in social networks, according to their graph structure characteristics. For bin-based attack, we propose a novel k-anonymity scheme. With this scheme, social individuals are completely k-anonymity protection. Experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The utility of anonymized networks are demonstrated with the results of vertex degree, and betweenness.	attack model;betweenness;degree (graph theory);degree distribution;entity;personally identifiable information;requirement;scheme;social graph	Jianliang Gao;Qing Ping;Jianxing Wang	2017	World Wide Web	10.1007/s11280-017-0524-3	bin;degree (graph theory);k-anonymity;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;social network;social graph;personally identifiable information;attack model;betweenness centrality	Web+IR	-58.35910533322501	62.98405973656021	162242

In our system, a property owner will have a wireless module node (called secondary module) attached to the property that s/he wants to protect. The secondary wireless module node will not store any personal information about the owner, nor any specific information about the property to be protected. Each user of the system will also have a unique wireless module node (called primary module) that contains some security information about the user, thus should be privately held by the user and be kept to the user always. Once a tracking process is triggered in privacy preserving manner, the secondary module will start sending out the alarm signal periodically. The alarm signal will be captured by some surveillance wireless module, integrated with existing surveillance cameras. Using the trajectory information provided by the secondary wireless module node, and the videos captured by the surveillance cameras, our system will then automatically pinpoint a burglar (e.g., a person or a car) that is more likely to carry the stolen property. Our extensive evaluation of the system shows that we can find the burglars with surprisingly high accuracy under various experiment settings, with significantly reduced storage-requirement of the legacy video surveillance system. It also can help the police to catch the burglars more efficiently by providing critical images or videos containing the burglars.	closed-circuit television;personally identifiable information;privacy	Shaojie Tang;Xiang-Yang Li;Haitao Zhang;Jiankang Han;Guojun Dai;Cheng Wang;Xingfa Shen	2011	2011 IEEE 32nd Real-Time Systems Symposium	10.1109/RTSS.2011.37	embedded system;wireless sensor network;information privacy;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;computer security	Embedded	-52.35996301453431	67.391571516234	162417

Individuals who seek to establish the credibility of network forensic data must speak competently about how the data was gathered and the potential for data loss. Unfortunately, manufacturers rarely provide information about the performance of low-layer network devices at a level that will survive legal challenges. This paper proposes a first step toward an independent calibration standard by establishing a validation testing methodology for evaluating forensic taps against manufacturer specifications. The methodology and the theoretical analysis that led to its development are offered as a conceptual framework for developing a standard and to “operationalize” network forensic readiness.

Our specific focus is on pulsating attacks, a particularly debilitating type that has been hypothesized in the literature. In a pulsating attack, bots coordinate to generate intermittent pulses at target links to significantly reduce the throughput of TCP connections traversing the target. With pulsating attacks, attackers can cause significantly greater damage to legitimate users than traditional link flooding attacks. To date, however, pulsating attacks have been either deemed ineffective or easily defendable for two reasons: (1) they require a central coordinator and can thus be tracked; and (2) they require tight synchronization of pulses, which is difficult even in normal non-congestion scenarios. This paper argues that, in fact, the perceived drawbacks of pulsating attacks are in fact not fundamental. We develop a practical pulsating attack called CICADAS using two key ideas: using both (1) congestion as an implicit signal for decentralized implementation, and (2) a Kalman-filter-based approach to achieve tight synchronization. We validate CICADAS using simulations and wide-area experiments. We also discuss possible countermeasures against this attack."""	amplifier;denial-of-service attack;experiment;kalman filter;network congestion;pulse (signal processing);simulation;spamdexing;throughput	Yu-Ming Ke;Chih-Wei Chen;Hsu-Chun Hsiao;Adrian Perrig;Vyas Sekar	2016		10.1145/2897845.2897866	kalman filter;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;application layer ddos attack;computer security;denial-of-service attack	Security	-58.112689847847015	69.83327940889889	162679

A practical comparison between ADOPT and other standards demonstrates that ADOPT performs better in terms of overhead and security.	camera serial interface;centralized computing;interoperability;mobile computing;online certificate status protocol;overhead (computing);public key certificate;scvp;service discovery	Konstantinos Papapanagiotou;Giannis F.

This work investigates the discriminatory power of email transport-layer characteristics, i.e. the TCP packet stream. From a corpus of messages and corresponding packets, we extract per-email TCP features. While legitimate mail flows are wellbehaved, we observe small congestion windows, frequent retransmissions, loss and large latencies in spam traffic. To learn and exploit these differences, we build “SpamFlow.” Using machine learning feature selection, SpamFlow identifies the most selective flow properties, thereby adapting to different networks and users. In addition to greater than 90% classification accuracy, SpamFlow correctly identifies 78% of the false negatives from a popular content filter. By exploiting the need to source large quantities of spam on resource constrained hosts and networks, SpamFlow is not easily subvertible.	anti-spam techniques;content-control software;email;feature selection;machine learning;microsoft windows;network congestion;network packet;spamming;text corpus	Robert Beverly;Karen R.

Many detection methods have been developed to distinguish botnet behaviors from normal human behaviors. Future botnets, however, may incorporate the characteristics of human beings and weaken the existing detection techniques. In this work, we present a novel intelligent botnet, called the delay-tolerant botnet, that intentionally adds random delays to the command propagation and endeavors to avoid the detection. We then study the scalability of delay-tolerant botnets. Specifically, we apply mathematical analysis to derive the average delay required to distribute a command to all bots in three types of command and control architectures: centralized, distributed, and hybrid delay-tolerant botnets. We find that in all cases, the delay increases approximately logarithmically with the number of bots, indicating that the delay-tolerant botnets are scalable. Finally, we verify the analytical results by simulations.	botnet;centralized computing;internet;scalability;simulation;software propagation	Zesheng Chen;Chao Chen;Qian Wang	2010	IJSN	10.1504/IJSN.2010.037664	intrusion detection system;real-time computing;scalability;computer science;software agent;network security;distributed computing;computer security	Security	-62.78731212745097	70.2691534692066	163042

Substations host many Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) that monitor the state of the electricity infrastructure. This critical data is packaged and transmitted between multiple IEDs for proper system monitoring and control. The modern network that interconnects IEDs, while a significant improvement over the historic serial interconnection, has many challenges which have yet to be addressed - ranging from setup complexity to security policies. In this paper we propose that software-defined networking can alleviate many of today's problems and create a network which can evolve with changing technologies and needs. We demonstrate an auto-configuring substation network which eliminates many substation network management issues. Our prototype is built using a Ryu-based, software-defined network controller and tested with actual IEDs used in substations. We also discuss how our software-defined energy communication network (SDECN) architecture not only solves problems of today, but enables substation networks to easily evolve with the rapid evolution of the smart grid.	electrical connection;hardware-assisted virtualization;interconnection;network architecture;network interface controller;prototype;software-defined networking;system monitor;telecommunications network;traction substation	Adam Cahn;Juan Hoyos;Matthew Hulse;Eric Keller	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688017	embedded system;engineering;computer security;computer engineering	Robotics	-51.367296333518034	67.84239580064512	163210

The modules of PAMon, including semantic reconstruction, hidden process detection, resource utilization analysis, comprehensive analysis, and so forth, are thoroughly analyzed and investigated. To validate the feasibility of PAMon, a miniaturized private cloud was configured aided by Xen and eucalyptus technology. Through experiments, it is demonstrated that the PAMon detection system can effectively address malicious programs running on the monitored virtual machines by comprehensively analyzing the critical processes, hidden processes, and resource-seizing processes. Moreover, this detection system is more comprehensive, thorough, and reliable than existing detection techniques.

Consequently, intrusion detectors that adopt allowable and disallowable concepts are used in network forensics. The disallowable policy enforcers alert on events that are known to be bad while the allowable policy enforcers monitor events that deviate from known good. Nevertheless, sophisticated cases of computer attacks often render attempts to isolate failed attacks from successful attacks ineffective. Thus, attacks are erroneous interpreted and most successful cases of computer attacks are not forestalled while in progress despite the huge volume of warnings that intrusion detectors generate beforehand. Therefore, we present a new clustering algorithm to lessen these problems. Series of evaluations showed how to adopt category utility to improve the efficacies of methods for detecting and preventing intrusions. The results also differentiated failed attacks on computer resources from successful attacks.	algorithm;category utility;cloud computing;cluster analysis;intrusion detection system;sensor;web application	Joshua Ojo Nehinbe	2010	2010 IEEE Second International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science	10.1109/CloudCom.2010.90	statistical classification;intrusion detection system;computer science;information security;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	EDA	-60.68038105564012	62.92063759783533	163312

c6f8809256e6cbf5c5122f52f2d5f781ce821b6e	smartwatch-based legitimate user identification for cloud-based secure services		Smartphones are ubiquitously integrated into our home and work environment and users frequently use them as the portal to cloud-based secure services. Since smartphones can easily be stolen or coopted, the advent of smartwatches provides an intriguing platform legitimate user identification for applications like online banking and many other cloud-based services. However, to access security-critical online services, it is highly desirable to accurately identifying the legitimate user accessing such services and data whether coming from the cloud or any other source. Such identification must be done in an automatic and non-bypassable way. For such applications, this work proposes a two-fold feasibility study; (1) activity recognition and (2) gait-based legitimate user identification based on individual activity. To achieve the above-said goals, the first aim of this work was to propose a semicontrolled environment system which overcomes the limitations of users’ age, gender, and smartwatch wearing style. The second aim of this work was to investigate the ambulatory activity performed by any user. Thus, this paper proposes a novel system for implicit and continuous legitimate user identification based on their behavioral characteristics by leveraging the sensors already ubiquitously built into smartwatches. The design system gives legitimate user identification using machine learning techniques and multiple sensory data with 98.68% accuracy.	smartwatch	Muhammad Imtiaz Ahmad;Mohammed A.

In this paper, we will provide a quantification of DDoS attacks in size and duration beyond these outliers reported in the media.

Experimental evidence demonstrates that site-specific packet content models are capable of detecting new worms with high accuracy in a collaborative security system. A new approach is proposed that correlates ingress/egress payload alerts to identify the worm’s initial propagation. The method also enables automatic signature generation that can be deployed immediately to network firewalls and content filters to proactively protect other hosts. We also propose a collaborative privacy-preserving security strategy whereby different hosts can exchange PAYL signatures to increase accuracy and mitigate against false positives. The important principle demonstrated is that correlating multiple alerts identifies true positives from the set of anomaly alerts and reduces incorrect decisions producing accurate mitigation.	alert correlation;anomaly detection;antivirus software;egress filtering;experiment;network packet;sensor;software propagation;tracing (software)	Ke Wang;Gabriela F.

This paper presents a smart home scenario, together with its requirements for a secure and user friendly mutual authentication protocol. Protocols developed for the internet are often not applicable to the Internet of Things due to hardware limitations and physical inaccessibility of devices. To tackle the challenge of a usable and secure device authentication in the area of the IoT, a QR code based mutual authentication protocol is proposed. The protocol supports two operation modes to handle different hardware configurations with respect to cameras and displays. Both operation modes are secure against attacks within the proposed attacker model. The protocol can also be used to exchange the public keys between two parties, in order to establish a secure channel without a trusted third party.	authentication protocol;communications protocol;encryption;home automation;human-readable medium;internet of things;key management;leon;martin kay;mutual authentication;physical access;prototype;public-key cryptography;qr code;requirement;secure channel;software deployment;trusted third party;usability	Tobias Marktscheffel;Wolfram Gottschlich;Wolfgang Popp;Philemon Werli;Simon Dominik Fink;Arne Bilzhause;Hermann de Meer	2016	2016 IEEE 17th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2016.7523562	data authentication algorithm;communications protocol;ipsec;internet layer;key exchange;challenge–response authentication;computer science;authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;authentication;internet privacy;ssliop;computer security;internet of things;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;computer network	Security	-49.53546537004542	69.83413634601706	163698

Therefore, many of these systems are currently exposed to threats similar to those endured by normal computer-based networks on the Internet, but the impact of failure of the former can be much higher to society. This paper presents a demonstration of a family of protection devices for critical information infrastructures developed in the context of the EU CRUTIAL project.

The bank of korea took the lead in jointing together to create a mobile banking application that each bank can adapt for its own use. In providing smartphone services, it is of critical importance to take the proper security measures, because these services, while offering excellent mobility and convenience, can be easily exposed to various infringement threats. This paper proposes a security framework that should be taken into account by the joint smartphone-based mobile banking development project. The purpose of this paper lies in recognizing the value of smartphones as well as the security threats that are exposed when smartphones are introduced, and provides countermeasures against those threats, so that an integrated information security framework for reliable smartphone-based mobile financial services can be prepared, by explicitly presenting the difference between personal computers and smartphones from the perspective of security.	information security;malware;mobile banking;mobile commerce;operating system;personal computer;smartphone	Yong-Nyuo Shin;Myung-Geun Chun	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17604-3_21	security service;business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-50.55265453637982	61.55343642960939	164244

Such incidents are usually observed together with anomalous AS paths which violate a “valley-free” policy. Existing techniques to infer routing policy cannot satisfy industrial demand of real-time route leak detection because they are very likely to trigger false positives. In this paper, we propose an online detection scheme dedicated to detect route leak AS paths. Based on long-lived routing paths, and route anomalous concurrency, we manage to filter possible false positives in online scenarios. Applying this scheme to Oregon's routing data from 2009 to 2013, we detect 136 route leak events. Our evaluation shows that our scheme triggers no false positives, and most of these events are previously unknown to the research and operation communities at large.	concurrency (computer science);default route;ibm notes;real-time clock;routing;sensor;unreachable memory	Shen Su;Beichuan Zhang;Lin Ye;Hongli Zhang;Nathan Yee	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249474	routing;static routing;route poisoning;multipath routing;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Embedded	-58.26612395170144	68.92222786065454	164261

Many people invest money on creating new Bitcoins because of Bitcoin's market increase. They actually buy hardware and power to participate in Bitcoin mining. The market value of Bitcoin has also absorbed cybercriminals. They steal the process cycles from victims' machines and use them in mining activities by malware programs. There have been several security reports about these types of malicious activities. Although there are methods to detect botnets, to the best of our knowledge, none of non-commercial and published papers present detection method for these types. In this paper, we present Botcointrap, a novel approach to identify Bitcoin miner botnets (called Botcoin) based on dynamic analysis of executable binary files. This method benefits from a parameter value that all Botcoins must use across their computations and detect them in the lowest level of execution; therefore, our method can be used to overcome weaknesses of many other approaches. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach efficiently identifies all simulated Botcoins.	anthracosis;binary file;bitcoin;botnet;computation;cryptocurrency;cybercrime;executable;malware;paper;population parameter;scientific publication;weakness;benefit	Atefeh Zareh	2018	2018 15th International ISC (Iranian Society of Cryptology) Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)	10.1109/ISCISC.2018.8546867	computer security;cryptocurrency;computation;market value;computer science;botnet;malware;executable	Security	-58.29920610035143	61.91450949758828	164365

35b7c6c304017f77be88f2b983523ff66fa06841	pids - a behavioral framework for analysis and detection of network printer attacks		Nowadays, every organization might be attacked through its network printers. The malicious exploitation of printing protocols is a dangerous and underestimated threat against every printer today, as highlighted by recent published researches. This article presents PIDS (Printers’ IDS), an intrusion detection system for detecting attacks on printing protocols. PIDS continuously captures various features and events obtained from traffic produced by printing protocols in order to detect attacks. As part of this research we conducted thousands of automatic and manual printing protocol attacks on various printers and recorded thousands of the printers’ benign network sessions. Then we applied various supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify the collected data as normal (benign) or abnormal (malicious). We evaluated several detection algorithms, feature selection methods, and the features needed in order to obtain the best detection results for protocol traffic of printers. Our empirical results suggest that the proposed framework is effective in detecting printing protocol attacks, providing an accuracy of 99.9 with negligible fall-positive rate.	algorithm;feature selection;intrusion detection system;machine learning;malware;printer (computing);printing;sensor;supervised learning	Asaf Hecht;Adi Sagi;Yuval Elovici	2018	CoRR		computer science;computer security;feature extraction;intrusion detection system	Security	-60.57111237640879	65.18430379773308	164827

d96ef07871148ef3dcbbda1e4681e3910b7c9f4c	sgx-tor: a secure and practical tor anonymity network with sgx enclaves		With Tor being a popular anonymity network, many attacks have been proposed to break its anonymity or leak information of a private communication on Tor. However, guaranteeing complete privacy in the face of an adversary on Tor is especially difficult, because Tor relays are under complete control of world-wide volunteers. Currently, one can gain private information, such as circuit identifiers and hidden service identifiers, by running Tor relays and can even modify their behaviors with malicious intent. This paper presents a practical approach to effectively enhancing the security and privacy of Tor by utilizing Intel SGX, a commodity trusted execution environment. We present a design and implementation of Tor, called SGX-Tor, that prevents code modification and limits the information exposed to untrusted parties. We demonstrate that our approach is practical and effectively reduces the power of an adversary to a traditional network-level adversary. Finally, SGX-Tor incurs moderate performance overhead; the end-to-end latency and throughput overheads for HTTP connections are 3.9% and 11.9%, respectively.	adversary (cryptography);control table;elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;hypertext transfer protocol;identifier;intel developer zone;malware;network enclave;overhead (computing);personally identifiable information;proxy server;relay;software deployment;throughput;tor messenger;trusted execution environment;x86	Seong-min Kim;Juhyeng Han;Jaehyeong Ha;Taesoo Kim;Dongsu Han	2018	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2018.2868054	anonymity;computer network;throughput;latency (engineering);adversary;distributed computing;private information retrieval;overhead (business);computer science;software;server	Networks	-55.43472021941639	64.42830458462882	165671
237820d6a9985bae740f4fef8c8a085c0303e888	machine learning based ddos detection through netflow analysis		Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) has been a lasting severe threat to Internet, which is evolving both in technique and traffic volume recently. Many traditional detection methods fail due to their limitations in real-time, complexity or universality. Therefore, it is necessary to explore how to timely detect different kinds of DDOS by utilizing simple traffic sampling data such as NetFlow in high speed networks up to Tbps bandwidth. In this paper, we put forward a scheme to identify DDos traffic with NetFlow feature selection and machine learning. Firstly, we extract adaptive flow-based features and pattern-based features from sampling NetFlow data in real-time. Then we build a detector by RandomForest and evaluate it by using a research lab network trace which contains benign traffic and simulated DDos traffic of different kinds by popular DDos tools. Experiment results show that our method achieves an average accuracy of more than 99% and a false-positive less than 0.5%. Besides, our method is valid for DDos means such as stealthy DDos attack so it is more universal that typical traditional methods. Finally, we apply our detector on the real-world NetFlow logs provided by a large ISP, and measure the characteristics of DDos in several dimensions. This also proves that our detector is applicable for real-world network.

Unfortunately, most software-based encryption products suffer from various vulnerabilities such as insecure storage and usage capabilities for security-critical cryptographic keys and operations. In this paper we present a security architecture that allows secure, reliable and user-friendly encryption of devices and of TCPIIP communication. The architecture is capable of using Trusted Computing functionalities and offers a security level which is comparable to a hardware based solution, but is far more cost-effective. We have already implemented a device encryption system and a VPN client. Moreover, the security architecture is an appropriate basis for many applications such as Enterprise Rights Management (ERM) and secure Online Banking.	bitlocker;encryption;virtual private network	Ammar Alkassar;Michael Scheibel;Michael Stübel;Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi;Marcel Winandy	2006		10.1007/978-3-8348-9195-2_7	cloud computing security;h.235;computer science;security service;data security;distributed system security architecture;internet privacy;computer security;physics;enterprise information security architecture;56-bit encryption;computer network	Arch	-50.085750067335695	61.684394981559734	165716

As insider threat incidents have evolved to cause potentially catastrophic damages, there exists a need for a detection mechanism in order to build solutions that prevent such threats. Studies over the years show an understanding of the threat, and many approaches have been suggested to detect it, yet none of the approaches targets the physiological aspect of the threat. Bio-signals are impossible to mimic or change, as opposed to behavioral approaches. In this paper, we investigate the use of physiological signals as a measurement to detect insider threat. We design an insider threat monitoring system called Physiological Signals Monitoring (PSM) that detects incidents seconds before they occur. The main measurement in PSM is the abnormal deviation rate of electrocardiogram (ECG) amplitude, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and skin temperature that occurs seconds before an incident is executed. Our experiment on 15 human subjects explores this new area and shows the promise of the proposed solution with all of the tested incidents being correctly classified with Nearest Neighbor and Functional Trees classifiers.	access control;british informatics olympiad;catastrophic interference;computer;existential quantification;galvanic isolation;insider threat;mimic;malware;real life;signals intelligence;software deployment;threat (computer);usability	Abdulaziz Almehmadi;Khalil El-Khatib	2014		10.1145/2659651.2659654	computer science;access control;computer security	Security	-60.92647970273225	62.32697366183567	166107

While many existing schemes provide strong anonymity, they are inappropriate when high bandwidth and low latency are required. In this work, we explore an anonymity scheme for end hosts whose performance makes it possible to have it always on. The scheme leverages the natural grouping of hosts in the same subnet and the universally available broadcast primitive to provide anonymity at line speeds. Our scheme is strongly resistant against all active or passive adversaries as long as they are outside the subnet. Even within the subnet, our scheme provides reasonable resistance against adversaries, providing anonymity that is suitable for common Internet applications.	high availability;internet;subnetwork;web search engine	Craig A.

The most studied solution is to let routers probabilistically mark packets with partial path information during packet forwarding, which is referred as Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM). In this paper, we study the effect of simple attacker strategies to spoof the markings to impede victim's capacity to traceback. We show that random marking is sufficient to impede the victim from tracing the attackers. A simple enhancement based on IP path length distribution makes it harder for the victim. We hope that this analysis would help researchers to adapt the current PPM techniques accordingly to thwart the DDoS attacks.	denial-of-service attack;ip traceback;internet;item unique identification;network packet;router (computing)	Vamsi Paruchuri;Arjan Durresi;Raj Jain	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.377	trinoo;computer science;ip forwarding;internet privacy;application layer ddos attack;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Networks	-57.92073079789898	69.82133437389709	166318

NDN can overcome the fundamental limitations of the current Internet, in particular, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. However, NDN can be subject to new type of DoS attacks namely Interest flooding attacks and content poisoning. These types of attacks exploit key architectural features of NDN. This paper presents a new intelligent hybrid algorithm for proactive detection of DoS attacks and adaptive mitigation reaction in NDN. In the detection phase, a combination of multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithm with PSO in the context of the RBF neural network has been applied in order to improve the accuracy of DoS attack prediction. Performance of the proposed hybrid approach is also evaluated successfully by some benchmark problems. In the adaptive reaction phase, we introduced a framework for mitigating DoS attacks based on the misbehaving type of network nodes. The evaluation through simulations shows that the proposed intelligent hybrid algorithm (proactive detection and adaptive reaction) can quickly and effectively respond and mitigate DoS attacks in adverse conditions in terms of the applied performance criteria.	adversary (cryptography);artificial neural network;benchmark (computing);denial-of-service attack;elegant degradation;future internet;hybrid algorithm;inter-domain;mathematical optimization;network architecture;pareto efficiency;particle swarm optimization;perl dbi;phase-shift oscillator;radial basis function;simulation;throughput;whole earth 'lectronic link	Amin Karami;Manel Guerrero Zapata	2015	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2014.11.003	robust random early detection;computer science;distributed computing;particle swarm optimization;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Security	-59.933437304352914	67.63835679788399	166378

While it is trivial to find the sender’s IP address in most email server software, it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to do so in email client software: we explain why. This implies that either alternative approaches are needed (typically signature-based) or that new standards for communicating between clients and servers are needed. We suggest several forms such standards might take.	algorithm;client (computing);client-side;digital signature;email;ip address blocking;line level;router (computing);sender id;server (computing);spamming	Joshua Goodman	2004			world wide web;internet privacy;client;communication source;server;computer science;email authentication	Metrics	-54.51499635621271	63.590159351502436	166490

In this paper, we present an application traffic classification method based on fixed IP-port information. A fixed IP-port is a {IP, protocol, port} triple dedicated to only one application, which is automatically collected from the behavior analysis of individual applications. We can classify the Internet traffic accurately and quickly by simple packet header matching to the collected fixed IP-port information. Therefore, we can construct a lightweight, fast, and accurate realtime traffic classification system than other classification method. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm to extract the fixed IP-port information and the system architecture. Also we prove the feasibility and applicability of our proposed method by an acceptable experimental result.	algorithm;internet;network packet;network traffic control;real-time clock;real-time transcription;systems architecture;traffic classification	Sung-Ho Yoon;Jin-Wan Park;Jun-Sang Park;Young-Seok Oh;Myung-Sup Kim	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04492-2_3	traffic generation model;network traffic control;simulation;traffic classification;internet traffic;floating car data;computer science;traffic shaping;computer security;internet traffic engineering;computer network;systems architecture	Metrics	-62.444369551623815	66.785071204835	166583

The method operates on the time-series representation of a packet stream and it examines the """"burstiness"""" instead of the rate of packets. The method filters out packets from this stream using signatures produced with wavelet-based multi-resolution analysis, along with a similarity measure. We evaluate the proposed method with real traffic traces (i.e., Domain Name System queries from legitimate end-users and e-mail worms) and compare it with a rate limiting method.

In big ASs, the usage of scaling techniques as iBGP Route Reflection is necessary to reduce the information exchanged inside the system. However, as discussed in various studies, these techniques may lead to routing anomalies like suboptimal path selection, deflection, non-determinism, or oscillation. Especially an endless exchange of update messages and the resulting unstable behavior of the system, involved with oscillation, are extremely unwanted. Besides oscillation, also non-determinism may result in similar situations. In contrast to this, both non-determinism and oscillation were not observed in ASs using full-mesh iBGP. In this paper, it is proved that these routing anomalies cannot occur here. Understanding the conditions for the absence of these anomalies may be a first step to amalgamate the scalability advantages of iBGP Route Reflection and the stability of full-mesh iBGP.	autonomous system (internet);border gateway protocol;control theory;internet;nondeterministic algorithm;reachability;routing;scalability	Uli Bornhauser;Peter Martini	2008	6th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (cnsr 2008)	10.1109/CNSR.2008.53	functional analysis;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;oscillation;computer security;computer network	Robotics	-57.6717087805084	73.24768580952282	166730
1a95a51b11d7fb73de9a6f5d97ec03671ee0cbd6	holmes: real-time apt detection through correlation of suspicious information flows		In this paper, we present HOLMES, a system that implements a new approach to the detection of Advanced and Persistent Threats (APTs). HOLMES is inspired by several case studies of real-world APTs that highlight some common goals of APT actors. In a nutshell, HOLMES aims to produce a detection signal that indicates the presence of a coordinated set of activities that are part of an APT campaign. One of the main challenges addressed by our approach involves developing a suite of techniques that make the detection signal robust and reliable. At a high-level, the techniques we develop effectively leverage the correlation between suspicious information flows that arise during an attacker campaign. In addition to its detection capability, HOLMES is also able to generate a high-level graph that summarizes the attacker’s actions in real-time. This graph can be used by an analyst for an effective cyber response. An evaluation of our approach against some real-world APTs indicates that HOLMES can detect APT campaigns with high precision and low false alarm rate. The compact high-level graphs produced by HOLMES effectively summarizes an ongoing attack campaign and can assist real-time cyber-response operations.		Sadegh M.

Unfortunately, wireless network edge devices increase spoofing potential as all devices can “see” all network traffic within RF range. Conventional bit-level security helps, but additional security based on physical-layer (PHY) attributes is required to ensure unauthorized devices do not adversely impact CR reliability during environmental assessment. RF Distinct Native Attribute (RF-DNA) fingerprinting is one PHY technique for reliably identifying devices based on inherent emission differences. These differences are exploited to uniquely identify, by serial number, hardware devices and aid cognitive network security. Reliable device discrimination has been achieved using Multiple Discriminant Analysis, Maximum Likelihood (MDA/ML) processing. However, MDA/ML provides no insight into feature relevance which limits its use for optimizing feature selection. This limitation is addressed here using Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization-Improved (GRLVQI) and Learning from Signals (LFS) classifiers. Comparative assessment shows that GRLVQI and LFS classification performance rivals that of MDA/ML, overcomes inherent MDA/ML limitations, and provides benefit for CR network applications where reliable RF environment assessment and PUE mitigation is essential.	authentication;authorization;bit-level parallelism;cognition;cognitive network;cognitive radio;dna profiling;emulator;feature selection;fingerprint (computing);learning vector quantization;live file system;multiple discriminant analysis;network packet;network security;phy (chip);power usage effectiveness;radio frequency;relevance	Paul K.

7695c0b258934b10a7484f91cb5284b80141c65f	cesar: a testbed infrastructure to evaluate the efficiency of wireless automotive software updates		Connected vehicles allow to update the software (SW) running on their integrated electronic control units (ECUs) over-the-air. Such updates are complex procedures that involve several steps, such as the authentication with a remote device, the secure and reliable wireless transfer of the new binary, as well as its installation and verification on the target ECU. Each of these aspects affects the efficiency of the entire SW update process, and it is important to evaluate the impact of different solutions on the functionality of a vehicle and to compare their performance on real hardware. In this paper we present CESAR, a configurable testbed infrastructure that allows to evaluate the efficiency of an automotive SW update system in a highly automated way. CESAR allows to specify different update mechanisms, security configurations, wireless protocols used for the data transfer, and to carefully define the scenario of interest (i.e., pin down the number of wireless vehicle interfaces, the network topology, and the target ECU). Furthermore, CESAR can be used to measure the efficiency of a SW update on real hardware, and to derive insights about the weaknesses of a system under test or about the interaction of a specific SW with a given ECU.	authentication;automotive software;communications protocol;dependability;engine control unit;network topology;patch (computing);shattered world;system under test;testbed	Marco Steger;Carlo Alberto Boano;Kay Römer;Michael Karner;Joachim Hillebrand;Werner Rom	2017		10.1145/3127540.3127580	computer network;system under test;ieee 802.11s;computer science;network topology;automotive software;embedded system;data transmission;wireless;software;real-time computing;testbed	Security	-51.10855372276399	69.9423991261842	166963
257f23705e0737a0c3d6cc843b6f3a7ffdfa29ec	cloudrps: a cloud analysis based enhanced ransomware prevention system	ransomware;abnormal behavior;prevention system;intrusion detection;cloud	Recently, indiscriminate ransomware attacks targeting a wide range of victims for monetary gains have become a worldwide social issue. In the early years, ransomware has used e-mails as attack method. The most common spreading method was through spam mail or harmful websites. In addition, social networking sites or smartphone messages are used. Ransomware can encrypt the user’s files and issues a warning message to the user and requests payment through bitcoin, which is a virtual currency that is hard to trace. It is possible to analyze ransomware but this has its limitations as new ransomware is being continuously created and disseminated. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ransomware prevention system based on abnormal behavior analysis and detection in cloud analysis system—CloudRPS. This proposed system can defend against ransomware through more in-depth prevention. It can monitors the network, file, and server in real time. Furthermore, it installs a cloud system to collect and analyze various information from the device and log information to defend against attacks. Finally, the goal of the system is to minimize the possibility of the early intrusion. And it can detect the attack quickly more to prevent at the user’s system in case of the ransomware compromises.	algorithm;backup;bitcoin;code;confidentiality;cryptography;email;encryption;information leakage;key (cryptography);personally identifiable information;provisioning;security service (telecommunication);server (computing);smartphone;spamming;spectral leakage;virtual currency	Jeong Kyu Lee;Seo Yeon Moon;Jong Hyuk Park	2016	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-016-1825-5	operating system;distributed computing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-57.03455474549339	63.293977278587015	166998
dac2afe7003ac3f278592bceb67908797134dba2	collaborative botnet detection with partial communication graph information		Botnets have long been used for malicious purposes with huge economic costs to the society. With the proliferation of cheap but non-secure Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices generating large amounts of data, the potential for damage from botnets has increased manifold. There are several approaches to detect bots or botnets, though many traditional techniques are becoming less effective as botnets with centralized command & control structure are being replaced by peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets which are harder to detect. Several algorithms have been proposed in literature that use graph analysis or machine learning techniques to detect the overlay structure of P2P networks in communication graphs. Many of these algorithms however, depend on the availability of a universal communication graph or a communication graph aggregated from several ISPs, which is not likely to be available in reality. In real world deployments, significant gaps in communication graphs are expected and any solution proposed should be able to work with partial information. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of some community detection algorithms in detecting P2P botnets, especially with partial information. We show that the approach can work with only about half of the nodes reporting their communication graphs, with only small increase in detection errors.	algorithm;botnet;centralized computing;control flow;emergence;machine learning;peer-to-peer;sensor	Harshvardhan P.

When malicious users join sites, they provide limited information about themselves. With this limited information, sites can find it difficult to distinguish between a malicious user and a normal user. In this study, we develop a methodology that identifies malicious users with limited information. As information provided by malicious users can vary, the proposed methodology utilizes minimum information to identify malicious users. It is shown that as little as 10 bits of information can help greatly in this challenging task. The experiments results verify that this methodology is effective in identifying malicious users in the realistic scenario of limited information availability.	experiment;malware;security hacker;threat (computer);user (computing)	Reza Zafarani;Huan Liu	2015		10.1145/2806416.2806535	behaviorism;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-57.07976633606924	61.917223885553156	167259
ebf19f18917e33d7b40797197107d2c253679987	breaking ble beacons for fun but mostly profit		Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons introduced a novel technology that enables devices to advertise their presence in an area by constantly broadcasting a static unique identifier. The aim was to enhance services with location and context awareness. Although the hardware components of typical BLE Beacons systems are able to support adequate cryptography, the design and implementation of most publicly available BLE Beacon protocols appears to render them vulnerable to a plethora of attacks. Indeed, in this paper, we were able to perform user tracking, user behavior monitoring, spoofing as well as denial of service (DoS) of many supported services. Our aim is to show that these attacks stem from design flaws of the underlying protocols and assumptions made for the BLE beacons protocols. Using a clearly defined threat model, we provide a formal analysis of the adversarial capabilities and requirements and the attack impact on security and privacy for the end-user. Contrary to popular belief, BLE technology can be exploited even by low-skilled adversaries leading to exposure of user information. To demonstrate our attacks in practice, we selected Apple's iBeacon technology, as a case study. However, our analysis can be easily generalized to other BLE Beacon technologies.	air traffic control radar beacon system;bluetooth;context awareness;cryptography;denial-of-service attack;eddystone (google);facebook beacon;ibeacon;identifier;mission critical;open research;privacy;relevance;requirement;stemming;threat model;unique key;web beacon	Constantinos Kolias;Lucas Copi;Fengwei Zhang;Angelos Stavrou	2017		10.1145/3065913.3065923	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Security	-55.643612891869225	62.82484425112738	167526

In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type """"opportunistic adversaries"""". This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats. Then we propose a countermeasure algorithm to detect such attacks based on change detection in the post-classification data distributions. Experimental results show that our algorithm has higher detection accuracy than other approaches based on outlier detection or change-point detection."""	algorithm;anomaly detection;automation;business process;machine learning;promoting adversaries;vulnerability (computing)	Michiaki Tatsubori;Shohei Hido	2012	2012 Annual SRII Global Conference	10.1109/SRII.2012.24	engineering;machine learning;data mining;computer security;one-class classification	SE	-59.20396467078385	61.36656857445596	167602
3017f623ec5d03a629fcebc72af52a2554077174	on the detection of fake certificates via attribute correlation	certification;attribute correlation;man in the middle attacks	Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, SSL, are important cryptographic protocol suites on the Internet. They both implement public key certificates and rely on a group of trusted certificate authorities (i.e., CAs) for peer authentication. Unfortunately, the most recent research reveals that, if any one of the pre-trusted CAs is compromised, fake certificates can be issued to intercept the corresponding SSL/TLS connections. This security vulnerability leads to catastrophic impacts on SSL/TLS-based HTTPS, which is the underlying protocol to provide secure web services for e-commerce, e-mails, etc. To address this problem, we design an attribute dependency-based detection mechanism, called SSLight. SSLight can expose fake certificates by checking whether the certificates contain some attribute dependencies rarely occurring in legitimate samples. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate SSLight and successfully confirm that SSLight can detect the vast majority of fake certificates issued from any trusted CAs if they are compromised. As a real-world example, we also implement SSLight as a Firefox add-on and examine its capability of exposing existent fake certificates from DigiNotar and Comodo, both of which have made a giant impact around the world.	add-ons for firefox;authentication;certificate authority;cryptographic protocol;e-commerce;email;experiment;https;protocol stack;public key certificate;public-key cryptography;transport layer security;visual intercept;vulnerability (computing);web service	Xiaojing Gu;Xingsheng Gu	2015	Entropy	10.3390/e17063806	man-in-the-middle attack;hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer;public key infrastructure;revocation list;internet privacy;certification;world wide web;computer security;certificate authority	Security	-56.617502788380484	63.41477511931473	167717

There is an increasing need to test existing Modbus protocol implementations for security vulnerabilities, as devices become accessible even from the Internet. Fuzz testing can be used to discover implementation bugs in a fast and economical way. We present the design and implementation of MTF, a Modbus/TCP Fuzzer. The MTF incorporates a reconnaissance phase in the testing procedure so as to assist mapping the capabilities of the tested device and to adjust the attack vectors towards a more guided and informed testing rather than plain random testing. The MTF was used to test eight implementations of the Modbus protocol and revealed bugs and vulnerabilities that crash the execution, effectively resulting in denial of service attacks using only a few network packets.	communications protocol;crash (computing);denial-of-service attack;internet protocol suite;internetworking;modbus;move-to-front transform;random testing;sensor;software bug;vulnerability (computing)	Artemios G.

For many recently introduced secure MSN data communication schemes, attribute-based encryption is often adopted to preserve user privacy and prevent outside attackers from eavesdropping. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure user revocation scheme to address inside attacks based on an attribute-based encryption technique. The proposed scheme enables a trusted authority (TA) to flexibly control the data decryption capability of mobile social users. It disables malicious users from decrypting any data packet. As a result, proper user behavior is encouraged, inside attacks are reduced, and network security is enhanced. Through the analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed user revocation scheme is able to resist attribute collusion attacks and revoke collusion attacks. Extensive simulation results further confirm that the proposed scheme has much smaller communication overhead and much shorter delay than the existing solution [1].	attribute-based encryption;broadcast encryption;key size;mobile social network;network packet;network security;overhead (computing);public-key cryptography;simulation	Xiaohui Liang;Xu Li;Rongxing Lu;Xiaodong Lin;Xuemin Shen	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134273	computer science;cryptography;internet privacy;mobile computing;computer security;encryption;computer network;social network	Security	-49.057054143798744	73.05639066980726	167958

3256da9dce71ededb116e3a4f703b656a552d8ed	algorithm for trust based policy hidden communication in the internet of things		The Internet of Things(IoT) has been developing rapidly since the past decade. It is becoming a crucial part of everyday life. It is becoming a way of living in which machines perform activities on their own by communicating with each other, without the need for human beings to instruct them. In such a scenario, which concerns daily life, privacy, and secrecy should be of at most priority. Since in Internet of Things(IoT) several machines communicate with each other, mutual authentication and service discovery must be performed in such a way that each of the devices share information with only those devices that are genuine. Hence, private mutual authentication and automatic service discovery is important for the functioning of the IoT without human intervention. But, this comes at the cost of computation time. Thus, there is a balance to be found between the two. This can be achieved by introducing a trust attribute. We propose here that the distance between the client and server and the presence of a signed token with the client act as components of the trust attribute. Here we mention a hybrid approach that determines in real time which protocol to be used (SIGMA-I or policy hiding prefix based encryption) based on the proximity/distance between the entities involved and presence of a token with the client.	algorithm;computation;elliptic curve cryptography;encryption;entity;internet of things;mutual authentication;privacy;sha-3;server (computing);service discovery;time complexity	Naresh Peshwe;Debasis Das	2017	2017 IEEE 42nd Conference on Local Computer Networks Workshops (LCN Workshops)	10.1109/LCN.Workshops.2017.77	secrecy;computer science;the internet;service discovery;distributed computing;mutual authentication;security token;encryption;server;authentication	Mobile	-49.78352172080625	74.43361242709496	168272

CardGuard is non-intrusive in the sense that no cycles of the host CPUs are used for intrusion detection and the system operates at Fast Ethernet link rate.

However, there remain some risks in such use of SSL/TLS@. These include that of information being stored in clear at the end point of the communication link and lack of user authentication. Although SSL/TLS does offer the latter, the security service is optional and usually omitted. This is because of the fact that users typically do not have the necessary asymmetric key pair. Since SSL/TLS protects data only while it is being transmitted, the merchant has access to sensitive information such as the debit/credit card number. The storage of unencrypted debit/credit card information at the merchant server therefore represents a risk that is not currently addressed by the use of SSL/TLS to secure electronic payment transactions.In this paper, we propose a payment protocol in which the risk of having debit/credit card details stored at a merchant server is eliminated. User authentication is also provided. This is achieved by utilising the GSM data confidentiality service to encrypt sensitive information. The GSM security service is also used to provide user identity authentication. The additional security is realised in such a way that no management overhead is imposed on the user.	authentication;chargeback;confidentiality;debit card;e-commerce;encryption;hoc (programming language);information sensitivity;norm (social);overhead (computing);personal computer;plaintext;public-key cryptography;security service (telecommunication);server (computing);subscriber identity module;threat (computer);transaction processing;transport layer security	Vorapranee Khu-smith;Chris J.

VoIP then benefit much lower cost of equipment, operation, and better integration with data applications than voice communications over telephony networks. On the other hand, VoIP further introduce security vulnerability while delivering voice packets over the public Internet, using the transparent IP protocol suite. The most popular solution to secure VoIP voice packets is to apply cost-effective AES encryption with a single key during to a voice call. In this paper, to further enhance the VoIP security to prevent malicious eavesdroppers, we propose a much stronger privacy protection for an end-to-end VoIP. This dependable solution applies not only the Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) algorithm for key negotiation, but also the key generation function (KGF) for changing key dynamically in a VoIP call session. This 2-tier key distribution scheme provides effective and robust security for VoIP voice packets during the end-to-end call session. This proposed scheme has been deployed on an opensource SIP-based phone as our test-bed over the Internet. The performance results from the experiments with the Internet dynamics of packet loss inserted on the test-bed demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only provide more secure VoIP call, but also preserve the quality of voice packet delivery. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

They consist of network environments and sets of applications, and after being installed and configured with all of these components, the Honeynet is ready to be attacked with the purpose of maintaining a controlled environment for the study of the events that occurred. Through the analysis of these events, it is possible to understand the objectives, tactics and interests that the attackers have for the proposed environment.

At the same time, this communication technology poses a great threat to the system in those countries that wish to control the information flow. As a result, the Internet is subject to be under censorship, which is, however, a great privacy issue. Deploying decoy routers is one emerging approach to tackle this issue, since it helps each packet whose destination is a prohibited server to hide its ultimate destination from the censorship authority also known as warden. The recent report by Schuchard et al. shows an existence of an efficient approach to detect and isolate active decoy routers from the public. As a countermeasure, they propose to deploy decoy routers surrounding a target country such that isolating the decoy routers will result in isolating the the country from the rest of the Internet. Based on our observation that this problem in fact is with two opposite optimization goals, minimizing the number of decoy routers and maximizing the confinement rate, we introduce two polynomial time algorithms which handle this deployment problem under the presence of uncooperative ASes. We also conduct simulations to compare and analyze the performance of our algorithms.	algorithm;emoticon;heuristic;ibm notes;information superhighway;internet;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimization problem;router (computing);server (computing);signalling system no. 7;simulation;software deployment;time complexity	Donghyun Kim;Glenn R.

Regardless, the number of illegal file sharing using BitTorrent continues to grow and most of file sharers and downloader are unconcerned legal action to transfer copywrite-protected files. However, it is difficult to gather enough probative evidence to prosecute illegal file sharers in criminal court and/or sued for damages in civil court. Further, there is a lack of research on investigation techniques to reveal illegal BitTorrent sharers. This is because the role of the server in BitTorrent networks has been changed compared to servers in conventional P2P networks. As a result, it is difficult to apply previous investigation processes for investigation of conventional P2P networks to the investigation of suspected illegal file sharing using BitTorrent. This paper proposes a methodology for the investigation of illegal file sharers using BitTorrent networks through the use of a P2P digital investigation process.	bittorrent;download;file sharing;peer-to-peer;server (computing);upload	Sooyoung Park;Hyunji Chung;Changhoon Lee;Sangjin Lee;Kyungho Lee	2013	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-013-1760-x	packet analyzer;bittorrent;computer science;bittorrent tracker;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;file sharing;computer network	Metrics	-56.542419497347495	66.11022390039997	169011

In the second set of experiments, the goal was to find patterns that can indicate where the credentials are located in a memory dump of an Android device.

Although they might agree so, some selfish colluders may break away from their fair-collusion agreement and process their fingerprinted copies before collusion to further lower their risk. On the other hand, to protect their own interests, other attackers may wish to detect and prevent such selfish pre-collusion processing. It is important to study this problem of traitors within traitors, formulate the dynamics among colluders and build a complete model of multi-user collusion. This paper investigates techniques that attackers can use to detect and identify selfish colluders without revealing the secrecy of any fingerprinted copies. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme accurately identifies all selfish colluders without falsely accusing any others.	algorithm;ftc fair information practice;fairness measure;fingerprint;multi-user;simulation	H.

It has quickly made large inroads into the voice over IP (VoIP) market. SIP is an application-layer control operating on top of a transport protocol and allows to create, modify, and terminate sessions with one or more participants. With security considerations, these operations require authentication from participating end-points, confidentiality, data integrity, and protection against internal and external attacks. For authentication, SIP relies on HTTP Digest by default; the client is authenticated to the SIP proxy server. In order to have mutual authentication between client and server, SIP could be implemented over TLS (transport layer security) when TCP is supported by SIP architecture network. In this paper, we propose a mutual authentication mechanism within HTTP Digest since this later is implemented by default in all SIP environments. It consists in providing meaning and semantic to some of the parameters' values generated by the participating end-points during SIP session establishment, especially to the """"nonce"""" values. Our solution is backward-compatible with today implementations. Without being in opposition to security protocols like TLS, this approach helps in reducing DoS (denial of service) attacks, detects server identity spoofing and ensures basic mutual authentication with comparison to HTTP digest."""	backward compatibility;confidentiality;cryptographic hash function;cryptographic nonce;data integrity;denial-of-service attack;digest access authentication;encryption;firewall (computing);hypertext transfer protocol;ipsec;internet;interoperability;mutual authentication;proxy server;public key infrastructure;server (computing);service-oriented device architecture;signaling protocol;software deployment;terminate (software);transport layer security	Thomas Guillet;Ahmed Serhrouchni;Mohamad Badra	2008	2008 New Technologies, Mobility and Security	10.1109/NTMS.2008.ECP.69	sip trunking;computer science;information security;voice over ip;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-55.94616077967766	67.96695168266646	169569

By dividing these users into three groups, our controlled study measured both the effect of extended validation certificates that appear only at legitimate sites and the effect of reading a help file about security features in Internet Explorer 7. Across all groups, we found that picturein-picture attacks showing a fake browser window were as effective as the best other phishing technique, the homograph attack. Extended validation did not help users identify either attack. Additionally, reading the help file made users more likely to classify both real and fake web sites as legitimate when the phishing warning did not appear.	browser security;extended validation certificate;idn homograph attack;internet explorer 7;phishing;picture-in-picture;spoofing attack;usability testing;user interface	Collin Jackson;Daniel R.

Th ese association(s) may represent any interaction among entities, for example betw e n people or even bank accounts. The need for link discovery arises in many app lications including law enforcement, counter-terrorism, social network analy sis, intrusion detection, and fraud detection. Given the sensitive nature of informat ion hat can be revealed from link discovery, privacy is a major concern from t he perspective of both individuals and organizations. For example, in the con text of financial fraud detection, linking transactions may reveal sensitive info rmation about other individuals not involved in any fraud. It is known that link disco very can be done in a privacy-preserving manner by securely finding the transit ive closure of a graph. We propose two very efficient techniques to find the transitiv e closure securely. The two protocols have varying levels of security and perfor mance. We analyze the performance and usability of the proposed approach in te rms of both analytical and experimental results.	complex network;entity;intrusion detection system;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;privacy;social network;usability	Xiaoyun He;Jaideep Vaidya;Basit Shafiq;Nabil R.

Since the advertising library and host app are running in the same process, the current Android permission mechanism cannot prevent an ad network from collecting private data that is out of an ad network's permission range. In this paper, we propose PmDroid to protect the data that is not under the scope of the ad network's permission set. PmDroid can block the data from being sent to advertising servers at the occurrence of permission violation in ad networks. Moreover, we utilize PmDroid to assess how serious the permission violation problem is in the ad networks. We first implement 53 sample apps using a single ad network library. We grant all permissions of Android 4.3 to these apps and record the data sent to the Internet. Then, we further analyze 430 published market apps. In total, there are 76 ad networks identified in our experiments. We compare the permission of data received by these ad networks with their official documents. Our experimental results indicate that the permission violation is a real problem in existing ad network markets.	android;experiment;information privacy;internet;personally identifiable information;software development kit;undocumented feature	Xing Gao;Dachuan Liu;Haining Wang;Kun Sun	2015	2015 IEEE 34th Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS)	10.1109/SRDS.2015.41	online advertising;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;android;computer network	Security	-55.955321384821204	61.74271328088884	169935

We discuss the limitations of current Intrusion Detection System (IDS) technology, and propose a novel approach which we call Intrusion Detection & Diagnosis System (IDS) technology to overcome such limitations. The basic idea is to collect information at several architectural levels, using multiple security probes, which are deployed as a distributed architecture, to perform sophisticated correlation analysis of intrusion symptoms. This makes it possible to escalate from intrusion symptoms to the adjudged cause of the intrusion, and to assess the damage in individual system components. The process is driven by ontologies. We also present preliminary experimental results, providing evidence that our approach is effective against stealthy and non-vulnerability attacks.	artificial intelligence;distributed computing;intrusion detection system;ontology (information science)	Luigi Coppolino;Salvatore D'Antonio;Ivano Alessandro Elia;Luigi Romano	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10265-3_18	anomaly-based intrusion detection system;intrusion detection system;real-time computing;computer science;data mining;computer security;intrusion prevention system	Security	-62.135888066037	61.85039829464381	169944

d80aa2545293be5617d80de3f2cd3b9cba525cf9	community discovery of attribution trace based on deep learning approach		In order to prevent potential network crime and halt attackers’ operation further, collecting information to profile attackers is helpful. Because this exposes the identity of attackers, as well as provides IOC (Indicator of Compromise) to confirm whether devices have been compromised. In this information searching procedure, finding unknown information based on the existing ones is of crucial importance, because it leads to a more comprehensive profile about the attackers. Usually, these information pieces about a particular attacker form a tight connected community. Thus, finding the correct community label for the new incoming information piece based on these existing ones is pivotal for iteratively discovering more unknown information about the attacker. To facilitate this process, we propose to adopt the promising deep learning method to community classification on attribution traces. First, we propose to employ deep learning on extracting attribution trace pattern and then use the fine-tuned DBN (Deep Belief Network) to model the existing communities. At last, we experimentally illustrate the effectiveness of the DBN model in finding the correct community labels by feeding it with test information pieces. The results demonstrate that deep learning is a powerful means for identifying the community label.	deep learning	Jian Xu;Xiaochun Yun;Yongzheng Zhang;Zhenyu Cheng	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-01950-1_20	distributed computing;network analysis;deep learning;machine learning;deep belief network;attribution;computer science;indicator of compromise;artificial intelligence	Security	-59.71143182828858	63.48542443863307	170202

The most widely used technique to control a botnet is to try to connect to many domain names, generated according to an algorithm called domain generating algorithm (DGA). In this paper we present different algorithms that can determine if a computer is part of a botnet by looking at its network traffic. Since in some cases the network traffic is impossible to be shared due to privacy reasons we also analyze the case where just limited information can be provided (such as a netflow log). The algorithms presented here were obtained after reverse engineering and analyzing the DGA of 18 different botnets including some that were taken down (such as Cryptolocker) and ones that are still alive and thriving (such as PushDo, Tinba, Nivdort, DirtyLocker, Dobot, Patriot, Ramdo, Virut, Ramnit and many more).	anomaly detection;computer;cryptolocker;cutwail botnet;domain generation algorithm;flow network;network packet;network traffic control;privacy;reverse engineering;router (computing);tiny banker trojan;virut	Dragos Gavrilut;George Popoiu;Razvan Benchea	2016	2016 18th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC)	10.1109/SYNASC.2016.053	srizbi botnet;computer science;cryptography;operating system;data mining;database;malware;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Arch	-60.1316183826083	65.4148387599628	170466
f8e4e3e22d5568e5ad7ccad5b949c05b541a1dda	examining hacker participation length in cybercriminal internet-relay-chat communities		To further cybersecurity, there is interest in studying online cybercriminal communities to learn more about emerging cyber threats. Literature documents the existence of many online Internet Relay Chat (IRC) cybercriminal communities where cybercriminals congregate and share hacking tools, malware, and more. However, many cybercriminal community participants appear unskilled and have fleeting interests, making it difficult to detect potential long-term or key participants. This is a challenge for researchers and practitioners to quickly identify cybercriminals that may provide credible threat intelligence. Thus, we propose a computational approach to analyze cybercriminals IRC communities in order to identify potential long-term and key participants. We use the extended Cox model to scrutinize cybercriminal IRC participation for better understanding of behaviors exhibited by cybercriminals of importance. Results indicate that key cybercriminals may be quickly identifiable by assessing the scale of their interaction and networks with other participants.	categorization;computer security;cybercrime;geopolitical ontology;ground truth;hacker;internet relay chat;logic programming;malware;proportional hazards model;threat (computer);tor messenger	Victor A.

The related and prior works ensure security and privacy. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these schemes is usually low or there is the possibility of denial of services attacks. The main goal of our paper is to provide initial design of a scheme which ensures privacy, security and efficiency. The proposed scheme can also protect against several Denial of Services Attacks.

Prudent security must engage in other risk management and mitigation techniques to rapidly detect and recover from breaches. In reality, many security policies are either wrong, containing errors, or are misused and abused by malicious employees or compromised accounts; not all granted access is desirable. A popular approach to mitigate against these and other residual threats is to monitor applications to detect misuse and abuse of credentials in near real-time.  We will show a platform for monitoring applications and the use of analytic models on diverse datasets for detecting suspicious user activity. Our platform combines traditional data management systems with BigData platforms to efficiently apply analytics across security relevant data (policies, logs, metadata) and provide administrators a dashboard of the current security status of the organization, and the ability to investigate prioritized alerts. One key analytic in the demo is a novel generalization of the role mining problem as applied to access logs and modeling user behavior for anomalies. Other analytics include conventional statistical measures, Gaussian mixture models and clustering, Markov models, and entropic analysis of requests. This demonstration will walk through a prototype system and describe the analytics and underlying architecture.	access control;big data;cluster analysis;credential;malware;markov chain;markov model;mixture model;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;risk management;sensor	Suresh Chari;Ted Habeck;Ian Molloy;Youngja Park;Wilfried Teiken	2013		10.1145/2462410.2462433	analytics;data mining;world wide web;computer security	Security	-60.63089885015164	61.645639805672786	171106

The design and appearance of these websites makes it difficult for users to manually identify them as fake. Automated detection systems have emerged as a mechanism for combating fake websites, however most are fairly simplistic in terms of their fraud cues and detection methods employed. Consequently, existing systems are susceptible to the myriad of obfuscation tactics used by fraudsters, resulting in highly ineffective fake website detection performance. In light of these deficiencies, we propose the development of a new class of fake website detection systems that are based on statistical learning theory (SLT). Using a design science approach, a prototype system was developed to demonstrate the potential utility of this class of systems. We conducted a series of experiments, comparing the proposed system against several existing fake website detection systems on a test bed encompassing 900 websites. The results indicate that systems grounded in SLT can more accurately detect various categories of fake websites by utilizing richer sets of fraud cues in combination with problem-specific knowledge. Given the hefty cost exacted by fake websites, the results have important implications for ecommerce and online security.

They are increasingly being used to improve the quality of life of patients by treating chronic ailments such as cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. Wireless IMDs have shown recently important security concerns. In particular, it has been stated that lethal attacks can be launched on these devices. In this paper, we propose a solution to secure IMDs against unauthorized access, battery depletion, and denial of service attacks. A Radio Frequency energy harvesting solution is used to design a powerless mutual authentication protocol. A technique for dynamic biometric keys extraction from electrocardiogram signals collected at both sides (the programmer and the IMD) is used, allowing to secure access to the IMD devices in regular and emergency situations.	authentication protocol;authorization;biometrics;brute-force search;denial-of-service attack;depletion region;forward secrecy;key generation;mutual authentication;programmer;radio frequency;the quality of life;usc interactive media & games division	Nourhene Ellouze;Mohamed Allouche;Habib Ben Ahmed;Slim Rekhis;Noureddine Boudriga	2013		10.1145/2517300.2517307	telecommunications;engineering;biological engineering;computer security	Mobile	-50.95285751677603	72.28637443768326	171437

IoT comprises a huge amount of devices (hereinafter called as constrained devices) able to interact with the environment and to communicate over the Internet. Among other challenges that prevents the growth of IoT, the IoT is challenged for security issues. In this work, we are mainly interested in secure communication concerns for constrained devices. In essence, constrained devices are devices operating under low-power, and with limited computational and network resources. For such characteristics, they do not support standard security protocols and, consequently, they become a potential target for traditional Internet attacks (e.g., Denial of Service and man-in-the-middle). Thus, we introduce an architecture to enable constrained devices to use Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) with mutual authentication to communicate with Internet devices. Briefly, we propose a third part device called Internet of Things Security Support Provider (IoTSSP) and two main mechanisms: (i) the Optional Handshaking Delegation, and (ii) the Transfer of Session. Experimental results show the proposal feasibility and its additional benefits.	access control;computation;computer security;datagram transport layer security;denial-of-service attack;future internet;handshaking;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;man-in-the-middle attack;mutual authentication;pre-shared key;retransmission (data networks);router (computing);scalability;secure communication;security support provider interface;security management	Glederson Lessa dos Santos;Vinicius Tavares Guimaraes;Guilherme da Cunha Rodrigues;Lisandro Zambenedetti Granville;Liane Margarida Rockenbach Tarouco	2015	2015 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communication (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2015.7405613	communications protocol;ipsec;the internet;wireless sensor network;internet traffic;security association;internet layer;internet transit;computer science;datagram transport layer security;authentication;internet security;internet privacy;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Security	-52.11460175581712	73.2284535230721	171585

This characteristic behavior of malware was found to be surprisingly prevalent in a parallel study. To this end, we propose a visual analytics solution that supports both automatic detection and manual inspection of periodic signals hidden in network traffic. The detected periodic signals are visually verified in an overview using a circular graph and two stacked histograms as well as in detail using deep packet inspection. Our approach offers the capability to detect complex periodic patterns, but avoids the unverifiability issue often encountered in related work. The periodicity assumption imposed on malware behavior is a relatively weak assumption, but initial evaluations with a simulated scenario as well as a publicly available network capture demonstrate its applicability.	deep packet inspection;malware;network packet;network traffic control;quasiperiodicity;sensor;visual analytics	Huynh Ngoc Anh;Wee Keong Ng;Alex Ulmer;Jörn Kohlhammer	2016	2016 IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec)	10.1109/VIZSEC.2016.7739581	intrusion detection system;fourier transform;detector;visualization;computer science;theoretical computer science;time series;data mining;malware;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-60.40638259581198	65.23163094658945	171750

In a typical virtualized and multi-tenant environment, the cloud infrastructure and the hosted cloud services are managed by different administrative entities that may not trust each other. In such a scenario, the cloud service providers might hesitate to disclose operational information to the infrastructure providers. In this paper, we present Encrypted IP (EncrIP), a network-level design consideration for encrypting IP addresses that hides information about which end-systems are communicating in a cloud service, while still allowing packet forwarding with longest-prefix match in commodity routers. Using probabilistic encryption, EncrIP can avoid that an observer can identify what traffic belongs to the same source-destination pairs. Our evaluation results show that EncrIP requires only a few MB of memory on the gateways where traffic enters and leaves the cloud network infrastructure. In our prototype implementation of EncrIP on GENI, which uses standard IP headers, the success probability of a statistical inference attack to identify packets belonging to the same session is less than 0.001%. Therefore, we believe EncrIP presents a practical solution for protecting privacy in multi-tenant, cloud network infrastructure.	cloud computing;entity;inference attack;level design;longest prefix match;multitenancy;network packet;privacy;probabilistic encryption;prototype	Sriram Natarajan;Tilman Wolf	2014	2014 International Conference and Workshop on the Network of the Future (NOF)	10.1109/NOF.2014.7119797	cloud computing security;client-side encryption;computer science;internet privacy;converged infrastructure;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-55.91171137602397	69.48981422543972	171815

When designing such systems, two major issues need to be faced. First, population of these systems evolves continuously (nodes can join and leave the system as often as they wish without any central authority in charge of their control), and second, these systems being open, one needs to defend against the presence of malicious nodes that try to subvert the system. Given robust operations and adversarial strategies, we propose an analytical model of the local behavior of clusters, based on Markov chains. This local model provides an evaluation of the impact of malicious behaviors on the correctness of the system. Moreover, this local model is used to evaluate analytically the performance of the global system, allowing to characterize the global behavior of the system with respect to its dynamics and to the presence of malicious nodes and then to validate our approach.	correctness (computer science);distributed computing;dynamical system;malware;markov chain;peer-to-peer;performance evaluation	Emmanuelle Anceaume;Romaric Ludinard;Bruno Sericola	2012	SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review	10.1145/2185395.2185447	markov chain;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-58.64469417470681	71.01828526603877	172460
9b2477697246ca3cb86bdb6b67af304293b947b6	using deep neural networks to translate multi-lingual threat intelligence		The multilingual nature of the Internet increases complications in the cybersecurity community’s ongoing efforts to strategically mine threat intelligence from OSINT data on the web. OSINT sources such as social media, blogs, and dark web vulnerability markets exist in diverse languages and hinder security analysts, who are unable to draw conclusions from intelligence in languages they don’t understand. Although third party translation engines are growing stronger, they are unsuited for private security environments. First, sensitive intelligence is not a permitted input to third party engines due to privacy and confidentiality policies. In addition, third party engines produce generalized translations that tend to lack exclusive cybersecurity terminology. In this paper, we address these issues and describe our system that enables threat intelligence understanding across unfamiliar languages. We create a neural network based system that takes in cybersecurity data in a different language and outputs the respective English translation. The English translation can then be understood by an analyst, and can also serve as input to an AI based cyber-defense system that can take mitigative action. As a proof of concept, we have created a pipeline which takes Russian threats and generates its corresponding English, RDF, and vectorized representations. Our network optimizes translations on specifically, cybersecurity data.

DDoS attacks often exhaust the network bandwidth, processing capacity and information resources of victims, thus, leading to unavailability of computing systems services. Various defense mechanisms for the detection, mitigation and/or prevention of DDoS attacks have been suggested including resource redundancy, traceback of attack origins and identification of programs with suspicious behavior. Contemporary DDoS attacks employ sophisticated techniques including formation of hierarchical networks, one-way communication channels, encrypted messages, dynamic ports allocation and source address spoofing to hide the attackers' identities; such techniques make both detection and tracing of DDoS activities a challenge and render traditional DDoS defense mechanisms ineffective. In this paper, we propose the DDoS Container, a comprehensive framework that uses network-based detection methods to overcome the above complex and evasive types of attacks; the framework operates in 'inline' mode to inspect and manipulate ongoing traffic in real-time. By keeping track of connections established by both potential DDoS attacks and legitimate applications, the suggested DDoS Container carries out stateful inspection on data streams and correlates events among sessions. The framework performs stream re-assembly and dissects the resulting aggregations against protocols followed by various known DDoS attacks facilitating their identification. The traffic pattern analysis and data correlation of the framework further enhance its detection accuracy on DDoS traffic camouflaged with encryption. Actions available on identified DDoS traffic range from simple alerting to message blocking and proactive session termination. Experimentation with the prototype of our DDoS Container shows its effectiveness in classifying DDoS traffic.	denial-of-service attack	Zhongqiang Chen;Zhongrong Chen;Alex Delis	2007	Comput.

In traditional distributed systems, network partitions are generally a result of bugs or connectivity failures; the typical goal of the system designer is to automatically recover from such issues as seamlessly as possible. Blockchain-based systems, however, rely on purposeful """"forks"""" to roll out protocol changes in a decentralized manner. Not all users may agree with proposed changes, and thus forks can persist, leading to permanent network partitions. In this paper, we closely study the large-scale fork that occurred in Ethereum, a new blockchain technology that allows for both currency transactions and smart contracts. Ethereum is currently the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $28B. We explore the consequences of this fork, showing the impact on the two networks and their mining pools, and how the fork lead to unintentional incentives and security vulnerabilities."""	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;distributed computing;ethereum;fork (software development);network partition;smart contract;software bug;systems design;vulnerability (computing)	Lucianna Kiffer;Dave Levin;Alan Mislove	2017		10.1145/3152434.3152449	computer science;fork (system call);distributed computing;cryptocurrency;market capitalization;decentralization;popularity;currency;network partition;incentive	Security	-58.19262775393082	60.90999675610632	172854

Each of these standards has been defined based on a number of vendor specific implementations, in order to provide common inter-working procedures for cross-vendor communication. Thus, a lot of optional and redundant information is being exchanged during e-mail sessions, which is available to implement versatile covert channel mechanisms. This work exploits this possibility by presenting a simple but effective steganographic scheme that can be used to deploy robust secret communication through spam e-mails. This scheme can offer unidirectional asynchronous one-to-one or one-to-many covert channel facilities that are able to bypass the most sophisticated firewalls and traffic analyzers. Its implementation neither affects the involved transport protocols nor causes any perceivable performance degradation or data loss to the end-users. The proposed scheme allows one to manage possible filtering/loss of the e-mails being the vehicle of the secret information. A novel retransmission method based on the Raptor codes has been adopted. The use of Raptor codes is key to correctly and efficiently manage the difficulty or impossibility to retransmit e-mails in the case of a unidirectional secret communication starting from one sender and directed to many recipients. In order to evaluate the performance characteristics of the proposed scheme, an empirical estimation of the covert channel bandwidth has been performed.	covert channel;spamming	Aniello Castiglione;Alfredo De Santis;Ugo Fiore;Francesco Palmieri	2012	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2011.07.068	secure communication;computer science;internet privacy;raptor code;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-53.80242365002686	69.60535601162287	172937

They suggest that there are security weaknesses allowing publishing applications with malicious behavior on Google Play. For test reasons of Google Play security mechanisms, a special pair of applications has been developed. The former is a testing application containing a mobile botnet client. It has been designed to be resistant against security scans based on dynamic analysis but its malicious intentions have been presented in uncovered form into the code of application. Such testing application has been published on Google Play. The latter is represented by a malware application with the sole purpose of being fraudulently installed on mobile devices without any security verification including Google Play.

Such a mechanism would leverage the current authentication channel to carry out the covert communication rather than introducing a separate one. The communication would need to be oblivious to an adversary observing it, possibly as a man-in-the-middle. We discuss the properties that such channels would need to have for the various scenarios in which they would be used. Also, we show their poten- tial for mitigating the effects of a number of security breaches currently occurring in these scenarios.	authentication	Mohammed H. Almeshekah;Mikhail J. Atallah;Eugene H.

Currently Live sawing, which is one direction sawing, can be simulated for only one rotational orientation and one depth of opening cut using a single workstation. The optimal rotational orientation and depth of the opening cut significantly affects the value of lumber produced. The optimal rotational orientation and the opening position outperformed the mean of 432 possible combinations by 14.7 percent. However the computational time involved in simulation of all the 24 different log orientations and 18 different ways to choose the opening depth for a log proves costly and is not effective for sawmill industry. In order to cut the simulation time we collaborate the TOPSAW and Grid Computing technology to leverage this sawing optimization. In this paper we propose a problem solving environment which makes TOPSAW Grid- enabled. The applicability of this solution is shown by a case study.	computation;grid computing;mathematical optimization;problem solving environment;sawmill;simulation;time complexity;workstation	Ashwin Bommathanahalli;Maoyuan Xie;Zhifeng Yun;Sun Joseph Chang;Zhou Lei;Gabrielle Allen	2007	Second International Multi-Symposiums on Computer and Computational Sciences (IMSCCS 2007)	10.1109/IMSCCS.2007.80	web service;cross-site scripting;ajax;web application security;web development;content security policy;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	HPC	-53.64222414058024	62.689135574262956	173256

Our goal is to minimize the detection and reaction time and automate responses, while involving as many networks as possible along the attack path. The proposed approach relies on building a “community” of trusted partners that will cooperate by exchanging security information so that inclusion in the attack path is detected locally and without traceback procedures. The main building block is the Cooperative anti-DDoS Entity, a modular software system deployed in each participating network domain that supports secure message exchanges and local responses tailored to individual sites' policies. We discuss the operation and the implementation of a prototype, and we provide a survey of the methodologies against DDoS and compare our approach to related work.	cpu cache;denial-of-service attack;emoticon;emulator;entity;experiment;inter-domain;intrusion detection system;kee games;modular programming;multicast;overlay network;privilege escalation;prototype;reliability engineering;single point of failure;software deployment;software system	Georgios Koutepas;Fotis Stamatelopoulos;Basil S.

In this context, the Wi-Fi communication technology has grown to become the de-facto standard for data communications in Smart Home environments, with cordless telephony being dominated by the DECT protocol. Even though both technologies incorporate sets of security features aimed at securing the confidentiality and integrity of the communications, the nature and the design of both radio-frequency protocols make them vulnerable, up to a certain extent, to privacy leakages through traffic analysis attacks. In this paper we explore the information leakage vulnerabilities inherent to these technologies and their potential impact on citizens' privacy in the context of the Smart Home.

2bffb158cf908caef7c97f09734412ae4fe6a493	cross site request forgery on android webview		Android has always been about connectivity and providing great browsing experience. Web-based content can be embedded into the Android application using WebView. It is a User Interface component that displays webpages. It can either display a remote webpage or can also load static HTML data. This encompasses the functionality of a browser that can be integrated to application. WebView provides a number of APIs which enables the applications to interact with the web content inside WebView. In the current paper, Cross site request forgery or XSRF attack specific to android WebView is investigated. In XSRF attack, the trusts of a web application in its authenticated users is exploited by letting the attacker make arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf of a victim user. When the user is logged into the trusted site through the WebView, the site authenticates the WebView and not application. The application can launch attacks on the behalf of user with the APIs of Webview, exploiting user’s credentials resulting in Cross site request forgery. Attacks can also be launched by setting cookies as HTTP headers and making malicious HTTP Request on behalf of victim.	android;authentication;credential;cross-site request forgery;embedded system;html;http cookie;hypertext transfer protocol;list of http header fields;malware;requests;user interface;web application;web content;web page;world wide web	A.

c9435c2d3dbebc22f0aa893543d6c53819c2ade3	exploring user mental models of end-to-end encrypted communication tools		End-to-end (E2E) encrypted communication tools can help users keep their communications secure from government or corporate surveillance. In this work, we conduct a quantitative survey (n=125) to assess general mental models and understandings of a hypothetical E2E encrypted communication tool. We find that the vast majority of respondents had adopted E2E encrypted tools in the real world, but lacked confidence and accuracy in their mental models of E2E encryption. Two key misconceptions include (1) three-quarters of respondents believing that their E2E encrypted communications could be accessed by unauthorized entities, and (2) one-half of respondents feeling that SMS and landline phone calls were more secure than, or as secure as, E2E encrypted communications. These findings raise concerns that respondents may not feel threatened by proposals of “backdoors” since they already feel that different entities can access their communications. More broadly, our findings suggest that the primary user-related challenge for E2E encrypted tools may no longer be adoption, but helping users who already have these tools avoid sending sensitive information over less secure channels.	authorization;backdoor (computing);encryption;entity;information sensitivity;landline;mental model	Ruba Abu-Salma;Elissa M.

Several approaches exist to filter network-level attacks, but application-level attacks are harder to detect at the firewall. Filtering at application level can be computationally expensive and difficult to scale, while still creating bogus positives that block legitimate users. In this paper, authors show application layer DoS attack for SIP server using some open source DoS attack tools and also suggest a mechanism that can protect a given SIP server from application-level DoS attacks especially the attacks targeting the resources including CPU, sockets, memory of the victim server. In this paper author’s attempt to illustrate application layer distributed denial of Service (DDoS) attack on SIP Server such as SIP flooding attack, real time transport (RTP) flooding attack using open source DDoS attack tools. We propose a new DDoS defence mechanism that protects SIP servers from application-level DDoS attacks based on the two methodologies: IPtables and fail2ban detection. The attack flow detection mechanism detects attach flows based on the symptom or stress at the server, since it is getting more difficult to identify bad flows only based on the incoming traffic patterns. A popular software known as Wireshark which is a network protocol analyzer is used to capture the packets during DoS attack from the victim server Ethernet interface to detect the attacking host IP address and analysis the types of attack. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme via experiment.	analysis of algorithms;central processing unit;communications protocol;denial-of-service attack;experiment;firewall (computing);open-source software;server (computing);wireshark;iptables	Muhammad Morshed Alam;Muhammad Yeasir Arafat;Feroz Ahmed	2015	JNW	10.4304/jnw.10.6.344-352	trinoo;session description protocol;user datagram protocol;computer science;invite of death;transmission control protocol;voice over ip;secure shell;session initiation protocol;internet control message protocol;application layer ddos attack;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-60.45613939649065	67.24666797104405	173811

W The survivability of the future Internet is largely dependent on whether it will be able to successfully address both security and performance issues facing the Internet. On one hand, the Internet becomes more and more vulnerable due to fast spreading malicious attacks. On the other hand, it is under great stress to meet ever growing/changing application demands while having to sustain multi-gigabit forwarding performance. In this paper, we propose a Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) coprocessor based solution for high speed, integrated TCP flow anomaly detection and policy filtering. The attacking packets with spoofed source IP addresses are detected through two-dimensional (2D) matching. The key features of the solution are: (1) setting flag bits in TCAM action code to support various packet treatments; (2) managing TCP flow state in pair to do 2D matching. We evaluate the solution’s ability to detect TCP-based flooding attacks based on real-world-trace simulations. The results show that the proposed solution can match up OC-192 line rate. The possible modifications of the solution for the detection of low rate TCP-targeted attacks are also discussed. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, Churn and Free-Riding become great challenges to these systems. This paper proposes a reputation management system based on sustained online duration (SOD-based system) to optimize the resources utilization in file-sharing P2P systems. In the SOD-based system, peers can enhance their reputation by increasing the duration of online time. Our scheme limits the number of times a peer provides services and introduces the bad rating records to prevent some malicious behaviors. The simulation and analysis show that SOD-based system increases the number of downloads, reduces Churn, and solves the problems of Cold-Start and Matthew Effect. Some malicious attacks, such as Sybil and Collusion, can not have bad effects on this system.	file sharing;malware;peer-to-peer;reputation management;reputation system;simulation	Wen Ji;Shoubao Yang;Fuli Liu	2008	2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering	10.1109/CSSE.2008.507	in situ resource utilization;von neumann stability analysis;computer science;information security;management system;internet privacy;free riding;management;computational model;world wide web;computer security;file sharing	DB	-59.52601985076547	73.03536502576937	173878

Current countermeasures to denial of service (DoS) attacks rely on the perimeter model of network security. However, as the case study and analysis in this paper make apparent, the perimeter model, which relies on firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems, is unable to provide an effective defence against DoS attacks. Therefore, there is a need for a new approach; one that identifies an attack beyond the perimeter. Within this paper, we present such an approach. We achieve early detection of DoS attacks by the identification of traffic signatures which indicate that an attack is underway. As these signatures can be identified 'outside' the perimeter, appropriate measures can be taken to prevent the attack from succeeding. We use examples of DoS attacks and a case study to demonstrate the applicability of our approach.	antivirus software;denial-of-service attack;firewall (computing);network security;perimeter;type signature	John Haggerty;Qi Shi;Madjid Merabti	2002		10.1109/CSAC.2002.1176313	computer security model;intrusion detection system;attack;covert channel;asset;computer science;network security;security service;internet privacy;network access control;network security policy;computer security;denial-of-service attack;intrusion prevention system;computer network	Security	-59.2376988452181	66.18924349244924	173991

Companies such as FON have been successful in attracting large communities of users. However, solutions such as FON either require users to buy specialized FON routers or firmware modifications to existing routers. In this paper we propose a solution which requires no such sophisticated hardware. An alternative is to provide a solution which requires users to download a client software on to their PCs. While the solution appears simple it raises several issues of incentivizing users to share their bandwidth and also issues of preventing users from cheating behaviors which give them an unfair advantage. In this paper, we propose a system and solution which (i) requires only software downloads on PCs, (ii) is robust to tampering of the software, and intermittent monitoring of an access point by the owner, (iii) a credit based mechanism whereby users earn credits for sharing bandwidth and punishment and pricing mechanism whereby users are charged at a higher price whenever they are caught misbehaving. By making simple but plausible assumptions about user behavior, we show via analysis and extensive simulations that the system converges to a Pareto Optimal Nash equilibrium. We further validate our system model, by running trace driven simulations on real world data. We believe that the solution provided by Wi-Sh is an attractive and more credible alternative to solutions such as FON.	client (computing);download;firmware;nash equilibrium;optical fiber;pareto efficiency;robustness (computer science);simulation;wireless access point	Xin Ai;Vikram Srinivasan;Chen-Khong Tham	2009	IEEE INFOCOM 2009	10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062082	pricing;client;pareto analysis;systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;microcode;computer security;bandwidth;nash equilibrium;wireless;server;robustness;computer network	Mobile	-55.09795078879793	70.73559215543618	174001
35ad6e39ff9b5a51936e0b0dce062000c1d5cfd1	improving cyber-security via profitable insurance markets		Recent work in security has illustrated that solutions aimed at detection and elimination of security threats alone are unlikely to result in a robust cyberspace. As an orthogonal approach to mitigating security problems, some researchers have pursued the use of cyber-insurance as a suitable risk management technique. In this regard, a recent work by the authors in [1] have proposed efficient monopoly cyberinsurance markets that maximize social welfare of users in a communication network via premium discriminating them. However, the work has a major drawback in the insurer not being able to make strictly positive profit in expectation, which in turn might lead to unsuccessful insurance markets. In this paper, we provide a method (based on the model in [1]) to overcome this drawback for the risk-averse premium discriminating monopoly cyber-insurer, and prove it in theory. More specifically, we propose a non-regulatory mechanism to allow monopoly cyber-insurers to make strictly positive profit in expectation. To investigate the general effectiveness of our mechanism beyond a monopoly setting with full coverage, we conduct numerical experiments (comparing social welfare at market equilibrium) on (a) practical Internet-scale network topologies that are formed by users who are free to decide for themselves whether they want to purchase insurance or not, (b) settings of perfect and imperfect market competition, and (c) scenarios with partial insurance coverage.	cyber-insurance;cyberspace;emoticon;experiment;monopoly;network topology;numerical analysis;risk aversion;risk management;telecommunications network	Ranjan Pal;Leana Golubchik;Konstantinos Psounis;Pan Hui	2018	SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review	10.1145/3273996.3273999	telecommunications network;cyberspace;risk management;drawback;network topology;monopoly;social welfare;computer security;cyber-insurance;computer science	AI	-61.70234512604337	72.86737651413908	174280
46c0d7f8ed25176a46009e69878c6e8cd96a326c	data mining for detecting bitcoin ponzi schemes		Soon after its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has been adopted by cyber-criminals, which rely on its pseudonymity to implement virtually untraceable scams. One of the typical scams that operate on Bitcoin are the so-called Ponzi schemes. These are fraudulent investments which repay users with the funds invested by new users that join the scheme, and implode when it is no longer possible to find new investments. Despite being illegal in many countries, Ponzi schemes are now proliferating on Bitcoin, and they keep alluring new victims, who are plundered of millions of dollars. We apply data mining techniques to detect Bitcoin addresses related to Ponzi schemes. Our starting point is a dataset of features of real-world Ponzi schemes, that we construct by analysing, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the transactions used to perform the scams. We use this dataset to experiment with various machine learning algorithms, and we assess their effectiveness through standard validation protocols and performance metrics. The best of the classifiers we have experimented can identify most of the Ponzi schemes in the dataset, with a low number of false positives.	algorithm;bitcoin;data mining;machine learning;pseudonymity	Massimo Bartoletti;Barbara Pes;Sergio Serusi	2018	2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)	10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00014	computer security;data mining;feature extraction;blockchain;pseudonymity;computer science	Security	-58.71320339210193	61.56543747327336	174363

Traditional mapping approaches have become increasingly inaccurate because many applications use nondefault or ephemeral port numbers, use well-known port numbers associated with other applications, change application signatures or use traffic encryption. In this paper we will demonstrate that multiscale traffic analysis based on multi-order wavelet spectrum can be used as a discriminator of Internet applications traffic profiles. By performing clustering analysis over the multiscale wavelet spectrum coefficients that are inferred from the measured traffic, the proposed methodology is able to efficiently differentiate different IP applications without using any payload information. This characteristic will allow the differentiation of traffic flows in unencrypted and encrypted scenarios. In order to compare the differentiating potential of different traffic application data, upload, download and joint upload and download flow statistics are considered to evaluate the identification approach for each selected protocol. Moreover, we also evaluate which timescales and spectrum orders are more relevant for the traffic differentiation. From the analysis of the obtained results we can conclude that the proposed methodology is able to achieve good identification results using a E. Rocha ( ) · P. Salvador · A.

In this paper we will concentrate on “cyber fraudsters”. At the time of this writing, a prime hunting ground for fraudsters is online banking. Millions of people worldwide use online banking to quickly and conveniently do their regular bank-related transactions. Unfortunately, this convenience comes at a price. By doing their banking online, they are vulnerable to falling prey to fraud scams such as SIM swap fraud. This paper explains what SIM swap fraud is and how it works. We will analyze the online banking payment transaction process to discover what vulnerabilities fraudsters exploit via SIM swap fraud, and then introduce a computer-based security system which has been developed to help combat it.	authorization;biometrics;certificate authority;click fraud;credit card fraud;cybercrime;cyberspace;electronic funds transfer;high- and low-level;internet;malware;mobile phone;online banking;paging;prey;sim lock;security question;telephone number;visual intercept	Louis Jordaan;Sebastiaan H. von Solms	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-19228-9_7	business;internet privacy;computer security;commerce	Security	-55.653699694981405	63.37296959648198	174529

Such algorithms usually require training using good-quality and quantitatively significant datasets, which are rarely publicly available. To this end, in this paper we describe a novel experimental framework, that we call the Mouseworld, that combines NFV and SDN to create an environment able to (1) blend and transmit real and synthetic traffic and (2) collect and label this traffic in order to be utilised for training and validating ML algorithms that will be applied to the detection of cybersecurity threats. The Mouseworld framework includes a set of traffic generation, collection and labelling modules, jointly with analytics and algorithm training and visualization components. The OSM open-source network orchestrator is utilized to control and manage the framework and to deploy the training and validation scenarios. We present a preliminary result on the area of Security threat detection as a demonstration of the framework viability.	algorithm;computer security;machine learning;network function virtualization;open-source software;openstreetmap;software-defined networking;synthetic data;threat (computer);traffic analysis	Antonio Pastor;Alberto Mozo;Diego R.

The obstacles to using machine learning are many: attack patterns change over time as attackers change their behavior (sometimes automatically), and application security systems are deployed in a highly resource-constrained environments, meaning that an accurate but time-consuming machine learning cannot be deployed.

While it is tempting to abandon electronic voting altogether, we show how a careful application of distributed systems and cryptographic techniques can yield voting systems that surpass current systems and their analog forebears in trustworthiness and usability. We have developed the VoteBox, a complete electronic voting system that combines several recent e-voting research results into a coherent whole that can provide strong end-to-end security guarantees to voters. VoteBox machines are locally networked and all critical election events are broadcast and recorded by every machine on the network. VoteBox network data, including encrypted votes, can be safely relayed to the outside world in real time, allowing independent observers with personal computers to validate the system as it is running. We also allow any voter to challenge a VoteBox, while the election is ongoing, to produce proof that ballots are cast as intended. The VoteBox design offers a number of pragmatic benefits that can help reduce the frequency and impact of poll worker or voter errors.	accessibility;audio feedback;capability maturity model;coherence (physics);cryptography;display device;distributed computing;encryption;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;formal verification;graphics;human factors and ergonomics;input device;malware;non-interactive zero-knowledge proof;personal computer;programming complexity;systems design;table (information);trust (emotion);trusted system;usability;visual basic;voter model;web worker	Daniel Sandler;Kyle Derr;Dan S.

Currently a single app can be created and executed on multiple target platforms. In this scenario, different programming languages such as HTML5 and JavaScript, and operational systems like Tizen and webOS promises easy multi-platform development. However, one of the biggest concerns from companies that develop applications to these IoT devices is the leakage or exposure of sensitive data. In this work we are addressing this problem by creating a modified version of Tizen, called TTizen, that modifies the Tizen Web Runtime to add dynamic taint tracking, with that we can track sensitive information that is being leaked, even if the information is obfuscated, and warn the users. From our knowledge this is the first prototype that adds this kind of technique to Tizen and tracks web applications in mobile devices. The results show that TTizen is a promising approach that can be improved and used to detect data leakage in IoT devices.	html5;information sensitivity;internet of things;javascript;mobile device;operational system;programming language;prototype;smart tv;smartphone;smartwatch;software developer;spectral leakage;symbian;tablet computer;taint checking;tizen;web application;webos	Thiago S.

To this end, the traffic communication must be authenticated to guarantee trustworthiness for guiding drivers and establishing liability in case of traffic accident investigation. Cryptographic authentication techniques have been extensively exploited to secure VANETs. Applying cryptographic authentication techniques such as digital signatures raises challenges to efficiently store signatures on messages growing with time. To alleviate the conflict between traffic liability investigation and limited storage capacity in vehicles, this paper proposes to aggregate signatures in VANETs. Our proposal can preserve privacy for honest vehicles and trace misbehaving ones, and provides a practical balance between security and privacy in VANETs. With our proposal, cryptographic witnesses of safety-related traffic messages can be significantly compressed so that they can be stored for a long period for liability investigation. Our proposal allows a large number of traffic messages to be verified as if they were a single one, which speeds up the response of vehicles to traffic reports.	accident analysis;aggregate data;antivirus software;authentication;authentication protocol;cryptography;data compression;digital signature;hoc (programming language);privacy;public key infrastructure;trust (emotion);type signature	Bo Qin;Qianhong Wu;Lei Zhang;Josep Domingo-Ferrer	2010	2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications	10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645013	vehicular ad hoc network;digital signature;information privacy;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.636262642337584	74.50574228732923	175584
ffd4a90cd3ac877e6d0ea65aed5a7c29e338067d	hail to the thief: protecting data from mobile ransomware with ransomsafedroid		The growing popularity of Android and the increasing amount of sensitive data stored in mobile devices have lead to the dissemination of Android ransomware. Ransomware is a class of malware that makes data inaccessible by blocking access to the device or, more frequently, by encrypting the data; to recover the data, the user has to pay a ransom to the attacker. A solution for this problem is to backup the data. Although backup tools are available for Android, these tools may be compromised or blocked by the ransomware itself. This paper presents the design and implementation of RANSOMSAFEDROID, a TrustZone based backup service for mobile devices. RANSOMSAFEDROID is protected from malware by leveraging the ARM TrustZone extension and running in the secure world. It does backup of files periodically to a secure local persistent partition and pushes these backups to external storage to protect them from ransomware. Initially, RANSOMSAFEDROID does a full backup of the device filesystem, then it does incremental backups that save the changes since the last backup.

Recent approaches aiming to solve this problem rely on the TLS protocol to additionally provide integrity information of the involved endpoints. However, these solutions have shortcomings with regard to either security, functionality or compliance to the TLS specification. This prevents that those approaches are deployed in practice. In this paper, we present an implementation of a security architecture for establishing Trusted Channels based on OpenSSL that resolves the deficiencies of the previous solutions. It provides the possibility to convey reliable integrity information of the involved endpoints and offers the high security standards of former approaches while being flexible, scalable and efficient to enable widespread deployment.	computer security;ipsec;openssl;scalability;software deployment;transport layer security	Frederik Armknecht;Yacine Gasmi;Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi;Patrick Stewin;Martin Unger;Gianluca Ramunno;Davide Vernizzi	2008		10.1145/1456455.1456462	internet protocol;computer security model;cloud computing security;direct anonymous attestation;security through obscurity;covert channel;computer science;internet security;security service;internet privacy;transport layer security;security testing;trustworthy computing;computer security;enterprise information security architecture;computer network	Security	-55.047899437898685	69.91721388695764	175724
e102f603fd91bbd779568f0165f99ea95d26488d	a case study of user-level spam filtering	macquarie university institutional repository;training email filters;researchonline;digital repository;macquarie university;content filtering;user level spam filtering;spam bayes;email spam control;false negatives	There are number of Anti-Spam filters that have reduced the amount of email spam in the inbox but the problem still continues as the spammers circumvent these techniques. The problems need to be addressed from different aspects. Major problem for instance arises when these anti-spam techniques misjudge or misclassify legitimate emails as spam (false positive); or fail to deliver or block spam on the SMTP server (false negative); thus causing a staggering cost in loss of time, effort and finance. Though false positive are very harmful loss of important information for the user, false negatives defeat the purpose of the spam filtering. This paper makes an effort in proposing another aspect to address this problem. It discusses some of these anti-spam techniques, especially the filtering technological endorsements designed to prevent spam to entrench their capability enhancements, as well as analytical recommendations that will be subject to further research. Apart from applying anti-spam techniques, training of Spam control tool with relevant user preferences can reduce the chances of false positives, false negatives and spam email that land in the inbox. We identify the need for training the filter with domain specific data. This paper shows the decline in false negatives via results of a case study on training the Spam Bayes tool with carefully collected domain specific user preferred dataset for over a period of 12 months. 1	anti-spam techniques;inbox by gmail;server (computing);spamming;user (computing)	Kamini Bajaj;Josef Pieprzyk	2014			forum spam;digital library;computer science;spambot;spam and open relay blocking system;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-56.83730613712619	61.78371563127908	175726

Therefore, in the IEEE 802.16 standard a security sublayer is specified in the MAC layer to address the privacy issues across the fixed Broadband Wireless Access (BWA). Several articles have been published to address the flaws in IEEE 802.16 security after the IEEE standard 802.16-2001 was released. However, the IEEE standard 802.16-2004 revision does not settle all the discovered problems and additional flaws remain. This paper gives an overview of the IEEE 802.16 standard, focusing on the MAC layer and especially the security sublayer. We analyze the security flaws in the standard as well as in related works, and illustrate possible attacks to the authentication and key management protocols. Possible solutions are also proposed to prevent these attacks. Finally, we propose a security handover protocol that should be supported in the future 802.16e for mobility.	authentication;key management;list of sequence alignment software;privacy;wireless access point	Sen Xu;Manton M.

Because of this, it has become a common exploit target and several HTTP specific IDSs have been proposed as a response. However, each IDS is developed and tested independently, and direct comparisons are difficult. We describe a framework for testing IDS algorithms, and apply it to several proposed anomaly detection algorithms, testing using identical data and test environment. The results show serious limitations in all approaches, and we make predictions about requirements for successful anomaly detection approaches used to protect web servers.	anomaly detection;hypertext transfer protocol	Kenneth L.

A stack of three protocols secures the communication between trains and trackside equipment; encrypted radio communication is provided by the GSM-R protocol, on top of this the EuroRadio protocol provides authentication for a train control application-level protocol. We present an attack which exploits weaknesses in all three protocols: GSM-R has the same well known weaknesses as the GSM protocol, and we present a new collision attack against the EuroRadio protocol. Combined with design weaknesses in the application-level protocol, these vulnerabilities allow an attacker, who observes a MAC collision, to forge train control messages. We demonstrate this attack with a proof of concept using train control messages we have generated ourselves. Currently, ERTMS is only used to send small amounts of data for short sessions, therefore this attack does not present an immediate danger. However, if EuroRadio was to be used to transfer larger amounts of data trains would become vulnerable to this attack. Additionally, we calculate that, under reasonable assumptions, an attacker who could monitor all backend control centres in a country the size of the UK for 45 days would have a 1% chance of being able to take control of a train.	collision attack;communications protocol;cryptanalysis;cryptography;encryption;forge;management system;message authentication code	Tom Chothia;Mihai Ordean;Joeri de Ruiter;Richard J.

71a1fed654e1de9857d8b0d1c78c4024e60457bc	the untold secrets of operational wi-fi calling services: vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures		Since 2016, all of four major U.S. operators have rolled out nationwide Wi-Fi calling services. They are projected to surpass VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and other VoIP services in terms of mobile IP voice usage minutes in 2018. They enable mobile users to place cellular calls over Wi-Fi networks based on the 3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) technology. Compared with conventional cellular voice solutions, the major difference lies in that their traffic traverses untrustful Wi-Fi networks and the Internet. This exposure to insecure networks may cause the Wi-Fi calling users to suffer from security threats. Its security mechanisms are similar to the VoLTE, because both of them are supported by the IMS. They include SIM-based security, 3GPP AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement), IPSec (Internet Protocol Security), etc. However, are they sufficient to secure Wi-Fi calling services? Unfortunately, our study yields a negative answer. We conduct the first study of exploring security issues of the operational Wi-Fi calling services in three major U.S. operators’ networks using commodity devices. We disclose that current Wi-Fi calling security is not bullet-proof and uncover four vulnerabilities which stem from improper standard designs, device implementation issues and network operation slips. By exploiting the vulnerabilities, together with several state-of-the-art computer visual recognition technologies, we devise two proof-of-concept attacks: user privacy leakage and telephony harassment or denial of voice service (THDoS); both of them can bypass the security defenses deployed on mobile devices and the network infrastructure. We have confirmed their feasibility and simplicity using real-world experiments, as well as assessed their potential damages and proposed recommended solutions.	authentication and key agreement (protocol);compaq lte;countermeasure (computer);denial-of-service attack;experiment;ip multimedia subsystem;ipsec;internet;mobile ip;mobile device;spectral leakage	Tian Xie;Guan-Hua Tu;B.

P2P streaming system is vulnerable to DDoS attacks due to its high bandwidth demand and strict time requirement. In this paper, we propose a distributed framework to defense DDoS attack based on Credit Model(CM) which takes the responsibility to identify malicious nodes and categorize nodes into different credit level. We also introduce a Message Rate Controlling Model (MRCM)to control the message rate of a node according to its credit level. Combining CM and MRCS together, our framework can improve the resistibility against DDoS for P2P streaming system.	denial-of-service attack	Jun Yang;Ying Li;Benxiong Huang;Jiuqiang Ming	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69295-9_3	trinoo;computer science;internet privacy;application layer ddos attack;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Crypto	-58.89026706263896	69.52977025144735	176593

However, most researches work on measuring, analyzing and modeling of Private Trackers towards to Internet or networks. Few work aims at utilizing the PTs model to real life. In this paper, we abstract the idea of PTs model to a universal trade exchange mechanism creatively, and apply it to real-world cases. This is not only beneficial for the system in this work, but also can be widely used in other areas similar to trade exchange. We propose a novel management system of equipment sharing platform based on PTs model in this paper.

This fact has generated a new storm of network attacks that every day generates a non negligible amount of network traffic. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) aim at preventing the delivery of malicious traffic to targeted systems thus preventing damage at the end point of the attack, however they are positioned either on a single host or on very peripheral routers, thus they do not provide any help in reducing the amount of malicious traffic roaming the network. The sheer amount of traffic to be analyzed prevents any attempt to move intrusion detection to core routers, however Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) may provide a solution. In past works DIDS have been envisioned as cooperative clusters of traditional IDS, in this paper we present two novel methodologies that could allow distributing the computational load of intrusion detection on several nodes and a simulation tool that allows us to evaluate the impact of these methodologies on the nodes involved.	intrusion detection system;malware;network traffic control;peripheral;router (computing);simulation	Mauro Migliardi;Valentina Resaz	2009	2009 Third International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies	10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.14	anomaly-based intrusion detection system;intrusion detection system;host-based intrusion detection system;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;intrusion prevention system;computer network	Security	-58.32989626366683	67.93178554172027	176879

This kind of attacks is normally targeted at a particular service provider to exhaust the network and system resources of the provider. Since the scale of the attack is limited, the ISP operators normally cannot observe this type of attacks. As a result, the victim of the attack is left to deal with the attack on its own accord. This paper proposes a SOA approach to build a system against DDoS attacks targeting online businesses. The system is built on Web services. It can be constructed and reconfigured easily by an attack victim. Experiments were also carried out to measure the overheads and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	denial-of-service attack;experiment;normal mode;response time (technology);service-oriented architecture;web service	Xinfeng Ye;Santokh Singh	2007	IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2007)	10.1109/ICWS.2007.23	web service;pre-play attack;computer science;internet privacy;application layer ddos attack;law;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	SE	-57.430152472669015	65.57595905392384	176882

If a medical image is illegally obtained or if its content is malevolently changed, the patient's privacy or health care to be provided will certainly be undermined. To solve this problem, this study proposes a steganographic method for mammograms, which hides patients' information in mammograms without changing their important details. In particular, the proposed method can extract the hidden information from stego-mammograms without the aid of the original images. This study also utilizes a watermarking technique, which masks the contents of the mammogram, for providing mammograms protection against illegal access and malevolent modifications. This watermark can be removed to reveal the masked mammogram when authorization for viewing is given.	authorization;database;digital watermarking;picture archiving and communication system;privacy;steganography	Yue Li;Chang-Tsun Li;Chia-Hung Wei	2007	Third International Symposium on Information Assurance and Security	10.1109/IAS.2007.62	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Arch	-53.78872954543143	74.10890206639203	177146

Meanwhile in these environments, it is very difficult to identify the adversaries. In this paper, we present a scheme that is designed to defend against potential attacks at a very early stage, in order to minimize the damage to the victims and the entire network. Instead of taking actions only after the attacks arrive at the host, our scheme makes the access point the one who monitors, identifies and prevents potential attacks. In this active protection way, the system can respond more quickly and can also prevent much of the malicious network traffic.	network traffic control;wireless access point	Ming Lei;Yang Xiao;Susan V.

It is battery powered, transmits in the infra-red spectrum and is approximately 60X60X8 millimetres. The transmissions take place every 15 seconds and identify the badge. Receivers are linked by wire to a computer and are placed so as to define cells for the coverage req ui red. Normally they correspond to spaces occupied by one or a number of people. The badge has a light-dependent resistor used to reduce power consumption by decreasing the frequency of transmissions when in the dark. This also means that the user can switch the badge off by placing it in a pocket or face down on the table. Not all badge transmissions are picked up by a receiver, but by using simple algorithms in the receiving software the system can be made sufficiently accurate to be very usef u 1. As well as transmitting the Active Badge can receive which makes possible a more secure system by using a one-way authentication function. Two buttons, two visible LEDs and a tone generator are available for simple interactions. Reciprocity of use is ensured by making badge information available to all computer screens in the organisation.	algorithm;authentication;hopper;interaction;one-way function;transmitter	Andy Hopper;Andy Harter;Tom Blackie	1993		10.1145/169059.169535	computer science;heuristics;data mining;database;programming language		-53.05636921879924	68.89690432971558	177787

There is a growing literature on ways to detect that an interactive connection into a site and another outbound from the site give evidence of such a “stepping stone.” This has been done based on monitoring the access link connecting the site to the Internet (Eg. [7, 11, 8]). The earliest work was based on connection content comparisons but more recent work has relied on timing information in order to compare encrypted connections. Past work on this problem has not yet attempted to cope with the ways in which intruders might attempt to modify their traffic to defeat stepping stone detection. In this paper we give the first consideration to constraining such intruder evasion. We present some unexpected results that show there are theoretical limits on the ability of attackers to disguise their traffic in this way for sufficiently long connections. We consider evasions that consist of local jittering of packet arrival times (without addition and subtraction of packets), and also the addition of superfluous packets which will be removed later in the connection chain (chaff). To counter such evasion, we assume that the intruder has a “maximum delay tolerance.” By using wavelets and similar multiscale methods, we show that we can separate the shortterm behavior of the streams – where the jittering or chaff indeed masks the correlation – from the long-term behavior of the streams – where the correlation remains. It therefore appears, at least in principle, that there is an effective countermeasure to this particular evasion tactic, at least for sufficiently long-lived interactive connections.	call stack;crazy stone (software);encryption;evasion (network security);network packet;pursuit-evasion;relay;sensor;stepping level;wavelet	David L.

Recent trend of deploying middleboxes in cloud as virtualized services further expands potential benefits of middleboxes while avoiding local maintenance burdens. Despite promising, designing outsourced middleboxes still faces several security challenges. First, many middlebox processing services, like intrusion detection, require packet payload inspection, while the ever-increasing adoption of HTTPS limits the function due to the end-to-end encryption. Second, many packet inspection rules used by middleboxes can be proprietary in nature. They may contain sensitive information of enterprises, and thus need strong protection when configuring middleboxes in untrusted outsourced environments. In this paper, we propose a practical system architecture for outsourced middleboxes to perform deep packet inspection over encrypted traffic, without revealing either packet payloads or inspection rules. Our first design is an encrypted high-performance rule filter that takes randomized tokens from packet payloads for encrypted inspection. We then elaborate through carefully tailored techniques how to comprehensively support open-source real rulesets. We formally analyze the security strength. Implementations at Amazon Cloud show that our system introduces roughly 100 millisecond latency in each connection initialization, with individual processing throughput over 3500 packets/second for 500 concurrent connections.	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);amazon web services;deep packet inspection;end-to-end encryption;https;information sensitivity;intrusion detection system;middlebox;network packet;open-source software;parsing;randomized algorithm;regular expression;string searching algorithm;systems architecture;throughput	Xingliang Yuan;Xinyu Wang;Jianxiong Lin;Xinyu Wang	2016	IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524526	deep content inspection;telecommunications;operating system;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Networks	-57.80429556842257	66.04628421423767	177987

Each packet that goes through this entry point is checked by the firewall to determine whether to accept or discard the packet. The firewall makes this determination based on a specified sequence of overlapping rules. The firewall uses the first-match criterion to determine which rule in the sequence should be applied to which packet. Thus, to compute the set of packets to which a rule is applied, the firewall designer needs to consider all the rules that precede this rule in the sequence. This “rule dependency” complicates the task of designing firewalls (especially those with thousands of rules), and makes firewalls hard to understand. In this paper, we present a metric, called the dependency metric, for measuring the complexity of firewalls. This metric, though accurate, does not seem to suggest ways to design firewalls whose dependency metrics are small. Thus, we present another metric, called the inversion metric, and develop methods for designing firewalls with small inversion metrics. We show that the dependency metric and the inversion metric are correlated for some classes of firewalls. So by aiming to design firewalls with small inversion metrics, the designer may end up with firewalls whose dependency metrics are small as well. We present a method for designing modular firewalls whose inversion metrics are very small. Each modular firewall consists of several components, called firewall modules. The inversion metric of each firewall module is very small - in fact, 1 or 2. Thus, we conclude that modular firewalls are easy to design and easy to understand.	entry point;firewall (computing);internet;network packet;pf (firewall)	Hrishikesh B.

Antivirus software can help protect a user against these threats. There are numerous vendors users can choose from for their antivirus protection, each with their own set of virus definitions and various resources that are capable of recognizing new threats. However, there is no established system or process to measure and display data on the performance of antivirus vendors to new malware over an ongoing time period in real time. Such a mechanism would better inform end users of their security options in addition to informing organizations of prevalent threats occurring in networks. In this paper, we propose a cloud sourced malware reporting system that uses distributed agents to assess the performance of antivirus software based on malware signatures.	antivirus software;confidentiality;malware;software agent;threat (computer)	Kellie E.

A novel graphical password strategy Yet Another Graphical Password (YAGP) inspired by DAS is proposed in this paper.

NeSSi incorporates a variety of features relevant to network security distinguishing it from general-purpose network simulators. Its capabilities such as profilebased automated attack generation, traffic analysis and interface support for the plug-in of detection algorithms allow it to be used for security research and evaluation purposes. NeSSi has been utilized for testing intrusion detection algorithms, conducting network security analysis, and developing distributed security frameworks at the application level. NeSSi is built upon the agent componentware framework JIAC [5], resulting in a distributed and easy-toextend architecture. In this paper, we provide an overview of the NeSSi architecture and briefly demonstrate its usage in three example security research projects. These projects comprise of evaluation of stand-alone detection unit performance, detection device deployment at central nodes in the network and comparison of different detection algorithms.	algorithm;general-purpose markup language;intrusion detection system;network security;plug-in (computing);simulation;software deployment;traffic analysis	Rainer Bye;Stephan Schmidt;Katja Luther;Sahin Albayrak	2008		10.1145/1416222.1416260	computer security model;simulation;computer science;operating system;security service;network simulation;distributed computing;network access control;computer security;computer network	Security	-62.38093380650653	64.58339409713611	178715

Also, 6LoWPAN devices are mostly deployed in unattended environments, hence easy to capture and clone. Despite that state of the art crypto solutions provide information security, IPv6 enabled smart objects are vulnerable to attacks from outside and inside 6LoWPAN networks that are aimed to disrupt networks. This paper attempts to identify intrusions aimed to disrupt the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL).In order to improve the security within 6LoWPAN networks, we extend SVELTE, an intrusion detection system for the Internet of Things, with an intrusion detection module that uses the ETX (Expected Transmissions) metric. In RPL, ETX is a link reliability metric and monitoring the ETX value can prevent an intruder from actively engaging 6LoWPAN nodes in malicious activities. We also propose geographic hints to identify malicious nodes that conduct attacks against ETX-based networks. We implement these extensions in the Contiki OS and evaluate them using the Cooja simulator.	contiki;etx (form factor);information security;internet of things;intrusion detection system;lossy compression;low-power broadcasting;malware;operating system;routing;smart objects	Dharmini Shreenivas;Shahid Raza;Thiemo Voigt	2017		10.1145/3055245.3055252	engineering;internet privacy;computer security;intrusion prevention system;computer network	Security	-52.574171007043795	73.65209463765329	178774

They are customized to pass anti-spam filters and ask the person to click or to open the joined dangerous attachment. Current filters are very inefficient against spear phishing emails. It is proposed to improve the existing filters by taking advantage of user own analysis and feedback to detect all kinds of phishing emails. The method rests upon an interface displaying different warnings to receivers. Analysis shows that users trust their first impression and are often lead to ignore warnings flagged by proposed new interactive system.	anti-spam techniques;attachments;email filtering;interactivity;phishing;spamming	P.-Y.

To prevent someone's identity from being misused, they need to be protected by one of the most reliable sources of the user authentication process. This paper proposes an approach for achieving security using a novel technique for personal authentication to protect them from intruders. Here, the biometric feature used for authentication is the retinal vessel tree. The structure of the retinal vessels is unique for each individual, it is very difficult to tamper with and it remains same throughout the life time of a human being. Using these natural characteristics of human retina, this paper shows a way of extraction and calculation of one of the most crucial features of retina, i.e., bifurcation angle to prepare an e-passport which would be able to identify each person in this world uniquely. In this way the chances of theft of the passport will be reduced at the lowest level of the system. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using the experimental observation. Among many retinal features, the distinct bifurcation points have been generated and the angles are calculated of the same bifurcation point. The simplicity and efficiency of the proposed method makes it readily to be applied alone or incorporated with other existing security methods.	authentication;bifurcation theory;biometric passport;biometrics;microsoft account	Nilanjana Dutta Roy;Arindam Biswas	2015	2015 Eighth International Conference on Advances in Pattern Recognition (ICAPR)	10.1109/ICAPR.2015.7050709	computer vision;geography;internet privacy;computer security	Vision	-51.11931836933128	66.6354971060472	179301

As DDoS streams do not have common characteristics, currently available intrusion detection systems (IDS) cannot detect them accurately. As a result, defend DDoS attacks based on current available IDS will dramatically affect legitimate traffic. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach to defend against distributed denial of service attacks by coordinating across the Internet. Unlike traditional IDS, we detect and stop DDoS attacks within the intermediate network. In the proposed approach, DDoS defence systems are deployed in the network to detect DDoS attacks independently. A gossip based communication mechanism is used to exchange information about network attacks between these independent detection nodes to aggregate information about the overall network attacks observed. Using the aggregated information, the individual defence nodes have approximate information about global network attacks and can stop them more effectively and accurately. To provide reliable, rapid and widespread dissemination of attack information, the system is built as a peer to peer overlay network on top of the internet.

One line of evasion is the development of techniques that leverage the possibility that the TCP state maintained on the GFW may not represent the state at end-hosts. In this paper we undertake, arguably, the most extensive measurement study on TCP-level GFW evasion techniques, with several vantage points within and outside China, and with clients subscribed to multiple ISPs. We find that the state-of-the art evasion techniques are no longer very effective on the GFW. Our study further reveals that the primary reason that causes these failures is the evolution of GFW over time. In addition, other factors such as the presence of middleboxes on the route from the client to the server also contribute to previously unexpected behaviors.  Our measurement study leads us to new understandings of the GFW and new evasion techniques. Evaluations of our new evasion strategies show that our new techniques provide much higher success rates of (compared to prior schemes) ≈ 90% or higher. Our results further validate our new understandings of the GFW's evolved behaviors. We also develop a measurement-driven tool INTANG, that systematically looks for and finds the best strategy that works with a server and network path. Our measurements show that INTANG can yield near perfect evasion rates and is extremely effective in aiding various protocols such as HTTP, DNS over TCP, and Tor in evading the GFW.	client–server model;converge;emoticon;evasion (network security);hypertext transfer protocol;middlebox;pursuit-evasion;server (computing);state (computer science);stateful firewall;tor messenger	Zhongjie Wang;Yue Cao;Zhiyun Qian;Chengyu Song;Srikanth V.

How to mitigate the influence of the unfair ratings remains an important issue in online rating systems.

In this paper, we proposed a feature-based identification method which can automatically identify the authenticity of online authorship or article according to their unique writing style. This technique is a hypothesis testing based method that creates a function words feature set specially tailored towards Chinese online messages. To evaluate the effectiveness of this automatic recognition method, we conducted several experiments on datasets extracted from a Chinese forum web, and statistically analyzed the content of registered uses' post and reply messages.

In contrast to this binary decision we suggest to use traffic shaping whereas the bandwidth limit is defined by the probability of a source to be a legal user. As a proof of concept, we implemented a simple high performance Linux kernel module nf-HiShape which is able to shape thousands of source IP addresses at different bandwidth limits even under high packet rates. Our shaping algorithm is comparable to Random Early Detection (RED) applied on every single source IP range. The evaluation shows, that our kernel module can handle up to 50,000 IP ranges at nearly constant throughput whereas Linux tc already decreases throughput at about 200 ranges.	algorithm;ddos mitigation;denial-of-service attack;ipv4 subnetting reference;linux;loadable kernel module;network packet;random early detection;throughput;traffic shaping	Markus Goldstein;Matthias Reif;Armin Stahl;Thomas M.

26a3c709974cd405b5bd64b733a8a62efe708a28	from very weak to very strong: analyzing password-strength meters		Millions of users are exposed to password-strength meters/checkers at highly popular web services that use userchosen passwords for authentication. Recent studies have found evidence that some meters actually guide users to choose better passwords—which is a rare bit of good news in password research. However, these meters are mostly based on ad-hoc design. At least, as we found, most vendors do not provide any explanation of their design choices, sometimes making them appear to be a black box. We analyze password meters deployed in selected popular websites, by measuring the strength labels assigned to common passwords from several password dictionaries. From this empirical analysis with millions of passwords, we report prominent characteristics of meters as deployed at popular websites. We shed light on how the server-end of some meters functions, provide examples of highly inconsistent strength outcomes for the same password in different meters, along with examples of many weak passwords being labeled as strong or even very strong. These weaknesses and inconsistencies may confuse users in choosing a stronger password, and thus may weaken the purpose of these meters. On the other hand, we believe these findings may help improve existing meters, and possibly make them an effective tool in the long run.	anytime algorithm;authentication;black box;coherence (physics);dictionary;feedback;hoc (programming language);password strength;server (computing);web service	Xavier de Carné de Carnavalet;Mohammad Mannan	2014			cognitive password;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-55.222233001923215	62.52828377177532	179969

Although call filtering addresses all kinds of attacks, we focus here on SPIT. Filtered messages that are part of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or that attempt to exploit device vulnerabilities are much less problematic, and legal scholars agree that service providers have the right to defend against them.	denial-of-service attack	Christoph Sorge;Saverio Niccolini;Jan Seedorf	2010	IEEE Security & Privacy	10.1109/MSP.2010.54	computer science;voice over ip;internet privacy;computer security;denial-of-service attack;civil law;computer network	Security	-55.8421396169161	65.7794611327306	180004
056d97a2c6daa109c58eafdb8039cb5b5b827d3a	toward a practical packet marking approach for ip traceback	denial of service dos attack;ip traceback;probabilistic packet marking ppm;internet security	IP traceback is an important step in defending against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Probabilistic packet marking (PPM) has been studied as a promising approach to realize IP traceback. In this paper, we propose a new PPM approach that improves the current state of the art in two practical directions: (1) it improves the efficiency and accuracy of IP traceback and (2) it provides incentives for ISPs to deploy IP traceback in their networks. Our PPM approach employs a new IP header encoding scheme to store the whole identification information of a router into a single packet. This eliminates the computation overhead and false positives due to router identification fragmentation. Our approach does not disclose the IP addresses of the routers having marked packets, thereby alleviating the ISP’s security concern of disclosing network topology. Our approach is able to control the distribution of marking information. Hence, it is suitable to be deployed as a value-added service which may create revenue for ISPs. Therefore our PPM approach improves the performance and practicability of IP traceback.	computation;confidentiality;denial-of-service attack;fork (software development);ip traceback;item unique identification;line code;network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);router (computing)	Chao Gong;Kamil Saraç	2009	I.

f809a8a7e3a5e324fd64cf4f4d3149b2847f859a	a study on false channel condition reporting attacks in wireless networks	routing protocols;measurement;peer-to-peer computing;throughput;relays;topology	Wireless networking protocols are increasingly being designed to exploit a user's measured channel condition; we call such protocols channel-aware. Each user reports the measured channel condition to a manager of wireless resources and a channel-aware protocol uses these reports to determine how resources are allocated to users. In a channel-aware protocol, each user's reported channel condition affects the performance of every other user. The deployment of channel-aware protocols increases the risks posed by false channel-condition feedback. In this paper, we study what happens in the presence of an attacker that falsely reports its channel condition. We perform case studies on channel-aware network protocols to understand how an attack can use false feedback and how much the attack can affect network performance. The results of the case studies show that we need a secure channel condition estimation algorithm to fundamentally defend against the channel-condition misreporting attack. We design such an algorithm and evaluate our algorithm through analysis and simulation. Our evaluation quantifies the effect of our algorithm on system performance as well as the security and the performance of our algorithm.

Although many researches had been proposed to analyze network intrusion behaviors in accordance with low-level network data, they still suffer a large mount of false alerts and result in difficulties for network administrators to discover useful information from these alerts. To reduce the load of administrators, by collecting and analyzing unknown attack sequences systematically, administrators can do the duty of fixing the root causes. Due to the different characteristics of each intrusion, none of analysis methods can correlate IDS alerts precisely and discover all kinds of real intrusion patterns. Therefore, an alert-based decision support system is proposed in this paper to construct an alert classification model for on-line network behavior monitoring. The architecture of decision support system consists of three phases: Alert Preprocessing Phase, Model Constructing Phase and Rule Refining Phase. The Alert Processing Phase is used to transform IDS alerts into alert transactions with specific data format as alert subsequences, where an alert sequence is a kind of well-aggregated alert transaction format to discover intrusion behaviors. Besides, the Model Constructing Phase is used to construct three kinds of rule classes: normal rule classes, intrusion rule classes and suspicious rule classes, to filter false alert patterns and analyze each existing or unknown alert patterns; each rule class represents a set of classification rules. Normal rule class, a set of false alert classification rules, can be trained by using sequential pattern mining approach in an attack-free environment. Intrusion rule classes, a set of known intrusion classification rules, and suspicious rule classes, a set of novel intrusion classification rules, can be trained in a simulated attacking environment using several well-known rootkits and labeling by experts. Finally, the Rule Refining Phase is used to change the classification flags of alert sequence across different time intervals. According to the urgent situations of different levels, Network administrators can do event protecting or vulnerability repairing, even or cause tracing of attacks. Therefore, the decision support system can prevent attacks effectively, find novel attack patterns exactly and reduce the load of administrators efficiently.	decision support system	Nien-Yi Jan;Shun-Chieh Lin;Shian-Shyong Tseng;Nancy P.

One solution is to be able to counter attack with offensive capabilities. With attacker information available, companies find themselves in a dilemma – counter attack for immediate self-defense, retaliate for future deterrence, inform the appropriate law enforcement authorities, or do nothing. We examine justification for the hack back selfdefense and deterrence arguments in the context of current technology and legal framework. This paper extends discussion of issues surrounding using offensive capabilities for defensive purposes to the civilian/commercial Internet context beyond information warfare.	internet;vigilante	Vikas Jayaswal;William Yurcik;David Doss	2002		10.1109/ISTAS.2002.1013841	public relations;political science;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-56.63411958868808	65.91844487918084	180554

Mobile agent or m bile software agent is piece of software that ca n operate autonomously to accomplish user assigned ta sk. To explain more, mobile agent is the process wh ich can migrate to hosts autonomously. As an agent trav els to do execution in different environment in dif ferent host or servers, the agents are in need of protecti ng themselves and their data from various types of attacks. So providing security to the mobile agent (static c ode) and its data (dynamic code) is an emerging nee d in Mobile Agent Technology. The change in Mobile Agent (MA) code can be identified due its static nature where as finding change in mobile agent data is the biggest challenge especially in malicious host’s a ttacks. This study presents Clone Return Process (CRP) meth od to protect the data of free roaming mobile agent against colluded truncation attack. By using CRP, m alicious host are identified and recovery of mobile agent is easily done. So free roaming mobile agent communicates with other servers and protects its computation results (data) in an efficient way.	communications protocol;computation;i/o controller hub;internet;mobile agent;secure communication;software agent;truncation	G.

These social robots promise to become not just a personal assistant, but a companion that knows its owner»s tastes and habits. As the advances in artificial intelligence move the dream of home robots closer, exploitation techniques that could specifically target these robots need to be thoroughly examined. In this paper, we present our observations from performing an initial vulnerability analysis to a commercial social robot. Our results indicate that both manufacturers and application developers need to take cybersecurity into account when considering the use of their robots.	artificial intelligence;computer security;cyber security standards;social robot	Justin Miller;Andrew B.

Virtual world users invest a considerable amount of time, effort and often money to collect virtual property items, only to have them stolen by thieves. Many virtual property thefts go undetected, with thieves often stealing virtual property items without resistance, leaving victims to discover the theft only after it has occurred. This paper presents the design of a detection framework that uses an algorithm for identifying virtual property theft at two key stages: account intrusion and unauthorized virtual property trades. Initial tests of this framework on a synthetic data set show an 80% detection rate with no false positives. This framework can allow virtual world developers to tailor and extend it to suit their specific virtual world software and provide an effective way of detecting virtual property theft while being a low maintenance, user friendly and cost effective.	algorithm;authentication;authorization;downtime;ozoneweb;sensor;synthetic data;usability;virtual community;virtual world;while	Nicholas Charles Patterson;Michael Hobbs;Jemal H.

With about a half million reports each year in the United States, phone fraud complaints have more than doubled since 2013. In the current calling line identification presentation scheme, the caller ID is trivially spoofed. Scammers are using spoofed caller IDs to trick their victims into answering unwanted calls and further a variety of scams. To provide a solution to this problem, this paper proposes an authentication scheme that provides the possibility of a security indicator for the current Q.731.3 calling line identification presentation supplementary service. The goal of this proposal is to help prevent users from falling victim to phone impersonation scams, as well as provide a foundation for future defenses to stop unwanted calls based on the caller ID information.
