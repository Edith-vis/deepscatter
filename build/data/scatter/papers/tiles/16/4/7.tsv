Understanding its flow mechanics and establishing computational models require precise measurement of flow parameters. However, measuring the parameters of multiphase flow has been considered a challenging problem in the past decades. It is of significance to scientific researchers and also of practical value to industry.	control flow	Chao Tan;Jiabin Jia;Chuanlong Xu;Zhiqiang Sun;Feng Ding	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2844479	manufacturing engineering;computer science;distributed computing;computational model;multiphase flow	Visualization	-49.01383452739144	-0.27324049292485325	44778

a22605f5892ea3942e5e1d5e6370908cb4f0616b	issues and opportunities		As organizational computing moves from back roo m production processing to more highly visible areas such as computing for competitive advantage, expert systems , fourth generation technologies, local area networks, an d desktop publishing, one may assume that the vast majority of organizational effort should be spent on developing new applications to take advantage of these new technologies and development philosophies . As attractive as this migh t sound most organizations are faced with a much mor e glaring problem that is consuming the vast majority o f available resources . Resources that otherwise might b e dedicated to these new projects . The problem is how do w e manage and maintain a 30 year inventory of applicatio n software . The issue is not trivial since the software span s both hardware and software generations and is critical to the day-to-day operations of the business . A brief analysis of the problem indicates it will only get worse . For every new system placed in production we generate another piece of software to be added to the eclectic inventory . Admittedly maintenance can be classified as a technical problem and needs a technical solution . But the only hope of getting a handle on the issue and determinin g how to maintain the inventory, without sacrificing th e future of the organization, is to develop a manageria l solution. The solution needs to address such issues a s strategy, productivity, policy, procedures, and priorities . In an attempt to learn more about the practica l implications and organizational realities of managing th e maintenance function, 29 MIS directors and maintenanc e managers were assembled to discuss the issue. All of th e attendees represented member firms of the Informatio n System Research Center at the University of Houston . A round table discussion format was used to facilitat e interaction among the attendees . The objective of th e session was to establish the key elements of a mission statement for the information system (IS) maintenanc e function from hich organization specific action plans could be developed . The purpose of this article is to report on th e outcomes of the session and specifically to (1) describe th e key issues and questions raised by the group, (2) list a set of critical success factors for the maintenance functio n identified by the group, and (3) list a series of attributes that can be used to develop an organization's mission statemen t for the IS maintenance function .	business requirements;database;desktop computer;expert system;information systems research;information needs;information system;management information system;quality of service;virtual community	L.

The papers' editors and authors are affiliated with institutions that span the The book is divided into five sections: the introduction, design methods, high-level programming, simulation frameworks, and state-of-the-art designs. The individual papers cite surveys, make case studies, provide proofs of concept, offer proposals for designs, and explore models. Any discussion of network-on-chip design should begin with its need, something that's inseparable from FPGA design history. The major factor of FPGA design is the amount of time it takes to complete a design. As a consequence of lengthy design times reuse becomes of utmost importance. The most efficient design strategy is to not design from scratch but to glue intellectual property (IP) cores together, preferably in a flexible manner. The evolution of FPGA design has progressed from designing from scratch, to gluing together fixed IP cores, to designing and connecting ad-hoc reconfigurable IP cores, to connecting IP-reconfigurable IP cores to ad-hoc network infrastructures. As the state-of-the-art advanced, the processing bottleneck has moved from computation within an IP core to communication across IP cores – the bane of systems optimization writ small.	computation;field-programmable gate array;high- and low-level;high-level programming language;hoc (programming language);list of minor characters in the matrix series;mathematical optimization;network on a chip;phased-array optics;semiconductor intellectual property core;separable polynomial;simulation;snapshot (computer storage);software framework	Robert Schaefer	2013	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/2532780.2532794	software architecture;computer architecture;architectural pattern;computer science;software engineering;pattern;computer engineering	EDA	-52.476874188649255	-0.15638665742356855	45392

After twenty years of progress, the PC is good enough for most consumers. As PC development becomes less profitable, design emphasis shifts to mobile systems such as digital cameras, MP3 players, and cell phones. Mobile systems change the design goal from cost performance to cost-performance-per-watt. Smaller transistors won’t help because they are too expensive and they leak too much. The microprocessor, which has held back advances in hardware design for thirty years, won’t be the workhorse in mobile systems of the future. Microprocessors and DSPs are unsuitable for mobile systems because instruction-based processing is computationally inefficient and because they use too much energy. Today’s memory components are also unsuitable for mobile systems. New programmable logic devices based on next-generation non-volatile memory will enable efficient reconfigurable systems.

c8b8c0484bfc0442e12099f3eaf3f9c18791cd67	components for information processing	information processing	Microprocessors are at the intersection of two important engineering activities: electronics engineering and computer engineering. The electronic engineer should be familiar with underlying theory of operation of the various electronic components and methods of designing systems with these components. One important set of such systems is that Of the general-purpose digital computer. This set provides the basic components for the computer engineer who should be familiar with the theory of operation of the computer and the methods of designing the programs, or software, of complex information-processing systems. Each set of activities involves a set of components plus a set of tools to be used at the various stages of system implementation, design, construction, testing, commissioning, maintenance and modification. Until the advent of the microprocessor, the components and tools in each area of activity were quite different. Now that there is considerable overlap of these twin cultures, each group of engineers will need to come to grips with the components and tools familiar to the others. Perhaps this interdisciplinary activity will lead to the identification and establishment of a new activity: that of informationprocessor engineering which contains the best attitudes and values from the existing disciplines. One objective of this tutorial series will be to identify the common components and tools required for the engineering of microprocessor-based systems and, hopefully, to assist in the establishment of sound values and attitudes for the new class of engineer. Articles in this series will lag the leading edge of technological development, since they can only be prepared after due reflection of the general principles which underlie the new trends. In dealing with general principles, it is better to avoid direct reference to commercial products, and this maxim will be observed wherever possible; however, it is appreciated that illustrations of specific points may entail the description and critical appraisal of an existing product. Initially, this series will draw on the distilled experiences of the group at the University College of Swansea. This group has been building microprocessor-based systems since 1972 and offering short microprocessor workshop courses to practising electronics engineers since early 7975. The handbook used on the workshops has now been developed into a book entitled Introduction to microprocessors, edited by D Aspinall and E L Dagless published by Pitman Publishing Limited. Relevant chapters of this book will form the basis of early articles in the series. As the series develops, it is hoped to attract significant tutorial papers from leading teachers in the field.	computer engineering;electronic component;electronic engineering;experience;general-purpose markup language;information processing;microprocessor;software testing	D.

The series intends to provide articles on the latest developments in this well established discipline, highlighting recent research achievements and providing insight into both theoretical and practical issues related to the evolution of the discipline from different perspectives. The series provides a forum for the publication of both academic and industrial research, addressing the state of the art, theory, and practice in network and service management. In the last editorial we listed the major conferences, workshops, and journals in this area, highlighting the recently established IEEE Electronic Transactions on Network and Service Management (eTNSM). This has recently passed the first major IEEE approval, in which the proposed title, scope, and sponsorship were approved, with the IEEE Communications Society being the sole sponsor. The next key milestone is the phase 2 approval that will consider relevant business aspects (e.g., financial projections). This was to take place at the February 2006 IEEE Periodical meeting. The journal currently publishes two issues per year, and three issues have been published so far. These are freely available at present at http://www.comsoc.org/eTNSM Another important development for the community has been the start at the beginning of 2006 of the European EMANICS project on Management of the Internet and Complex Services. This is an EU Network of Excellence that brings together 13 research institutions active in the area of network and service management. It encompasses work areas dealing with integration (long-term vision, virtual laboratory, and testbeds), dissemination (a new European conference, electronic dissemination, training and technology transfer, open source initiatives), and joint research activities (scalable, economic, and autonomic management). For more information, visit the project site at http://www.emanics.org/. Finally, it is worth noting that the key annual event in this area, which this year is the 10th IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS 2006), is to be held April 3–7, 2006 in the Vancouver Convention and Exhibition Center, Vancouver, Canada. This includes a three-day symposium with technical paper, application, and panel sessions, and two days of tutorials by renowned experts in the field; see http://www.noms2006.org/ We again experienced an overwhelming interest for the second issue, receiving 23 submissions overall.

237a86cdd71798a6942b8574b99d4cce22f056ac	recent advances in interactive and automated analysis		Computers and distributed software applications are becoming nowadays ubiquitous, and therefore their safety and reliability have increasingly important societal impact. In this context, formal methods equipped with powerful and versatile analysis tools are more important than ever in the design process. Despite the relevant scientific results and well-established tools obtained in recent years, there is a constant need of enhancing the analysis capabilities in order to handle increasingly complex systems. We briefly discuss some recent advances in the field, introducing five papers selected from the 22th International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems (TACAS 2016).	automated proof checking;bisimulation;complex systems;concurrency (computer science);distributed computing;european joint conferences on theory and practice of software;formal methods;parallel algorithm;proof assistant;stochastic process	Radu Mateescu	2017	International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer	10.1007/s10009-017-0477-y	theoretical computer science;computer engineering;formal equivalence checking;complex system;engineering design process;computer science;formal methods;parallel algorithm;societal impact of nanotechnology;proof assistant	SE	-48.37094510097371	0.3629615643472876	52045

A key national program is being launched jointly by a number of government agencies headed by the Ministry of Science and Technology. Areas include key electronic components, chipsets and infrastructure software. Objectives associated with the infrastructure software cover supports for the development and domestic replacement of essential software, such as operating system, database management system, middleware and office software. Another important one is the 863 high technology program. It set priorities in advanced computing technology, intelligence technology, network, virtual reality, information security, and so on. Industrialization aims at establishment of national and regional software parks and incubators, as well as chip design bases in various areas. Intellectual Property Rights are important goals in the software development. Strategy is given to selectively obtain critical technologies, which can be used for technology-technology exchange.

c66aeceae40159de85f2bcf669570e3cb1fa56a5	editor-in-chief's introduction: the state of computing	first page;environment systems applications	Electronics Engineers is 100 years old. The IEEE Computer Society celebrates this anniversary with a special issue of Computer magazine that presents an assessment of the state of computer technology. Founded in 1951 as the Professional Group on Electronic Computers of the Institute of Radio Engineers, which subsequently merged with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers to become the IEEE, the Computer Society is only one third the age of the IEEE. I In these three decades, however, the Computer Society has become not only the largest technical society within the IEEE, but, with more than 76,000 members, it is also the largest of the scientific and educational societies in the computer field. The growth of the society, in itself, is indicative of the evolution of computing technology and of its influence on our lives. The origins of modern computer technology can be traced back only to World War II, when British military intelligence began using Colossus for encryption and code analysis. Shortly thereafter, the pioneering work of Eckert and Mauchly produced the first large-scale electronic computer, the Eniac. Since this first vacuumtube system, the technology has evolved through generations, from discrete circuits using transistors, to integrated circuits, and finally to large-scale, and very large scale integrated circuits. 2 It is the possibilities of these electronic developments that we have set out to investigate in this commemorative issue of Computer.

An SO can be defined as a physical digital object augmented with sensing, processing, storing and networking capabilities. The key role of such objects resides in the capabilities they have to make physical environments intelligent so as to provide novel services to people. Cultural Heritage domain and in particular its fruition and enjoyment perspectives can profitably benefits of such technologies since it characterize a domain where different aspects have to be considered: people enjoyment, cultural items fruition, valorisation and tutelage of spaces and artworks. In this paper we present an ongoing project, named (TrUST Transport with Ubiquiotus and Smart Technologies) and developed within DATABENC, a high technology district for Cultural Heritage management, in collaboration with the Mobility Transport Company (ANM) of Naples. The project exploits the Internet of Things technologies in order to enable a novel fruition metaphor inside the transport coaches. Deploying a SO with GPS and WiFi capabilities, users can enjoy of multimedia content about the cultural heritage that surrounds them during a trip. c © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

FIWARE is the result of a series of wellfunded EU projects that is currently intensively promoted throughout public agencies in Europe and world-wide. The goal was to figure out how services provided by FIWARE facilitate the development of smart applications. It was conducted first by an analysis of the central components that make up the service stack, followed by the implementation of a pilot project that aimed on using as many of these services as possible.

This paper presents an architecture and a tool set which provide a migration path from terminal-based to client/server technology, conserving much of the investments in existing applications. It is argued, though, that a new technological revolution is required in the form of extending the web browser/server technology to operational information systems in hospitals. A blueprint is presented for a further migration path from client/server to browser/server technology. The browser technology is regarded as a major challenge to hospital information systems in the next few years.	blueprint;client–server model;fileman;hospital information systems;informatics (discipline);information system;international cooperation;internet;investments;legacy system;real life;server (computer);server (computing);united states department of veterans affairs;www;web application	Mikko Korpela	1998	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-896-0-222	client–server model;comet (programming);world wide web;web api;clickstream;informatics;legacy system;internet privacy;computer science	OS	-62.741620103543525	-3.572785305852795	56237

After Bell Labs demonstrated that this idea was wrong, how would engineers and managers go about bringing the new amplifying device up to the level of usability of the vacuum tube? How would its unique characteristics be exploited? How would we convince the armed forces that this device could meet their demanding applications? Why did the early transistors lend themselves well to computing circuits and lend themselves poorly to linear amplification? What was the origin of practices such as temperature cycling and burn-in that became widespread in later years? How did Astounding Science Fiction Magazine play a role? How was information exchanged with universities and government organizations? How were project managers chosen and how did they manage? Some of the answers are found in these memoirs recalling J.A. Morton's Signal Corps project and J.H. Felker's TRADIC Phase I computer project.	computer	James R.

The Workshop was organized and sponsored by Cisco, Northwestern University's International Center for Advanced Internet Research (iCAIR), IBM, and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The goal of the workshop was to identify existing middleware services that could be leveraged for new capabilities as well as identifying additional middleware services requiring research and development. The workshop participants discussed the definition of middleware in general, examined the applications perspective, detailed underlying network transport capabilities relevant to middleware services, and then covered various specific examples of middleware components. These included APIs, authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) issues, policy framework, directories, resource management, networked information discovery and retrieval services, quality of service,	middleware	Bob Aiken;John Strassner;Brian E.

The Workshop deals with topics that span multiple enterprises, including Peer to Peer (P2P), Grid Computing, security of large-scale backbones, software security, et al. Consequently, it was suggested that the Workshop consider a name change to more accurately reflect the topics of the papers it was receiving and delivering. Several names were considered and Security Technologies was selected. However, the name Enterprise Security has not been dropped as it was the name under which it was organized originally.	application security;grid computing	David P.

VISIR allows wiring and measuring of electronic circuits remotely on a virtual workbench that replicates physical circuit breadboards. The wiring mechanism is developed by means of a relay switching matrix connected to a PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI) instrumentation platform. The entire equipment is controlled by LabVIEW server software, in addition to a measurement server software that protects the equipment from hazard connections by verifying input circuit designs, sent by students, before being executed. This paper addresses other approaches such as remote labs based on Data Acquisition Cards (DAQs), NetLab, and RemotElectLab, comparing them with VISIR in order to emphasize its singularity. Topics discussed are as follows: the technical description, software, operation cycle, features, and provided services. In addition, the feedback received by students at several universities and the encountered drawbacks along with the proposed solutions are highlighted. The paper finally addresses the ongoing and future challenges within the VISIR community including its integration with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and iLab Shared Architecture (ISA), its new hardware version release that is based on LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation (LXI), and its new open platform version that supports federated access.	breadboard;data acquisition;electronic circuit;feedback;labview;management system;open platform;pci extensions for instrumentation;relay;server (computing);verification and validation;wiring;workbench	Mohamed Tawfik;Elio San Cristóbal;Sergio Martín;Rosario Gil;Gabriel Díaz;Antonio Colmenar;Juan Peire;Manuel Castro;Kristian Nilsson;Johan Zackrisson;Lars Håkansson;Ingvar Gustavsson	2013	IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies	10.1109/TLT.2012.20	distance education;embedded system;electronic circuit;electronics;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;data mining;emerging technologies;world wide web	Visualization	-53.975186691964986	4.1108588421848005	58496

b51c5ea30e332c2f71dbf59fb5cb45a516efa75f	guest editorial: special issue on realizing ai synergies in software engineering		Software engineering is now expected to solve a plethora of increasingly complex questions that are dynamic, automated, adaptive, or must execute on a very large scale. In theory, AI technologies have the potential to support the development of increasingly complex SE systems. Conversely, in theory, SE might also play a role in alleviating development costs and the development effort associated with AI tools. This special multi-issue presents some of the latest innovative synergistic AI and SE techniques and practices and was stimulated (in part) by a 2-day workshop entitled “Realizing AI Synergies in SE (RAISE’13)” which was held at ICSE’13 and was sponsored by the NSF. The workshop is part of an on-going series, usually held at the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering. This first part includes papers covering topics related to defects and maintainability. In “AutoODC: Automated Generation of Orthogonal Defect Classifications”, LiGuo Huang, Vincent Ng, Issac Persing, Mingrui Chen, Zeheng Li, Ruili Geng and Jeff Tian present a way to automate the classification of software defects by regarding it as a supervised text classification problem. The authors use the orthogonal defect classification (ODC) framework from IBM for their work and propose a novel annotation framework which uses experts’ opinions to help classify defects. The automated approach, called AutoODC, was trained using machine learning algorithms and the	algorithm;document classification;entity–relationship model;ibm notes;icse;machine learning;orthogonal defect classification;software bug;software engineering;synergy	Rachel Harrison;Tim Menzies	2014	Automated Software Engineering	10.1007/s10515-014-0174-y	computer science;industrial engineering;software engineering	SE	-55.850667788367424	-0.790687459652255	60080

They are familiar with the Grid technology. They know how to develop and run applications in Linux/Unix environment using programming languages such as C and Java. They use command-line interfaces (CLI) to run their applications on the Grid. If the Grid wants to be a success story, which it definitely wants, it should involve further users and user communitieswho do not have the abovementioned knowledge and many of them do not even want to obtain this knowledge. They want to migrate and deploy their calculation, modelling, simulation etc. applications on the Grid, to run them with minimum costs and efforts having access to Grid resources in a transparent way. We organised the “Grid-Enabling Legacy Applications and Supporting End Users” Workshop (GELA), in Paris, France, on June 20th 2006 within the framework of the 15th IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing HPDC’15 to answer the second and third question. The workshop brought together Grid researchers and current/perspective Grid users. Researchers presented solutions for grid-enabling legacy code applications, and for supporting the development andusage ofGrid applications. Users outlined their existing Grid applications and defined their requirements towards different Grid technologies.	command-line interface;distributed computing;grid computing;java;legacy code;linux;programming language;requirement;simulation;unix	Péter Kacsuk;Gábor Terstyánszky	2008	Future Generation Comp.

When the fish surface—about once every two days—their locations are transmitted to a satellite, then posted on a Web site. The tagging program, started in Australia where five fatal shark attacks have occurred in the past 10 months, could eventually be used in Florida where a number of sharks have attacked swimmers and surfers. The cost of tagging—about $3,000 per shark—is being paid for by corporate sponsorship.

Typically, they have no central authority , are governed by networks and contain both emerging and purposefully designed parts. Their use varies over time, and a large number of individuals use them for different purposes. The ba sic digital government infrastructure has evolved over time and the development towards the n ext generation of digital government infrastructure (NGI) is under development. In this introduction, we discuss aspects of infrastructure development and this special issue c ontains papers contributing to the development of the NGI in various fields including customs, cri sis management, legislation and regulation, providing a number of possible functions and servic s that may become part of the NGI. We argue that policy-makers should view the NGI from a complex-adaptive systems (CAS) view and that the next generation of infrastructures will pr ovide not only technological services, including connectivity and security, but also shared informat ion and knowledge in various fields, thus making it easier to participate, translate legislat ion and manage collaboration between public and private parties and in this way advancing digital g overnment.	complex adaptive system;e-government;ext js javascript framework;itil;next generation identification;next-generation network;point of view (computer hardware company);sociotechnology	Marijn Janssen;Soon Ae Chun;José Ramón Gil-García	2009	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2008.12.006	complex adaptive system;public relations;generating function;computer science;knowledge management;enterprise architecture;public administration;management;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-62.601383874222456	2.1823910803228084	62516

1d8bf7e48799cb9f6420bf4b0e1358d79a19a912	addressing the challenges of aerospace and defense initiatives using software analysis tools	software analysis	Aerospace engineers and operators have to manage tremendously complex geometries that change over time. Not long ago, engineers performed this detailed analysis with pencils, paper, slide rules, and sheer brainpower. The introduction of the calculator accelerated the industry’s growth and, soon after, the evolution and integration of computers dramatically increased efficiency and productivity. Aerospace, defense, and intelligence professionals are now poised to take the community to a whole new level through mission-specific software technology advancements. By leveraging sophisticated analysis tools, which incorporate dynamic twoand three-dimensional visualization to significantly aid in understanding and comprehending the information, users can attain new heights of productivity. Complex problems that once took weeks or months to complete, now take only seconds or minutes when employing software capabilities. In many cases, analyses that were impossible to even contemplate are now quickly and easily completed, and their results have yielded major advancements in the industry and the world. This keynote address will discuss and demonstrate how commercially available software tools are currently used by the aerospace and defense communities to make missions and programs a reality. Six major themes will be discussed with each demonstrating examples of real-world success stories such as those highlighted below: Defense and intelligence programs – Command centers worldwide use the Constant Sentinel software system to depict the location and status of surveillance assets and the targets they generate. All fused into a single coherent display, the situational awareness provided helps commanders allocate resources, spot trends, and make decisions faster than our enemies can react. Anomaly resolution and deorbits – Software technology played an integral role in the explanation and visualization safely deorbiting the Mir space station. In the Moscow mission control center, different software packages were integrated to create three-dimensional animations of the reentry process and confirm astrodynamic calculations. To help the world better understand this historic event, CNN used software to broadcast 3-D animations worldwide to illustrate the entire deorbit sequence, as well as to provide a live simulation of the orientation and location of Mir throughout its final orbits, reentry, and debris break up. Commercial space applications –Space Imaging’s IKONOS 2 operations center employs the power of software within its scheduling processes to determine time periods when the satellite can satisfy requests for highresolution imagery. Various constraints on these times, such as ambient lighting and imaging geometry, are modKEYNOTE ADDRESS	anomaly detection;coherence (physics);computer;mission control;scheduling (computing);shading;simulation;slide rule;software system	Paul L.

Commercial and open source virtualization products are being used by researchers and educators to create a wide variety of virtual environments. These virtual environments facilitate systems design and development and product development as well as the testing and modeling of production and preproduction systems. As the capabilities, functionality, and stability of these products have evolved, the use of virtualization has expanded, necessitating the identification of new research areas to investigate the impacts of virtualization on digital forensics. In February 2007, a group of digital forensics researchers, educators, and practitioners gathered at the National Center for Forensic Science at the University of Central Florida for the 2007 Workshop on Virtualization in Digital Forensics to discuss these issues and develop a research and education agenda for virtualization and digital forensics. This article outlines some of the ideas generated and new research categories and areas identified at this meeting.		Mark Pollitt;Kara L. Nance;Brian Hay;Ronald C. Dodge;J.

350e4e88b88834c0296412eed7b3c2bdcb23fc23	software engineering		The Computer Science Department offers the BS degree in Computer Science and the BS degree in Software Engineering. Both are based on a solid foundation of mathematics, including calculus, linear algebra, and discrete mathematics. These programs of study are designed to offer students opportunities to prepare for an industrial, business, or governmental career in a rapidly changing profession and to prepare for graduate study in a field in which further education is strongly recommended. The two programs have the same basis in core computer science, including the analysis of algorithms and data structures, modern programming methodologies, and the study of operating systems. The Computer Science program continues with courses in advanced data structures, programming languages, telecommunications networks, and automata theory, while the Software Engineering program include courses in requirements engineering, software validation and testing, and software architecture, culminating in a challenging project course in which students must demonstrate use of software engineering techniques. Both programs offer a rich choice of elective studies, including courses in artificial intelligence, computer graphics, databases, and compiler design.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;artificial intelligence;automata theory;compiler;computer graphics;computer science;data structure;database;discrete mathematics;linear algebra;operating system;programming language;requirement;requirements engineering;software architecture;software engineering;software verification and validation;telecommunications network	Don G.

This platform serves the growing needs of expanding technical curriculum into internet-based engineering courses and allows deploying, hosting and sharing laboratory resources between people all over the world. It frees laboratory owners from many responsibilities (such as creating and managing time reservation system, keeping the trusted certificate, etc.) and gives more time and freedom to concentrate on subject specific tasks rather than on computer science. On-line laboratories hosted on Labicom are normally accessible worldwide from modern web-browsers in many languages. Laboratory owners have an opportunity to localize their labs to as many languages as they want. Labicom.net represents multi-tier distributed server-client net of applications. Currently only a few laboratories are connected (Remote Laser Laboratory (RLL) [2], [3] is the most mature) but they are already used in beta-testing. New features and updates are applied regularly and new labs are supposed to join the platform soon.	computer science;internationalization and localization;internet;multitier architecture;online and offline;server (computing);software testing;web application	Igor Titov	2013	2013 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EduCon.2013.6530251	simulation;engineering;multimedia;world wide web	DB	-54.74937603637062	3.2503780687873505	66642

31a3713250b39aef5e1f2890e9e32db5ade758cc	omlet: a revolution against big-brother social networks (invited talk)	social networks	"""With the wide-spread adoption of proprietary social networks like Facebook and mobile chat platforms like Wechat, we may be heading to a future where all our communication are monetized and our online transactions are mediated by monopolistic big-data companies. This talk describes a new anti-data monetization movement led by Omlet, an open messaging service and distributed computing platform that spun out of 4 years of research at Stanford University. With Omlet, (1) users can own their data and have them hosted on cloud services of their choice and (2) distributed """"p2p webapps"""" enable phones and other internet of things to interact with each other without having its communication be monetized. Introduced in March 2014, Omlet is already seeing traction, as it is being distributed on millions of Android phones, by Asus and other yet-to-be-announced device makers. This paradigm shift to decentralized computation not only safeguards users' data privacy, it fosters open competition and innovation, and provides an efficient and scalable foundation to handle the billions of phones and devices. Software engineering researchers can help make this a reality by making distributed mobile app development on such a platform accessible."""	android;big data;cloud computing;computation;course (navigation);distributed computing;e-commerce;information privacy;internet of things;mobile app;monetization;programming paradigm;scalability;social network;software engineering;traction teampage	Monica S.

17011f3af6b75567b130b60ce972ae891b6d5934	introduction to special issue on healthcare modeling and simulation	modeling and simulation	"""The application of modeling and simulation in the field of healthcare goes back more than five decades. Such applications have focused on improving the operational and strategic management of healthcare systems, mainly within hospitals in terms of patient flow and epidemiological analysis. Although modeling and simulation have been widely recognized in healthcare from an academic perspective, there is still a significant divide between theoretical publications and practical applications. It is evident that the implementation of simulation results has been very slow to catch up with advances in simulation theory and methodology especially in view of the explosive growth in the number of published articles over the last decade. To stimulate more timely and more effective application of these advances, we called for a special issue of ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS) that encompasses high-quality scholarly papers while also providing more insights into the implementation of simulation in the healthcare field. In this special issue, we have the opportunity to appreciate the increasing depth of quality and the growing applicability of such modeling and simulation techniques to the core of healthcare delivery and the wider healthcare environment. The principal development that characterizes the modern scene is the clear focus on the customer for whom the models really matter, and this is reflected in all the articles in this special issue. The field is moving from a primarily academic pursuit to an operational reality. To this end, we received twenty-one articles for consideration as part of this special issue. After carefully reviewing all submissions, we selected five articles to represent the state-of-the-art of modeling and simulation in healthcare from both the theoretical and practical perspectives. The first article is titled """" DGHPSim: Generic Simulation of Hospital Performance """" and is coauthored by Murat M. G ¨ unal and Michael Pidd. This article presents DGHPSim, a generic modeling framework for hospitals, primarily in the context of England's National Health Service. DGHPSim is a suite of four components designed to simulate the activities of a typical hospital with the aim of reviewing and evaluating the effect of different operating policies on patient waiting times. Some of the components of the framework can be used independently as well as in conjunction with other components of the framework. DGHPSim uses transition matrices based on real data to represent the states of the patients passing through the wards in which those patients may receive …"""	computer simulation;strategic management	Tillal Eldabi;Terry Young	2011	ACM Trans.

Collectively, these sites span multiple power authorities that independently control carbon emissions at each site. Serving data from a carbon-heavy site increases the service's carbon footprint, but it is hard to place data at sites that will have low emission rates without replicating to too many sites. We present CADRE, a carbon-aware data replication approach. CADRE forecasts emission rates at each site and replicates data to sites that combine together to yield low carbon footprints. It makes replication decisions online, i.e., When data is created, and thus avoids emissions caused by moving data frequently in response to changing emission rates. CADRE uses the multiple-choice secretary algorithm to replicate objects with large footprints to low emission sites. It models carbon footprints for each object using the footprint-replication curve, a graph that maps replication factors to expected carbon footprints. CADRE also achieves availability goals, respects storage capacity limits and balances data across sites. Compared to consistent hashing, our approach reduces carbon footprints by 70%. It also supports and enhances the state-of-the-art green load balancing, reducing the carbon footprint by an additional 21%.	algorithm;cloud computing;consistent hashing;data center;database;distributed computing;hadamard transform;hardware description language;icdcs;international conference on dependable systems and networks;international federation for information processing;load balancing (computing);object storage;replication (computing);self-replicating machine;throughput;usenix annual technical conference	Zichen Xu;Nan Deng;Christopher Stewart;Xiaorui Wang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing	10.1109/ICAC.2015.15	carbon;routing;simulation;computer science;operating system;carbon dioxide;data mining;database;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;replication;computer network	Visualization	-58.235696316749745	-0.4809555881284764	69586

The aim of the workshop was to bring together researchers within the field of clone detection to critically assess the current state of research, and to establish new directions and partnerships for research. There were at least 30 people in attendance. Five position papers were presented and discussed. In addition, an index card-based brainstorming technique was used to focus discussion on assessing the current state of clone analysis and detection. A report and analysis of the results of this brainstorming session is the main content of this report. We recommend another international workshop on clones and clone detection be set to be held alongside another conference sometime in 2004.	duplicate code	Andrew Walenstein;Arun Lakhotia;Rainer Koschke	2004	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/979743.979752	computer science;engineering;software engineering;data mining	SE	-57.20990669067246	-0.5184782471292222	70812

9c827d9a1a6ca960722e715243a5ad412c99344f	ieee access special section editorial: analysis and synthesis of large-scale systems		The last few decades have witnessed the rapid growth of research u0026 development on large-scale systems (LSSs) due to the increasing complexity and the growing demand of modern engineering systems. The LSSs can normally be viewed as interconnections of multiple subsystems. Many practical systems can be described by the LSSs such as power systems, multi-robot systems, communication networks, transportation networks, and supply chains. In such large-scale systems, the centralized control framework may become impossible for its implementation. The decentralized and distributed controls have emerged as the attractive control methodologies to handle the scale and interactions of large-scale complex systems. However, the interactions among different subsystems introduce many challenges in the analysis and synthesis of such systems. Therefore, it is of significance to address several fundamental problems regarding real-time analysis, estimation and control of these systems.

This paper, as a pioneer research, has attempted to make a phenomenal analysis on the existing virtual money systems. By the analysis, this paper has defined what virtual money is, what its general models are, and how its existing systems work. By the analysis, the features of existing virtual money systems are abstracted and their problems are summarized. Driven by the motivation of utilizing and improving the existing virtual money systems, this paper has outlined a novel generic virtual money system model called Common Money (CONEY) to resolve the problems that bother the existing virtual money systems. Finally, further interesting issues for future research are given.	e-commerce;e-society;money;virtual community;virtual currency;virtual economy	Jingzhi Guo;Angelina Chow	2008	2008 10th IEEE Conference on E-Commerce Technology and the Fifth IEEE Conference on Enterprise Computing, E-Commerce and E-Services	10.1109/CECandEEE.2008.91	gold;e-commerce;systems modeling;digital currency;computer science;money;silver;data analysis	Visualization	-60.89511817714482	2.971497659740094	76498

With a great deal of help from the Central Government and local governments, a series of trials to integrate the traditional complex facilities and natural items with the technical elements of the ubiquitous environment such as RFID, SoC and USN are actively in progress. Particularly, in the case of combining with the existing GIS system, they will be very efficient. and In this study, as an actual example of the application of RFID, wireless telecommunications, and GIS, RFID is introduced to manage street trees in cities and UFID is studied for a new address system in Korea. To enhance the existing management system, GPS, CDMA and a web information system are constructed and finally the three dimensional GIS system is developed.	management system;radio-frequency identification	Eui-myoung Kim;Mu-Wook Pyeon;Min-Soo Kang;Jae-sun Park	2006		10.1007/11935148_7	radio-frequency identification;telecommunications;computer science;ubiquitous computing;cartography	HCI	-48.889573132596844	2.008594665512813	76582

3720d00183d70ffdd6e37658b66d1fa31f81e738	dragging government legacy systems out of the shadows		What does the US Department of the Treasury’s Individual Master File (IMF) software— the authoritative data source on American taxpayers—have in common with Apple’s CEO? Like Tim Cook, the IMF will be celebrating its 56th birthday this year, according to a May 2016 US Government Accountability O ce (GAO) report on legacy IT investments.1 The report identi ed the IMF and its same-aged companion, the Business Master File (which contains the tax information related to individual business-income taxpayers), as the government’s two oldest operating software systems. Indeed, nearly 75 percent of today’s Americans weren’t yet born when the systems went operational. Both are written in assembly code and execute on IBM mainframes—and there are no immediate plans to replace either of them. The Treasury Department’s elderly software systems are by no means unique. Coming in at 53 years of age are the US Air Force’s Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS), which coordinates the operational functions of US nuclear forces, and the US Department of Veterans A airs Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) system for tracking VA personnel time and attendance. The Air Force system runs on a 1970s-era IBM Series/1 minicomputer and depends on 8-inch oppy disks, while the VA system is written in COBOL and executes on an IBM mainframe. SACCS is slated for an upgrade in 2017, whereas PAID is scheduled to be replaced next year. The GAO report lists 10 systems that are 39 years old or older (6 are over 50 years old), with half not currently scheduled for either replacement or modernization. In addition, the GAO found that operations and maintenance Dragging Government Legacy Systems Out of the Shadows	assembly language;cobol;drag and drop;legacy system;mainframe computer;minicomputer;software system;strategic automated command and control system	Robert N.

TELOTA (The Electronic Life of the Academy), an initiative for academically applied information technology, was launched here in 2002. The initiative supports the academy's projects by developing IT solutions for research work and digital publications. The project """" Construction of a repository for biographical data on historical persons of the 19 th century """" – short form: Person Data Repository – enhances the existing approaches to data integration and electronically supported research in biographies. It investigates connecting and presenting heterogeneous information on persons of the """" long nineteenth century """" (1789–1914). The project's aim is to provide a de-central software system for research institutions, universities, archives, and libraries that allows combined access on biographic information from different data pools. The project is subdivided into three major fields: 1) conceptual design of an adequate data model, which embraces different methods and perspectives; 2) data exchange with national and international cooperation partners; and 3) development of a software solution based on an evaluated framework. The project is funded by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, German Research Foundation). The work began in July 2009 with three academic staff members and three student assistants, and will continue for two years. To structure heterogeneous biographical data, the project pursues a novel approach, which was already presented in a talk at the workshop """" Personendateien – Elektronisches Publizieren """" in September 2009 in Leipzig (see link below). The approach does not define a person as single data record, but rather as compilation of all statements concerning that person. Thus, it is possible to display complementing as well as contradicting statements in parallel, which meets one of the basic challenges of biographic research. In the above lecture by Niels-Oliver Walkowski, he notes: """" Biographic research, understood as the creation of identifying narrations, performs semantic constructions, which were caused by a human, but which are not identical to it. The consequences are concurring narrations, polysemy and contingency, which are not an expression of lacking knowledge, but are due to the conditions of biographic research. """" In order to satisfy different research approaches and perspectives, the smallest entity of the Person Data Repository is not a person, but a single statement on a person, which is named """" aspect """" in the data model. An aspect bundles references to persons, places, dates and sources.

The workshop brought together researchers and practitioners in order to consider methods that use data stored in software repositories (such as source control systems, defect tracking systems, and archived project communications) to further understanding of software development practices. We divided submissions into six sessions, each devoted to a particular topic: 1) Infrastructure and Extraction, 2) Integration and Presentation, 3) System Understanding and Change Patterns, 4) Defect Analysis, 5) Process and Community Analysis, and 6) Software Reuse. To maximize interaction and discussion, we limited each session to a survey of the topic area, followed by the presentation of one or two papers, then an open discussion. We also allocated a demo hour to give interested parties the opportunity to learn more about other accepted papers.This report includes an overview of the presentations made during these sessions and a summary of the issues raised throughout the workshop.	archive;code reuse;control system;defect tracking;emergence;icse;software bug;software development;software repository;tracking system;version control	Ahmed E.

068cad82fa9a4dac213790d34d079ba4c9ecc91e	managing computer suppliers	computer supplier	"""One of the challenges I had as a software application project manager at Bell Labs was the responsibility to manage computer suppliers so that equipment and support was ready when we needed them at telephone company IT centers. There were seven computer suppliers I dealt with on three major projects. Each supplier became an intimate member of its project team and I participated in the deployment of hundreds of their computers to serve the needs of the then Bell System. Here is how I did it. The largest deployment was about 500 PDP 11/70s from the long gone Digital Equipment Corporation. The technical interface focused on having a single person who was the designated interface for the supplier to me. This person had to be technically competent and """" know the supplier's machines and organization. """" The interface person had to get things done, expedite installations and escalate problems. In critical situations, we needed to communicate with their technical people directly and without the need for translation. A pure marketing type was unacceptable. Let's call this contact the supplier's program manager for my project, who was responsible for coordination of our software needs, our hardware needs and deployment plans, product requirements , deployment plans, field maintenance and for keeping me and my people well informed of their corporate directions. For example when DEC shifted to the VAX computer line they refused to make UNIX a standard supported operating system but were willing to establish a focused and specialized organization to serve our requirements. Finding this unacceptable, I declared that the VAX was not a continuation of the PDP 11/70 computer line and we went out for a new bid for continued deployment of our application. We selected a competitor, who offered the HP-UX system as a standard supported operating system and the rest is history. We undertook the porting of our applications to the HP-UX operating system and HP invested multi-millions to meet our technical needs. We also encouraged Amdahl to provide UNIX operating environments, which they did to great effect. It was very important for me, as a Bell Labs manager to meet with supplier's executives to confirm their commitment and funding to our project and for them to understand our expectations and our assessment of the performances of their project manager. The principle that even though the program manager did not have all the resources for our support …"""	a/ux;amdahl's law;computer;continuation;horizontal pitch;operating environment;operating system;performance;program manager;requirement;software deployment;unix;vax	Larry Bernstein	2012	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/2347696.2347718	systems engineering;computer science	Arch	-61.185208386193004	4.111978236524332	77472

It is a six steps interactive process that uses the notion of “Strategic Dependency Situations” a modularization strategy applied to situations of an organization. ERi*c uses an elicitation strategy that mines goals from the description of the context vocabulary. This paper reports on its use in the context of Investment Contracts of a Telecom Company. The experience of using ERi*c served as basis for the dissertation of one student at UERJ (State University of Rio de Janeiro). A summary of the method application is provided as well as the final remarks on the effects of the modeling experience.

This microcode is generated by the shuttle compiler. This use of microprocessor techniques is believed to provide flexibility for 10-years' worth of vehicles whose parameters and payloads are changing. Microprocessor technology has also found its way into manned weapons. Simulation techniques used at the Wright Paterson Air Force Base, Ohio, USA, were illustrated by application to antiaircraft artillery tracer display generation. In conclusion, there was plenty of good technical material for all those developing or using minicomputer systems. I suspect that, when next year's event is held in Geneva on 20-22nd June 1978, we will see many more applications, both simple and complex. The Proceedings will be available in August, price £_20, from IPC Science and Technology Press Ltd, 32 High Street, Ouildford, Surrey, UK.	compiler;integrated circuit;microcode;microprocessor;minicomputer;simulation	Alan Pipes	1977	Microprocessors	10.1016/0308-5953(77)90160-X	operations research	EDA	-49.94057742369211	-4.203132955249826	80416

In addition to the visualisation of recorded signal patterns in time and spectral domain, the software directly computes a variety of basic metrological parameters of input analogue channels e.g. effective number of bits, THD, THD+noise, SINAD, etc. according to IEEE Std 1057, IEEE Std. 1241 and DYNAD. The parameter determination is performed in time as well as in spectral domain to compare the achieved results. The software was developed in LabWindows/CVI (C language) with implementation of low-level Win32 API multimedia functions. The authors’ intention is to apply the software for computer component vendors and in educational demonstration of ADC testing principles. The paper contains also a few examples of achieved interesting results from testing some PC sound cards and practical authors’ experiences from PC sound card testing.	application programming interface;effective number of bits;electronic component;high- and low-level;ieee 1471;labwindows/cvi;personal computer;sinad;sound card;total harmonic distortion;virtual instrumentation;waveform	Ján Saliga;Linus Michaeli	2003	Computer Standards & Interfaces	10.1016/S0920-5489(02)00077-6	embedded system;real-time computing;effective number of bits;computer hardware;computer science;operating system	Visualization	-52.83150354594163	4.110768726546496	81381

08cf3fe187f2fdd325f0631e4c282ecb2a11ed22	whatever happened to object-oriented databases?	object oriented database	Computer A couple of years ago, industry observers touted object-oriented databases as a technology on the rise, well suited for the emerging Internet age. They said object-oriented databasemanagement systems (ODBMSs) would soon become the primary database technology, supplanting relational databasemanagement systems (RDBMSs), which were not designed to handle the type of multimedia data frequently found on the Internet. As further evidence of this, they said the growth of intranets signaled a decline in the use of client-server networks, on which most relational databases were used. Fast-forward to today, and none of these predictions has come to pass. Relational databases are still by far the most widely used databases. Meanwhile, object-relational database-management systems (ORDBMSs) have added object capabilities to relational databases. They are gaining in popularity and are expected to outsell even relational databases by 2003. And OO databases (see the “OO Database Orientation” sidebar) are still minor players with solid but strictly niche markets. Sales of relational databases have grown considerably faster than the sales of OO databases, and annual worldwide RDBMS revenues are now about 50 times larger. Rick Cattell, distinguished engineer at Sun Microsystems, indicated, “Objectoriented databases are doing just fine, and the news of their demise is highly exaggerated. While their market [share] isn’t as big, they continue to be used in areas like CAD (computer-aided design) and telecommunications, where RDBMSs are not well suited.” However, said Michael Stonebraker, chief technology officer at Informix and an ORDBMS proponent and pioneer, “ODBMSs occupy a small niche market that has no broad appeal. The technology is in semi-rigor mortis, and ORDBMSs will corner the market within five years.”	client–server model;computer-aided design;fast forward;ibm informix;internet;intranet;niche blogging;object-relational database;relational database management system;semiconductor industry;server (computing)	Neal Leavitt	2000	IEEE Computer	10.1109/MC.2000.10067	computer science;database	DB	-60.43194253423596	2.453917442977437	84315

Looking at the literature of this field in Europe, the author found the name of Leo Wenzel Pollak in Prague in the 1934 Hollerith Nachrichten, the customer journal of the Berlin DEHOMAG Company (L.W. Pollak and F. Kaiser, 1934). Pollak's paper turned out to be the culmination of seven years' intensive use of punched cards in scientific data processing-a project that has, so far, not been appreciated in the history of data processing.	leo (computer)	Friedrich W.

2ddedecf2cdeb9c1b126d453518396b05028b178	seeing is believing: authenticating users with what they see and remember		Brainwaves, as external signals of a functioning brain, provide a possible glimpse into how we think and react. However, seen another way, we could reasonably expect that a given action or event could be linked back to its corresponding brainwave reaction. Recently, commercial products in the form of commercial brainwave headsets have flooded into the market, opening up the possibility of exploiting brainwaves for various purposes and making this more feasible. In this paper, we build an authentication system based on brainwave reactions to a chain of events. We use a commercially available brainwave headset to collect brainwave data of participants for use in the proposed authentication system. After the brainwave data collection process, we apply a machine learning-based approach to extract features from brainwaves to serve as authentication tokens in the system and to support the authentication system itself.	authentication	Wayne Chiu;Kuo-Hui Yeh;Akihito Nakamura	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-99807-7_24	brainwaves;data collection;wearable computer;chain of events;security token;human–computer interaction;headset;authentication;computer science	HCI	-59.96606091964392	2.2440425789258422	85680

At the completion of the project it was realized that to address the complexity of a Smart Grid with vast numbers of intelligent connected devices and systems, computational intelligence techniques must move from top-down to the lowest levels of architectures, with interactive cooperation between smart components, each with a level of autonomy. The CS-SGVP team emphasized creative thought leadership and “blue sky” thinking to identify future Smart Grid operational visions and the role of computing to achieve these visions. The CS-SGVP team developed its visions using a three-tiered approach. Architectural concepts describe Smart Grid goals and characteristics, general grid types, as well as computing concepts considered common across grid types. Functional concepts describe how the grid will operate. Technological concepts describe the roles of certain technologies within the Smart Grid. The CS-SGVP expects that over the course of many years, various visions will come to fruition.	autonomy;cs games;computational intelligence;thought leader;top-down and bottom-up design	David A.

09564c5faf45253aa28506e1c8483c808ee5b4c4	front matter		"""This volume contains the proceedings of the Special Topic Conference (STC) of the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI). The organisation of the STC is part of a long tradition of EFMI working groups to organise scientific events focused on important trends in medical informatics and eHealth. In 2016, the special topic is """"Transforming Healthcare with the Internet of Things"""" in relation to the EFMI working group Personal Portable Devices (PPD). STC 2016 takes place in Paris, France, organised by the Laboratoire d'Informatique Médicale et d'Ingénierie des Connaissances en e-Santé (LIMICS) under the auspices of EFMI and the French Association for Medical Informatics (AIM). Only a few years ago, devices were limited to health cards and personal portable devices. Since then, devices have dramatically evolved to include wearables, sensors, and actuators for measuring health values. The application of such technologies in the field of health, social care and wellness has attracted the attention of both patients and members of the general public interested in supporting or improving their health and wellbeing. One of the characteristics of these 'devices' (sometimes too small to observe thanks to nanotechnology) is to be 'connected' and to communicate with other connected devices and systems. This has been the game changer, as it replaces the cumbersome and often error-prone intervention of the human being who was previously necessary to enter data. The Internet of Things (IoT) is thus turning out to have a major impact on the information paradigm in healthcare. The patient can now become their own Chief Operational Officer, as described by Eric Topol in his recent book The Patient will see you now Eric Topol, The Patient Will See You Now, Basic Books, New York, 2015. . By providing tools that are able to generate large quantities of data that must be processed in real time, the IoT can have a potentially transformative effect on healthcare, allowing medicine and patient management to evolve from a discrete encounter-based process to a continuous patient-empowering management. This requires an adequate answer from traditionally organised healthcare, which will have to find ways to address new challenges related to respect for consumer privacy, cyber security and data integrity. STC 2016 deals with the convergence of a process originally fuelled by technical and scientific forces, and the current political forces driven by the sustainability agenda of health and social care. This emphasises the process to humanise the individual who is more and more connected and surrounded by the IoT. Our ambition is to concentrate on this debate and create a platform for these different dimensions of this unstoppable development. As a conclusion, we quote the Blue Line Statement presented at the 31th PCSI Conference in The Hague on October 16th 2015 in order to emphasise the transition of health and social care systems and the shift from care to citizen-driven health: In order to achieve meaningful improvements in the health of the population, it is essential to understand the combination of health and social care issues for people. This requires health and social care systems to be interoperable, both from a technological and semantic point of view. Care should be aligned around the person and strive for social interoperability between the professions serving them, and systems must be designed with empathy and respect as core underpinning values. The pillars of the Blue Line model represent key principles for the design and delivery of person-centred, integrated care systems. We encourage policymakers and health system leaders to adopt these principles and create the societal incentive framework to enable this vision to be realised. The Village Track participants of the PCSI Conference recommend that further support be sought to continuously develop and formalise the Blue Line principles as requirements for supporting holistic, person-centred, integrated care systems in the Netherlands, and beyond. STC Programme The call for papers has resulted in 70 submissions from 30 countries, which were peer-reviewed by over 160 highly appreciated experts of the EFMI biomedical informatics network. Over 400 authors and co-authors are involved in the accepted contributions that shape the programme. The conference starts with a key contribution from Bernard Benhamou entitled Internet of Things & Medicine: A European Perspective. Then, Peter Pharrow explains how 'We are entering the era of the Internet of (every)-Thing'. Christian Lovis, as the third keynote speaker, ends the conference by addressing the key to 'Moving from a care-driven system to a health-centred paradigm: active objects, data, and information'. The reviewing process has demonstrated that, up to now, the scientific work related to the IoT in healthcare has been focused on a mix of technologically-driven issues, but the potential to reform the health and social care systems is still underexploited. This can be seen as a positive sign, as the scientific world first wants to understand and prove the potential of the IoT before widely implementing it within the healthcare system. Accepted contributions reflect the scientific work on the impact of the IoT and the societal dimensions of the IoT in the sessions related to the transformation of healthcare, while the sessions on ontologies, decision support, clinical information systems, and data reuse complete the programme. To enrich the scientific sessions, the conference also offers tutorials, workshops, posters, short communications, demonstrations and a plenary panel. From Sunday 17th to Tuesday 19th April 2016, Paris will not only be the city of light, but also the centre for world-citizens involved in the changing of traditional health care. It is with respect for the history of French medicine that the LIMICS chose the """"Ecole de médecine"""" (created in 1794), as the historic, almost sacred, venue for STC 2016 to discuss the future of healthcare. On behalf of the Scientific Program Committee Jacob Hofdijk SPC team Brigitte Séroussi, Christian Lovis, Floor Sieverink, Frédéric Ehrler and Adrien Ugon."""	aim alliance;alignment;choose (action);cognitive dimensions of notations;computer security;consumer privacy;convergence (action);data integrity;decision support systems, clinical;decision support system;educational workshop;empathy;health care;holism;informatics (discipline);information systems;information system;internet of things;interoperability;maniac mansion;mobile device;occupations;ontology (information science);overall well being;paper;patients;physical object;polyp size additional dimensions:len:pt:specimen:qn;portable computer;posters;programming paradigm;quantity;requirement;reuse (action);review [publication type];scientific literature;venue (sound system);wearable computer;eric;sensor (device)	Al-Sadiq	1999	2016 Al-Sadeq International Conference on Multidisciplinary in IT and Communication Science and Applications (AIC-MITCSA)	10.1111/cgf.13381		HCI	-61.1439651390952	-8.57887945661571	87071

XML Security consists of three recommendations: XML (Digital) Signature, XML Encryption and XML Key Management Specification (XKMS), all of them published by the W3C. By means of a review of the available literature the authors draw several conclusions about the status quo of XML Security. Furthermore the current state and focuses of research as well as the existing challenges are derived. Trends to different application areas e.g. use of XML Security for Mobile Computing are also outlined. Based on this information the analyzed results are discussed and a future outlook is predicted.	key management;markup language;microsoft outlook for mac;mobile computing;xkms;xml encryption;xml signature	Andreas Ekelhart;Stefan Fenz;Gernot Goluch;Markus Steinkellner;Edgar R.

ab124120da8736b91e110ed36a5697cf5a97e112	guest editor's introduction: special section on the eurographics symposium on parallel graphics and visualization (egpgv)	special issues and sections;computer graphics;visualization;data visualization;meetings	THIS special section on Parallel Graphics and Visualization features extended versions of three selected papers from the Eurographics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization (EGPGV) in 2009. EGPGV 2009 was held in Munich, Germany, from 29-30 March 2009. It was the ninth event of this successful series of symposia, and was colocated with the Eurographics Annual Conference, which took place from 30 March to 3 April 2009. More information on EGPGV and its supporting Eurographics Working Group on Parallel Graphics can be found at http:// www.egpgv.org. EGPGV 2009 received 27 full paper submissions, which were reviewed by an International Program Committee with 23 members and by the three editors of the symposium proceedings (the symposium chair and the two paper cochairs). Each submission received three or more reviews, culminating with a final program that contained 14 papers, for an acceptance rate just short of 52 percent. Accepted papers for EGPGV 2009 covered a healthy range of topics from the fields of both computer graphics and visualization. The topics included simulation, global illumination, rendering, visualization, and general purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPUs), covering a wide variety of parallel computing platforms ranging from multicore to grid computing. Based on the reviewers’ comments and scoring as well as the quality of the oral presentations at EGPGV 2009, a committee that consisted of the proceedings editors and additional members selected three papers to be invited for submission to this special section of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). The authors extended their papers to include new additional material. The extended paper then underwent a full journal review process, including multiple cycles of editing and reviewing. The paper “GPU-Based Multilevel Clustering” by Iurie Chiosa and Andreas Kolb addresses the problem of mesh and data clustering. They present an efficient parallel algorithm for multilevel clustering, specifically designed for fast execution on GPUs. They demonstrate that their clustering method is useful for mesh clustering and general data clustering alike. “Parallel Iteration to the Radiative Transport in Inhomogeneous Media with Bootstrapping” by László SzirmayKalos, Gábor Liktor, Tamás Umenhoffer, Balázs Tóth, Shree Kumar, and Glenn Lupton presents a method to solve the radiative transport equation in inhomogeneous participating media. The proposed solution involves running a multiple-scattering solver in parallel on the GPU or across different nodes in a cluster. “Efficient Rasterization for Outdoor Radio Wave Propagation” by Arne Schmitz, Tobias Rick, Thomas Karolski, Torsten Kuhlen, and Leif Kobbelt considers the problem of simulating and propagating radio waves, which is more complex than the analogous light transport problem due to the fact that waves bend around corners because of diffraction. In this work, the authors present a parallel beam tracing solution to this problem. We would like to thank all members of the International Program Committee of EGPGV 2009, the external reviewers for EGPGV 2009, and the reviewers for the extended papers for TVCG for their help. We would also like to take this opportunity to thank Kurt Debattista for his great work as symposium chair and his support and help during the reviewing process of EGPGV 2009, as well as all of the people from the University of Warwick who designed and hosted the symposium Web pages. Finally, we thank the local organizers of the Eurographics Conference, Rüdiger Westermann and Joachim Georgii, who were very supportive of local arrangements for EGPGV 2009.	arne sølvberg;beam tracing;cluster analysis;colocation centre;computer graphics;eurographics;global illumination;graphics processing unit;grid computing;gábor n. sárközy;iteration;multi-core processor;parallel algorithm;parallel computing;radio wave;rasterisation;simulation;software propagation;solver;transportation theory (mathematics);web page	João Luiz Dihl Comba;Daniel Weiskopf	2011	IEEE Trans.

2953148cff8e644df648ef593a009cbeb4f61e29	ife has become csrd		During the past year, IFE has undergone a major change. After being a German-language journal for more than 20 years, it has now changed to English as the lingua franca in science and the language of choice for publishing scientific research results. This development is also reflected in IFE’s change of name: it will henceforth be called “Computer Science – Research and Development (CSRD)”. The focus of CSRD/IFE has also been widened to take into account the key role software plays as an integral part of many products in the Information Age. Just as software, the basic raw material of the Information Age, is connected to many neighbouring disciplines, CSRD publishes high-quality research and survey papers from the area of Software Engineering and Systems and its adjacent disciplines, including embedded systems, mobile systems, information systems, algorithm engineering, web engineering, ubiquitous computing, service-oriented architectures, model-driven architectures, process-oriented architectures and related topics. Contributions describing research in application areas such as mechanical engineering, medical engineering and medical technology, traffic engineering and environmental technology are also welcome. This change in CSRD/IFE’s language and focus has already been mirrored in the articles that have appeared in the journal over the past year. CSRD/IFE has published papers providing insight into topics such as embedded operating systems, algorithmic problems in drawing subway maps, industrial applications of model checking as well as software engineering applications in medical technology and medical	algorithm engineering;computer science;embedded operating system;embedded system;floor and ceiling functions;information system;map;model checking;model-driven architecture;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;software engineering;ubiquitous computing;web engineering	Sabine Glesner	2009	Computer Science - Research and Development	10.1007/s00450-009-0053-0	computer science;traffic engineering;health technology;software;real-time computing;systems engineering;special interest group;information system;ubiquitous computing;algorithm engineering;web engineering	SE	-55.287458216806726	-1.0780884959524446	90645

0d48ee94c9ae413dcb3a722f592736b962235957	the topology of covert conflict	file sharing;infectious disease;peer to peer	Often an attacker tries to disconnect a network by destroying nodes or edges, while the defender counters using various resilience mechanisms. Examples include a music industry body attempting to close down a peer-to-peer file-sharing network; medics attempting to halt the spread of an infectious disease by selective vaccination; and a police agency trying to decapitate a terrorist organisation. Albert, Jeong and Barabási famously analysed the static case, and showed that vertex-order attacks are effective against scale-free networks. We extend this work to the dynamic case by developing a framework based on evolutionary game theory to explore the interaction of attack and defence strategies. We show, first, that naive defences don’t work against vertex-order attack; second, that defences based on simple redundancy don’t work much better, but that defences based on cliques work well; third, that attacks based on centrality work better against clique defences than vertex-order attacks do; and fourth, that defences based on complex strategies such as delegation plus clique resist centrality attacks better than simple clique defences. Our models thus build a bridge between network analysis and evolutionary game theory, and provide a framework for analysing defence and attack in networks where topology matters. They suggest definitions of efficiency of attack and defence, and may even explain the evolution of insurgent organisations from networks of cells to a more virtual leadership that facilitates operations rather than directing them. Finally, we draw some conclusions and present possible directions for future research.	centrality;game theory;halting problem;peer-to-peer file sharing	Shishir Nagaraja;Ross J.

It uses some of the WWW features such as the ability to have multimedia documents, the simplicity of the HTLM syntax and particularly the Web's networked structure. The basic idea is, that on the one side there is an instrumentation pool, that means a number of instruments located anywhere in the world. On the other side a detailed description of the instrument and its front panel are available on the WEB and can be accessed by any Web browser for a specific declared usersgroup. This link permits students to learn the use of advanced measurement equipment, to perform real measurements with instruments not available at the University.	front panel;virtual world;www;world wide web	Thomas Zimmer;Patrice Kadionik;Yves Danto	1997		10.1109/MSE.1997.612572	web service;sensor web;embedded system;automatic test equipment;web development;web modeling;the internet;simulation;data web;web mapping;web-based simulation;web design;web accessibility initiative;web standards;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;web navigation;web page;virtual reality;multimedia;web intelligence;web 2.0;world wide web;web server	Web+IR	-54.28881731794988	3.5097008618338967	91420

Thus, advertisers, online-advertising hosts, and the technology vendors that support them are always looking for better ways to get potential customers to look at their material. This is particularly the case because banner ads and other types of online promotions have proven easy to ignore. Now, though, the Internet advertising community is trying something new with an old technology: widgets. Widgets are portable, lightweight Web applications that can be embeded in an HTML-based page.	html;internet;online advertising;software widget;web application;web banner	George Lawton	2007	Computer	10.1109/MC.2007.256	online advertising;the internet;computer science;advertising;internet privacy;world wide web;contextual advertising	Web+IR	-56.41058915862953	3.3296725924394623	92288

The resulting integration of information and control permits efficient and effective management of complex man-made systems. Examples include transportation systems, buildings, electrical grids, health care systems, governments, and supply chains. Achieving this vision requires extensive data integration and analysis, over diverse, rapidly changing, and often uncertain data. There are many challenges, requiring both new data management techniques as well as new mathematics, forcing new collaborations as the basis of the new “Data Science”. Needs and opportunities will be discussed in the context of specific pilots and projects. 1.

At the time, Information Systems consisted of a combined computing/library User Services group, Systems & LAN Management, Network Managemert~ and the Electronic Studio research& development group. User Services had one consultant deployed in each of five divisions. With the new approach, we decentralize customer support staff from all of Information Systems into the academic divisions while maintaining core services in other areas.	customer support;information systems;information system	Andrea Martin;Beth Shapiro;Vicky Dean	1995		10.1145/219894.223030	systems engineering;knowledge management;management science	OS	-62.70681688860922	-0.09813046674302549	94514

But the utility of these information engines may be affected mostly by the design of last few inches connecting the human to the machine. Dr. Furness will relate lessons learned in a 36 year quest to develop advanced display technology culminating in his invention of the virtual retinal display, a means for scanning an image directly onto the retina of the eye. The unique resolution and luminance characteristics of the VRD make it ideal for wearable computing applications. Dr. Furness received a BS degree in Electrical Engineering from Duke University and Ph.D. in Engineering and Applied Science from the University of Southampton, England. He is currently a professor of Industrial Engineering and adjunct professor of Electrical Engineering and Technical Communication at the University of Washington, and is the founding director of the Human Interface Technology Laboratory at the Washington Technology Center. Prior to joining the faculty at the University, he served a combined 23 years as an officer and civilian at the Armstrong Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where he developed advanced cockpits and virtual interfaces for the Department of Defense. Dr. Furness is the inventor of the personal eyewear display, the virtual retinal display, the HALO display, and other display and interface technologies. In 1998, Dr. Furness received the Discover Award for Technology Innovation for his invention of the Virtual Retinal Display.

The software implications of these protocols for mobile computing need focus. The use of UML is excellent. The cases showing how to use UML are insightful. I am looking forward to a heavily edited second edition containing just the application software structures that is the merit of the book. I recommend the book to software developers building application for nomadic and mobile users. There are no problems for professors to use as homework assignments and has little theory. Except for the jargon it is an easy read-but very, very long. So, with a title """" Hibernate: A J2EE Developer's Guide """" and a printing of January 2005, I opened this book with the expectation that it will teach its reader about Hibernate within the context of J2EE. I also thought that it would address the latest version of Hibernate – i.e. one of the 3.x versions. The first thing I did was open the preface – always a good place to start – and I found a Roadmap telling the reader that the book was basically written to be read in two ways depending on user inclinations ; chapters 2-5 for a real world introduction via code examples and chapters 6-9 which are higher-level introductions. So the reader can proceed straight through to learn from examples first (my personal preference) or can read the theory section first and then run through the examples. The later chapters, 10-13, discuss more advanced issues of performance, application schema management, general best practices, and future directions for Hibernate. So with that under my belt, I was looking forward to a good read, some exemplary code, and hopefully some insight into more advanced features and best practices. More Java Gems is a collection of articles appearing in the now out-of-print magazine Java Report selected and introduced by Dwight Deugo, and published by Cambridge University Press, © 2000, 484 pp., 0-521-77477-2 (paperback), out of print (available online for around $4.00). This book is a second collection of 34 thematically-arranged articles from the Java Review magazine which published from 1996 through December of 2001. Chapter 1 is entitled Overview so you would expect an overview of O/R Mapping and an explanation why it is hard but at the same time necessary for any medium to large software projects.

d4e9889a5aab5be3b94284d0e1b09411eee579d6	hassan a. karimi, amin hammad, editors, , telegeoinformatics: location-based computing and services (2004) crc press, boca raton, fl 0415369762 (392 pp., us$99.95 hardback)		Location-based services (LBS) have emerged from the combination of recent technological advances in wireless communication, mobile computing, and positioning systems. As might be expected for this relatively new area of study, the topic of location-based services remains rather ill-defined and nebulous. This book aims to consolidate the fundamentals of LBS and to provide a complete introduction to LBS for students, academics, and industry professionals. The book is an edited collection of chapters by different authors, and includes contributions from wellknown academics in the fields of geographic information science, computer science, and engineering. The structure of the book is clear and logical, with three distinct sections progressing from fundamentals in part one, through integrated systems in part two, to applications of LBS in part three. Part one contains chapters on remote sensing (Chapter 2), positioning (Chapter 3), and wireless communications (Chapter 4). All three of these chapters are authoritative and provide good coverage of their respective topics. In general these chapters are well written, although often technical to an extent that may discourage student readers of the book. Most of this early material is not specific to LBS, and so can also be found in the standard texts on on remote sensing, positioning, and wireless communications. Thus, the chapters constitute a useful reference, but readers who are comfortable with these topics can safely skip forward to part two. An introductory chapter in part one (Chapter 1) seemed to have been written as an afterthought and did not contribute much to the book. As an example, Chapter 1 includes about six pages of technical specifications for well-known GIS software packages (e.g., disk space, memory, and operating system requirements), which one might more easily find by browsing the Web. Part two begins with an overview of the architecture of LBS (Chapter 5), focusing primarily on client-server architectures, but ending with a brief look at mobile ad hoc networks. Chapter 6 offers an upbeat industry	client–server model;computer engineering;computer science;cyclic redundancy check;disk space;geographic information science;hoc (programming language);integrated circuit;location-based service;mobile computing;operating system;requirement;server (computing);system requirements;world wide web	Matt Duckham	2005	Computers & Geosciences	10.1016/j.cageo.2005.04.003	data mining;computer science;media studies	HCI	-57.83658628456329	-0.012324122984326105	97384

fa627c374b6ed5d38cf22b645f05dade0666ee35	introduction to the ches 2012 special issue		The 14th International Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES 2012) was held at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, during September 9–12, 2012. This special issue presents expanded versions of 5 of the best ranked papers from the CHES Workshop. The CHES Workshop covers new results on all aspects of the design and analysis of cryptographic hardware and software implementations. The workshop builds a bridge between the cryptographic research community and the cryptographic engineering community. Since its inception in 1999, CHES has grown into the flagship event for the cryptographic engineering community. In this special issue, you will find 5 of the best ranked papers among the 120 submissions received by the workshop. These papers were identified based on the review scores of the CHES review process, and the expanded journal submissions of these papers received an additional, independent peer-review. The five papers in this special issue reflect the broad spectrum of topics that is typically found in a CHES workshop and include physical hardware security, novel hardware architectures, and novel implementation attacks using faults and side-channel analysis. The first paper, “Simple Photonic Emission Analysis of AES”, is by Alexander Schlösser, Dmitry Nedospasov, Juliane Krämer, Susanna Orlic, and Jean-Pierre Seifert. The authors describe how direct optical observation of on-chip transistor switching enables sidechannel analysis.

We propose that by using nanotechnology we could embed computation and sensing directly into the material used for construction. Intelligent concrete blocks and panels advanced with stimuli-responsive smart paints are the core of the proposed architecture. In particular, the photo-responsive paint would sense the buildings internal and external environment while the nano-materialconcrete composite material would be capable of sensing the building environment and implement massive-parallel information processing resulting in distributed decision making.

The emergent technology sees a building as high-level massiveparallel computer — assembled of computing concrete blocks. Based on the generic principles of neuromorphic computation and reservoir computing we envisage a single building or an urban quarter to turn into a large-scale sensing substrate. It could behave as a universal computer, collecting and processing environmental information in situ enabling appropriate data fusion. The broad range of spatio-temporal effects include infrastructural and human mobility, energy, bio-diversity, digital activity, urban management, art and socializing, robustness with regard to damage and noise or real-time monitoring of environmental changes. The proposed intelligent architectures will increase sustainability and viability in digitised urban environments by decreasing information transfer bandwidth by e.g, utilising 5G networks. The emergence of socio-cultural effect will create a cybernetic relationship with our dwellings and cities.	andrew adamatzky;applied computer science;british informatics olympiad;computation;computer engineering;computer-aided design;cybernetics;emergence;gnu nano;high- and low-level;information processing;neuromorphic engineering;real-time clock;reservoir computing;socialization;unconventional computing;universal turing machine	Andrew Adamatzky;Konrad Szacilowski;Dawid Przyczyna;Zoran Konkoli;Georgios Ch.

Many new communications equipments are being procured. Existing approaches to military simulation modeling have, for good reasons, not concentrated on command and control (C2), but this is now changing. The author proposes an approach to the modeling of military command systems based on Searle's theory of speech acts, and suggests that it may have broader application than modeling C2 alone.	control system;network-enabled capability;simulation;x86	John David Salt	2004	Proceedings of the 2004 Winter Simulation Conference, 2004.		command and control;simulation;engineering;simulation modeling;mission command;computer security;computer engineering	Robotics	-60.24675008568467	-0.41257047306434186	102662
30c3b5fba801fb1ca9753bbdf6b77336718de08f	special issue: selected papers from the fourth international ieee symposium on advanced networks and telecommunication systems (ieee ants 2010)		The Fourth International Symposium on Advanced Networks and Telecommunication Systems (ANTS) (http://www.ieee-comsoc-ants.org/2010/) was held in Mumbai, India, during December 16–18, 2010, at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay (Mumbai). The theme of ANTS-2010 continued to focus on communication systems and networking technologies for realizing converged ubiquitous broadband connectivity. ANTS2010 presented technical sessions, peer-reviewed and invited, industry talks and government panels, that related to networking technologies and telecommunication design principles in access, metro, and core areas, in three parallel tracks and plenary sessions. ANTS continued to follow its original design vision of fostering interaction between industry, academia, and government; between Indian technologists and those overseas; and between service providers and network equipment vendors. ANTS-2010 received 89 submissions (three-page extended summaries) from the open call for peer-reviewed papers. The Technical Program Committee selected 16 papers for oral presentation and another 14 for poster presentation. The authors of four of these papers, after careful review by the Guest Editors of this issue, were invited to submit full-length versions for potential publication in this Special Issue of the Optical Switching and Networking (OSN) journal. After a thorough reviewprocess, as followed with regular OSN submissions, all the invited papers have been selected for publication in this Special Issue. In ‘‘Evaluation of Post-Fault Restoration Strategies in Multi-Domain Networks’’, Feng Xu, Tamal Das, M. Peng, and Nasir Ghani investigate the use of loose routes based on abstracted domain information to restore paths upon failure in multi-domain IP/MPLS and DWDM networks, as compared to domain-by-domain crankback. The performance of these approaches is studied by simulation.

Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration in the National Airspace System is a NASA research project that addresses the integration of civil UAS into non-segregated airspace operations. One of the major challenges of this integration is the lack of an on-board pilot to comply with the legal requirement that pilots see and avoid other aircraft. The need to provide an equivalent to this requirement for UAS has motivated the development of a detect and avoid (DAA) capability to provide the appropriate situational awareness and maneuver guidance in avoiding and remaining well clear of traffic aircraft. Formal methods has played a fundamental role in the development of this capability. This talk reports on the formal methods work conducted under NASA’s Safe Autonomous System Operations project in support of the development of DAA for UAS. This work includes specification of low-level and high-level functional requirements, formal verification of algorithms, and rigorous validation of software implementations.

The ALWAC IIIE at ADB Institute, Gothenburg, was used for technical as well as for administrative applications. Another episode concerns reengineering of an inventory management application; it used the ALWAC IIIE for the Swedish Defence Material Administration in 1960. The next episode concerns the computer Univac III. A sales contract between Götaverken AB and Univac included a guarantee by Univac to transfer one of Götaverken’s punched card routines to a magnetic tape oriented routine on Univac III. The development work was carried out on a Univac III at Kantonalbank in Bern, Switzerland. They did the work in night shifts during a period of five months. Only one Univac III was installed in Sweden.	alwac iii-e;apple desktop bus;code refactoring;computer;information system;inventory;punched card;software development process;switzerland;univac	Janis A.

8280c60fbca8deab82ef2a9373f9a972807a5174	proceedings 2nd workshop on graph inspection and traversal engineering, graphite 2013, rome, italy, march 24, 2013		These are the proceedings of the Second Workshop on GRAPH Inspection and Traversal Engineering (GRAPHITE 2013), which took place on March 24, 2013 in Rome, Italy, as a satellite event of the 16th European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2013). The topic of the GRAPHITE workshop is graph analysis in all its forms in computer science. Graphs are used to represent data in many application areas, and they are subjected to various computational algorithms in order to acquire the desired information. These graph algorithms tend to have common characteristics, such as duplicate detection to guarantee their termination, independent of their application domain. Over the past few years, it has been shown that the scalability of such algorithms can be dramatically improved by using, e.g., external memory, by exploiting parallel architectures, such as clusters, multi-core CPUs, and graphics processing units, and by using heuristics to guide the search. Novel techniques to further scale graph search algorithms, and new applications of graph search are within the scope of this workshop. Another topic of interest of the event is more related to the structural properties of graphs: which kind of graph characteristics are relevant for a particular application area, and how can these be measured? Finally, any novel way of using graphs for a particular application area is on topic. The goal of this event is to gather scientists from different communities, such as model checking, artificial intelligence planning, game playing, and algorithm engineering, who do research on graph search algorithms, such that awareness of each others' work is increased.	algorithm engineering;application domain;artificial intelligence;central processing unit;computation;computer cluster;computer graphics;computer science;european joint conferences on theory and practice of software;extreme programming practices;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;graph traversal;graphics processing unit;graphite;heuristic (computer science);list of algorithms;model checking;multi-core processor;off topic;scalability;search algorithm;tree traversal	Anton Wijs;Dragan Bovsnavcki;Stefan Edelkamp	2013		10.4204/EPTCS.138	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;mathematics;graph;programming language;graph database;algorithm	AI	-48.76888080429835	0.3500378954568514	106178

Both card and mobile NFC’s are widely accepted by almost all supermarkets in many countries. The usability of NFC payments not only depends on the NFC card/mobile used but also on the payment terminal used in the supermarkets. To evaluate the usability of NFC payments, observations and exit interviews were conducted in 6 different supermarkets in Vienna, Austria. We had a total 160 observations and 179 exit interviews. The above-mentioned data was analyzed and the results portrayed that NFC payments suffer several usability issues. The results show that users face lack of proper information, lack of feedback and consistency while paying with NFCs.	near field communication	Poornigha Santhana Kumar;Michael Bechinie;Manfred Tscheligi	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-92285-0_43	multimedia;marketing;payment terminal;saucer;payment;usability;near field communication;computer science	ECom	-61.22777343909505	-0.34419512931689905	110212

Companies increasingly like to focus on their core expertise area and use IT services to address all their peripheral needs. Services Computing is a new science which aims to study and better understand the foundations of this highly popular industry. It covers the science and technology of leveraging computing and information technology to model, create, operate, and manage business services. Since 2004, the International Conference on Services Computing (SCC) has provided a platform for practitioners to present the latest advances in services science. Like its predecessors, SCC 2009 will contribute in building the pillars of this important science and shaping the future of Service Computing.Services Computing currently shapes the thinking of business modeling, business consulting, solution creation, service delivery, and software architecture design, development and deployment. The global nature of Services Computing leads to many opportunities and challenges and creates a new networked economic structure for supporting different business models. SCC 2009 will help in bridging the gap between business services and information technology by driving research in technologies such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), business process integration and management, service engineering and grid/utility computing and Web 2.0. The theme of the conference is """"Innovation in Globally Integrated Services"""". SCC 2009 will have the following major tracks: Foundations of Services Computing, Service Computing Practices and Applications and Business Aspects of Service Computing.SCC 2009 is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Services Computing. SCC 2004 was held in Shanghai, China, September 15-18, 2004 . SCC 2005 was co-located with ICWS 2005 on July 11-15, 2005 in Orlando, Florida, USA. SCC 2006 was co-located with ICWS 2006 on September 18-22, 2006 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. SCC 2007 was co-located with ICWS 2007 on July 9-13, 2007 in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. SCC 2008 was held on July 8-11, 2008, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. The SCC Proceedings has been included in EI Compendex.SCC 2009 will concentrate on the science and technology of Business/Application Services and the bridging technologies such as Business Strategy and Design, Business Process Integration and Management, Grid and Utility Computing, and SOA Services and Solutions; while the 2009 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2009) will continue to put its focus on all aspects of Web based services from infrastructure and application perspectives; IEEE Congress on Services (SERVICES 2009) covers innovations in all vertical services industries and education agenda."""	authentication;automated reasoning;binary prefix;bridging (networking);business process execution language;business process;computer security model;confidentiality;digital identity;entity;itil;integrated services;interaction;international conference on services computing;international conference on web services;metamodeling;model-driven architecture;network security;noise shaping;peripheral;precondition;requirement;service layer;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;software architecture;software deployment;utility computing;ws-securitypolicy;web 2.0;web service	Michael Menzel;Christoph Meinel	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing	10.1109/SCC.2009.57	engineering;software engineering;industrialization of services business model;services computing;world wide web;computer security	Visualization	-58.740296189437956	-3.656345733288042	112998

In the future, human beings will live in a smart environment where both life and work are well addressed by technology, whereas humans will be responsible only for providing creativity. For this purpose, we have organized the first 2015 Smart World Congress, including five IEEE International Conferences. Specifically, a variety of challenges are presented in the field of smart world. Therefore, an open forum on the top ten challenges (Top10Cs) for smart worlds was held under the congress to identify the main challenges through collecting the intelligence existing particularly in crowd wisdom. Top10Cs and related works, as a crowdsourcing approach, discuss and analyze the top challenges for smart worlds based on the selective results of the crowd and experts via an online platform. Moreover, we summarize the experiences obtained in organizing the Top10Cs forum.	crowdsourcing;embedded system;international federation for information processing;organizing (structure);smart tv;smart city;smart environment;smart objects;smart system;wisdom of the crowd	Jianhua Ma;Yumei Zheng;Huangsheng Ning;Laurence Tianruo Yang;Runhe Huang;Hong Liu;Qitao Mu;Stephen S.

While people in a group share a definite common task goal, people in a society share their knowledge resources and reuse them to produce new ones. The augmentation of societies requires a new type of media that can carry varieties of knowledge resources, replicate themselves, recombine themselves, and be naturally selected by their environment. They may be called meme media since they carry what R. Dawkins called “memed’. The accumulation of memes in a society will form a meme pool, which will work as a gene pool to bring a rapid evolution of knowledge resources shared by this society. We need a world-wide repository of memes, and a good browser to access this repository. This repository works as a marketplace where people can publish memes, browse through them, and reuse some of them. This paper reviews IntelligentPad as a meme media architecture, and proposes two new system architectures that work as marketplace systems for meme media.	browsing;gene pool;meme;self-replicating machine;tree accumulation	Yuzuru Tanaka	1996		10.1145/244130.244190	shared resource;natural selection;computer science;data mining;multimedia;world wide web;systems architecture	Web+IR	-59.67356356533663	3.5074779634251616	120474

In that time it has grown from a small solvers project to a large, comprehensive library development effort for scalable computational science and engineering applications. In this collection of articles we present a broad discussion of many of the recent developments in Trilinos. The special issue is divided into two journal issues, the first issue (Scientific Programming, Volume 20, Number 2, 2012) contains an updated overview of the project and a collection of papers discussing tools to set up and manage data and problem definition. With this collection of tools, users can quickly build problem definitions and set up data needed by the solvers. The second issue (Scientific Programming, Volume 20, Number 3, 2012) contains papers on the next generation of equation solvers in Trilinos. These new solvers encode the latest in solver algorithms and are designed for execution on scalable manycore systems. Part two of this issue also includes a discussion of four problem solving environments that present a certain perspective on the capabilities in Trilinos, providing users with a high-level environment that caters to specific problem domains.	algorithm;computational engineering;computational science;encode;high- and low-level;manycore processor;multi-core processor;problem domain;problem solving;scalability;solver;trilinos	Michael A.

In this paper, we step back and consider the software process model itself as a key artifact that can be enacted and semi automated. We support our vision by proposing an architecture for a cloud-based software processes modelling and enactment environment which integrates software development tools and maintains repositories of modelling artifacts and the history of development. © 2014 Newcastle University.

"""" We no longer agonize over what kind of electricity to supply to our house, via what kind of wires, from what kind of dynamo, and which sockets to install. It's standardized and all we see are the appliances that consume the electricity. Here, we're going to take a much narrower view of this question than another article 1 that starts with the premise that the Web is effectively its applications, thus making the Web invisible by fiat. This column will be much more of a backward look than a prediction. Before we talk about """" the Web """" becoming so pervasive, ubiquitous, and standardized that it becomes invisible, we should be clear on what """" it """" is (apologies to Bill Clinton). Fundamentally, for the Web's first versions, there were two protocols: HTTP for transactions and HTML for display. Browsers and serv-ers compliant with these protocols implemented the World Wide Web. This is still true today, except that the protocols have become dramatically more complicated and allow much more functionality. When I first saw and started implementing web-pages back in 1993, you really only needed to know 10 HTML commands to get started: beginning the webpage, beginning the content, paragraph breaks, and line breaks, along with their partner end commands (except, strangely, for line breaks) would allow you to write a page. Another slightly complicated command would let you make links to other pages. That's five. The other five were defining a header, including images, setting fonts, bolding text, and centering text. Then, you could also (if inclined) use another three commands to create basic tables. Essentially, this work was simple and incremental. More complicated commands existed for menus and posting, using choices to a background server that would then return another page constructed according to user choices. After that came RSS that would let the user subscribe to changes in a website. And then, even though Tim Berners-Lee disparaged the term """" Web 2.0 """" (see http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/ Tim_Berners-Lee) when it emerged around 2006, 2 it implemented the kind of interactivity that he intended for the original Web. But now old school was out. You had to at least know Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) just to make nice displays, and you had to use sophisticated Web creation software.

As disk sizes begin to exceed two terabytes and hardware vendors begin to transition from BIOS to EFI, understanding GPT disks in forensic examinations becomes useful. This practitioner paper provides an overview of the GUID Partition Table (GPT) scheme from the perspective of the digital forensic investigator. Methods of analysis and acquisition are shown, and artifacts of forensic relevance are identi ed. The target audience for this paper is digital forensic practitioners and forensic tool developers.	bios;computer;dos;guid partition table;relevance;terabyte;unified extensible firmware interface	Bruce J.

148ec6fde7241f128cab5ff718646e1d6da00730	a case study of anonymization of medical surveys		Health data anonymization is a hot topic, on which both the medical and the computer science communities have made a great effort to provide a safer and trustful way of sharing data among research centers and hospitals.The main challenge in data anonymization is to provide a proper trade off between the utility of the resulting data/models and protecting individual privacy.In this paper we present a real anonymization case, with particular emphasis on choices that have to be made to carry it on, and difficulties experienced using a data set with many dimensions, and not well distinguishable features. We present our approach for evaluating disclosure risks and methods for anonymising high-dimensional medical survey data and measuring the utility of the transformed data.	computer science;data anonymization	Michele Gentili;Sara Hajian;Carlos Castillo	2017		10.1145/3079452.3079490	data mining;safer;survey data collection;trade-off;medicine;data anonymization	ML	-49.27785299968287	3.9236380052140825	128114

However, there are certain key issues that are preventing the field from addressing larger domains and from achieving wide-scale impact. Formulating these as grand challenges arguably focuses attention on these key issues and may bring a critical mass of effort to bear that could result in a major leap forward. This article is one of several concurrent activities aimed at reinvigorating the debate on grand challenges in M&S. These grand challenges include Big Simulation, human behavior, composability, cloud-based M&S, reproducibility in M&S research and the democratization of M&S. Two themes emerge: the need for large-scale cloud-based cyberinfrastructures for M&S and the democratized access to M&S and its outputs.	cyberinfrastructure;grand challenges;simulation	Simon J. E.

02b6367c41a81ab73925fe6cba8723e549057fd6	the international conference on consumer electronics?china [conference reports]		T he IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics– China (ICCE–China) 2016 was held at the Guangzhou National Integrated Circuits Design Industrialization Center for Modern Service Industry in Guangzhou, China, on 19–21 De cember. The conference objective was to serve as a platform in China for ex perts to exchange ideas and learn from one another. As the average wealth of a population increases, consumers can begin to afford more advanced products. Therefore, there is an increasing need for engineers to study fundamental theory and techniques for the development of advanced consumer products. To help meet this need, this conference focused on exchanging ideas in signal processing and consumer health care for the development of such advanced CE products. There were six major themes: ▼ signal processing, with a focus on the development of speech, audio, music, image, video, and multimedia applications ▼ biomedical engineering in the development of health monitoring, healthcare, and biomedical applications ▼ power saving, power monitoring, and power management applications ▼ smart control in home automation, home control, home monitoring, and home robot applications ▼ consumer networking, covering the Internet of Things, wireless, and cloud system applications ▼ optics, electronic devices, and circuits, with a focus on the development of CE circuits, sensors, and devices and their optical applications. ICCE–China participants came up with novel ideas and results in the areas of both theoretical breakthroughs and new CE applications. The fruitful results are expected to nurture professionals and students as well as generate revenue. The conference consisted of regular sessions, special sessions, tutorials, and keynotes, together comprehensively covering the aforementioned six themes. IEEE CE Society Past President Stefan Mozar and ICCE–China 2016 General Chair Prof. Wing-Kuen Ling delivered the opening keynote addresses. Ling then offered the first plenary talk, “Optimization for Time Frequency for Biomedical Consumer Electronics,” which presented optimization techniques for performing time–frequency analysis in the development of wearable biomedical CE products. These include such systems as those for classifying viral infections and bacterial infections based on coughing sounds, for classifying supraventricular tachycardias and ventricular Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/MCE.2017.2684900 Date of publication: 14 June 2017 Prof. Wing-Kuen Ling, conference general chair, delivers the opening keynote.	control theory;domestic robot;frequency analysis;home automation;identifier;integrated circuit;internet of things;mathematical optimization;power management;rsa conference;sensor;signal processing;time–frequency analysis;wearable computer	W.

The first efforts used the “waterfall” system life cycle as the framework and emphasized such tools as flowcharts, decision logic tables, and record layout forms. Today, the numbers of systems methodologies and tools have exploded, giving instructors much latitude in designing courses. As a way to understand how systems analysis and design is being taught at the undergraduate level, the author conducted a mail survey of 1,947 college instructors teaching the course. The instructors’ names and addresses were obtained from the Campus Marketing Group mailing list and from the McGraw-Hill MIS Directory; the publishing company Dryden/Harcourt Brace & Co. sent each instructor a Raymond McLeod, Jr.	flowchart;logic programming;numerical analysis;row (database);structured systems analysis and design method;system lifecycle;waterfall model	Raymond McLeod	1996	Commun.

However, shortage of equipment, high costs, and the lack of human resources for laboratory maintenance and assistance decrease the implementation capacity of the hands-on training laboratories. At the same time, the Internet has become a common networking medium and is increasingly used to enhance education and training. In addition, experimental equipment at many sites is typically underutilized. Thus, remote laboratories accessible through the Internet can resolve cost and access constraints as they can be used at flexible times and from various locations. While many solutions have been proposed so far, this paper addresses an important issue of facilitating remote lab deployments by providing remote connectivity services to lab providers using a Relay Gateway Server architecture. A proof-of-concept solution is described which also includes other previously reported useful features. The system has been tested in engineering labs and student assessment is provided.	computer engineering;cryptographic hash function;experiment;hands-on computing;internet;relay	Arsen Melkonyan;Andreas Gampe;Murillo Pontual;Grant Huang;David Akopian	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2242416	the internet;simulation;computer science;electrical engineering;multimedia;computer engineering	Mobile	-54.82818995986937	3.2527475472950016	130513
2cc34dea2eb384ee259a92056263dab51970f4fe	theme issue on identification, information, and knowledge in the internet of things	journal	The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is providing many bright prospects to the public. Indeed, most of them such as smart cities and communities, intelligent transportation systems, mobile health, and smart agriculture are stepping into our views. Achieving the benefits of IoT requires the fusion and management of vast amounts of heterogeneous data using knowledge-based decision systems and the integration of technologies including RFID, sensor networks, NFC, Bluetooth, Zigbee, WiFi and WiMAX. Many challenges exist, including how to correctly identify things in IoT, how to integrate and transfer enriched data, how to collect and process information, how to retrieve the knowledge automatically from the big data, how to share the knowledge among smart things, and how to ensure the information security and protect the privacy. This theme issue aims to explore identification, information, and knowledge in the Internet of Things. In particular, it intends to investigate the data models required, and the information processing and knowledge discovery techniques to analyze interactions across spaces, and to study how collaboration and interaction in the Internet of Things can be facilitated leveraging the best practices developed in social computing, social and community intelligence, wireless sensor networks, and business service-oriented computing. This issue is in collaboration with three international events: IIKI2012 (International workshop on Identification, Information, and Knowledge in the Internet of Things 2012) in Wuxi, China (http://ireg.bnu.edu.cn/IIKI2012/), KAMIoT2012 (International workshop on Knowledge Acquisition and Management in the Internet of Things 2012) in Liverpool, UK (http://www.seba.bnu.edu.cn/ KAMIoT2012), and WASA2012 (The 7th International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems, and Applications) in Huangshan, China. In addition, an open call for papers was also announced and circulated. At the end of the review process, we accepted seven papers for this theme issue. Each of the papers was peer-reviewed by at least two experts in the field. In the following, we provide a brief introduction to each paper. The first paper titled ‘‘A Truthful Auction Mechanism for Channel Allocation in Multi-Radio, Multi-Channel Non-Cooperative Wireless Networks’’ by Zuying Wei et al. proposes a strategy-proof and highly efficient channel auction mechanism for multi-radio wireless networks. The proposed SHIELD not only guarantees strategy-proofness in the process of channel redistribution, but also achieves high system performance. The evaluation results show that SHIELD outperforms the existing mechanisms in terms of spectrum utilization and user satisfaction ratio. The second paper titled ‘‘SPRITE: A Novel Strategyproof Multi-unit Double Auction Scheme for Spectrum Allocation in Ubiquitous Communications’’ by Yu-e Sun et al. presents a novel Strategy-PRoof multI-unitdouble aucTion schEme (SPRITE) which establishes a series of bid-related buyer group construction and winner determination strategies and improves the spectrum reusability and achieves sound spectrum utilization, fairness, and essential economic properties.

At the center of such a business is fast access to data. Note that the user data in an RTB system is changing constantly since the choice of actions at every user visit needs to take into account past behavior of that user. So, such RTB applications need databases that provide predictable sub-millisecond latency for reads in the presence of heavy write load.	big data;data system;database;real-time bidding;real-time transcription	Srini Srinivasan	2014			competitive advantage;data mining;computer science;big data	DB	-61.20916891782567	0.9265702567642871	132041

In particular, starting from a standard environment providing remote access to a set of experiments, the telelaboratory is now organized as a collection of learning objects, i.e., modular didactic units designed following specific learning objectives within control systems and robotic fields. The telelaboratory has a remote Web-based access which can be used both as a simulation environment and as a remote way of performing real physical experiments. The developed telelaboratory is based on free open-source software such as Scilab/Scicos, Comedi, and real-time application interface patch for Linux kernels. In-house software tools, such as a Java Web hyper modular interface system, graphic environment tools, and a virtual laboratory interface based on Java applets, have been developed as a support for the learning process.	control system;experiment;in-house software;java applet;linux;open-source software;rtai;real-time computing;real-time transcription;robot;scicos;scilab;simulation	Aldo Balestrino;Andrea Caiti;Emanuele Crisostomi	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.2006941	embedded system;simulation;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;operating system;linux kernel	Robotics	-54.37860559534484	3.3424385512500776	138182

However. aviation systems are getting more and more complex. So, formal methods have no hope to address these systems unless some compositional argument is being made. In this talk, I will present the results of the effort led by NASA to demonstrate the use of formal methods and compositional verification for the V & V of safety requirements of a flight critical system. The talk will show how the formal arguments made at the component level are being composed into a system-level argument. The study is done on Simulink models for a quad-redundant flight control system for a transport class airplane.

(abstract)		"""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has endeavored to develop a consistent method of assuring the credibility of simulation results. Requirements like """"accurate enough for a particular use"""" present problems. How do you measure accuracy? What has to be accurate? What factors are measured? How do you quantify “enough for the particular use?” Which functions are measured? When during the simulated time are they measured? How do you state uncertainty requirements? These are but a few of the specifics that make writing defendable requirements for simulations many orders of magnitude more difficult that writing requirements for other software. NASA-STD-7009 presents a Credibility Assessment Scale (CAS) containing eight criteria grouped into three categories that attempts to quantify factors influencing simulation credibility. This paper identifies these criteria, provides straightforward definitions and introduces typical methods of assessment. NASA Recognizes the Need for Consistent Measures of M&S Credibility The genesis of NASA’s recent emphasis on assuring the validity of simulations and the credibility of simulation studies is the Columbia Accident Investigation Report (CAIB). It called for NASA to “develop, validate, and maintain physics-based computer models to evaluate Thermal Protection System damage from debris impacts. These tools should provide realistic and timely estimates of any impact damage from possible debris from any source that may ultimately impact the Orbiter. Establish impact damage thresholds that trigger responsive corrective action, such as on-orbit inspection and repair, when indicated.” The Renewed Commitment to Excellence, or Diaz Report, broadened the scope beyond the Space Transportation System. Diaz action item four called for NASA to “develop a standard for the development, documentation, and operation of models and simulations (M&S): 1 This paper draws most of its information from NASA-STD-7009. Unless otherwise noted all references are to that standard. 1 http://standards.nasa.gov/released/NASA/NASA_STD_7009_APPROVED_2008_07_11.pdf 2 http://caib.nasa.gov/ 3 http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/55691main_Diaz_020204.pdf • Documentation, configuration management, and quality assurance • Verification and validation, operational data and trending • Tool management, maintenance, and obsolescence • Training requirements • Best practices for user interfaces • User feedback when results appear unrealistic” The Stafford-Covey Report 4 enjoined “formal development, verification and validation, and outside review plans”. It added that “assumptions should be written down and consistently applied.” Finally it required that “sensitivity analysis and careful analysis of uncertainty were to be performed.” These commitments were to be agency wide. The Chief Engineer Memo’s required that the credibility of M&S results is properly conveyed to those making critical decisions, and that analysts should assure that the credibility of M&S meets the project requirements. NASA was to establish M&S requirements and recommendations that will form a strong foundation for disciplined (structure, management, control) development, validation and use of M&S within NASA and its contractor community, include a standard method to assess the credibility of the M&S presented to the decision maker when making critical decisions (i.e., decisions that effect human safety or mission success) using results from M&S, and establish a common set of terms and a uniform way for M&S practitioners to communicate the credibility of M&S.
