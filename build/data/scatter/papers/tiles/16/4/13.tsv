In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them there into the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. For example, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend against the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disrupting communication. We present a general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and, thus defending against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that implements leashes. We also discuss topology-based wormhole detection, and show that it is impossible for these approaches to detect some wormhole topologies.	confidentiality;denial-of-service attack;hoc (programming language);location-based service;network packet;routing;sensor;tik;wireless security	Yih-Chun Hu;Adrian Perrig;David B.

It is broadly known that the main advantages of randomized average consensus gossip are its fault tolerance and distributed nature. Unfortunately, the flat architecture of the algorithm also increases the attack surface for a data injection attack. Even though we cast our problem in the context of sensor network security, the attack scenario is identical to existing models for opinion dynamics (the so-called DeGroot model) with stubborn agents steering the opinions of the group toward a final state that is not the average of the network initial states. We specifically propose two novel strategies for detecting and locating attackers and study their detection and localization performance numerically and analytically. Our detection and localization methods are completely decentralized and, therefore, nodes can directly act on their conclusions and stop receiving information from nodes identified as attackers. As we show by simulation, the network can often recover in this fashion, leveraging the resilience of randomized gossiping to reduced network connectivity.	attack surface;code injection;fault tolerance;gossip protocol;internationalization and localization;network security;numerical analysis;randomized algorithm;sensor;simulation	Reinhard Gentz;Sissi Xiaoxiao Wu;Hoi-To Wai;Anna Scaglione;Amir Leshem	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks	10.1109/TSIPN.2016.2614898	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer security	Security	-56.12738599521962	78.67245321651235	62398

Though authentic ation of broadcast messages is probably the most critical primitive, certain applicati ons such as battlefield control and natural resource management also require the broadcast dat to be kept secret from eavesdroppers. In this paper we design, implement, and evaluate a novel scheme that meets the requirements of secrecy, authenticity, integrity, and fre shness of broadcast messages in the context of a single-hop wireless sensor network. Our contri butions are three-fold: first, we propose the use of time-varying keys (based on a key-chain) f or broadcast encryption, emphasising advantages such as non-forgeability, protectio n against old-key compromise, and allowance for dynamic data. Second, we extend the basic keyhain mechanism to incorporate limited protection against key loss, allowing legitim ate receivers to recover even if they have lost a small number of keys. Third, we prototype our sche me by incorporating it into Deluge, the network programming protocol distributed with TinyOS, and quantify its cost in terms of time, space, and power consumption on a TelosB mot e pla form. Our scheme represents a practical, efficient and scalable means of deli vering broadcast data secretly to a large number of low-power sensor nodes.	add-ons for firefox;bootstrapping (statistics);broadcast encryption;computer network programming;confidentiality;cryptography;dynamic data;executable;experiment;hop;keychain;low-power broadcasting;patch (computing);prototype;replay attack;requirement;scalability;semantic security;tinyos	Vijay Sivaraman;Diethelm Ostry;Jaleel Shaheen;Antoni Junior Hianto;Sanjay Jha	2011	EURASIP J.

To battle with adversaries, a countermeasure is to avoid message routing through certain insecure areas, e.g., Malicious countries and nodes. To this end, avoidance routing has been proposed over the past few years. However, the existing avoidance protocols are single-path-based, which means that there must be a safe path such that no adversary is in the proximity of the whole path. This condition is difficult to satisfy. As a result, routing opportunities based on the existing avoidance schemes are limited. To tackle this issue, we propose an avoidance routing framework, namely Multi-Path Avoidance Routing (MPAR). In our approach, a source node first encodes a message into k different pieces, and each piece is sent via k different paths. The destination can assemble the original message easily, while an adversary cannot recover the original message unless she obtains all the pieces. We prove that the coding scheme achieves perfect secrecy against eavesdropping under the condition that an adversary has incomplete information regarding the message. The simulation results validate that the proposed MPAR protocol achieves its design goals.	adversary (cryptography);computer hardware;encryption;information-theoretic security;routing;secure communication;simulation	Kazuya Sakai;Min-Te Sun;Wei-Shinn Ku;Jie Wu;Ten-Hwang Lai	2015	2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2015.77	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	EDA	-51.67279436717684	78.53505745304254	63303
228e62d5039a2c8314c0ffafb9632a532d9ea4ba	practical defenses against pollution attacks in intra-flow network coding for wireless mesh networks	link quality;security analysis;network protocol;wireless network security;perforation;network security;wireless network;system performance;wireless mesh network;network coding;network coding security;pollution attacks;linear transformation;security;network congestion	Recent studies show that network coding can provide significant benefits to network protocols, such as increased throughput, reduced network congestion, higher reliability, and lower power consumption. The core principle of network coding is that intermediate nodes actively mix input packets to produce output packets. This mixing subjects network coding systems to a severe security threat, known as a \emph{pollution attack}, where attacker nodes inject corrupted packets into the network. Corrupted packets propagate in an epidemic manner, depleting network resources and significantly decreasing throughput. Pollution attacks are particularly dangerous in wireless networks, where attackers can easily inject packets or compromise devices due to the increased network vulnerability.  In this paper, we address pollution attacks against network coding systems in wireless mesh networks. We demonstrate that previous solutions to the problem are impractical in wireless networks, incurring an unacceptably high degradation of throughput. We propose a lightweight scheme, DART, that uses time-based authentication in combination with random linear transformations to defend against pollution attacks. We further improve system performance and propose EDART, which enhances DART with an optimistic forwarding scheme. A detailed security analysis shows that the probability of a polluted packet passing our verification procedure is very low. Performance results using the well-known MORE protocol and realistic link quality measurements from the Roofnet experimental testbed show that our schemes improve system performance over 20 times compared to previous solutions.	communications protocol;dart (programming language);elegant degradation;flow network;linear network coding;mesh networking;network congestion;network packet;testbed;throughput;time-based authentication;whole earth 'lectronic link;wireless mesh network	Jing Dong;Reza Curtmola;Cristina Nita-Rotaru	2009		10.1145/1514274.1514292	wireless mesh network;communications protocol;network traffic control;linear network coding;wireless wan;network architecture;telecommunications;wi-fi protected setup;computer science;information security;network security;wireless network;maximum throughput scheduling;packet forwarding;order one network protocol;linear map;security analysis;packet loss;network congestion;network access control;computer security;computer network	Security	-54.53878186650481	75.3726136378922	63320

In previous studies, homomorphic encryptions have been applied to conceal communication during aggregation such that enciphered data can be aggregated algebraically without decryption. Since aggregators collect data without decryption, adversaries are not able to forge aggregated results by compromising them. However, these schemes are not satisfy multi-application environments. Second, these schemes become insecure in case some sensor nodes are compromised. Third, these schemes do not provide secure counting; thus, they may suffer unauthorized aggregation attacks. Therefore, we propose a new concealed data aggregation scheme extended from Boneh et al.'s homomorphic public encryption system. The proposed scheme has three contributions. First, it is designed for a multi-application environment. The base station extracts application-specific data from aggregated ciphertexts. Next, it mitigates the impact of compromising attacks in single application environments. Finally, it degrades the damage from unauthorized aggregations. To prove the proposed scheme's robustness and efficiency, we also conducted the comprehensive analyses and comparisons in the end.	aggregate function;authorization;cipher;data aggregation;encryption;forge	Yue-Hsun Lin;Shih-Ying Chang;Hung-Min Sun	2013	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2012.94	homomorphic encryption;information privacy;tin;computer science;cryptography;elliptic curve cryptography;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-50.849717253105794	76.42289843281775	63528

Although many works have addressed this problem, they have considered the concept of grouping differently. In this paper, we consider a group as being a set of nodes sensing the same type of data and we alternatively propose an efficient secure group communication scheme that enables group management and secure group key distribution. The proposed scheme is based on a logical ring architecture, which permits to alleviate the task of the group controller in maintaining the group key. The proposed scheme also provides backward and forward secrecy, addresses the node compromise attack and gives solution to detect and eliminate the compromised nodes. Finally, our implementation shows that the proposed scheme is highly efficient and secure.	communications protocol;forward secrecy;group key;key distribution;key management;programming paradigm;ring network;run time (program lifecycle phase);secure communication;xslt/muenchian grouping	Omar Cheikhrouhou;Anis Koubaa;Olfa Gaddour;Gianluca Dini;Mohamed Abid	2010	2010 International Conference on Wireless and Ubiquitous Systems	10.1109/ICWUS.2010.5670431	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-50.14362722260554	77.18506860403177	63694

Nodes are placed in an open environment that will eventually be exposed to an adversary. An adversary can easily access security information such as the authentication key using data authentication. An adversary can use compromised sensor nodes to inject false reports to the WSN. If undetected, these false reports are forwarded to the base station. Such attacks by compromised sensor nodes result in false alarms and the depletion of the limited amount of energy in battery powered sensor nodes. The Dynamic En-routing Filtering (DEF) scheme can detect and drop false reports during the forwarding process. In DEF, the authentication key re-distribution period is important to detect false reports and save network energy. In this paper, we present a fuzzy-based authentication key re-distribution period determination method for DEF. The fuzzy-based method can prevent this problem and provide energy savings. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method via simulation.

A packet dropping attack is one of the major security threats in OppNets since neither source nodes nor destination nodes have the knowledge of where or when the packet will be dropped. In this paper, we present a novel attack and traceback mechanism against a special type of packet dropping where the malicious node drops one or more packets and then injects new fake packets instead. We call this novel attack a Catabolism attack and we call our novel traceback mechanism against this attack Anabolism defense. Our novel detection and traceback mechanism is very powerful and has very high accuracy. Each node can detect and then traceback the malicious nodes based on a solid and powerful idea that is, hash chain techniques. In our defense techniques we have two stages. The first stage is to detect the attack, and the second stage is to find the malicious nodes. Simulation results show this robust mechanism achieves a very high accuracy and detection rate. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is challenging to design a key management scheme in current wireless ad hoc networks to fulfill the required attributes of secure communications, such as data integrity, authentication, confidentiality, non-repudiation and service availability, when Sybil attacks are present. In this paper, we present a self-contained public key management scheme, called SMOCK, which is able to resist the Sybil attack, achieves zero communication overhead for authentication, and offers high service availability. In oar scheme, small number of cryptographic keys are stored off-line at individual nodes before they are deployed in the network. To provide good scalability in terms of number of nodes and storage space, we utilize a combinatorial design of public-private key pairs, which means nodes combine more than one key pair to encrypt and decrypt messages.

The development of routing protocols for WSNs is a major challenge because of their severe resource constraints, ad hoc topology and dynamic nature. Among those proposed routing protocols, the biology-inspired self-organized secure autonomous routing protocol (BIOSARP) involves an artificial immune system (AIS) that requires a certain amount of time to build up knowledge of neighboring nodes. The AIS algorithm uses this knowledge to distinguish between self and non-self neighboring nodes. The knowledge-building phase is a critical period in the WSN lifespan and requires active security measures. This paper proposes an enhanced BIOSARP (E-BIOSARP) that incorporates a random key encryption mechanism in a cost-effective manner to provide active security measures in WSNs. A detailed description of E-BIOSARP is presented, followed by an extensive security and performance analysis to demonstrate its efficiency. A scenario with E-BIOSARP is implemented in network simulator 2 (ns-2) and is populated with malicious nodes for analysis. Furthermore, E-BIOSARP is compared with state-of-the-art secure routing protocols in terms of processing time, delivery ratio, energy consumption, and packet overhead. The findings show that the proposed mechanism can efficiently protect WSNs from selective forwarding, brute-force or exhaustive key search, spoofing, eavesdropping, replaying or altering of routing information, cloning, acknowledgment spoofing, HELLO flood attacks, and Sybil attacks.	acknowledgment index;algorithm;anatomy, regional;artificial immune system;autonomous robot;brute-force attack;deploy;encryption;hoc (programming language);inspiration function;network packet;neural network simulation;neuronal calcium-sensor proteins;overhead (computing);population;protocols documentation;routing;self-organization;simulators;sybil attack;waisman syndrome	Kashif Saleem;Abdelouahid Derhab;Mehmet A.

However, it is not a secured protocol and suffers from serious security flaws such as no Origin AS Prefix verification and no AS Path verification. These two flaws in the BGP protocol can result in the attacks such as Prefix Hijacking and AS_PATH Forgery. These flaws are present in BGP due to lack of mechanisms for validating the actual source and path of the BGP UPDATE message. Many alternatives for the BGP such as S-BGP, SoBGP, etc. have been proposed but they are not compatible with the BGP and we need to replace BGP completely with them. The proposed method is a complimentary protocol to the BGP and verifies the Origin AS and the AS_PATH advertised in the BGP UPDATE message. The proposed Hierarchical Origin & Path (HOP) Verification method can be deployed in the current setting and works along with BGP. It can also be deployed in a scalable manner and can also work along with the ASes which do not follow HOP Verification method, thereby, solving all the deployment issues.	border gateway protocol;digital signature forgery;inter-domain;routing;scalability;software deployment	Gaurav Sharma;Lata Ragha	2011	2011 Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Telecommunication Systems and Networks (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2011.6163660	computer science;distributed computing;default-free zone;computer security;computer network;network mapping	Networks	-54.77372936723407	75.15530084693403	66737

We prove the security of our proposal in the random oracle model. According to the formal security validation using AVISPA, the proposed scheme is strongly secure against the passive and active attacks, such as replay, man-in-the middle and node compromise attacks, etc. We implemented our proposal for TinyOS-2.1, analyzed the memory occupation, and evaluated the time and energy performance on the MICAz motes using the Avrora toolkits. Moreover, we deployed our proposal within the TOSSIM simulation framework, and investigated the effect of node density on the performance of our scheme. Experimental results indicate that our proposal consumes an acceptable amount of resources, and is feasible for infrequent key distribution and rekeying in large scale sensor networks. Compared with other ID-based key agreement approaches, TinyIBAK is much more efficient or comparable in performance but provides rekeying. Compared with the traditional key pre-distribution schemes, TinyIBAK achieves significant improvements in terms of security strength, key connectivity, scalability, communication and storage overhead, and enables efficient secure rekeying.

However, this assumption is not always true and a hostile or unprotected environment can seriously affect the protocol and network performance. In this work two kinds of approaches are applied to a well-known routing protocol called SAODV in order to improve its performance and to offer more resilience to attack from malicious nodes authenticated by the network. A preventive approach based on a cryptographic mechanism and a reactive approach to detect the anomalous and malicious behavior of nodes are considered. An extension of SAODV to offer Intrusion Detection mechanism (IDM) and trust-based mechanism (TBM) to promote the collaboration of the cooperating node and penalize the selfish nodes are proposed. The extended and proposed protocol SAODV-SDO is presented and simulation results were performed in order to show the effectiveness of our proposal in comparison with AODV and SAODV.	authentication;cryptography;hoc (programming language);intrusion detection system;malware;network packet;network performance;routing;simulation;throughput	Floriano De Rango	2009	2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium	10.1109/WTS.2009.5068989	computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.31531945396522	77.9908775896078	67402
140baa156c8486640e7e8debe249577c4d1e3ce0	anonymous category-level joint tag estimation: poster	anonymity;category level;rfid;joint estimation	Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies have been widely used in many applications. Tag estimation, which is to estimate the cardinality of a single tag set, is an important research topic. This paper expands the estimation research as follows: It performs joint estimation between two tag sets, and more importantly the estimation is fine-grained in an effort to accommodate common practical scenarios, where each tag set consists of tags belonging to different categories. For any two given tag sets, we want to know the detailed information about the joint property of each category, instead of just the aggregate information of the whole sets. Furthermore, due to the open nature of RFID communications, it is often desirable that category-level joint estimation can be performed in an anonymous way without revealing the tags' IDs. To support these requirements, we develop a new technique called mask bitmap that can encode a tag set without requiring the tags to report their IDs or category IDs. Any two mask bitmaps that encode different tag sets can be combined to perform category-level joint estimation. Simulation results confirm that the proposed solution can yield accurate category-level estimates and preserve tags' anonymity.	aggregate data;bitmap;encode;radio-frequency identification;requirement;simulation;tag cloud	Min Chen;Jia Liu;Shigang Chen;Qingjun Xiao	2016		10.1145/2942358.2942400	radio-frequency identification;anonymity;computer science;data mining;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-49.03927236698874	83.5816309623435	67488

The protection of integrity and confidentiality of information and the protection from unauthorized access are important issues. However, due to factors such as resource limitations, absence of centralized access points, open wireless medium and small size of the sensor nodes, the implementation of security in WSNs is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a protocol, quality-based distance vector routing (QDV), for securing WSNs using concepts based on ant colony optimization (ACO). Two fundamental parameters: quality-of-service (QoS) and reputation are used. The high value of reputation of a node signifies that the node is trusted and is more reliable for data communication purposes. As a node shows signs of misbehavior, its reputation decreases, which, in turn, affect its quality-of-security (QSec), thereby disabling the malicious nodes from gaining access to the network. By incorporating these two factors, we are able to distinguish the nodes present in the network. We, then, present a method to achieve """"equilibrium"""" where the node is able to guarantee that its neighbors are secure."""	ant colony optimization algorithms;authorization;centralized computing;confidentiality;distance-vector routing protocol;mathematical optimization;quality of service;wireless access point	Sanjay Kumar Dhurandher;Sudip Misra;Mohammad S.

There are two kinds of WSN model models with sensors for sensing data and a sink for receiving and processing queries from users; and models with special additional nodes capable of storing large amounts of data from sensors and processing queries from the sink. Among the latter type, a two-tiered model [6,7] has been widely adopted because of its storage and energy saving benefits for weak sensors, as proved by the advent of commercial storage node products such as Stargate [8] and RISE. However, by concentrating storage in certain nodes, this model becomes more vulnerable to attack. Our novel technique, called zip-histogram, contributes to solving the problems of previous studies [6,7] by protecting the stored data’s confidentiality and integrity (including data from the sensor and queries from the sink) against attackers who might target storage nodes in two-tiered WSNs.	linear system	Van H.

It has unique characteristics that make new challenges arise compared to its wired networks or traditional wireless networks counterpart. Due to these unique characteristics, the traditional intrusion detection techniques for wired networks and wireless networks are not well suited for ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose a Manager-based architecture for intrusion detection system to shorten an intrusion detection time in an ad hoc network environment. We have evaluated the performance of proposed system through simulation-based experiment and compared it with other existing methods. The result shows that our method gives the better performance.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);intrusion detection system;malware;mobile device;simulation	Muhammad Arifin Ritonga;Masaya Nakayama	2008	2008 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet	10.1109/SAINT.2008.38	vehicular ad hoc network;intrusion detection system;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;network security;operating system;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-56.78146237754634	78.36483711786047	69275

In this paper, we propose a secure localization mechanism that detects existence of these nodes, termed as phantom nodes, without relying on any trusted entities, an approach significantly different from the existing ones. The proposed mechanism enjoys a set of nice features. First, it does not have any central point of attack. All nodes play the role of verifier, by generating local map, i.e. a view constructed based on ranging information from its neighbors. Second, this distributed and localized construction results in strong robustness against adversaries: even when the number of phantom nodes is greater than that of honest nodes, we can filter out most of the phantom nodes. Our analytical results as well as simulations under realistic noisy settings demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is effective in the presence of a large number of phantom nodes.	phantom reference	Joengmin Hwang;Tian He;Yongdae Kim	2008	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2007.10.005	embedded system;wireless sensor network;internationalization and localization;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer security	Mobile	-53.01154993242922	76.23080165922738	69789

WSNs have many existing and envisioned applications due to their ease of deployment, particularly in remote areas. But the security of WSNs is still an issue. Some existing approaches mainly rely on cryptography to ensure data authentication and integrity. These approaches only address part of the problem of security in WSNs. However, these approaches are not sufficient for the unique characteristics and novel misbehaviors encountered in WSNs. Recently, the use of reputation systems has become an important mechanism in WSNs. In this paper we propose a reputation-based trust which borrows tools from probability, statistics and mathematics analysis. We have suggested a new term certainty used in trust system and we argued that the positive or negative outcomes for a certain event is not enough information to make a decision in WSNs. We build up a reputation space and trust space in WSNs, and define a transformation from reputation space to trust space. Finally, we discuss some important properties of them and point out some open problems in reputation system in WSNs.	cryptography;message authentication;reputation system;software deployment	Haiguang Chen;Huafeng Wu;Xi Zhou;Chuanshan Gao	2007	2007 International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering (MUE'07)	10.1109/MUE.2007.181	wireless sensor network;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;computer security;computational trust;computer network	Mobile	-51.66167134077954	76.16096081284343	70641

Maria Striki, Doctor of Philosophy, 2006 Directed By: Professor John S. Baras, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Securing group communications in resource constrained, infrastructure-less environments such as Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) is a very challenging research direction in the area of wireless networking and security. This is true as MANETs are emerging as the desired environment for an increasing number of civilian, commercial and military applications, addressing an increasing number of users. Most of these applications are sensitive and require specific security guarantees. The inherent limitations of MANETs impose major difficulties in establishing a suitable secure group communications framework. Key Management (KM) is the operation that enables and supports the secure exchange of data and ensures the capability of members’ secure cooperation as a group. KM protocols provide a common symmetric group key to all group members, and ensure that only legitimate members have access to a valid group key at any instance. Our work focuses on the design of efficient, robust, novel or improved group KM schemes, capable of distributed operation where key infrastructure components are absent or inaccessible, that accomplish the following: (a) better performance than this of existing schemes for similar environments, (b) successfully handle network dynamics and failures, in networks with large number of nodes. Our protocols address Flat or Hierarchical MANETs separately. Our solution for Flat MANETs involves the design of two new Octopus protocols, and the adaptation of the original to MANETs. We introduced algorithms for handling membership changes, disruptions and failures with low overhead for initial key establishment or steady state for all three protocols. In an effort to reduce their suboptimal performance when executed without topological considerations, underlying routing is integrated into the design by the definition of topology oriented communication schedules via lightweight heuristics. In addition, we integrated a lightweight leader election algorithm with the proposed protocols, used Elliptic Curve Cryptography to reduce certain costs further, and investigated the effects of a number of mobility models in the performance of our schemes. For Hierarchical MANETs, we designed a 2-level Hybrid scheme that supports various combinations of protocols to improve metrics of interest. This scheme exploits battlefield diversity, and links key distribution to network topology and nodes’ mobility.

The objective is to identify optimal settings including the best intrusion detection interval and the best batch rekey interval under which the system lifetime (mean time to security failure) is maximized while satisfying performance requirements. We develop a mathematical model based on stochastic Petri net (SPN) to analyze tradeoffs between security and performance properties, when given a set of parameter values characterizing operational and environmental conditions of a GCS instrumented with intrusion detection tightly coupled with batch rekeying. We compare our design with a baseline system using intrusion detection integrated with individual rekeying to demonstrate the effectiveness.

In this paper, we deeply study the optimal data backup strategy that backup nodes set the resources prices and source nodes determine the resources quantities that they want to rent. Firstly, we apply a Stackelberg game framework to simulate the interaction among source nodes and backup nodes whose objective is to gain the maximum payoff of every source node and the maximum total payoff of all the backup nodes by adjusting strategies interactively. And then we propose an algorithm to compute the equilibrium price strategy for backup nodes and equilibrium price strategy for source nodes. Finally, we validate this optimal backup strategy through numerical analysis.	algorithm;backup;data security;interactivity;numerical analysis;simulation	Xu Liu;Xiaoqiang Di;Jinqing Li;Hui Qi;Huamin Yang;Ligang Cong	2016	2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)	10.1109/CITS.2016.7546444	simulation;economics;distributed computing;computer security	DB	-53.721976654298324	80.90715859439533	71344

In specific, the proposed SND scheme consists of three phases: the NC broadcasting phase, the network node response/authentication phase and the NC time-delay analysis phase. In the broadcasting phase and response/authentication phase, local time information and antenna direction information are elegantly exchanged with signature based authentication techniques between the NC and legislate network nodes, which can prevent most of the wormhole attacks. In the NC time-delay analysis phase, the NC can further detect the possible attack by using the time-delay information from the network node. To solve the transmission collision problem in the response/authentication phase, an RD-TDMA protocol is also proposed. Both simulation results and security analysis demonstrate that the proposed SND scheme can effectively resist wormhole attack for the 60 GHz communication network with directional antenna.	authentication;centralized computing;collision problem;network interface controller;requirement;ruby document format;secure neighbor discovery;simulation;telecommunications network;traffic collision avoidance system	Zhiguo Shi;Rongxing Lu;Jian Qiao;Xuemin Shen	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555338	communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;network access control;computer security;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	-51.79445535283452	79.5049814953971	71503

An RFID tag is a small electronic device with an antenna and has a unique serial number. In this paper, we study the use of blocker tags by malicious attackers which can cause the nearby readers not being able to successfully receive the reply messages from the RFID tags. We mathematically model the blocker tag attack problem using information extracted from the interrogations performed by the reader. Using this analytical framework, we propose a probabilistic blocker tag detection (PBTD) algorithm to detect the presence of an attacker in the system. The probability of false alarm for the P-BTD algorithm is determined via simulation. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has a better performance than the threshold-based detection algorithm in terms of using a shorter time (i.e., fewer interrogations) to detect the presence of blocker tags.	algorithm;malware;rsa blocker tag;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;sensor;simulation	Ehsan Vahedi;Vahid Shah-Mansouri;Vincent W.

The sinkhole effect is caused by attempts to draw all network traffic to malicious nodes that broadcast fake shortest path routing information. Two reliable indicators of sinkhole intrusion are proposed and analyzed. We will study how these sinkholes may be detected and term such as sinkhole intrusion detection. One indicator is based on the sequence number in the routing message and the other one is related to the proportion of the routes that travel to a suspected node. Threshold values that imply possible sinkhole intrusion are derived for these two indicators. The simulation results show that the indicators are consistent and reliable for detecting sinkhole intrusion.	ansi escape code;etx (form factor);hoc (programming language);routing;royer oscillator;sensor;simulation;stealth;tower of hanoi	H.

cffa6b803a5cfb31a7493772a8ee8a55237b3ee5	secure protocols for data propagation and group communication in vehicular networks	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Vehicular networks are organized with high-mobility vehicles, which are a challenge to key agreement and secured communication among vehicles; hence, efficient cryptography schemes for lightweight ciphers are essential. Many security schemes for vehicular networks particularly take the secure propagation of traffic-related information into account. Group communication is desirable in vehicular networks, while groups of friends drive the vehicles to travel together. In this study, it is applied an asymmetric key mechanism and a group-based Elliptic Curve cryptograph to authenticate data propagation as also to individually secure group communication. The data propagation includes a flooding delay mechanism, where each vehicle participant in the propagation calculates an individual delay for propagation. As groups of vehicles move on the roadway toward same destinations, two alternative schemes of group key agreement in vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure modes are proposed to secure group communication among the vehicles. Security analysis results present that the proposed schemes can effectively prevent malicious vehicle from participating in vehicular communications. Evaluation results show that the propagation delay mechanism can effectively reduce broadcast collision, and the delay results of the group key agreement schemes are acceptable.	authentication;cipher;cryptogram;group key;key-agreement protocol;propagation delay;public-key cryptography;software propagation;vehicle-to-vehicle	Meng-Yen Hsieh;Hua-Yi Lin;Chin-Feng Lai;Kuan-Ching Li	2011	EURASIP J.

Master nodes collect data from sensor nodes and answer the queries from the network owner. The reliance on master nodes for data storage and query processing raises serious concerns about both data confidentiality and query-result correctness in hostile environments. In particular, a compromised master node may leak hosted sensitive data to the adversary; it may also return juggled or incomplete data in response to a query. This paper presents a novel spatiotemporal approach to ensure secure range queries in event-driven two-tier sensor networks. It offers data confidentiality by preventing master nodes from reading hosted data and also enables efficient range-query processing. More importantly, it allows the network owner to verify with very high probability whether a query result is authentic and complete by examining the spatial and temporal relationships among the returned data. The high efficacy and efficiency of our approach are confirmed by detailed performance evaluations.	adversary (cryptography);computer data storage;confidentiality;correctness (computer science);database;event-driven programming;multitier architecture;overhead (computing);range query (data structures)	Jing Shi;Rui Zhang;Yanchao Zhang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.102210.100548	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;information security;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	DB	-50.96371120751244	79.34784568880058	72785

Although existing key management schemes are enough to solve most of the security constraints on WSNs, a random-key predistribution scheme has recently evolved as an efficient solution for sharing keys between sensor nodes. Studying the signal ranges of the sensor nodes might significantly improve the performance of the key-sharing mechanism, but this possibility remains unexploited and needs further attention. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new approach for a probabilistic key predistribution scheme that guarantees a higher probability of sharing keys between nodes that are within the signal range than that of other schemes. As a result, the proposed approach provides adequate security and is expected to minimize the key ring, reduce the communication overhead, and provide high connectivity. We also compare our present scheme with existing algorithms developed for the same purpose and observe that the proposed scheme performed better, even with different deployment errors.	algorithm;computer security;key management;overhead (computing);software deployment	Huyen Thi Thanh Nguyen;Mohsen Guizani;Minho Jo;Eui-nam Huh	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.2008191	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;information security;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-50.45680054003082	78.99995211661357	72880

0cd5ad317de0237e7f95e0b6a98859642fc79d1b	a new energy prediction approach for intrusion detection in cluster-based wireless sensor networks		Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) require an efficient intrusion detection scheme to identify malicious attackers. Traditional detection schemes are not well suited for WSNs due to their higher false detection rate. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection scheme based on the energy prediction in cluster-based WSNs (EPIDS). The main contribution of EPIDS is to detect attackers by comparing the energy consumptions of sensor nodes. The sensor nodes with abnormal energy consumptions are identified as malicious attackers. Furthermore, EPIDS is designed to distinguish the types of denial of service (DoS) attack according to the energy consumption rate of the malicious nodes. The primary simulation experiments prove that EPIDS can detect and recognize malicious attacks effectively.	denial-of-service attack;experiment;malware;scheme;sensor;simulation	Wen Shen;Guangjie Han;Lei Shu;Joel Jos&#x00E9; P.

However, many of the previous decentralized solutions reveal the plain text to the intermediate relaying proxies,or require the key distribution center to coordinate secure group communications between subgroups. In this study, we propose a decentralized group key management scheme that features a mechanism allowing a service provider to deliver the group key to valid members in a distributed manner using the proxy cryptography. In the proposed scheme, the key distribution center is eliminated while data confidentiality of the transmitted message is provided during the message delivery process. The proposed scheme can support a secure group communication in dynamic network environments where there is no trusted central controller for the whole network and the network topology changes frequently.	confidentiality;cryptography;encryption;group key;hoc (programming language);key distribution center;key management;mesh networking;network interface controller;network topology;proxy server;scalability;secure multicast;spectral leakage;surface-mount technology;trust (emotion)	Junbeom Hur;Young-joo Shin;Hyunsoo Yoon	2007		10.1145/1298239.1298261	service provider;confidentiality;computer science;distributed computing;pre-shared key;key distribution;computer security;key distribution center;network topology;computer network	Security	-49.8043635738369	77.19806222482349	74509

A belief-based packet forwarding framework is proposed to obtain cooperation-enforcement strategies solely based on each node's own past actions and its private imperfect observation of other nodes' information.

294e5625c9de1aa27a96acbd7ac260ed37954675	scalable exchange of packet counters in olsr		The HELLO messages of the OLSR protocol can be used as a way to exchange packet counters for each advertised link between the originating node and its neighbors. These counters are aimed to enable nodes receiving the HELLO messages to check that the property of flow conservation is verified on the originating node. The addition of this information incurs a significant overhead that could prevent the node from being able to advertise all its links in one HELLO message. Although plain OLSR has been designed to deal with partial information in its control messages, enabling the verification of the flow conservation property is not trivial. In this paper, we present a way to perform partial advertisement of packet counters and complete verification of the property of flow conservation that remains scalable. Simulation results show that in practical conditions, the use of the method incurs a limited overhead that makes it very acceptable.	flow network;network packet;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);scalability;simulation	Ignacy Gawedzki;Khaldoun Al Agha	2008		10.1007/978-0-387-09490-8_11	computer network;optimized link state routing protocol;scalability;network packet;computer science	Networks	-55.197462383800165	75.69424453967166	74992

This paper puts forward an effective and efficient security scheme for launching anonymity in clustered heterogeneous sensor networks. The clustered heterogeneous sensor network has two types of nodes: high end nodes that work as cluster heads and low end nodes. The clusters are formed initially by using Voronoi diagrams and then some node adjustment is done in the clusters using Tabu search. The secure scheme uses a unique technique to conceal its true identity (ID). Once the sensor nodes are deployed, the nodes setup their neighbor table and share their secret key with the neighbors while ensuring that their true identity (ID) is not disclosed and the communication is secured. The empirical performance evaluations support the given approach's efficiency and effectiveness.	computation;heuristic;key (cryptography);key exchange;key management;online identity;routing;tabu search;voronoi diagram	Kanwalinderjit Kaur Gagneja;Kendall E.

It is crucial to detect such jamming attacks as fast as possible. Existing studies have shown that an effective indicator of jamming is the packet delivery ratio (PDR). However, current PDR-based schemes use the end-to-end packet delivery ratio, which requires one to observe communication for a long time before a good decision is made. In this paper, we propose collaborative detection, which evaluates the packet delivery ratio in an given area instead of a pair of nodes. The intuition is that the attacker often jams an area of his interest, not just two specific nodes. The benefit is that we can detect jamming attacks in a much faster way. We have evaluated the performance of our idea on TelosB motes. The results show that we can effectively and quickly detect jamming attacks.	adversary (cryptography);design review (u.s. government);end-to-end principle;experiment;network packet;radio jamming;sensor	Kartik Siddhabathula;Qi Dong;Donggang Liu;Matthew K.

In this paper the Onion Ring protocol designed by Lee has been analyzed that it cannot defend against a so-called intersection attack, a new type of attack. Based on this protocol, an improved layered Onion ring protocol is proposed which can defend against this attack effectively.

DTNs aim to provide interoperability between a range of heterogeneous networks, operating under resource-constrained circumstances and traditional infrastructure networks such as the Internet. Because of the circumstances, DTNs possess some interesting characteristics that make a traditional end-to-end security paradigm unsuitable and increase the value of the overlay's resources. Controlling access to overlay resources and providing for secure group communications over unknown intermediate networks is essential. We propose a novel solution based on previous work in secure group communications using key-graphs and in extension to work on scalable access authorization in self-organizing overlays to provide a scalable mechanism for access control and secure group communications in DTNs. Since resources are especially limited, our implementation focuses on minimizing the traffic on the overlay associated with the maintenance of our solution.	access control;authorization;backup;c++;computation;delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end principle;experiment;internet;interoperability;java;library (computing);malware;mobile device;organizing (structure);parallel computing;programming paradigm;prototype;reference implementation;routing;scalability;self-organization	Paul T.

Entity-centric trust typically involves signatures and certificates, while data-centric methods leverage on consistency checks. One way to implement data consistency checking is to exploit redundant information dissemination to detect inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose a metric to investigate the degree of redundancy that different types of information dissemination protocols exhibit. We evaluate our metric using simulations of Geocast and aggregation protocols. Results show that geocast largely eliminates redundancy, whereas aggregation keeps more redundant communication paths.	antivirus software;geocast;redundancy (engineering);simulation	Stefan Dietzel;Jonathan Petit;Frank Kargl;Geert Heijenk	2012		10.1145/2307888.2307914	computer science;data mining;computer security;computer network	Web+IR	-52.73893738354254	77.14634075247484	77402

Many solutions to this problem have been proposed. In this paper, we take a fresh and comprehensive approach that addresses simultaneously three aspects: security, scalability and adaptability to changing network conditions. Our communication protocol, Castor, occupies a unique point in the design space: it does not use any control messages except simple packet acknowledgments, and each node makes routing decisions locally and independently without exchanging any routing state with other nodes. Its novel design makes Castor resilient to a wide range of attacks and allows the protocol to scale to large network sizes and to remain efficient under high mobility. We compare Castor against four representative protocols from the literature. Our protocol achieves up to two times higher packet delivery rates, particularly in large and highly volatile networks, while incurring no or only limited additional overhead. At the same time, Castor is able to survive more severe attacks and recovers from them faster.	acknowledgement (data networks);castor;communications protocol;hoc (programming language);network packet;overhead (computing);routing;scalability;secure communication;unicast;web of trust	Wojciech Galuba;Panagiotis Papadimitratos;Marcin Poturalski;Karl Aberer;Zoran Despotovic;Wolfgang Kellerer	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462115	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;information science;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.590954885596595	75.55489290639731	79569

Most VANET applications, including safety ones, are based on multi-hop communications. Hence, a certain trustworthiness should exist among vehicles to ensure a reliable and trusted communication excluding dishonest peers from all network operations. In this paper we propose an hierarchical trust establishment solution able to cope with VANET applications and their requirements. Our solution is based on a three-level architecture, which enables it to adapt to the communication scenario and the required security level. Simulation results conducted done NS2 tool evidence that our solution is able to reach almost optimal attacker detection ratios (more than 90%) even in the presence of a significant number of attackers in the network (25%) while reducing the wrong relay decision ratios.	interaction;quality of service;relay;requirement;sensor;simulation;social network;trust (emotion);trusted third party	Kerrache Chaker Abdelaziz;Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate;Nasreddine Lagraa;Juan-Carlos Cano;Pietro Manzoni	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794617	vehicular ad hoc network;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.09393760405234	77.3877219143889	80303

All well-known random key pre-distribution systems, including the Eschenauer and Gligor's pioneering scheme, its extensions, as well as threshold schemes, become insecure when a large number of nodes are captured. We propose a general technique, called virtual key ring, that can effectively strengthen the resilience of random key pre-distribution systems against node capture attacks by reducing the pre-loaded keying material while maintaining secure connectivity of the network.  The technique is general and applicable to many key pre-distribution systems. We however focus on the original EG scheme and propose a virtual key ring system based on this pioneering scheme. We provide detailed mathematical analysis and a security proof for the system, and use extensive simulation to validate the analysis and to compare performance of the new system with the original EG scheme. We also present simulation results for the strengthened resilience when the virtual key ring scheme is combined with the multipath key reinforcement and q-composite techniques, showing that the system resilience is substantially improved against large-scale node capture attack (e.g., 40% of nodes captured).	eurographics;key (cryptography);multipath propagation;provable security;simulation	Tuan Manh Vu;Reihaneh Safavi-Naini;Carey L.

2e61c6d85ae7d307872b70bc923bf125dba7a294	recovery and resource allocation strategies to maximize mobile network survivability by using game theories and optimization techniques		With more and more mobile device users, an increasingly important and critical issue is how to efficiently evaluate mobile network survivability. In this paper, a novel metric called Average Degree of Disconnectivity (Average DOD) is proposed, in which the concept of probability is calculated by the contest success function. The DOD metric is used to evaluate the damage degree of the network, where the larger the value of the Average DOD, themore the damage degree of the network. Amultiround network attackdefense scenario as a mathematical model is used to support network operators to predict all the strategies both cyber attacker and network defender would likely take. In addition, the Average DOD would be used to evaluate the damage degree of the network. In each round, the attacker could use the attack resources to launch attacks on the nodes of the target network. Meanwhile, the network defender could reallocate its existing resources to recover compromised nodes and allocate defense resources to protect the survival nodes of the network. In the approach to solving this problem, the “gradient method” and “game theory” are adopted to find the optimal resource allocation strategies for both the cyber attacker and mobile network defender.

The authors propose a flexible and resilient communication system using an ad-hoc cognitive radio network that fully utilizes the available spectrum resources. Two main components of the network are addressed: route discovery, i.e., identifying multiple paths from the source to the destination, and scheduling for these paths, i.e., efficiently allocating available resources to achieve an optimal transmission. Field-based routing is adopted. The authors also introduce a secure authentication and routing mechanism for this network. The authentication component leverages the social aspect of public safety communications and mitigates most basic wireless attacks. A hybrid novel reputation scheme is then proposed to allow for efficient routing in the presence of adversaries. The authors show through simulations that the proposed secure framework can efficiently reduce the transmission delay, be robust to the dynamics of channel availability, and mitigate routing attacks in a cognitive radio network.

Previous work has mostly focused on the network layer IP multicast and not as much work has been done on the application layer overlay multicast. A main feature of overlay multicast is that end systems carry on the responsibility of delivering the multicast traffic. Taking advantage of this feature, this paper presents a new collusion resistant technique, which is based on digital signature, for overlay multicast message authentication. The proposed technique minimizes both the computational cost (through signature amortization) and the communication overhead (using retransmissions and utilizing multiple multicast groups in handling message loss). In addition, it resists denial of service attacks via early dropping of forged messages. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate our proposed technique. Results of the study show that the proposed technique outperforms earlier ones.	message authentication;multicast	Emad Eldin Mohamed;Hussein M. Abdel-Wahab	2009	Trans.

Due to their decentralized design, they can be  subject to a large variety of communication errors, system failures or even attacks and intrusions. Current research focuses  either on specific avoidance and/or protective actions such as secure routing protocols or on general misbehavior detection  with human operator based response management [1]. However, due to the complexity of large-scale ad hoc networks, self-organization  and self-healing properties are necessary. A concept which allows for automatic responses to mitigate the effects of misbehavior  is missing. In this statement we discuss whether an adaptive decision making process based on the concept of receptor degeneracy, being a part of the cognitive immune self theory described by Cohen in 2000, is feasible.    	degeneracy (biology);hoc (programming language)	Sven Schaust;Martin Drozda;Helena Szczerbicka	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14547-6_29	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;dynamic circuit network;computer science;artificial intelligence;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	HCI	-56.74167856445472	76.48826911053868	82147

Yu and Guan proposed the dynamic en-route filtering scheme (DEF) to detect and drop false reports as soon as possible in wireless sensor networks. In this scheme, the choice of a threshold value to diffuse keys is important since it represents a trade-off between detection power and overhead. A large threshold value can increase the probability of detecting false reports but it consumes too much energy during the key dissemination phase. Thus, we should choose a threshold value to optimize between the detection power and energy consumption. In this paper we propose a key dissemination limiting method to diffuse keys efficiently. The threshold value in the proposed method is determined by a fuzzy rule-based system by considering the energy level of the network, the number of secret keys in a cluster, and the distance from the base station (BS) to a cluster head. The simulation results show that the proposed method can conserve energy, while it provides sufficient detection power.	fuzzy rule	Byung Hee Kim;Hae Young Lee;Tae Ho Cho	2007	I. J.

a1ecf0827680c9ef7da1203133c94194bd6c4477	flexisec: a configurable link layer security architecture for wireless sensor networks		Ensuring communications security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) indeed is critical; due to the criticality of the resources in the sensor nodes as well as due to their ubiquitous and pervasive deployment, with varying attributes and degrees of security required. The proliferation of the next generation sensor nodes, has not solved this problem, because of the greater emphasis on low-cost deployment. In addition, the WSNs use data-centric multi-hop communication that in turn, necessitates the security support to be devised at the link layer (increasing the cost of security related operations), instead of being at the application layer, as in general networks. Therefore, an energy-efficient link layer security framework is necessitated. There do exists a number of link layer security architectures that offer some combinations of the security attributes desired by different WSN applications. However, as we show in this paper, none of them is responsive to the actual security demands of the applications. Therefore, we believe that there is a need for investigating the feasibility of a configurable software-based link layer security architecture wherein an application can be compiled flexibly, with respect to its actual security demands. In this paper, we analyze, propose and experiment with the basic design of such configurable link layer security architecture for WSNs. We also experimentally evaluate various aspects related to our scheme viz. configurable block ciphers, configurable block cipher modes of operations, configurable MAC sizes and configurable replay protection. The architecture proposed is aimed to offer the optimal level of security at the minimal overhead, thus saving the precious resources in the WSNs.	algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;communications security;compiler;computer security;experiment;next-generation network;overhead (computing);pervasive informatics;replay attack;self-organized criticality;software deployment;viz: the computer game	Devesh C.

Routing processes in MANETs rely on cooperation of independent nodes constituting the network. Geographical Routing Protocols (GRPs) are suggested for MANETs in the literature. MANETs are highly susceptible to attacks. In this paper, a three-stage method has been proposed to address the performance degradation of a GRP due to the malicious nodes. This method based on a GRP, creates clusters. The malicious nodes are identified using modified hello message and secure keys are used to mitigate the effect of the maliciousness. The delay for the proposed clustered GRP was less than the GRP. When the size of the network increased, the end-to-end delay was significantly less. Cluster Heads (CHs) distribute public keys by using fuzzy logic. The effectiveness of the proposed cluster GRP when compared to the GRP is proved.	agent-based model;algorithm;authentication;centralisation;cluster analysis;computer simulation;design review (u.s. government);elegant degradation;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;fuzzy logic;gentoo linux;hoc (programming language);key size;mobile agent;mobile device;routing	Sudhakar Sengan;S.

They consume resources of remote hosts or network and make them deny or degrade services for legitimate users. Compared with traditional Internet, the resources, such as bandwidth, memory, and battery power, of each node are more limited in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Therefore, nodes in MANETs are more vulnerable to DoS attacks. Moreover, attackers in MANETs cannot only use IP spoofing to conceal their real identities but also move arbitrarily, which makes it a challenging task to trace a remote attacker in MANETs. In this paper, we proposed a zone sampling-based traceback (ZSBT) algorithm for tracing DoS attackers in MANETs. In our algorithm, when a node forwards a packet, the node writes its zone ID into the packet with a probability. After receiving these packets, the victim can reconstruct the path between the attacker and itself. Simulations were carried out to illustrate the validity of the algorithm; even with a little communication overhead.	algorithm;computer simulation;denial-of-service attack;enumerated type;error message;geographic routing;hoc (programming language);ip address spoofing;internet;intrusion detection system;network packet;out-of-band agreement;overhead (computing);sampling (signal processing);unreachable memory	Xin Jin;Yaoxue Zhang;Yi Pan;Yue-Zhi Zhou	2006	EURASIP J.

239fb64d0ae0286c371fc299fe08e792730fdf81	reaction-diffusion modeling of malware propagation in mobile wireless sensor networks	期刊论文	Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) are employed in many fields, such as intelligent transportation, community health monitoring, and animal behavior monitoring. However, MWSNs may be vulnerable to malicious interference because of the large-scale characteristics. One of the threats is to inject malware into some nodes, especially mobile nodes. When a contaminated node communicates with its neighbors, multiple copies of the malware are transmitted to its neighbors, which may destroy nodes, block regular communications, or even damage the integrity of regular data packets. This work develops a modeling framework which mathematically characterizes the process of malware propagation in MWSNs based on the theory of reaction-diffusion equation. Our proposed model can efficiently predict the temporal dynamic behavior and spatial distribution of malware propagation over time, so that targeted immunization measures can be taken on infected nodes, whereas most of the existing models for malware propagation can only predict the temporal dynamic behavior rather than the spatial distribution of malware propagation over time. We conduct extensive simulations on large-scale MWSNs to evaluate the proposed model. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model and method are efficient, and that the mobile speed, communication range, and packet transmission rate of nodes are the main factors affecting malware propagation in MWSNs.	interference (communication);malware;mathematical model;mobile phone;network packet;numerical analysis;simulation;software propagation	Xiaoming Wang;Zaobo He;Xueqing Zhao;Chuang Lin;Yi Pan;Zhipeng Cai	2013	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-013-4977-4	computer science;internet privacy;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-56.54572767857808	74.90800098946205	82593

A malicious node can manipulate header options used by RPL to track DODAG inconsistencies, thereby causing denial of service attacks, increased control message overhead, and black-holes at the targeted node. RPL counteracts DODAG inconsistencies by using a fixed threshold, upon reaching which all subsequent packets with erroneous header options are ignored. However, the fixed threshold is arbitrary and does not resolve the black-hole issue either. To address this we present a mitigation strategy that allows nodes to dynamically adapt against a DODAG inconsistency attack. We also present the forced black-hole attack problem and a solution that can be used to mitigate it. Results from our experiments show that our proposed approach mitigates these attacks without any significant overhead.	computational complexity theory;denial-of-service attack;experiment;lossy compression;low-power broadcasting;network packet;overhead (computing);routing	Anuj Sehgal;Anthéa Mayzaud;Remi Badonnel;Isabelle Chrisment;Jürgen Schönwälder	2014	2014 Global Information Infrastructure and Networking Symposium (GIIS)	10.1109/GIIS.2014.6934253	engineering;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-54.64971209933819	75.9803677850441	82804

Due to the inherent nature of open medium, diversity and variability of network topology, wireless networks are greatly difficult to secure by traditional methods. A physical layer key negotiation mechanism to secure wireless networks is proposed to quickly exchange and establish conventional cryptographic keys by exploiting the wireless channel’s characteristics. The physical layer key negotiation mechanism and its supplementary exception handling caused by the variations in communication paths are both described step by step. The simulation results verify the consistency of the keys of legitimate users, robustness and feasibility of this mechanism. Furthermore this cross-layer security technology is an exemplary complement to existing wireless network protocols to improve their security and enhances the ability to resist replay attacks, brute-force attack and eavesdropping.	acknowledgement (data networks);brute-force attack;communications protocol;cryptographic protocol;cyberspace;exception handling;heart rate variability;information privacy;key (cryptography);network topology;replay attack;requirement;simulation	Jikang Xia;Lan Chen;Ying Li;Endong Tong	2014	JNW	10.4304/jnw.9.9.2299-2308	security association;telecommunications;computer science;cryptography;network security;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;physical layer;computer network	Mobile	-52.27796973957606	74.90270204686072	82850

In this paper, we consider cooperation enforcement in autonomous mobile ad hoc networks under noisy and imperfect observation and study the basic packet forwarding among users through the repeated game models with imperfect information. A belief evaluation framework is proposed to obtain cooperation-enforcement packet forwarding strategies only based on each node's private information including its own past actions and imperfect observation of other nodes' information. More importantly, we not only show that the proposed strategy with belief system can maintain the cooperation paradigm but also establish its performance bounds. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed belief evaluation framework can enforce the cooperation with only a small performance degradation compared with the unconditionally cooperative outcomes when noisy and imperfect observation exist.	autonomous robot;elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);network packet;personally identifiable information;programming paradigm;simulation	Zhu Ji;Wei Yu;K.

In mobile ad-hoc networks, sources may provide faulty information, which can lead to incorrect conclusions. Consequently, devices need a mechanism to evaluate the integrity of their peers and the accuracy of peer provided information. To address this problem we propose a query processing model that relies on distributed trust and belief. Each device maintains and shares beliefs regarding the degree of trust it has for its peers - where trust is determined by experience and reputation. Additionally, each device associates a value indicating its belief in the accuracy of the information it holds. This knowledge is used by devices to determine the reliability of query responses. We implement our model in GloMoSim and provide experimental results for different combinations of trust and accuracy algorithms."""	algorithm;client–server model;database;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);information source;intrusion detection system;malware;peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;server (computing);simulation;trust (emotion);trust management (information system);ubiquitous computing;veracity	Filip Perich;Jeffrey Undercoffer;Lalana Kagal;Anupam Joshi;Timothy W.

In this study, proposed is a cooperative hybrid self-healing randomised distributed (CHSHRD) scheme, a new mechanism to enhance the confidentiality of the data collected by UWSNs. The proposed scheme employs both proactive and reactive peers to ensure both backward secrecy and data reliability. It helps the unattended sensors to self-heal and restore their backward secrecy by asking for help from the best qualified neighbours to generate a new secret key to regain their secrecy. The sick sensors also use the best qualified neighbours to distribute the data parts among them to protect the data from eavesdropping and this will enhance the data reliability. In this study, they also present a powerful, realistic and agile ADV model and show how CHSHRD scheme can result in sensor regaining secrecy and achieving high data reliability, despite the adversary efforts to the contrary. The evaluation of the proposed scheme relies on both theoretical probabilistic results and simulation results that compare the proposed scheme to other protection schemes. The results show that this hybrid scheme provides better protection than other schemes that use either proactive or reactive peers.	adversary (cryptography);agile software development;confidentiality;data redundancy;key (cryptography);replication (computing);sensor;simulation	Amir Salah Elsafrawey;Emad S.

To improve the lifetime of the network, nodes are organised into clusters, in which the cluster head (CH) collects and aggregates the data. A special node called mobile data collector (MDC) is used to collect the data from the CH and transfer it to the base station (BS). So far in the literature secure data collection in distributed WSN is considered. Here we propose and analyse three protocols for secure data collection in clustered WSN. The protocols use the tree-based key management scheme. The protocols authenticate the MDC and then transfer the encrypted data to MDC. The theoretical analysis shows that the protocols are invulnerable to the compromised MDC and replayed messages. The protocols show varying resiliency to compromised CH. Simulation results show that increased security incurs additional energy consumption in secure data collection.		A. S. Poornima;B. B.

A backbone network in the form of a cluster tree can enhance upper layer functions such as routing, broadcasting, in-network query processing and network management. A secure backbone based on the cluster tree enables secure upper layer functions and dynamic distribution of cryptographic keys among different nodes and users of collaborative networks. A secure cluster tree formation algorithm is presented that is independent of key pre-distribution scheme, network topology, and does not require a-priori neighborhood information or location awareness. Simulation based results show that the algorithm retains most of the desirable cluster and cluster tree characteristics while building the secure cluster tree. Availability of neighborhood information further improves the performance. Our simulations also suggest that hierarchical networks are more vulnerable to node capture than non-hierarchical networks.	algorithm;collaborative network;cryptography;database;internet backbone;key (cryptography);location awareness;mission critical;network topology;non-deterministic turing machine;routing;simulation	H.

We take the strictly increasing conditions of Sobrinho and make three main new contributions.  First, we show that the conditions are sufficient to guarantee that the protocols will converge to a unique solution, preventing the possibility of BGP wedgies. Second, we decouple the computation from the asynchronous context in which it occurs, allowing us to reason about a more relaxed model of asynchronous computation in which routing messages can be lost, reordered, and duplicated. Third, our theory and results have been fully formalised in the Agda theorem prover and the resulting library is publicly available for others to use and extend. This is in line with the increasing emphasis on formal verification of software for critical infrastructure.	agda;automated theorem proving;bellman–ford algorithm;border gateway protocol;computation;converge;distance-vector routing protocol;formal verification	Matthew L.

Conventional authentication schemes are not suitable to the sensor node because of the limitations of memory, computational power and energy in the node. In order to provide an efficient method to verify the identity of sender sensor nodes of WBAN, in this paper a lightweight authentication scheme, TinyZKP, based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is proposed and implemented on TinyOS-based sensor nodes. Our experimental results show that, compared to two ECDSA-based authentication schemes in TinyECC and WM-ECC, the TinyZKP runs 1.9 and 1.4 times faster and the energy cost is reduced by 48 % and 28 %, respectively.	authentication;zero-knowledge proof	Limin Ma;Yu Ge;Yuesheng Zhu	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1555-4	telecommunications;computer science;information security;authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;body area network;authentication;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;zero-knowledge proof;computer network	Mobile	-49.94448836920134	75.28018942025848	87419

Usually, cryptographic techniques are used for secure communications in wired and wireless networks. Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography have their advantages and disadvantages. In fact, any cryptographic means is ineffective if its key management is weak. Key management is also a central aspect for security in mobile ad hoc networks. In mobile ad hoc networks, the computational load and complexity for key management are strongly subject to restriction by the node’s available resources and the dynamic nature of network topology. We propose a secure and efficient key management framework (SEKM) for mobile ad hoc networks. SEKM builds a PKI by applying a secret sharing scheme and using an underlying multicast server groups. We give detailed information on the formation and maintenance of the server groups. In SEKM, each server group creates a view of the certificate authority (CA) and provides certificate update service for all nodes, including the servers themselves. A ticket scheme is introduced for efficient certificate service. In addition, an efficient server group updating scheme is proposed. The performance of SEKM is evaluated through simulation.	accessibility;authentication;authorization;certificate authority;communications protocol;computer simulation;confidentiality;cryptographic primitive;hoc (programming language);key management;multicast;network topology;non-repudiation;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;secret sharing;secure communication;server (computing)	Bing Wu;Jie Wu;Eduardo B.

At the same time, by assigning a special role to the cluster head nodes, clustering makes the network more vulnerable to attacks. In particular, disabling a cluster head by physical destruction or jamming may render the entire cluster inoperable temporarily until the problem is detected and a new cluster head is elected. Hence, the cluster head nodes may be attractive targets of attacks, and one would like to make it difficult for an adversary to identify them. The adversary can try to identify the cluster head nodes in various ways, including the observation of the cluster head election process itself and the analysis of the traffic patterns after the termination of the cluster head election. In this paper, we focus on the former problem, which we call the private cluster head election problem. This problem has been neglected so far, and as a consequence, existing cluster head election protocols leak too much information making the identification of the elected cluster head nodes easy even for a passive external observer.

We use combinatorial designs for key predistribution in sensor nodes. The deployment region is divided into square regions. The predistribution scheme has the advantage that all nodes within a particular region can communicate with each other directly and nodes which lie in a different regions can communicate via special nodes called agents which have more resources than the general nodes. The number of agents in a region is always three, whatever the size of the network. We give measures of resiliency taking the Lee distance into account. Apart from considering the resiliency in terms of fraction of links broken, we also consider the resiliency as the number of nodes and regions disconnected when some sensor are compromised. This second measure, though very important, had not been studied so far in key predistribution schemes which use deployment knowledge. We find that the resiliency as the fraction of links compromised is better than existing schemes. The number of keys preloaded in each sensor node is much less than all existing schemes and nodes are either directly connected or connected via two hop paths. The deterministic key predistribution schemes result in constant-time computation overhead for shared key discovery and path key establishment.	computation;key exchange;lee distance;node (computer science);overhead (computing);sensor node;software deployment;symmetric-key algorithm	Sushmita Ruj;Bimal K.

To cope with the deviation problem caused by the compromised nodes, this paper proposes a situation data fusion mechanism which can enhance reliability and integrality. It makes a reliability assurance scheme, which not only establishes a project distinguishing purposive and purposeless acts, but also builds a trust awareness rule based on historical trust and the correlations among current nodes. Furthermore, the data integrality is ensured in three stages, respectively. Firstly, in event detection stage, the proposed mechanism detects events and pretreats data to improve accuracy through most trust majority rule after collecting data. Moreover, during data fusion stage, data filtration is adopted to extract credible data. Additionally, the fusion weights of transactions depend on trust, so that they will change with the passage of time. As a result, the final fusion data will be closer to real value. Finally, in consistency detection stage, the detection rule with lower communication traffic is utilized to judge whether the centers are credible. Theory analyses and simulation results verify that the new mechanism can reduce the deviation. Meanwhile, reliability and stability have been validly enhanced.	data aggregation	Fangwei Li;Yifang Nie;Fan Liu;Jiang Zhu;Haibo Zhang	2014	IJDSN	10.1155/2014/585302	artificial intelligence;data mining;computer security	Mobile	-54.218315835363875	77.71370864580125	88986

We combine the designs of COI hierarchical management for scalability and reconfigurability with COI dynamic trust management for survivability and intrusion tolerance to compose a scalable, reconfigurable, and survivable COI management protocol for managing COI mission-oriented mobile groups in heterogeneous mobile environments. A COI mobile group in this environment would consist of heterogeneous mobile entities such as communication-device-carried personnel/robots and aerial or ground vehicles operated by humans exhibiting not only quality of service (QoS) characters, e.g., competence and cooperativeness, but also social behaviors, e.g., connectivity, intimacy and honesty. A COI commander or a subtask leader must measure trust with both social and QoS cognition depending on mission task characteristics and/or trustee properties to ensure successful mission execution. In this paper, we present a dynamic hierarchical trust management protocol that can learn from past experiences and adapt to changing environment conditions, e.g., increasing misbehaving node population, evolving hostility and node density, etc. to enhance agility and maximize application performance. With trust-based misbehaving node detection as an application, we demonstrate how our proposed COI trust management protocol is resilient to node failure, disconnection and capture events, and can help maximize application performance in terms of minimizing false negatives and positives in the presence of mobile nodes exhibiting vastly distinct QoS and social behaviors.	aerial photography;cognition;entity;experience;humans;intrusion tolerance;quality of service;reconfigurability;robot;scalability;trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Ing-Ray Chen;Jia Guo	2014	2014 IEEE 28th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2014.13	intrusion detection system;communications protocol;adaptability;scalability;community of interest;simulation;quality of service;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mathematical model;database;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-54.67084325783806	79.60503112016086	89455

For secure communication among sensors, secret keys must be established between them. Overhead imbalance of sensor nodes make it infeasible to use traditional key distribution center scheme for security service of distributed sensor network. In this paper we propose a distributed key establishment scheme. In the phase of key pre-distribution, every sensor node is preloaded the same size key pre-distribution information; in the phase of key establishment, the overhead every sensor node used to distribute key is the same. So, the overhead imbalance problem of traditional key distribution center scheme can be solved. A distinguishing property of this framework is that it does not require the knowledge of sensor's expected location and greatly simplifies the deployment of sensor networks. In security, the relationship between the ratio of compromised links to non-compromised sensors and the number of compromised nodes is linear.	key (cryptography);key distribution center;key exchange;overhead (computing);secure communication;security service (telecommunication);sensor node;software deployment	Hongwei Zhao;Shihui Pei;Pingping Liu	2007	Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)	10.1109/SNPD.2007.259	wireless sensor network;sensor node;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;key distribution;computer security;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	-50.543350641143746	76.8422834403744	89607

They query tags in a fixed bit order based on the assumption that the tag ID numbers are uniformly distributed throughout the range of the entire ID space because readers have no prior knowledge of the tags. This paper attempts to distinguish RFID applications where readers are already aware of all tags used by the application. We propose a heuristic query tree (H-QT) protocol that uses heuristic to select effective bits from known tags for the best queries in a divide and conquer approach. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed protocol is superior to original query tree protocols because it significantly reduces the number of tag collisions and no tag response.	heuristic;radio-frequency identification	Jongwoo Sung;Daeyoung Kim;Taehong Kim;Jinhyuk Choi	2012	IEICE Transactions		radio-frequency identification;query optimization;divide and conquer algorithms;heuristic;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;world wide web	Visualization	-49.021578838154724	83.58045124180367	89658

In other words, the sensors are divided into different deployment groups according to different types of data transmissions, but they cooperate with each other within and out of their respective groups. However, in traditional heterogeneous sensor networks, the classification is based on transmission range, energy level, computation ability, and sensing range. Taking this model into account, we propose a secure group association authentication mechanism using one-way accumulator which ensures that: before collaborating for a particular task, any pair of nodes in the same deployment group can verify the legitimacy of group association of each other. Secure addition and deletion of sensors are also supported in this approach. In addition, a policy-based sensor addition procedure is also suggested. For secure handling of disconnected nodes of a group, we use an efficient pairwise key derivation scheme to resist any adversary's attempt. Along with proposing our mechanism, we also discuss the characteristics of HDSN, its scopes, applicability, future, and challenges. The efficiency of our security management approach is also demonstrated with performance evaluation and analysis. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Assuming a probabilistic traffic model, permanent node identities, generalized source routing, and a fixed subset of selfish nodes we discuss the role of reputation awareness and route unawareness at selfish nodes.	end-to-end encryption;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;network performance;reputation system;simulation;source routing;statistical model;watchdog timer	Jerzy Konorski	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962923	wireless ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Robotics	-53.64484998826925	79.0953024248567	91469
f71a9e126059d0e58a2100e7091b814b50e68f17	dsmanet: defensive strategy of routing using game theory approach for mobile adhoc network		The Ad hoc technology enables a unique network namely mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET), where the establishment of the routing is a challenging task because of various characteristics such as mobility of the node and resource constraints of individual nodes. The self-configurability of the nodes makes the network vulnerable to initiate different forms of attacks in a very easy way. The malicious activities by the nodes are identified by its behavior of deceiving the other nodes data using participating into routing then dropping the packets, at the same time similar activities of packet drop could happen by non-malicious nodes due to some fault in the nodes. It is a challenging task to distinguish these two categories of nodes. Most of the current approaches focus on the trust building by the previous behavior of the nodes and black listing it, this approach leads to minimize the size of the network and sometimes permanent clustered network partition which leads to network failure. This paper introduces a novel strategy of defensive approach by the regular nodes as opposed to the malicious node and the method is named as “Defensive Strategy in MANET (DSMANET).” The performance parameters like throughput and routing overhead is compared with one of state of the art secure routing method DSMANET and found exhibiting better performance.	game theory;routing	K.

Hence, during data transmission, several nodes enter and leave the network. As a result, MANETs are vulnerable to several attacks in which the attackers get access to the network through malicious nodes entering the network in disguise of valid nodes. So, in MANETs, it is necessary to verify the nodes before using them to forward data packets/messages. In this paper, position verification technique for secure geographical routing has been proposed in MANET. In this technique, we estimate the position of the nodes before using them as forwarding nodes. Once the location is estimated, then it is verified for authenticity and then used for transmitting data packets.	malware;network packet;routing;transmitter	S. L. Aruna Rao;K. V. N.

Messages are exchanged to inform the other vehicles about emergency situations such as-safety alerts, and location privacy. Due to the usage of an insecure wireless medium, malicious activities in vehicles, i.e., illegal use of the false messages, can astray other vehicles. Security in communication among the vehicles can be provided by encrypting the messages using various security keys. However, it has been found from the literature that existing schemes for secure communication require large key size, and therefore may these schemes may not be applicable to smart cities. To address these issues, a secure message communication scheme among vehicles based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed. The proposed scheme needs smaller key size leading to mathematically simple and cost effective solution. Furthermore, the scheme provides mutual authentication, confidentiality, and forward secrecy. Security analysis prove that the proposed scheme is suitable to be adapted in smart city environment.	brute-force attack;brute-force search;computation;confidentiality;cryptographic hash function;elliptic curve cryptography;encryption;floor and ceiling functions;forward secrecy;key size;malware;man-in-the-middle attack;mutual authentication;polynomial;public-key cryptography;secure communication;smart city;time complexity	Amit Dua;Neeraj Kumar;Mukesh Singh;Mohammad S.

Protecting the network layer from malicious attacks is an important and challenging issue in both wired and wireless networks and the issue becomes even more challenging in the case of wireless mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper we propose a solution using a triple umpiring system (TUS), which provides security for routing and data-forwarding operations. In our system each node’s behaviour from source to destination is closely monitored by a set of three umpires. If any misbehaviour is noticed, umpires flag off the guilty node from the circuit. We have proposed two enhancements to the basic TUS for salvaging the circuit during disruptions in route reply and data-forwarding phases. The model with these two enhancements is called ETUS. We have implemented TUS and ETUS by modifying the popular Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector protocol. Extensive simulation studies using QualNet 5.0 establish the soundness of the proposal.

A Key Server must send the new key to all the remaining members so bandwidth efficiency concerns appear. Logical Key Tree algorithms reduce the number of messages to be sent, but in many scenarios, rekeying after each membership change has no sense. Batch rekeying algorithms are proposed as a solution to these problems. However such methods need to maintain the Logical Key Tree balanced all the time in order to achieve maximum bandwidth efficiency. This paper presents a new technique for multicast batch rekeying. This technique reallocates the tree nodes in order to keep the tree balanced all the time.	algorithm;batch processing;cipher;information-theoretic security;key server (cryptographic);multicast;performance evaluation;spectral efficiency	Josep Pegueroles;Francisco Rico-Novella	2003		10.1109/ISCC.2003.1214218	real-time computing;multicast;inter-domain;protocol independent multicast;computer science;cryptography;pragmatic general multicast;key management;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Networks	-48.847607200479054	77.56951964087156	95157

Moreover, the dynamic pair-wise key and group key management protocols are also important for long-lived and mobile WSN. In this paper, a two-layered dynamic key management (TDKM) approach for cluster-based WSN (CWSN) is proposed. Both pair-wise key and group key are distributed in three rounds for key material exchange without encryption/decryption and exponentiation operations in TDKM. In theoretical analysis, TDKM is compared with other key management protocols to show its efficiency. Finally, the relationships between the number of groups and the system performance including key generation overhead, network security, and secured data transmission overhead in CWSN are analyzed.	computational complexity theory;encryption;group key;key generation;key management;network architecture;network security;overhead (computing)	I-Hsun Chuang;Wei-Tsung Su;Chun-Yi Wu;Jang-Pong Hsu;Yau-Hwang Kuo	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.757	wireless sensor network;computer science;resource management;network security;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.961150478412755	77.277153090488	95758

Due to the limited capacities and capabilities of the sensor nodes, especially due to computational power restrictions, sensor network functionalities must be performed in effective way. Among those, providing security in WSNs requires lightweight solutions with no costly (in terms of memory, communication and computational) mechanisms for the sensor nodes. Moreover, the self-organizing characteristic and distributed nature of WSNs pose extra challenges for the security solutions. Fulfillment of classical security requirements is via lightweight adaptation of classical cryptographic techniques. However, WSNs are vulnerable to other network level and routing related attacks, such as selective forwarding, sinkhole, sybil and wormhole attacks, for which network level solutions are needed in addition to cryptographic solutions. On top of these, a secure and resilient key distribution mechanism is the main enabler of all security solutions. In the first half of this talk, after a brief introduction to WSNs, major threats and proposed security solutions for WSNs will be discussed.

Applications like network query, software updates, time synchronization and network management demand for broadcast security. In these applications if same key is used to encrypt every packet that we send, then various attacks can be launched to derive the key. In order to avoid this it is required to encrypt every packet using different key. In this paper we are proposing a method that is based on Shamir's secret sharing scheme, which ensures the freshness of the key. In the proposed method every packet is encrypted using different key and the key used for encryption is derived by the receiver using the additional information sent along with the packet.	encryption;network packet;patch (computing);replay attack;sensor;shamir's secret sharing	A.

The proposed scheme is a key management scheme that provides more efficient and secure methods for key generation and utilization. Enhanced and cost effective key management scheme achieves a secure communication between the members within the group-based network. In this scheme, the group key is generated only once which is static. Hence, it reduces the computation cost at any change in the network like member leave and member join. This papers deals with the analysis of enhanced and cost effective key management scheme with respect to communication overhead, computation cost. The analysis shows that the proposed key management scheme comprises of the most reliable methods for key generations and hence, the data communication. Enhanced and cost effective key management scheme is compared to some of the other key management techniques and proved to be the better choice in this study.	computation;group key;key generation;key management;multicast;overhead (computing);paper;secure communication	Saravana Kumar Muthusamy;P.

In this paper we consider the impact of the placement and range of limited-range jammers on ad hoc networks. Limited range jammers are more difficult to detect as they use transmission powers similar to that of regular nodes (or perhaps even smaller transmit powers). The attacker can locate his jammer(s) randomly in the network. Alternatively, jammers can be placed at strategic locations. For instance, intuitively, this can be nodes with the highest traffic inputs/outputs (discovered by sensing the traffic flow in the network). Using OPNET, we perform extensive simulations to show how significant such strategically placed attacks can be compared to random placement of limited-range jammers on both TCP and UDP traffic.	design review (u.s. government);hoc (programming language);radio jamming;randomness;simulation	Korporn Panyim;Thaier Hayajneh;Prashant Krishnamurthy;David Tipper	2009	2009 IEEE 34th Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2009.5355041	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-55.22642027929635	76.12761108580885	99891
67c496ccfdf982b500c147b027146d8422ad22e6	two improvements of random key predistribution for wireless sensor networks		Key distribution is of a critical importance to security of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Random key predistribution is an acknowledged approach to the key distribution problem. In this paper, we propose and analyze two novel improvements that enhance security provided by the random key predistribution schemes. The first improvement exploits limited length collisions in secure hash functions to increase the probability of two nodes sharing a key. The second improvement introduces hash chains into the key pool construction to directly increase the resilience against a node capture attack. Both improvements can be further combined to bring the best performance. We evaluate the improvements both analytically and computationally on a network simulator. The concepts used are not limited to the random key predistribution.	hash function;key distribution	Jirí Kur;Vashek Matyas;Petr Svenda	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-36883-7_5	key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Security	-51.106388155412674	77.4023874878049	100544

Supporting efficient in-network data aggregation while preserving the privacy of the data of individual sensor nodes has emerged as an important requirement in numerous WSN applications. For privacypreserving data aggregation in WSNs, He et al. (INFOCOM 2007) have proposed a Cluster-based Private Data Aggregation (CPDA) that uses a clustering protocol and a well-known key distribution scheme for computing an additive aggregation function in a privacy-preserving manner. In spite of the wide popularity of CPDA, it has been observed that the protocol is not secure and it is also possible to enhance its efficiency. In this paper, we first identify a security vulnerability in the existing CPDA scheme, wherein we show how a malicious participant node can launch an attack on the privacy protocol so as to get access to the private data of its neighboring sensor nodes. Next it is shown how the existing CPDA scheme can be made more efficient by suitable modification of the protocol. Further, suitable modifications in the existing protocol have been proposed so as to plug the vulnerability of the protocol.	cluster analysis;data aggregation;information privacy;key distribution;known-key distinguishing attack;utility functions on indivisible goods;vulnerability (computing)	Jaydip Sen;Subhamoy Maitra	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-29615-4_15	data aggregator;wireless sensor network;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Security	-51.08480933354932	76.35579333265972	101069

Cloned nodes subvert sensor network processing from within. In a companion paper [2], we show how to detect and remove clones from sensor networks using random key predistribution security measures. Keys that are present on the cloned nodes are detected by using authentication statistics based on key usage frequency. For consistency with existing random key predistribution literature, and ease of explanation, the network in that paper used an Erdos-Renyi topology. In the Erdos-Renyi topology, the probability of connection between any two nodes in the network is uniform. Since the communications ranges of sensor nodes are limited, this topology is flawed. This article applies the clone detection approach from [2] to more realistic network topologies. Grid and ad hoc topologies reflect the node connectivity patterns of networks of nodes with range limits. We provide analytical methods for choosing detection thresholds that accurately detect clones. We use simulations to verify our method. In particular we find the limitations of this approach, such as the number of nodes that can be inserted without being detected.	adversary (cryptography);authentication;duplicate code;hoc (programming language);network processor;network topology;sensor node;simulation	Richard R.

987de4189b681bc6eaa0fb576d3a599a1a0207c5	analytic model on data security in vanets		Fast-changing topologies and uncoordinated transmissions are two critical challenges of implementing data security in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). We propose a new protocol, where transmitters adaptively switch between backing off retransmissions and changing keys to improve success rate. A new 3-dimensional (3-D) Markov model, which can analyze the proposed protocol with symmetric or asymmetric keys in terms of data security and connectivity, is developed. Analytical results, validated by simulations, show that the proposed protocol achieves substantially improved resistance against collusion attacks.	data security;hoc (programming language);markov chain;markov model;network packet;simulation;transmitter	Xuan Zha;Xu Wang;Wei Ni;Ren Ping Liu;Yingjie Jay Guo;Xinxin Niu;Kangfeng Zheng	2017	2017 17th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2017.8261227	computer network;collusion;public-key cryptography;data security;key (lock);network topology;computer science;markov process;solid modeling;markov model	Arch	-51.10626879649852	77.99814972097992	102291

A serious consequence of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network easily. They are indeed ``attack multipliers'' and therefore are extremely destructive to the network. Detecting replication attacks is a nontrivial problem in MANETs due to the challenges resulted from node mobility, cloned/compromised node collusion, and the large number and wide spread of the replicas. Existing approaches either fail in mobile environments due to the limitations caused by local views or their dependence on invariant claims such as location and neighbor list, or are constrained by the number, distribution, and colluding activities of the replicas. In this paper, we propose two replication detection schemes (TDD and SDD) to tackle all these challenges from both the time domain and the space domain. Our theoretical analysis indicates that TDD and SDD provide high detection accuracy and excellent resilience against smart and colluding replicas, have no restriction on the number and distribution of replicas, and incur low communication/computation overhead. To our best knowledge, TDD and SDD are the only approaches that support mobile networks while place no restrictions on the number and distribution of the cloned frauds and on whether the replicas collude or not.	authorization;computation;computer form factor;credential;cryptographic hash function;entity;hoc (programming language);network model;one-way function;overhead (computing);sensor;stationary process;tamper resistance;test-driven development;verlet list	Kai Xing;Xiuzhen Cheng	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5461977	mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;information security;wireless network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-50.79740693609067	76.88349835209407	102969

A peer ps has to collect correct object information from trustworthy acquaintances which are considered to hold correct information. We consider two types of trustworthiness. First, the subjective trustworthiness stst on an acquaintance pt shows how much the peer ps trusts the acquaintance pt. The objective trustworthiness otst on an acquaintance pt indicates how much other peers trust the acquaintance pt. In this paper, we discuss three algorithms OT1, OT2, and OT3 for a peer ps to obtain the objective trustworthiness otst on the acquaintance pt. A peer ps collects subjective trustworthiness on an acquaintance pt from peers and obtain the average value as the objective trustworthiness. In the algorithm OT1, a peer ps tries to find every acquaintance of a target acquaintance pt in a type of flooding algorithm. Here, it takes time and more number of messages are transmitted. On the other hand, the peer ps sends request messages only to the acquaintances to reduce the number of messages in the algorithms OT1 and OT2. In OT2, only acquaintances which the peer ps can trust are considered. We evaluate the algorithms in terms of how correct objective trustworthiness can be obtained.	centralized computing;flooding algorithm;overlay network;peer-to-peer;ps (unix);trust (emotion)	Soichi Sawamura;Leonard Barolli;Ailixier Aikebaier;Valbona Barolli;Makoto Takizawa	2010	2010 International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2010.90	database index;trustworthiness;overlay network;quality of service;computer science;peer-to-peer;database;authorization;internet privacy;world wide web;distributed database;computer network	HPC	-54.51044433165745	80.39581806153159	104330

Though this information mixing has been proven to maximize network throughput, it also introduces security challenges such as pollution attacks. A malicious node could insert a malicious packet into the system and this corrupted packet will propagate more quickly than in traditional copy-and-forward networks. Several authors have studied secure network coding from both information theoretic and probabilistic viewpoints. In this paper, we show that there are serious flaws in several of these schemes (the security “proofs” for these schemes were presented in these publications).	linear network coding;malware;network packet;provable security;router (computing);theory;throughput	Yongge Wang	2009	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		computer network;throughput;linear network coding;probabilistic logic;network packet;computer security;computer science	Security	-51.49309914142044	78.50465133526002	104429

In this paper we focus on preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. As an example, we consider intruders that can cause DoS by exploiting the route discovery procedure of reactive routing protocols. We show the unsuitability of tools such as control chart, used in statistical process control (SPC), to detect DoS and propose an anomaly-based intrusion detection system that uses a combination of chi-square test & control chart to first detect intrusion and then identify an intruder. When the intruder is isolated from the network we show reduced overhead and increased throughput. Simulation results show that our algorithm performs well at an affordable processing overhead over the range of scenarios tested.	algorithm;anomaly detection;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;centralized computing;denial-of-service attack;erewhon;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);physical security;routing;simulation;throughput	Adnan Nadeem;Michael P.

The key, thus derived, can be used to establish a secure channel between the participants. When the group composition changes (or otherwise), one can employ supplementary GKA protocols to derive a new key. Thus, they are well-suited to the key establishment needs of dynamic peer-to-peer networks as in ad hoc networks. While many of the proposed GKA protocols are too expensive to be employed by the constrained devices often present in ad hoc networks, others lack a formal security analysis. We present a simple, secure and efficient GKA protocol well suited to dynamic ad hoc networks. We also present results of our implementation of the protocol in a prototype application.	adversary (cryptography);communications protocol;compiler;computation;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman problem;elliptic curve cryptography;group key;hoc (programming language);key (cryptography);key exchange;key-agreement protocol;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;prototype;provable security;secure channel	Daniel Augot;Raghav Bhaskar;Valérie Issarny;Daniele Sacchetti	2005	Sixth IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks	10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.26	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.53805785246878	76.44983387961848	106029

Wireless communications offer organizations and users many benefits such as portability and flexibility, increased productivity, and lower installation costs. However, risks are inherent in any wireless network. As the technologies of next generation wireless networks are emerging, security has become a primary concern in order to provide dependable and secure communication between the wireless nodes in a hostile environment. The next generation wireless networks face many unique challenges in security such as open network architecture, shared wireless medium, limited resource constraints, and highly dynamic network topology. This special issue in Security and Communication Networks presents current research focusing on the standard or protocol related security, attacks and defense applications, security architecture and frameworks, and theories and methodologies in security in next generation wireless networks. In view of this, we selected eight papers on security in next generation wireless networks to this special issue. The papers are either selected from open submissions or the best paper in 2008 International Workshop on Network and System Security (NSS 2008), held on 18–19 October 2008, in Shanghai, China. All the papers were selected on the basis of their originality, technical quality, and significance. Each paper was under rigorous technical review by at least three international reviewers. The selected papers are summarized below. Routing security contexts via an IP network imposes new challenging requirements of secure crosshandover services and security context management. In the first paper, Kim and Shin present a context router that manages security contexts in an all-IP network, providing seamless and secure handover services for the mobile users that carry multimediaaccess devices. The proposed predictive routing mechanism improves seamless and secure cross-handover services. Trust establishment and management are essential for any security framework of MANETs. In the second paper, Dahshan and Irvine propose a robust self-organized, public key management for MANETs. The proposed scheme relies on establishing a small number of trust relations between neighboring nodes during the network initialization phase. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is robust and efficient in the mobility environment of MANET and against malicious node attacks. A mobile node in a MANET must be assigned a free IP address before it may participate in unicast communications. This is a fundamental and difficult problem in the practical application of any MANET. In the third paper, Zhou, Mutka, and Ni propose a secure autoconfiguration algorithm, namely secure prophet address allocation, to perform prophet address allocation while considering the requirements of communication overhead, latency, and scalability. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach is able to maintain uniqueness of address assignment in the presence of IP spoofing attacks, ‘state pollution’ attacks, and Sybil attacks. In the fourth paper, Babu and Venkataram present a security techniques selection scheme for mobile transactions, called the Transactions-Based Security Scheme (TBSS).

Trust relations are based on evidence related to the previous interactions of entities within a protocol. In this work, we are focusing on the evaluation process of trust evidence in Ad Hoc Networks. Because of the dynamic nature of Ad Hoc Networks, trust evidence may be uncertain and incomplete. Also, no pre-established infrastructure can be assumed. The process is formulated as a path problem on a directed graph, where nodes represent entities, and edges represent trust relations. Using the theory of semirings, we show how two nodes can establish an indirect trust relation without previous direct interaction. The results are robust in the presence of attackers. We give intuitive requirements for any trust evaluation algorithm. The performance of the scheme is evaluated on three topologies.	algorithm;directed graph;entity;hoc (programming language);interaction;network security;network topology;requirement;semantic network	George Theodorakopoulos;John S.

However, all the existing self-healing group key distribution schemes in the literature are designed for homogenous WSNs that do not scale. In contract, heterogeneous WSNs have better scalability and performance. We are thus motivated to study selfhealing group key distribution for heterogeneous WSNs. In particular, we propose the concept of hierarchical self-healing group key distribution, tailored to the heterogeneous WSN architecture; we further revisit and adapt Dutta et al.’s model to the setting of hierarchical self-healing group key distribution, and propose concrete schemes that achieve computational security and high efficiency.	computational hardness assumption;group key;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;lossy compression;scalability;semantic security	Yanjiang Yang;Jianying Zhou;Robert H.

Our contribution is based on the notion of inner-circle consistency, where local node interaction is used to neutralize errors/attacks at the source, both preventing errors/attacks from propagating in the network and improving the fidelity of the propagated information. We achieve this goal by combining statistical (a proposed fault-tolerant cluster algorithm) and security (threshold cryptography) techniques with application-aware checks to exploit the data/computation that is partially and naturally replicated in wireless applications. We have prototyped an inner-circle framework with the ns-2 network simulator, and we use it to demonstrate the idea of inner-circle consistency in two significant wireless scenarios: (1) the neutralization of black hole attacks in AODV networks and (2) the neutralization of sensor errors in a target detection/localization application executed over a wireless sensor network.	algorithm;black hole;computation;cryptography;dependability;fault tolerance;hoc (programming language);simulation;software propagation	Claudio Basile;Zbigniew T.

However, they are far from mature for large-scale deployment in some applications due to the lack of the satisfactory guarantees on security. The main challenges exposed to the security of WMNs come from the facts of the shared nature of the wireless architecture and the lack of globally trusted central authorities. A well-performed security framework for WMNs will contribute to network survivability and strongly support the network growth. A low-computational and scalable key management model for WMNs is proposed in this paper which aims to guarantee well-performed key management services and protection from potential attacks.	fault tolerance;key management;mesh networking;routing;scalability;software deployment;trusted operating system;wireless mesh network	Li Gao;Elizabeth Chang;Sazia Parvin;Song Han;Tharam S.

A trust model, which is the core component of a trust mechanism, provides a quantitative way to evaluate the trustworthiness of sensor nodes. The trust evaluation is normally conducted by watchdog nodes, which monitor and collect other sensors' behavior information. Most existing works mainly focus on the design of the trust models and how these models can be used to defend against certain insider attacks. However, these studies are empirical with the implicit assumption that the trust models are secure and reliable. In this paper, we discuss several security vulnerabilities that watchdog and trust mechanisms have, examine how inside attackers can exploit these security holes, and finally propose defending approaches that can mitigate the weaknesses of trust mechanism and watchdog.	authentication;authorization;computational trust;cryptography;sensor;trust (emotion);vulnerability (computing);watchdog timer	Youngho Cho;Gang Qu;Yuanming Wu	2012	2012 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops	10.1109/SPW.2012.32	wireless sensor network;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computational trust;computer network	Security	-52.82627037062793	76.16986293969526	107635

Due to cutting-edge communication technology and advancements in terms of radio-mounted devices, groups in front-end war field, as well as rescue troops, are well connected to carry out their missions using multicast communication. The key to the success of military networks in a hostile environment is security and collaboration. Internal attacks are major threats to impose a great failure in their mission goal. We introduce a novel indirect internal stealthy attack and known direct internal stealthy attacks such as black hole and deny-to-forward attacks on tree-based multicast routing protocol. These internal attacks can induce the performance degradation in the multicast group. We design a distributed cross-layer based machine learning anomaly detection system for multicast communication of MANET. Using efficient multilayer features, rather than routing layer features alone, improve the accuracy of the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in terms of detection of direct and indirect internal stealthy attacks. We evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and detection accuracy of well-known multiclass classifiers in combination with various feature subset selection algorithms. Since our problem with classification is a multiclass, the performance metrics calculated here are different from the binary classifiers. Our IDS is efficient, with respect to high true positives, very low false positives and less resource consumption even in the very challenging conditions of multicast communication of ad hoc networks.	intrusion detection system;secure multicast	Arthur Menaka Pushpa;Kannan Kathiravan	2016	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-015-1065-2	intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;computer security;xcast;computer network	Mobile	-55.26329210768922	75.3805908137454	107883

Thus, we attempt to analyze the spatial distribution of crowd to facilitate the swift response to the emergency of public security. The states of crowd can be represented as the spatial distribution of moving points. The fractal features are used to describe the degree of gathering of points. PCA removes the disturbed factors from feature vector so as to keep only relevant information. The abnormal distributions of crowd, which are usually caused by natural disasters or special affairs, are detected with the proposed NPA (neighboring points accumulated) algorithm. The experiment on levy-flight simulation data shows that the proposed method is effective and reliable.	algorithm;feature vector;flight simulator;fractal;geographic coordinate system;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);mobile phone;printer working group;privacy;sensor;simulation;swift (programming language)	Zhenmei Liao;Su Yang;Jianning Liang	2010	2010 IEEE/ACM Int'l Conference on Green Computing and Communications & Int'l Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-CPSCom.2010.51	simulation;geography;data mining;computer security	EDA	-56.932423495054074	75.21597978673094	108182

In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient multi-hop Mobile IP registration scheme for the MANET-Internet integrated architecture.

Nevertheless, those applications have stringent security requirements, as they affect road traffic safety. Security requirement like authentication, privacy and Integrity are crucial to VANETs, as they avoid attacks against vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communication. In this paper, we investigate the authentication and privacy issues in VANETs. We explore the Attribute Based Signature (ABS) primitive and its variants. We then select among existing ABS literature, an efficient scheme (the best known) that achieve both traceability and user-privacy (anonymity). Finally, we propose a protocol for VANETs that uses traceable ABS in general context of multi-hop routing.	authentication;confidentiality;hoc (programming language);privacy;requirement;routing;traceability;vehicle-to-vehicle	Khalid Mrabet;Faissal El Bouanani;Hussain Ben-Azza	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications (WINCOM)	10.1109/WINCOM.2015.7381299	vehicular ad hoc network;computer science;cryptography;authentication;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.442512048749684	74.81652621055248	110426
f9dbcc77e72c664b0b6b06319174f229dd88a380	secure end-to-end data aggregation (seeda) protocols for wireless sensor networks		Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of a large number of nodes with limited sensing, computation and communication capabilities. In such a network the data transmission is an energy-consuming operation. Hence to increase the lifetime of the network it is essential to reduce the number of bits transmitted. One widely used method for reducing the data transmission is data aggregation. The security issues such as data integrity, confidentiality and freshness in data aggregation become crucial when the WSN is deployed in a remote or hostile environment. Secure data aggregation schemes are suitable to achieve security in data aggregation. In this paper we propose two protocols called SEEDA-SUM/AVG and SEEDA-MIN/MAX for secure data aggregation that provide end-to-end data privacy. The protocol SEEDA-SUM/AVG is used to compute the SUM and AVERAGE aggregates. Using this protocol the average number of bits transmitted per node is reduced by 30%-70% compared to the scheme proposed by Castelluccia et al. The SEEDA-MIN/MAX protocol computes MINIMUM and MAXIMUM aggregates by comparing the encrypted data. The protocol uses simple comparison operations in contrast to multiple encryptions in the scheme proposed by Ertaul et al.	data aggregation	A. S. Poornima;B. B.

b866fad88a3cde395953ebdb94dba4fb9afaab03	detection and mitigation of dos attacks in vanet using secured minimum delay routing protocol		In vehicular Ad Hoc network security is one of the features that need to be investigated seriously. In vehicular ad hoc network the vehicles move and communicate with each other and with the roadside unit (RSU) as well. The nodes are self-organized, highly portable and free to share so any node can interact with any other node resulting in security breach if there is any attack in the network. There are various attacks where the vehicles and RSUs are prone to attackers. Among those security attacks the denial of service attack and the distributed denial of service attack is given prominence and discussed in this paper. We have proposed Secured Detection of Dos Packet Algorithm for Denial of Service attack incorporated in the proposed Secured Minimum Delay Routing Protocol. We have evaluated the performance in NS3 using various parameters such as throughput and minimum delay with Adhoc on Demand Distance Vector AODV protocol and showed that the proposed algorithms are cost effective to mitigate the attacks.	denial-of-service attack;routing	V.

Four representative routing protocols are chosen for analysis and evaluation including: Ad Hoc on demand Distance Vector routing (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA). Secure ad hoc networks have to meet five security requirements: confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and availability.

Towards this goal, we have grouped the WSNs application environments into two major categories (i.e., infrastructure-based and infrastructureless) and have examined: a) which of the cluster-based Group Key Agreement (GKA) protocols that appear in the literature are applicable to each category, and b) to which degree these protocols will impact the systems' performance and energy consumption. In order to answer these questions we have calculated the complexity of each protocol and the energy cost it will add to the system. The evaluation of all discussed protocols is presented in a generalized way and can therefore serve as a reference point for future evaluations and for the design of new, improved GKA protocols.	communications protocol;computation;emoticon;group key;key-agreement protocol;network architecture;requirement;scalability	Eleni Klaoudatou;Elisavet Konstantinou;Georgios Kambourakis;Stefanos Gritzalis	2011	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/SURV.2011.061710.00109	wireless sensor network;computer science;resource management;cryptographic protocol;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-49.8201764039685	76.44637693773203	115206

But in ephemeral networks - a new breed of mobile networks where contact times between nodes are short and neighbors change frequently - reputations are hard to build. In this case, local revocation is a faster and more efficient alternative. In this paper, we define a game-theoretic model to analyze the various local revocation strategies. We establish and prove the conditions leading to subgame-perfect equilibria. We also derive the optimal parameters for voting-based schemes. Then we design a protocol based on our analysis and the practical aspects that cannot be captured in the model. With realistic simulations on ephemeral networks we compare the performance and economic costs of the different techniques.	game theory;hoc (programming language);reputation system;simulation	Maxim Raya;Mohammad Hossein Manshaei;Márk Félegyházi;Jean-Pierre Hubaux	2008		10.1145/1455770.1455797	wireless ad hoc network;game theory;cellular network;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-53.11214534124392	78.55290400528759	115645

5946388a6c8586b7784012737f93eb6c117e6fc3	a survey of distributed certificate authorities in manets		A Certificate Authority (CA) provides the critical authentication and security services for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) which are used for the Internet and wired networks. In MANETs (wireless and ad hoc) there is an inability to offer a centralized CA to provide these security services. Recent research has looked to facilitate the use of CAs within MANETs through the use of a Distributed Certificate Authority (DCA) for wireless and ad hoc networks. This paper presents a number of different types of DCA protocols and categorizes them into groups based on their factors and specifications. The paper concludes by proposing the best DCA security services in terms of performance and level of security.	authentication;centralized computing;certificate authority;hoc (programming language);internet;public key infrastructure	Junaid Ahsenali Chaudhry;Kashif Saleem;Paul Dowland;Mahdi H.

The high power nodes in heterogeneous wireless networks do not have energy constraints but the user nodes, which can be large in numbers, are usually low power energy constrained devices. Therefore, the GKA protocol used to secure group communications in these networks has to take into consideration both the low power nature of the user nodes and the network size. In this paper, we present an energy efficient and scalable authenticated GKA protocol, which uses our proposed Contributory Ring-Centralised (ContRi-Central) group model. Besides providing complexity analysis, we also show the computational and communication energy consumption costs analysis of all nodes running our proposed scheme and four other efficient GKA protocols. Both the complexity analysis and energy consumption costs analysis indicate that our proposed scheme is more efficient and suitable for heterogeneous wireless networks.	authentication;group key;key-agreement protocol	Joseph Chee Ming Teo;Chik How Tan;Jim Mee Ng	2006	IJSN	10.1504/IJSN.2006.011782	heterogeneous network;communication in small groups;computer science;information security;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-49.7634857273487	76.09436010493542	117077

9462df6540f7ece7f79c06cfe0e58f99137790b7	collaborative lightweight trust management scheme for wireless sensor networks	trust;wsn;security threats;trust counselor;routing protocol	The cooperative multi-hop communication in a remote infrastructureless networking environment poses a serious security threat for the design of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Because of their vulnerability to attacks, the intrinsic and demanding assignment of WSNs is security. Earlier security solutions aimed at thwarting different types of malicious threats but failed to consider the resource constrained nature of sensor nodes. The stringent resource constraints of WSNs require a lightweight trust-based routing scheme. In this paper, we propose a collaborative lightweight trust-based (CLT) routing protocol for WSNs with minimal overhead in regard to memory and energy consumption. It does not use promiscuous mode of operation to monitor the neighboring nodes for trust derivation. CLT employs a novel trust counselor that monitors and warns the neighboring nodes whose trust falls below a warning threshold. The warning message alarms a sensor node to check and correct the packet forwarding behavior to improve its trust relationship with its neighbors. Theoretical analysis and simulation results of CLT protocol demonstrate higher packet delivery ratio, higher network lifetime, lower end-to-end delay, lower memory and energy consumption than the traditional and existing trust-based routing schemes.	trust management (managerial science)	X.

To resolve the problem that marked information has been easy to be covered by the information of down-stream node in the traceback schemes based on probabilistic packet marking (PPM), ‘a non-repeatedly marking traceback scheme for wireless sensor networks (NMtrace) is proposed to locate the compromised nodes in this study’. In the NMtrace, when a packet is forwarding to the base station, if the edge information of the packet has been marked by forwarding nodes, the packet will not be marked again by the other nodes. The security shows that the NMtrace can resilience against various attacks which are launched by the compromised forwarding nodes collude with compromised source node. The performance evaluation shows that with the length of the attack path increasing, ‘the NMtrace needs fewer’ packets to reconstruct the attack path than the PPM-based schemes, the complete convergence rate less affected by the marking probability p and the energy ‘consumption of the NMtrace is also’ less than PPM-based schemes.	item unique identification	Zhiming Zhang;Ping Li;Xiaoyong Xiong;Changgen Jiang	2015	IET Wireless Sensor Systems	10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0005	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Embedded	-54.36815165774269	76.88418266851181	118941

One of them is the availability of secure threshold key distribution protocol. In this paper, we study fully identity-based and threshold key distribution methods in MANET. For improve the availability of these methods, we propose an identity-based multi-signcryption scheme, which can efficient achieve message confidentiality, unforgeability, non-repudiation, robustness in multi-users; moreover, it has message flexibility, order flexibility, message verifiability, and order verifiability. For that, we use this multi-signcryption scheme to identity-based and threshold key distribution protocols; as a result, a new identity-based and threshold key distribution protocol for MANET is given. Owing to the advantages of our identity-based multi-signcryption scheme, our key distribution protocol not only can distributed threshold key in secure and efficient manner, but improves the availability of fully distributed threshold key management in MANET.	authentication;confidentiality;cryptography;encryption;formal verification;identity creation;key distribution;key management;non-repudiation;signcryption	Chuanrong Zhang;Yuqing Zhang	2009	2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security	10.1109/CIS.2009.49	mobile ad hoc network;computer science;internet privacy;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-48.38055849871932	76.59700425943804	118956

Specifically, in the proposed SDPP scheme, each user is granted with a pseudo-ID, a certificate, and its private key corresponding to his similar interests. Based on the cooperative neighbour technique and the homomorphic encryption method, the proposed SDPP scheme cannot only detect and avoid black hole attacks but it also can preserve the message privacy. Through security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure in the MP2PSN scenarios. Moreover, we also discuss how SDPP can achieve the privacy-preservation of message and the evolution of users' certificates. Both theoretical and simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of black hole detection rate, average Detectreq reporting, and average transmission delay under various scenarios.	peer-to-peer;social network	Mohamed Amine Ferrag;Mehdi Nafa;Salim Ghanemi	2014	IJICS	10.1504/IJICS.2014.066650	homomorphic encryption;computer science;information security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	ECom	-48.848944415795046	74.81239391597192	119423

A key network security research area is in the study of malware propagation across the SDN-enabled networks. To analyze the spreading processes of network malware (e.g., viruses) in SDN, we propose a dynamic model with a time-varying community network, inspired by research models on the spread of epidemics in complex networks across communities. We assume subnets of the network as communities and links that are dense in subnets but sparse between subnets. Using numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, we find that the efficiency of network malware propagation in this model depends on the mobility rate q of the nodes between subnets. We also find that there exists a mobility rate threshold qc. The network malware will spread in the SDN when the mobility rate q > qc. Themalware will survive when q > qc and perish when q < qc. The results showed that our model is effective, and the results may help to decide the SDN control strategy to defend against network malware and provide a theoretical basis to reduce and prevent network security incidents.

The resource limitations and vulnerabilities of wireless sensor node expose the network to suffer with numerous attacks. The WSN constraints and limitations should be taken under consideration while designing the security mechanism. The recent Biological inspired self-organized secure autonomous routing protocol (BIOSARP) requires certain amount of time at initialization phase of WSN deployment to develop overall network knowledge. Initialization phase is a critical stage in the overall life span of WSN that requires an efficient active security measures. Therefore, in this paper we propose E-BIOSARP that enhances the BIOSARP with random key encryption and decryption mechanism. We present the design, pseudo code and the simulation results to prove the efficiency of E-BIOSARP for WSN. Network simulator 2 (NS2) has been utilized to perform the analysis. Our result shows that proposed E-BIOSARP can efficiently protect WSN from spoofed, altered or replayed routing information attacks, selective forwarding, acknowledgement spoofing, sybil attack and hello flood attack.	autonomous robot;confidentiality;cryptography;denial-of-service attack;encryption;network packet;pseudocode;routing;self-organization;sensor node;simulation;software deployment;sybil attack	Kashif Saleem;Mohammed S.

7a53974e00397d5c92d03c4e4821a75f4afa6288	a fog-based hierarchical trust mechanism for sensor-cloud underlying structure		In recent years, Sensor-Cloud has become a hot issue. In this structure, there are some security problems that can be well solved by trust mechanism. However, there are some deficiencies in existing trust mechanism, especially for the Sensor-Cloud underlying structure. We propose a fog-based hierarchical trust mechanism for these deficiencies. This hierarchical structure is not only easy to establish and implement, but also moves heavy and fine-grained data analysis tasks to the fog layer. The experimental results indicate that this fog-based hierarchical structure can deal well in saving network energy, guaranteeing a fast malicious node detect speed, detecting hidden data attacks and recovering misjudgment nodes in an allowable delay range.	sensor	Guangxue Zhang;Tian Wang;Md.

The complete distribution of the intrusion detection process is the salient feature of our proposition: distribution is not restricted to data collection but also applied to execution of the detection algorithm and alert correlation. Each node in the MANET runs a local IDS (LIDS) that cooperates with others LIDS. A mobile agent framework is used to preserve the autonomy of each LIDS while providing a flexible technique for exploring the natural redundancies in MANET to compensate for the dynamic state of wireless links between high mobility nodes. The proposed solution has been validated by actual implementation, which is described in the paper. Three attacks are presented as illustrative examples of the IDS mechanisms. Attack detection is formally described by specification of data collection, attack signatures associated with such data and alerts generation and correlation. Experiments exhibit fairly good results, the attacks being collaboratively detected in real-time.	alert correlation;algorithm;anomaly detection;authentication;description logic;electronic signature;hoc (programming language);intrusion detection message exchange format;linux intrusion detection system;mobile agent;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription	Ricardo Staciarini Puttini;Jean-Marc Percher;Ludovic Mé;Rafael Timóteo de Sousa Júnior	2004	Proceedings.

In a distributed computation environment, we may therefore want to prevent corrupt processes from denying or forging causal relationships between events. The audit of causal relationships of group multicast communications is an important component in achieving a solution to the problem of group-oriented distributed computing security. In this paper, a new approach to audit causal relationships of group multicast communications in group-oriented distributed systems is proposed. The goal of the auditing service is to collect, maintain, make available, and validate irrefutable evidence regarding causal relationships in group-oriented distributed systems. We affirm that the denial of existing causal relationships and the forgery of nonexistent causal relationships in group-oriented distributed systems can be correctly audited by our proposed approach. Also, auditing the causal delivery ordering for group multicast communications can actually be achieved. Moreover, we have validated the proposed auditing scheme to a moderately complex example. Experience indicates that the proposed scheme is indeed very useful.	algorithm;causal filter;causality;computation;computer security;control flow;directed acyclic graph;distributed computing;multicast	Woei-Jiunn Tsaur;Shi-Jinn Horng	2001	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1023/A:1008158907662	communication in small groups;computer science;information security;distributed computing;audit;computer security;distributed computing environment;computer network	Security	-53.87307220994884	78.35339660336108	121366

Our proposed scheme is unconditionally secure against adversarial attack in the sense that no matter how many nodes are compromised by the adversary, the rest of the network remains perfectly unaffected. On a more positive note, our design is scalable and provides full connectivity.	software deployment	Sarbari Mitra;Sourav Mukhopadhyay;Ratna Dutta	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-36818-9_56	mathematics;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	HCI	-50.640409311587796	77.29416292270831	121875

However, because wireless mobile nodes are usually constrained by limited power and computation resources, a selfish node may be unwilling to spend its resources in forwarding packets which are not of its direct interest, even though it expects other nodes to forward its packets to the destination. It has been shown that the presence of such selfish nodes degrades the overall performance of a non-cooperative ad hoc network. To address this problem, we propose a secure and objective reputation-based incentive (SORI) scheme to encourage packet forwarding and discipline selfish behavior. Different from the existing schemes, under our approach, the reputation of a node is quantified by objective measures, and the propagation of reputation is efficiently secured by a one-way-hash-chain-based authentication scheme. Armed with the reputation-based mechanism, we design a punishment scheme to penalize selfish nodes. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can successfully identify selfish nodes and punish them accordingly.	authentication;computation;hash chain;hoc (programming language);network packet;node (computer science);one-way function;software propagation	Qi He;Dapeng Wu;Pradeep K.

Automated monitoring of cattle with wireless monitoring devices mounted on the animals can increase efficiency of cattle production, decrease its reliance on human labour and thus increase its profitability. Multi-hop ad hoc wireless communication has the potential to increase battery life of the animal mounted devices, decrease their size and combat disconnections. This thesis reveals that no current approach sufficiently addresses energy constrains of the animal mounted devices and potential disconnections. We propose a delay tolerant store and forward architecture that provides data retention, detecting custom events, issues notifications, answers remote and in-situ queries, based on requirements identified during field experiments we conducted. This architecture utilizes fixed infrastructure but also works in ad hoc infrastructureless conditions. The core of the proposed architecture, Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) communication, provides offloading data for long term storage by sending data to farm servers via sinks that are a part of MANET and handles in-situ queries issued by users collocated with the animals. The proposed MANET routing algorithm addresses high mobility of nodes and disconnections. It provides lower and more balanced energy usage, shorter delays and increased success ratio of delivering answers to in-situ queries than more generic existing approaches. Problems of large scale deployment of the envisaged system are also addressed. We discuss the necessary configuration process performed during the system installation as well as pervasive mobile and home access to the target system. We propose cost efficient strategies for sinks installation and connecting sinks to farm servers, adaptive to different requirements, estates layout, available infrastructure and existing human and vehicle mobility. We also propose a cost efficient security model for the target system based on public key cryptography.	algorithm;cost efficiency;experiment;hoc (programming language);public-key cryptography;requirement;routing;sensor;server (computing);software deployment;store and forward	Bartosz Wietrzyk	2008			simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Mobile	-50.65218482926561	74.76041291530004	123261

3e55f8ab6f27b5227c8593ae358d5f545f6bd712	a security response approach based on the deployment of mobile agents		This paper introduces a response mechanism to improve the tolerance against security threats in MANET environments. The mechanism is started after detecting the existence of nodes with malicious behavior, and is based on the use of one or more mobile agents to improve the connectivity of the network. This way, in the event of the detection of a malicious node (e.g. a selfish node or a dropper node), an agent is employed to maximize the overall connectivity of the network. Every agent acts as a relaying node within the MANET and it is automatically positioned according to a particle swarm optimization (PSO) process. This paper represents a work in progress. However, the promising results obtained show the good suitability of the approach to improve the survivability of the network from a security perspective.	mobile agent	Roberto Magán-Carrión;José Camacho-Páez;Pedro García-Teodoro	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-38073-0_16	application security;mobile computing;computer security	Robotics	-55.35064109837291	74.89141260611387	123993
8ecb00c0d8500d8113ede32beda3962c1207b2ea	a hybrid approach for path vulnerability matrix on random key predistribution for wireless sensor networks		In this paper, we address the problem of physical node capture attack from an adversarial view. In this type of attack, an adversary intelligently captures the node(s) and extracts the cryptographic information to destroy the privacy, safety and reliability of the network. We propose a novel hybrid approach for constructing the path vulnerability matrix that maximizes the attacking efficiency and lowers the resource expenditure of the adversary. The main strength of the proposed matrix lies in incorporating various criteria such as the type of application running on the nodes, capturing cost, key dominance ranking, articulation point and intersecting shortest path nodes in estimating the vulnerability. The location of the data sink is considered as a major factor in estimating the vulnerability of the nodes in the network. The proposed matrix is compared with existing attacking strategies in terms of the number of attacking rounds, energy cost and fraction of compromised traffic. Although in this paper, we have considered adversarial point of view but the proposed matrix can be extended for the defender application also. The path vulnerability matrix provides vulnerability estimation that can be used to analyze system security weakness and helps to defend against them effectively and efficiently. The performance of proposed approach has been validated with respect to average path compromise ratio, average routing path length and average route successful ratio. We have also introduced an attack resistant random key predistribution scheme based on the proposed approach and the results confirm its effectiveness in decreasing node capture impact.	adversary (cryptography);biconnected component;cryptography;routing;shortest path problem	Priyanka Ahlawat;Mayank Dave	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3779-6	telecommunications;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-52.628536226349695	77.02317347264709	125383

A MANET is more susceptible to the attacks than wired network. As a result, attacks with malicious intent have been and will be devised to take advantage of these vulnerabilities and to cripple the MANET operation. Hence we need to search for new architecture and mechanisms to protect the wireless networks and mobile computing applications. In this paper, we examine the nodes that come under the vicinity of base node and members of the network and communication is provided to genuine nodes only. It is found that the proposed algorithm is a effective algorithm for security in MANETs. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.	authorization	N. Chandrakant;P. Deepa Shenoy;K. R.

e7ef613d3a7a0cc981546f61c1d576e9c5e5efcc	segmented bloom filter based missing tag detection for large-scale rfid systems with unknown tags		Radio frequency identification (RFID) is one of the key technologies of the Internet of Things, which has been widely applied to many scenarios, such as tracking, warehouse monitoring, and vehicular social network. In such applications, some of the objects are attached with low-cost tags, which need to be monitored carefully. Hence, the object monitoring can be achieved by missing tag detection in the RFID system. However, unknown tags, whose IDs are not known by the reader in prior, may exist in the system to interfere the missing tag detection and reduce the time efficiency. In this paper, we propose a segmented bloom filter-based missing tag detection scheme called SBFMD, which consists of two phases, i.e., deactivation phase and detection phase. The idea behind the proposed SBFMD scheme is to eliminate the useless slots away from the bloom filter-based frame to improve the detection efficiency. We theoretically optimize the parameters of the proposed SBFMD scheme to maximize the efficiency with a required reliability. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed SBFMD scheme, the results of which validate its effectiveness.	bloom filter;internet of things;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;simulation;social network;tag cloud	Kai Lin;Honglong Chen;Álvaro Murillo-García;Denghui Liu;Lu Liu;Leyi Shi	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872543	bloom filter;radio-frequency identification;computer science;distributed computing;server;internet of things	Mobile	-55.23448006217521	77.88001758519628	126441
dd74a20607b065215c2e59c05b90fb00a92ec7ae	distributed certification authority for mobile ad hoc networks - a dynamic approach		A Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is an infrastructureless network of wireless mobile nodes that cooperate among each other to maintain connectivity of the network. In comparison to wired networks, securing a MANET is more difficult and challenging. One of the effective ways of providing security in MANETs is by using Public Key Cryptography and Certificates. Certificates are issued by a trusted entity known as Certification Authority (CA). In order to provide certification service in MANETs, researchers have proposed the design of a distributed CA based on threshold cryptography. With a distributed CA, nodes obtain certification service from a coalition of threshold number of nodes in the network. In the design of distributed CA that we follow, nodes identify a coalition within their one-hop neighbors. With a distributed CA, when the number of nodes in the network reduces, number of neighbors for nodes also reduces resulting in substantial increase in the certification service delays. In this paper we propose the design of a distributed CA which follows dynamic approach to solve the above problem using a suite of network monitoring protocols. The proposed design is based on the observation that when the number of nodes in the network reduces, the delays involved in obtaining certificates can be reduced by dynamically varying the threshold value.	adversary model;certificate authority;hoc (programming language);hop-by-hop transport;public key certificate;public-key cryptography;simulation	Sanjay Raghani;Durga Toshniwal	2007	JCIT		mobile ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer network;delay-tolerant networking;vehicular ad hoc network;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;dynamic circuit network;computer science;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	-49.28739875500259	76.60278428960059	126905

However, security and privacy must be addressed to make these communications acceptable with respect to protecting patient privacy. In this position paper, we propose Privacy-Enhanced Opportunistic Networking (PEON), a system for using opportunistic networking in privacy-preserving way. PEON uses concepts from anonymous communications, rerouting messages through groups of peer nodes to hide the relation between the sources and destinations. By modifying group size, we can trade off between privacy and communication overhead. Further, individual nodes can make a similar trade off by changing the number of intermediate groups. We describe the cryptographic tools needed to facilitate changes in group membership and the design of simulation experiments that we will conduct to evaluate the overhead and effectiveness of our approach.	cryptography;experiment;medical privacy;node (computer science);overhead (computing);pervasive informatics;simulation	Zhengyi Le;Gauri Vakde;Matthew K.

This gives enough time for attackers to cause significant damage. Thus, it is of great importance to provide protection from unknown attacks. However, existing solutions are mostly concentrated on known attacks. On the other hand, mobility can make the sensor network more resilient to failures, reactive to events, and able to support disparate missions with a common set of sensors, yet the problem of security becomes more complicated. In order to address the issue of security in networks with mobile nodes, we propose a machine learning solution for anomaly detection along with the feature extraction process that tries to detect temporal and spatial inconsistencies in the sequences of sensed values and the routing paths used to forward these values to the base station. We also propose a special way to treat mobile nodes, which is the main novelty of this work. The data produced in the presence of an attacker are treated as outliers, and detected using clustering techniques. These techniques are further coupled with a reputation system, in this way isolating compromised nodes in timely fashion. The proposal exhibits good performances at detecting and confining previously unseen attacks, including the cases when mobile nodes are compromised.	algorithm;anomaly detection;cluster analysis;concentrate dosage form;eighty;exhibits as topic;experiment;feature extraction;machine learning;malware;outlier;performance;policy;reactive planning;religious missions;reputation system;routing;sensor;statistical cluster	Zorana Bankovic;David Fraga;José Manuel Moya;Juan Carlos Vallejo	2012		10.3390/s120810834	computer simulation;embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;cluster analysis;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Security	-54.10657693277512	76.80216113624077	128478

Unlike traditional routing techniques, it allows network nodes to perform transformations on packets they receive before transmitting them. For this reason, packets cannot be authenticated using ordinary digital signatures, which makes it difficult to hedge against pollution attacks, where malicious nodes inject bogus packets in the network. To address this problem, recent works introduced signature schemes allowing to sign linear subspaces (namely, verification can be made w.r.t. any vector of that subspace) and which are well-suited to the network coding scenario. Currently known network coding signatures in the standard model are not homomorphic in that the signer is forced to sign all vectors of a given subspace at once. This paper describes the first homomorphic network coding signatures in the standard model: the security proof does not use random oracles and, at the same time, the scheme allows signing individual vectors on-the-fly and has constant per-packet overhead in terms of signature size. The construction is based on the dual encryption technique introduced by Waters (Crypto’09) to prove the security of hierarchical identity-based encryption schemes.	antivirus software;authentication;digital signature;homomorphic encryption;id-based encryption;linear network coding;malware;network packet;overhead (computing);provable security;routing;throughput;transmitter	Nuttapong Attrapadung;Benoît Libert	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19379-8_2	random oracle;standard model;digital signature;linear network coding;computer science;theoretical computer science;provable security;internet privacy;packet loss;computer security	Crypto	-51.11260218848382	78.36350755150697	129129

However, these requirements could be sharply contrary to each other in some scenarios. For example, in- network data aggregation can significantly reduce communication overhead and thus has been adopted widely as a means to improve network efficiency; however, the adoption of in-network data aggregation may prevent data from being encrypted since it is a prerequisite for aggregation that data be accessible during forwarding. In this paper, we address this dilemma by proposing a family of secret perturbation-based schemes that can protect sensor data confidentiality without disrupting additive data aggregation. Extensive simulations are also conducted to evaluate the proposed schemes. The results show that our schemes provide confidentiality protection for both raw and aggregated data items with an overhead lower than that of existing related schemes.	confidentiality;data aggregation;download;emoticon;encryption;ibm notes;network planning and design;overhead (computing);requirement;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Taiming Feng;Chanwei Wang;Wensheng Zhang;Lu Ruan	2008	IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.20	wireless sensor network;computer science;network security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-51.3593877672147	76.44008180199684	129165

Moreover, traditional security mechanisms cannot be directly used in WSNs as they present constrained resources in terms of communication, computation and energy. Trust management models have recently been suggested as an e ective security mechanism for WSNs. The already found solutions are very expensive in terms of energy and memory, which seriously affects the lifetime of such networks. In this paper, we will present a lightweight trust management model, which guarantees the reliability and robustness of the network, seeking to increase its lifetime compared to existing models.	computation;trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Hela Maddar;Wafa Kammoun;Omar Cheikhrouhou;Habib Youssef	2016		10.5220/0005811005480553	key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-52.07707568127466	75.07871732625259	129789
c7dcc91d1fd6893332c9c22985fce07278cae23a	an efficient and lightweight source privacy protecting scheme for sensor networks using group knowledge		Providing source privacy is a critical security service for sensor networks. However, privacy preserving in sensor networks is a challenging task, particularly due to the limited resources of sensor nodes and the threat of node capture attack. On the other hand, existing works use either random walk path or fake packets injection, both incurring tremendous overhead. In this work, we propose a new approach, which separates the sensor nodes into groups. The source packet is randomly forwarded within and between the groups with elaborate design to ensure communication anonymity; furthermore, members of each group exchange encrypted traffic of constant packet length to make it difficult for the adversary to trace back. One salient feature of the proposed scheme is its flexibility of trading transmission for higher anonymity requirement.We analyze the ability of our proposed scheme to withstand different attacks and demonstrate its efficiency in terms of overhead and functionality when compared to existing works.	adversary (cryptography);encryption;id-based cryptography;network packet;overhead (computing);privacy;randomness;security service (telecommunication);sensor node	Zhiqiang Ruan;Wei Liang;Decai Sun;Haibo Luo;Fanyong Cheng	2013	IJDSN	10.1155/2013/601462	key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-51.703807072489816	76.31748876543143	130519

They are not suitable for the Internet of Things devices that have constrained resources. In this regard, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have become an increasingly popular technology for building secure authentication in these systems. In this paper, we propose lightweight PUF-based authentication protocol. This was implemented on a wireless sensor network constructed using the resource-limited IoT devices: Zolertia Zoul re-mote. The functionality of the proposed scheme was verified using a server-client configuration. Then power consumption and memory utilisation of the proposed protocol were estimated and compared with the existing solutions, namely: DTLS (datagram transport layer security) handshake protocol and UDP (user datagram protocol). Our results indicate that the proposed PUF based authentication saves up to 45% power and uses 12% less memory compared to DTLS handshake authentication.	authentication protocol;cryptography;datagram transport layer security;internet of things;sensor node;server (computing)	P P;Steve R.

In this paper, we prese nt a scalable and distributed protocol that enables two nodes to establish a pairwise shared key on the fly, without requiring the use of a on-line key distribution center. The design of our protocol is based on a novel combination of two techniques –probabilistic key sharingandthreshold secret sharing. Our protocol is scalable since every node only needs to possess a small number of keys, independent of the network size, and it is computationally efficient because it only relies on symmetric key operations. We show that a pairwise key established between two nodes using our protocol is secure against a collusive attack by up to a certain number of compromised nodes. Our protocol can be parameterized to meet the appropriate levels of performance, security and storage for the application under consideration.	ansi escape code;algorithmic efficiency;cryptography;hoc (programming language);key distribution center;key exchange;key server (cryptographic);on the fly;online and offline;requirement;routing;scalability;secret sharing;secure communication;server (computing);symmetric-key algorithm	Sencun Zhu;Shouhuai Xu;Sanjeev Setia;Sushil Jajodia	2003		10.1109/ICNP.2003.1249782	wireless ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;pre-shared key;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Security	-48.68846739297584	76.8507500680714	133669

Costs of Tree- based muTESLA are rising rapidly with more senders in networks, which limit its use in large-scale networks. To removing such a limit, this paper presents a muTPCT-based broadcast authentication protocol which mainly rests on constructions of muTPC (muTESLA parameters hash chain) and muTPCT (muTPC Merkle tree). The proposed protocol makes an improvement of tree-based muTESLA. It constructs muTPC to distribute and authenticate the initial parameter of muTESLA. Then it constructs muTPCT to distribute and authenticate the initial parameter of muTPC. Analysis and experiments have shown our proposed protocol has the ability of resisting DoS attacks against the distribution of muTESLA parameters and revoking authenticating powers of compromised nodes on time. It also outperforms the tree-based muTESLA by reducing the cost of computation, communication, and storage needed, which makes our proposed protocol more applicable to large scale sensor networks.	authentication protocol;computation;dos;experiment;hash chain;merkle tree;message authentication code;tree (data structure)	Zhiqiang Du;Kun Wang;Lihua Zhou	2008	2008 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference	10.1109/APSCC.2008.133	wireless sensor network;computer science;information security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-49.371873434362975	76.87255210038835	134139

Due to open nature of the wireless medium an adversary can easily eavesdrop and replay or inject fabricated messages. Different cryptographic methods can be used to defend against some of such attacks. However, node compromise is another major problem of WSN security due to it allows an adversary to enter inside the security perimeter of the network, which raised a serious challenge for WSNs. This paper is focusing on investigating internal attacks of wireless sensor networks, by which we show our novel algorithm that under some fixed parameters designed by the network designer, we can have reasonable model for predicting the highest signal noise ratio (S/N). Therefore we may allow the sinker to be open only around that particular time period to receive the signals from the sources while the other time slots are in """"sleeping state"""" to ignore any signals, including the internal attacking signal. In particularly, we found the highest S/N timing can be controlled by the sending rating for the fixed network.

In these overlays, users have both the motivation and the means to alter their position in the overlay tree. We introduce a repeated-game model of user behavior that captures the practical tradeoff between a user’s short-term desire for quality and long-term desire for the network’s continued existence. We simulate overlay treeformation protocols with this model to study their robustness to selfish users. We show that this model can explain user cooperation and provide insight into how overlay systems scale in the absence of heavyweight mechanisms or identity systems. We also use the model to derive practical guidance on how to make multicast overlay protocols more robust to selfish users.

However, the dynamic environment of MANETs makes the design and implementation of IDSs a very challenging task. In this paper, we present a non-overlapping Zone-Based Intrusion Detection System (ZBIDS) that fits the requirement of MANETs. On the local detection part, we present a general intrusion detection agent model and propose a Markov Chain based anomaly detection algorithm. We focus on the protection of MANET routing protocols and present the details regarding feature selection, data collection, data preprocess, Markov Chain construction, classifier construction and parameter tuning. We demonstrate that local detection alone cannot achieve desirable performance. Therefore, we further propose a collaboration mechanism among ZBIDS agents and an aggregation algorithm used by gateway nodes. With alert information from a wider area, gateway nodes’ IDS can effectively suppress many falsified alerts and provide more diagnostic information about the occurring attacks. Security officers can have a general understanding about the attacks using the proposed MANET Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (MIDMEF). We carry out extensive simulation to evaluate the performance of ZBIDS at different mobility levels.

d3e77a91d0f2dd666519aeae0696e086ef151c99	mdma: a multi-data and multi-ack verified selective forwarding attack detection scheme in wsns		In this paper, a multi-data and multi-ACK verified selective forwarding attacks (SFAs) detection scheme is proposed for containing SFAs. In our scheme, each node (in addition to the nodes in the hotspots area) generates multiple acknowledgement (ACK) message for each received packet to confirm the normal packet transmission. In multiple ACK message, one ACK is returned along the data forwarding path, other ACKs are returned along different routing paths, and thus malicious nodes can be located accurately. At the same time, source node send multiple data routing, one is primary data routing, the others are backup data routing. Primary data is routed to sink directly, but backup data is routed to nodes far from sink, and then waits for the returned ACK of sink when primary data is routed to sink. If a node doesn’t receive the ACK, the backup data is routed to sink, thus the success rate of data transmission and lifetime can be improved. For this case, the MDMA scheme has better potential to detect abnormal packet loss and identify suspect nodes as well as resilience against attack. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that MDMA scheme has better ability for ensuring success rate of data transmission, detecting SFA and identifying malicious nodes. key words: Wireless Sensor Networks, selective forwarding attack, multidata and multi-ACK, identify malicious node	acknowledgement (data networks);backup;experiment;network packet;operand forwarding;routing;sensor;waits	Anfeng Liu;Xiao Liu;He Li;Jun Long	2016	IEICE Transactions		wireless sensor network;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-54.541030478729375	76.38582241835762	137470

Several secure ad hoc routing protocols proposed, in the literature, are based on public key cryptography which drawback is to consume much more resources and decrease consequently network performances. In this paper, we propose a secure routing scheme for the DSR protocol. The proposed scheme combines the hash chains and digital signatures to provide a high level of security while reducing the costs of hop-by-hop signature generation and verification. The proposed protocol is analyzed using the NS-2 simulator.	routing	Thouraya Bouabana-Tebibel	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-32298-3_17	wireless routing protocol;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Crypto	-54.52162600874315	75.68108763803157	137876

These applications often include the management of confidential information, making the issue of security one of the most important aspects to consider. In this aspect, a user authentication mechanism that allows only legitimate users to access the network data becomes critical for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the network information. In this paper, we describe and cryptoanalyze previous works in user authentication to illustrate their vulnerabilities and security flaws. We then propose a robust user authentication scheme that solves the identified limitations. Additionally, we describe how the proposed protocol is more suitable for a secure sensor network implementation by analysis in terms of security and performance.	authentication	Sang Guun Yoo;Keunyoung Park;Juho Kim	2012	IJDSN	10.1155/2012/382810	computer science;authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;network access control;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-51.73646789585965	74.9541914822866	138147
4f862358d33bc4e3f13f4ae7c15388eb61043800	a novel trust management scheme based on dempster–shafer evidence theory for malicious nodes detection in wireless sensor networks		With the development of Internet technology, social network has become an important application in the network life. However, due to the rapid increase in the number of users, the influx of a variety of bad information is brought up as well as the existence of malicious users. Therefore, it is emergent to design a valid management scheme for user’s authentication to ensure the normal operation of social networks. Node trust evaluation is an effective method to deal with typical network attacks in wireless sensor networks. In order to solve the problem of quantification and uncertainty of trust, a novel trust management scheme based on Dempster–Shafer evidence theory for malicious nodes detection is proposed in this paper. Firstly, by taking into account spatiotemporal correlation of the data collected by sensor nodes in adjacent area, the trust degree can be estimated. Secondly, according to the D–S theory, the trust model is established to count the number of interactive behavior of trust, distrust or uncertainty, further to evaluate the direct trust value and indirect trust value. Then, a flexible synthesis method is adopted to calculate the overall trust to identify the malicious nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has obvious advantages over the traditional methods in the identification of malicious node and data fusion accuracy, and can obtain good scalability.	algorithm;authentication;big data;cloud computing;distrust;effective method;emergence;internet;iterative method;malware;mutual information;network model;objectivity/db;scalability;simulation;social network;trust management (information system);vertex-transitive graph	Wei Zhang;Shiwei Zhu;Jian Tang;Naixue N.

If malicious entities manipulate time synchronization, failures of many functionalities in the sensor networks would occur. In this paper, we identify various attacks against time synchronization and then develop a detection and self-healing scheme to defeat those attacks. The proposed scheme has three phases: (1) abnormality detection performed by individual sensors, (2) trust- based malicious node detection performed by the base station, and (3) self-healing through changing the topology of synchronization tree. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme as well as the implementation overhead.	computer simulation;denial-of-service attack;entity;overhead (computing);sensor;tree network	Yafei Yang;Yan Sun	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.383	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;information security;distributed computing;data synchronization;synchronization;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-51.614474754304865	77.4823135616546	141038

In this paper we propose a distributed signature protocol for large-scale long-lived ad hoc networks. The proposed protocol is based on RSA and a new (t,t)-secret sharing scheme. The nodes of the network are uniformly partitioned into t classes, and the nodes belonging to the same class are provided with the same share. Any t nodes, belonging to different classes, can collectively issue a signature, without any interaction. The scheme is at least as secure as any (t,n)-threshold scheme, i.e., an adversary can neither forge a signature nor disrupt the computation, unless it has compromised at least t nodes, belonging to different classes. Moreover, an attempt to disrupt the distributed service, by providing a fake signature share, would reveal the cheating node. Further, it is possible to easily increase the level of security, by shifting from a (t,t) to a (t+k,t+k) scheme, for a reasonable choice of parameter k, involving just a fraction of the nodes, so that the scheme is adaptive to the level of threat that the ad hoc network is subject to. Finally, the distributed signature protocol is efficient: the number of messages sent and received for generating a signature, as well as to increase the level of security, is small and both computations and memory required are small as well.

The conventional security solutions to provide key management through accessing trusted authorities or centralized servers are infeasible for this new environment since mobile ad hoc networks are characterized by the absence of any infrastructure, frequent mobility, and wireless links. In this paper, we propose an on-demand, fully localized, and hop-by-hop public key management scheme for MANETs. It can be performed by generating public/private key pairs by nodes themselves, issuing certificates to neighboring nodes, holding these certificates in their certificate repositories, and providing an authentication service quickly adaptive to the dynamic topology of the network without relying on any servers. Also, our scheme can be performed successfully as long as there is a physical communication line between two nodes, and it is accustomed well to the on-demand routing of MANETs.	approximation algorithm;authentication;centralized computing;certificate authority;computation;hoc (programming language);hop-by-hop transport;key management;longest prefix match;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;public key certificate;public-key cryptography;routing;self-organization;simulation	Ruidong Li;Jie Li;Hisao Kameda;Peng Liu	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

In a hostile environment the network may be subject to adversary attacks. Given the role that the base-station plays, it can be targeted in order to inflict the most damage to the network. Although stealth design and other physical precautionary measures may be pursued to hide the base-station, the fact that the base-station acts as a sink of all data transmission enables an adversary to employ traffic analysis techniques and identify the location of the base-station. This paper presents a novel approach for countering such traffic analysis and boosting the anonymity of the base-station. Sensors in low activity areas will send out deceptive packets among each other in order to distract the attention of the adversary and make the traffic analysis inconclusive. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the approach.	adversary (cryptography);mathematical model;network packet;overhead (computing);reliability engineering;routing;sensor;simulation;single point of failure;stealth;traffic analysis;transmitter	Yousef Ebrahimi;Mohamed F.

The use of multicast paradigm in wireless LANs brings significant advantages like savings in channel bandwidth and energy. Considerable research has been done with regard to issues like reliability, but they have not taken into consideration the operation in an insecure environment. We present schemes for secure multicast in wireless LANs, based on the notion of location based access control, wherein only a user present in specific locations can access the services provided. Location based access control is a significant requirement in the pervasive computing environments. These schemes make use of the broadcast nature of the medium for sending encrypted data to a group and for key management. Those schemes which are adaptive to the dynamics of the multicast group perform better than static schemes. Three schemes are presented in this paper. The three schemes vary according to whether the base station shares the same session key with all the members of its cell (SSK) or different session key for each one of the members (SSK), or a combination of the two schemes for efficient key management (Hybrid). The comparative performance of the three schemes based on the results of simulations are presented.	access control;batch processing;encryption;hybrid kernel;key management;location-based service;optimization problem;programming paradigm;secure multicast;session key;simulation;ubiquitous computing	Sandeep K.

24da645c981dba9eb79a5eb9566e5e58f673f563	a new method for ensuring anonymity and security in network coding		We propose a method for providing anonymity and security of data transmission in networks with network coding with multiple sources and receivers. An external passive adversary is assumed to be present in the network. It is required to organize message transmission in such a manner that the adversary cannot trace a message route. The proposed method is a modification of a secure transmission scheme based on coset coding. We show that using an additional operation at relaying nodes enables to remove statistical dependence between incoming and outgoing messages of the relaying nodes. This makes tracing message routes impossible. An overlay network between a source and a receiver must be constructed due to restrictions on routes between the source and receiver: the minimum cut between two successive nodes must be not less than the number of packets in the encoded source message.	linear network coding	O.

Standard authentication mechanisms cannot prevent this attack if the adversary has compromised one or a small number of sensor nodes. In this paper, we present an interleaved hop-by-hop authentication scheme that guarantees that the base station will detect any injected false data packets when no more than a certain number t nodes are compromised. Further, our scheme provides an upper bound B for the number of hops that a false data packet could be forwarded before it is detected and dropped, given that there are up to t colluding compromised nodes. We show that in the worst case B is O(t/sup 2/). Through performance analysis, we show that our scheme is efficient with respect to the security it provides, and it also allows a tradeoff between security and performance.	adversary (cryptography);authentication;best, worst and average case;hop-by-hop transport;jing;network packet;overhead (computing);profiling (computer programming);routing;sensor	Sencun Zhu;Sanjeev Setia;Sushil Jajodia;Peng Ning	2004	IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2004.

As a result, malicious nodes can violate the protocol and disrupt the network operations. In this paper, a protocol-based anomaly detection method in ad hoc networks with AODV routing protocol is proposed. In doing so, we use a step-by-step approach for modelling the normal behaviour of AODV, and utilise a combination of support vector data description SVDD and mixture of Gaussians MoGs one-class classifiers to classify any deviation from the normal behaviour as an anomaly. These two classifiers are chosen among six utilised classifiers according to their diversity and better accuracy.

In VANETs’, the network infrastructure provides a facility to generate the messages. But all these messages need not be reliable. Therefore, in order to build reliability on the message, the vehicle in which the message was generated can be evaluated based on a reputation score that it has earned during its prior transmissions. This paper aims to design and analyse a Reputation System for VANET’s which aids the receiving vehicle to decide the reliability on the message based on the score that has been earned by the transmitting vehicle.	centralisation;file spanning;geographic coordinate system;multitier architecture;reputation system;transmitter	T.

In order to protect CH elections from attackers, unpredictability, non-manipulability, and agreement property should be guaranteed in CH elections. However, existing schemes for secure CH election cannot prevent intelligent attackers from violating the properties via cooperation. In this paper, we propose a scheme that securely elects CHs by detecting intelligent attackers and excluding them. For every CH election round, each CH candidate provides reputation values to other CH candidates according to their behavior and extracts real reputation values. Then, each node evaluates the real reputation values of members in its cluster and excludes some disreputable nodes from CH candidates. The scheme greatly enhances the non-manipulability and agreement property of CH election results compared to other rival schemes. Furthermore, the scheme presents higher non-manipulability and higher agreement property than other schemes, even in an environment where message losses can occur.

Research work has been proposed for securing the routing protocol in ad hoc networks; however, solutions that utilize asymmetric cryptographic primitives are often infeasible in a constrained mobile environment. In this paper, we discover a strict, cooperative disruption attack on the route path and identify the deficiency of present security mechanisms for protecting routing information. We then propose a path authentication scheme which relies on efficient symmetric cryptographic primitives. The random assignment path authentication (RAPA) scheme guarantees the integrity of a complete request route path in the route discovery procedure and helps the current on-demand routing protocol in resisting routing disruption attacks.	angular defect;authentication;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;denial-of-service attack;hoc (programming language);routing	Li-Joe Lin;Shiuh-Pyng Shieh;Tzu-I Yang;Warren W.

Such protocol is classified as a secure reactive routing protocol, which is based on some type of query-reply dialog. That means ARAN does not attempt to continuously maintain the up-to-date topology of the network, but rather when there is a need, it invokes a function to find a route to the destination.

In a set-up phase, the server gives pre-defined keys to every user of the system, using secure point-to-point channels. Later on, it broadcasts an encrypted message along a broadcast channel, in such a way that only users in a priviliged subset can decrypt it, by using the pre-defined keys received in set-up phase. Usually, the broadcast message contains a fresh session key, which can subsequently be used for secure broadcast transmission to the priviliged set of recipients. In this paper we deal with two aspects of secure broadcast transmission: reliability and trust in the broadcaster. The first is a well-studied issue in communication over unreliable channels: packets can get lost and some redundancy is required to provide reliable communication. The second aspect concerns with the assumption that the broadcaster, who receives information for broadcasting from several entities, must be trusted. This issue has not previously been addressed in the broadcast transmission setting. We provide a motivating scenario in which the assumption does not hold and, for both problems, we review and extend some existing broadcast encryption schemes, in order to gain fault tolerance and to remove the need for trust in the broadcaster.

87e9380ad3bc1c102a5f32609f808a185e4edde5	enhanced position verification for vanets using subjective logic		The integrity of messages in vehicular ad-hoc networks has been extensively studied by the research community, resulting in the IEEE&#126;1609.2 standard, which provides typical integrity guarantees. However, the correctness of message contents is still one of the main challenges of applying dependable and secure vehicular ad-hoc networks. One important use case is the validity of position information contained in messages: position verification mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to provide this functionality. A more general approach to validate such information is by applying misbehavior detection mechanisms. In this paper, we consider misbehavior detection by enhancing two position verification mechanisms and fusing their results in a generalized framework using subjective logic. We conduct extensive simulations using VEINS to study the impact of traffic density, as well as several types of attackers and fractions of attackers on our mechanisms. The obtained results show the proposed framework can validate position information as effectively as existing approaches in the literature, without tailoring the framework specifically for this use case.	consensus (computer science);correctness (computer science);dependability;hoc (programming language);sensor;simulation;vertex-transitive graph	Rens Wouter van der Heijden;Ala'a Al-Momani;Frank Kargl;Osama M.

Digital signature is a widely used technique to protect messages’ authenticity and nodes’ identities. From the practical perspective, to ensure the quality of services in wireless mobile networks, ideally the process of signature verification should introduce minimum delay. Batch cryptography technique is a powerful tool to reduce verification time. However, most of the existing works focus on designing batch verification algorithms for wireless mobile networks without sufficiently considering the impact of invalid signatures, which can lead to verification failures and performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a Batch Identification Game Model (BIGM) in wireless mobile networks, enabling nodes to find invalid signatures with reasonable delay no matter whether the game scenario is complete information or incomplete information. Specifically, we analyze and prove the existence of Nash Equilibriums (NEs) in both scenarios, to select the dominant algorithm for identifying invalid signatures. To optimize the identification algorithm selection, we propose a self-adaptive auto-match protocol which estimates the strategies and states of attackers based on historical information. Comprehensive simulation results in terms of NE reasonability, algorithm selection accuracy, and identification delay are provided to demonstrate that BIGM can identify invalid signatures more efficiently than existing algorithms.	algorithm selection;antivirus software;authentication;batch cryptography;digital signature;elegant degradation;nash equilibrium;simulation	Jing Chen;Kun He;Quan Yuan;Guoliang Xue;Ruiying Du;Lina Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2016.2604820	games;game theory;algorithm design;simulation;mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;wi-fi array;mobile computing;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-51.338611721876426	74.72377842320633	146933

VANET has been incrementally experimented for rescue scenario. Therefore, one of the popular ad hoc protocols, ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV), is applied to adjust VANET environment. In AODV, its critical routing fields (CRF) are security leakages allowing malicious nodes to launch routing attacks by illegally modifying field content. To prevent CRF from being modified by forwarders, we propose Mobile Two-hop Integrity Validation for Emergency vehicle routing (MoTIVE) to enhance routing security of AODV. To design a secure VANET without introducing extra traffic, MoTIVE uses two-hop integrity stamping (THIS) and validation rules, accompanying routing information exchanges without modifying protocol design. With THIS, MoTIVE verifies the integrity of forwarded AODV routing messages within each two-hop area; consequently, it guarantees the routing correctness of whole network with induction concept. The main contribution of MoTIVE is that security-reinforced information is piggybacked in normal routing messages within two-hop locally instead of being flooded to the entire network globally. Compared with the original AODV, experiment results show that MoTIVE is scalable and causes no performance degradation while supplementary security protection is applied.

An ad-hoc network consists of a collection of wireless mobile nodes that are capable of communicating with each other without the use of a network infrastructure or any centralized administration. However, routing security in MANETs appears to be a problem due to its fundamental characteristics, such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation, and constrained capability. Existing routing protocols for MANETs have better network performance but fail to identify the presence of malicious nodes. In this paper, we propose a Resiliency Oriented Secure (ROS) routing protocol which includes a detection phase to identify the presence of malicious in the network. In this routing algorithm, nodes suspect the routing packets from other nodes based on number of updates field in their neighbors table, and confirm it by sending check request packets to their previous hop neighbors. On receiving positive or negative acknowledgement from previous hop neighbors, nodes either update or discard the control packet. In this way the participating nodes eliminate the malicious routing behavior successfully. Since ROS protocol does not employ any cryptographic techniques in the process of route discovery, it improves the performance of network in terms of control overhead, route acquisition time and saves the power of participating nodes.

In such an ad hoc network, the cooperation among the third parties is essential to successful communication. However, some third parties may not want to cooperate because, for example, battery limitation. They may not be interested in forwarding packets for others but nonetheless hope that others will cooperate to assist their communication. To ensure fairness in communications, it is necessary to eliminate the influence of such selfish third parties, and to seek cooperation from as many third parties as possible. Many researchers have been studying these issues. However, their studies assume that selfish behavior involves the malicious falsification of program codes or routing information even though not all selfish behaviors involve such falsification. In addition, the solutions they propose cannot completely eliminate the influence of selfish behavior. This paper defines the selfish behavior which ordinary third party entities are likely to exhibit and proposes a solution, called proactive cooperation mechanism (PCOM), which completely solves the problem caused by selfish behavior. In PCOM, each node keeps records of the cooperation of its adjacent nodes, and forwards only those packets that are generated by the adjacent nodes with a good cooperation record. Consequently, PCOM prevents selfish entities from joining the network.	code;emergence;entity;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);malware;routing	Toshihiro Suzuki;Motonari Kobayashi;Ashiq Khan;Masanori Morita	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255652	wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.084867097489386	78.3269664051738	147789
f36270881d1ef83bd3a99563ae044a58133a465a	bitcoin pool-hopping detection		In the Bitcoin blockchain, rewarding methods for remunerating miners participating in a pool have to meet certain requirements in order to guarantee the proper functioning of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In particular, these allocation rules reward pool participants in proportion to their contribution in the transaction validation process. Deployed rewarding methods met fairness concerns at the expense of vulnerability to miners exploiting pools' attractiveness for deciding when to mine for a pool and when to ‘hop’ to another one resulting more attractive: a phenomenon called pool-hopping. The most used score-based methods are designed to prevent this practice, but are not completely hopping proof. In this work, we propose a methodology to analyze the pool-hopping phenomenon, focusing on the detection of pool-hoppers. Analyzing those Bitcoin transactions that pools create for rewarding its participants, it is possible to determine time epochs where miners worked. Thus, we analyze those miners that have worked intermittently for pools adopting a rewarding system which pays out for each validated block. This evaluation leads us qualifying the miners that have hopped along with their hopping behavior and financial performance.	addresses (publication format);behavior;bitcoin;cryptocurrency;de-anonymization;ecosystem;entity name part qualifier - adopted;epoch (reference date);fairness measure;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;gene pool;requirement;rewards;rule (guideline)	Marianna Belotti;Sofiane Kirati;Stefano Secci	2018	2018 IEEE 4th International Forum on Research and Technology for Society and Industry (RTSI)	10.1109/RTSI.2018.8548376		Metrics	-53.24023750800258	81.80559063779332	147894

Considering the environment of mobile ad hoc networks, in this study we propose a new trust model. This new model is divided into two parts: trust assessment and trust prediction. The process of node trust assessment is based on node's historical behaviors, in which the trust decision factors include the subjective reputation and indirect reputation. Then utilizing the obtained trust data sequence, we propose an improved dynamic grey-Markov chain prediction measure to predict node's trust for future decision making. In which we eliminates grey bias via using unbiased GM(1,1) model. Moreover, in order to improve anti-jamming performance, we introduce the fuzzy classification method to classify the fuzzy states into some reasonable groups. Experimental results have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. It is proved in theory and practice that the prediction results not only are more reliable but also can help the decision maker with grasping the change tendency of trust and making proper decisions.	electronic counter-countermeasure;fuzzy classification;hoc (programming language);markov chain;radio jamming;software deployment;trust metric	Hui Xia;Guodong Wang;Zhen-Kuan Pan	2016	2016 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA	10.1109/TrustCom.2016.0045	computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;computer security	AI	-54.55827209350652	78.11594362440913	149213

For these environments, security infrastructures based on traditional PKIs present a number of major drawbacks: limited scalability and reconfigurability, static vision of trust, and high administrative costs. Besides, these infrastructures are not well adapted to authorisation, and lack delegation capabilities.

134818a78559db0858999cab0b6c7e812cc14316	towards trust-based acquisition of unverifiable information	trust;information acquisition;peer to peer network;distributed computing	We present a trust-based mechanism for the acquisition of information from possibly unreliable sources. Our mechanism addresses the case where the acquired information cannot be verified. The idea is to intersperse questions (“challenges”) for which the correct answers are known. By evaluating the answers to these challenges, probabilistic conclusions about the correctness of the unverifiable information can be drawn. Less challenges need to be used if an information provider has shown to be trustworthy. This work focuses on three major issues of such a mechanism. First, how to estimate the correctness of the unverifiable information. Second, how to determine an optimal number of challenges. And finally, how to establish trust and use it to reduce the number of challenges. Our approach can resist collusion and shows great promise for various application areas such as distributed computing or peer-to-peer networks.	bootstrapping (compilers);correctness (computer science);distributed computing;peer-to-peer	Eugen Staab;Volker Fusenig;Thomas Engel	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-85834-8_6	computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;distributed computing;trustworthy computing;world wide web	AI	-52.59802805201993	79.86437718010127	150026

Because of these characteristics, securing MANETs constitute a hard and challenging task. Consequently, new mechanisms may be of interest to secure such networks. To this end, we have found that trust management can be a support for MANET security. In fact, the reputation concept and the establishment of trustful relation between collaborating nodes can be meaningful to express security aspects in such environment. From there, we proposed in previous works a Mobility-based Clustering Algorithm (MCA) and a Trust management scheme for MCA (TMCA) to secure routing behaviors. MCA organizes nodes into clusters managed by a cluster-head (CH) and TMCA detects malicious routing behavior based on CHs direct observations and exchanged alerts. A delegation based process was also defined on TMCA and was called DTMCA. Although DTMCA meets security objectives, it may unfortunately be faced with various threats from malicious nodes: Several nodes can in fact collude in order to increase or decrease other reputation values to damage the QoS and even the MANET functioning. Our objective in this paper is then to secure DTMCA against collusion attacks. The mechanism proposed here is based on colluding nodes detection through cluster members behavior monitoring and by comparing this behavior with the received reputation value in the alert message. Detected colluder nodes are then discarded from further communication.	algorithm;centralized computing;cluster analysis;cylinder-head-sector;hoc (programming language);malware;organizing (structure);routing;trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Aida Ben Chehida Douss;Ryma Abassi;Sihem Guemara El Fatmi	2014	2014 Ninth International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	10.1109/ARES.2014.50	optimized link state routing protocol;business;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.52149640525283	77.8943856719074	150088

We present secure sink node architecture as two-tiered scheme for sensor network security. The architecture protects the sink node from unauthorized access by surrounding it with two protection layers. Sink nodes listen to only inner layer nodes and inner nodes are allowed to communicate with only outer layer nodes. These protection layers are formed in an intelligent manner without violating constraints specific to sensor network. In order to enhance security, protection layers are re-adjusted in case of an attack. We present statistical analysis to elucidate the performance of proposed architecture.	authorization;network security	Shahabuddin Muhammad;Zeeshan Furqan;Ratan K.

It includes two aspects: key distribution and key revocation. Many key management protocols have been specifically designed for wireless sensor networks. However, most of the key management protocols focus on the establishment of the required keys or the removal of the compromised keys. The design of these key management protocols does not consider the support of higher level security applications. When the applications are integrated later in sensor networks, new mechanisms must be designed. In this paper, we propose a security framework, uKeying, for wireless sensor networks. This framework can be easily extended to support many security applications. It includes three components: a security mechanism to provide secrecy for communications in sensor networks, an efficient session key distribution scheme, and a centralized key revocation scheme. The proposed framework does not depend on a specific key distribution scheme and can be used to support many security applications, such as secure group communications. Our analysis shows that the framework is secure, efficient, and extensible. The simulation and results also reveal for the first time that a centralized key revocation scheme can also attain a high efficiency.	authentication;broadcast encryption;centralized computing;key distribution;key management;session key;simulation	Yong Wang;Byrav Ramamurthy;Yuyan Xue;Xukai Zou	2008	2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems	10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769130	wireless transport layer security;wireless sensor network;security information and event management;security association;computer science;key management;security service;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;network access control;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.933510357145146	76.60677244031807	150832

Second, this fact results in a significant improvement in the detection performance of the system, especially in terms of low false positive rate. The different experimental results obtained show the promising nature of our approach, both in terms of the detection capabilities exhibited and from the point of view of the simplicity of the scheme.	algorithm;data mining;heuristic;hoc (programming language);intrusion detection system;network packet;overhead (computing);point of view (computer hardware company);sensor;simulation;theory	Leovigildo Sánchez-Casado;Gabriel Maciá-Fernández;Pedro García-Teodoro	2012	2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2012.75	vehicular ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Vision	-54.59762924397096	75.29147063465928	151677

Protecting these devices from harsh transients imposed by counterfeit wireless chargers [4] and ensuring equitable power delivery under heavily skewed coupling [5] remain challenging issues. This paper presents the design of a wireless power receiver that mitigates these disparate issues by leveraging a new detuning technique that does not rely on any switched passives. Public key authentication of genuine chargers is implemented using low-resource Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) [6,7]. Additionally, overcoming the skew in received power imposed by a 4∶1 distance ratio between receivers is demonstrated using a co-operative scheme.	battery charger;elliptic curve cryptography;key authentication;public-key cryptography	Nachiket V.

Each node acts as a router and is responsible for dynamically discovering other nodes it can directly communicate with. However, when a message without encryption is sent out through a general tunnel, it may be maliciously attacked. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical key management scheme (HKMS) for secure group communications in MANETs. For the sake of security, we encrypt a packet twice. Due to the frequent changes of the topology of a MANET, we also discuss group maintenance in this paper.

The basic idea relies on the availability of a low-cost public cryptsystem (e.g. Blom’s key management scheme [4]) that can be used for shared key computation between the source and the destination, as long as the public shares are known to each other. In SeGrid, each sensor resides in a grid computed from its physical location. Within a grid, one or a few number of sensors, with one of them the grid head, are active at any instant of time and all other sensors fall asleep for energy conservation. We intend to compute a shared key for two grids instead of two nodes, such that the grid heads can securely communicate with each other. The public shares of a grid are stored at designated locations based on our public share management protocol such that the closer two grids, the shorter distance to obtain each other’s public shares. We instantiate SeGrid based on Blom’s key management scheme [4] to illustrate the computation of a grid key. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that simultaneously considers both key management and network lifetime extension, which explores along the dimension of network density.	computation;cryptosystem;email;id-based encryption;key management;public-key cryptography;secure communication;sensor;sleep mode;symmetric-key algorithm	Fengguang An;Xiuzhen Cheng;Qing Xia;Fang Liu;Liran Ma	2005		10.1007/11599463_42	network management;secure communication;grid file;wireless sensor network;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;key management;distributed computing;computer security;sensor array;grid computing;computer network	Mobile	-50.03348649391926	77.24479695927977	153475
b42fdb27a3e8a366995ac1e3c30c43b9d6995907	group therapy for systems: using link attestations to manage failures.	group therapy	Managing failures and configuring systems properly are of critical importance for robust distributed services. Unfortunately, protocols offering strong fault-tolerance guarantees are generally too costly and insensitive to performance criteria. Yet, system management in practice is often ad-hoc and ill-defined, leading to under-utilized capacity or adverse effects from poorly-behaving machines. This paper proposes a new abstraction called linkattestation groups (LA-Groups) for building robust distributed systems. Developers specify application-level correctness conditions or performance requirements for nodes. Nodes vouch for each other’s acceptability within small groups of nodes through digitally-signed link attestations, and then apply a link-state protocol to determine these group relationships. By exposing such an attestation graph, LA-Groups enable the application (1) to make more informed decisions about its level of fault tolerance, security, or performance, and (2) to improve such properties by fluidly partitioning large-scale systems into small, better-suited groups. To demonstrate how LA-Groups can benefit systems, we outline designs for several applications—structured overlay routing, multicast, file sharing, and worm containment— that are robust against various failures.	correctness (computer science);digital signature;distributed computing;download;failure;fault tolerance;file sharing;graph property;hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;multicast;organizing (structure);reliability engineering;requirement;self-replication;systems management	Michael J.

Keys for encryption purposes must he agreed upon by communicating nodes. Due to resource constraints, achieving such key agreement in wireless sensor networks is nontrivial. Many key agreement schemes used in general networks, such as Diffie-Hellman and public-key based schemes, are not suitable for wireless sensor networks. Pre-distribution of secret keys for all pairs of nodes is not viable due to the large amount of memory used when the network size is large. Recently, a random key pre-distribution scheme and its improvements have been proposed. A common assumption made by these random key pre-distribution schemes is that no deployment knowledge is available. Noticing that in many practical scenarios, certain deployment knowledge may be available a priori, we propose a novel random key pre-distribution scheme that exploits deployment knowledge and avoids unnecessary key assignments. We show that the performance (including connectivity, memory usage, and network resilience against node capture) of sensor networks can he substantially improved with the use of our proposed scheme. The scheme and its detailed performance evaluation are presented in this paper.	diffie–hellman key exchange;encryption;key management;key-agreement protocol;performance evaluation;public-key cryptography;software deployment	Wenliang Du;Jing Deng;Yunghsiang Sam Han;Shigang Chen;Pramod K.

Rather than continuing to add mechanisms to an already complex protocol, or redesigning interdomain routing from scratch, we propose making BGP simpler. We argue that the AS-PATH, which lists the sequence of ASes that propagated the route, is the root of many of BGP's problems. We propose a transition from today's path-based routing to a solution where ASes select and export routes based only on neighboring ASes. We discuss the merits and limitations of next-hop routing. We argue that next-hop routing is sufficiently expressive to realize network operator's goals while side-stepping major problems with today's BGP. Specifically, we show that next-hop routing simplifies router implementation and configuration, reduces BGP's attack surface, makes it easier to support multipath routing, and provably achieves faster convergence and incentive compatibility. Our simulations show that next-hop routing significantly reduces the number of update messages and routing changes, and is especially effective at preventing the most serious convergence problems.	attack surface;border gateway protocol;inter-domain;list of code lyoko episodes;multipath routing;router (computing);simulation;software bug;stepping level;vergence	Michael Schapira;Yaping Zhu;Jennifer Rexford	2010		10.1145/1868447.1868450	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;supernetwork;border gateway protocol;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;incentive compatibility;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;default-free zone;path vector protocol;computer security;routing information protocol;computer network	Networks	-55.935711273704676	75.1999762055634	156541

The emerging network infrastructure and secure broadcast techniques enable prompt and secure delivery of emergency notification messages. With the ubiquitous deployment of alert systems, scalability and heterogeneity pose new challenges for the design of secure broadcast schemes. In this paper, we discuss the key generation problem with the goal of minimizing the total number of keys which need to be generated by the alert center and distributed to the users. Two encryption schemes, zero message scheme and extended header scheme, are modeled formally. For both schemes we show the equivalence of the general optimal key generation (OKG) problem and the bipartite clique cover (BCC) problem, and show that OKG problem is NP-hard. The result is then generalized to the case with resource constraints, and we provide a heuristic algorithm for solving the restricted BCC (and OKG) problem.	algorithm;bipartite dimension;bricx command center;broadcast encryption;clique cover;heuristic (computer science);key (cryptography);key generation;key management;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;scalability;software deployment;turing completeness	Guoqiang Shu;David Lee;Mihalis Yannakakis	2006	Proceedings 20th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639680	natural disaster;computer science;cryptography;key management;distributed computing;internet privacy;terrorism;computer security;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Embedded	-48.80366627219399	78.28482344859567	158148

In these security issues, key management is one of the most challenging and in dire need of solving problems. A lot of research has been mainly concentrated on key management for homogeneous wireless sensor networks. However, such homogeneous networks could restrict them to have a long network lifetime as well as to improve network connectivity. Recent research has shown that heterogeneous wireless sensor networks have greater performance and reliability. In this paper, we propose a key management scheme for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks to improve the random key predistribution scheme using deployment knowledge of nodes and the prior area deployment information. The performance evaluation and security analysis show that our scheme can substantially improve the network connectivity with low complexity and significant reduction on storage requirement, and enhance the network resilience against node capture, compared with existing key management schemes.	key management	Chunguang Ma;Zhiguo Shang;Huiqiang Wang;Guining Geng	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77024-4_77	wireless wan;wireless sensor network;heterogeneous network;computer science;information security;wireless network;key management;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;security analysis;mobile wireless sensor network;network access control;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-50.58734303625953	76.06473332547637	158323
095ba1d7f95084b4566dd1b372776f3865fc8d92	malicious node identification routing and protection mechanism for vehicular ad-hoc network against various attacks		Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is a promising approach that provides safety measures and other application to the drivers on the vehicles. The focus of VANETs is to fulfil useru0027s requirements on road side area which increases the safe and comfortable journey for users. It provides good communication like mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) when there is no intruders exist in the network. In VANET, communication depends on road safety such as emergency situation, vehicles tracking, messages monitoring and tracking of vehicles. But many attackers like black hole attack, wormhole attack and Sybil attack are more vulnerable to VANET. In order to provide efficient communication, we provide a malicious node identification routing mechanism which gives the valid route between two vehicles. To avoid several attacks, we introduce a protection mechanism that includes key management for preventing our network. Our proposed system provides efficient communication on VANET that focus on throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, detection rate and misdetection rate.	hoc (programming language);protection mechanism;routing	Yanyan Zhao;Azizol Abdullah;Mohd Taufik Abdullah;Zuriati Zukarnain	2018	IJNVO	10.1504/IJNVO.2018.10016246	knowledge management;mobile ad hoc network;vehicular ad hoc network;computer science;protection mechanism;key management;throughput;packet drop attack;sybil attack;computer network;network packet	ECom	-54.38252541879716	75.18355227478061	158564

To guarantee secure communication in wireless sensor networks, secret keys should be securely established between sensor nodes. Recently, the random key management approaches have been proposed for pair-wise key establishment in sensor networks. However, all of them have the following problem : if sensor nodes are captured by an attacker, some pair-wise keys of non-captured nodes can be compromised. In this paper, we propose a key distribution scheme which improves the resilience against node capture and reduces communication cost.	eurographics;key (cryptography);key distribution;key exchange;key management;overhead (computing);secure communication;sensor	Yong Ho Kim;Hwaseong Lee;Dong Hoon Lee	2007	2007 Third International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communications Networks and the Workshops - SecureComm 2007	10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550324	wireless sensor network;computer science;information security;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;mobile wireless sensor network;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-50.095527130337004	76.79224450975187	158586

Abstract Ubiquitous computing is poised to revolutionize the way we compute and interact with each other. However, unless privacy concerns are taken into account early in the design process, we will end up creating a very effective distributed surveillance system, which would be a dream come true for electronic stalkers and “ big brothers.” We present a protocol, which preserves the privacy of users and keeps their communication anonymous. In effect, we create a “ mist” that conceals users from the system and other users. Yet, users will still be able to enjoy seamless interaction with services and other entities that wander within the ubiquitous computing environment.	computer science;confidentiality;end-to-end principle;entity;gaia hypothesis;ibm notes;operating system;prasad v. tetali;privacy;routing;scart;seamless3d;secure communication;session key;systems design;ubiquitous computing	Jalal Al-Muhtadi;Roy H.

A trust management system in VANETs typically falls into one of two categories: centralized or distributed. Our solution is a hybrid system which merges the two canonical designs of a centralized and distributed structure that utilizes to capabilities of both systems. In this paper we provide the design of a trust system that takes into account both central and local evaluations to establish trust. In order to validate the trust system we design a simulation model in MATLAB that captures the interaction between different vehicles and between the vehicles and the Central Authority. The simulations show a high decision performance for the trust management system and validate the proposed scheme as a coherent grading system.	autonomous robot;centralized computing;coherence (physics);hybrid system;matlab;simulation;trust management (information system)	Raquel G.

With this, users can communicate in a indirect way. Thus, identity information such as IP addresses can be effectively hidden against eavesdropper. In anonymous communication systems, such as Mixes, Onion Routing, and Crowds, this mechanism is adopted to provide anonymity. This mechanism, however, can result in extra overhead in performance such as communication delay and participant payload, which may affect the applications of anonymous communication systems. In this paper, we study quantitatively the participant payload induced by host-based rerouting mechanisms. A probability formula for calculating the participant payload is derived, which shows that the participant payload is determined by the number of participants, the number of rerouting paths, and the probability distribution of the length of rerouting paths. Applying this formula to the practical anonymous communication system, Crowds, we get immediately the precise expected participant payload, which significantly improves Reiter and Rubin’s original analysis and demonstrates that the participant payload in Crowds remains a constant and independent of the variation of the number of participants in Crowds. Simulation results are presented to testify our theoretical analysis.	overhead (computing);routing;simulation	Hongfei Sui;Jianer Chen;Songqiao Chen;Jianxing Wang	2003		10.1109/ISCC.2003.1214287	payload;telecommunications;computer science;probability;crowd simulation;computer security;statistics;computer network	Security	-53.74484808811736	78.75423249573026	159856

Although security is a necessity in other types of networks, it is much more so in sensor networks due to the resource-constraint, susceptibility to physical capture, and wireless nature. In this work we emphasize two security issues: (1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling. Finally, some of these security properties will be evaluated in concrete case studies.	algorithm;goto;quality of service;scheduling (computing);secure communication;sleep mode	Christophe Guyeux;Abdallah Makhoul;Jacques M.

1f6d7cb92c17848c82c958e069586df23e700387	an enhanced data privacy mechanism suitable for ubiquitous sensor networks		Sensor network maintains high limitation of resource because it performs many communications in order to create encryption keys. To solve this problem, this research suggests LA 2 EP. LA 2 EP Protocol can minimize resource and provides a new scheme for authentication and en- cryption that can provide anonymity of node for safe communication. To analyze the performance of the suggested scheme, a degree of anonymity that is provided by the scheme suggested by using an Entropy-based modeling was measured. As a result, when the suggested scheme was used, the degree of anonymity of sensor node was high. It showed that an important element to increase the degree of anonymity was to let the sensor's ID not known correctly. Also, as a result of calculating spaces for operation, communication, and storage while considering the character- istic of sensor network, which is limited in resource, it showed suitability for sensor network environment.	information privacy	Jeong-Hyo Park;Yong-Hoon Jung;Kwang-Hyung Lee;Keun-Wang Lee;Moon-Seog Jun	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27180-9_17	computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;computer security	Mobile	-51.301097667552156	76.34754642305583	160739

The lack of interoperation between these components can not provide enough security for WSNs. To address this, we propose a new framework to integrate access control and intrusion detection (ID) to improve the security of WSNs. Moreover, we perform access control based on usage control (UCON), so that our scheme can provide mutable attributes and continuous access decision. We also develop an adaptive decision tree construction mechanism for intrusion detection. Besides normal attacks, our scheme can defense against sophisticated ongoing attacks and unknown attacks in WSNs. An instance of policy is simulated to evaluate the overhead coursed by our scheme. The implementation results support the feasibility of using our scheme in WSNs. Also, the security evaluation is done. The results show that the proposed scheme can provide higher security than traditional security schemes.	access control;decision tree;immutable object;interoperation;intrusion detection system;overhead (computing)	Jun Wu;Shigeru Shimamoto	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683984	intrusion detection system;wireless sensor network;computer science;decision tree;distributed computing;computer security;intrusion prevention system;computer network	Security	-51.22324101319665	76.51579104525105	160962

In untrusted environments, sensors may potentially be compromised. Existing approaches for securely answering aggregation queries in untrusted sensor networks can detect whether the aggregation result is corrupted by an attacker. However, the attacker (controlling the compromised sensors) can keep corrupting the result, rendering the system unavailable. This paper aims to enable aggregation queries to tolerate instead of just detecting the adversary. To this end, we propose a novel tree sampling algorithm that directly uses sampling to answer aggregation queries. It leverages a set sampling protocol to overcome a well-known obstacle in sampling—traditional sampling technique is only effective when the predicate count or sum is large. Set sampling can efficiently sample a set of sensors together, and determine whether any sensor in the set satisfies the predicate (but not how many). With set sampling as a building block, tree sampling can provably generate a correct answer despite adversarial interference, while without the drawbacks of traditional sampling techniques.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;interference (communication);rendering (computer graphics);sampling (signal processing);sensor	Haifeng Yu	2011	Distributed Computing	10.1007/s00446-011-0130-z	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science;information security;theoretical computer science;data mining;distributed computing	DB	-52.370606687828584	79.65338120844666	161071

Sensor nodes are divided into clusters managed by cluster heads which collect and aggregate data and send to base stations. The use of both symmetric and public key techniques makes the network highly resilient to node compromise. The nodes are resource constrained and thus communicate securely using symmetric triple key distribution technique. The cluster heads are powerful and use asymmetric key distribution techniques. The anonymity of cluster heads while forwarding messages is also preserved in our protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first key management scheme which uses both symmetric and asymmetric triple key distribution mechanism. The analysis shows that our scheme is highly secure, preserves privacy of cluster heads and can support efficient addition and deletion of nodes.	aggregate data;computation;key distribution;key management;network security;public-key cryptography;sensor node;symmetric-key algorithm	Sushmita Ruj;Kouchui Sakurai	2013	2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831104	wireless ad hoc network;computer science;base station;key management;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;pre-shared key;key distribution;computer security;polynomial;computer network	Security	-50.00530998541093	77.17207932236711	161489
019998fb742e6d0f45fe680cc9edcd4fb03c73d8	going beyond pollution attacks: forcing byzantine clients to code correctly	internet architecture;network coding;random coefficients	Network coding has been shown to achieve optimal throughput in multicast networks. However, it relies on network nodes or routers to code correctly; a Byzantine node can introduce junk packets into the network, thus polluting downstream packets, causing the sinks to receive incorrect data, and/or significantly reducing the throughput of the network. Most previous work has focused on checking if a Byzantine node transmitted polluted packets. However, even if a Byzantine node does not introduce a junk packet, he can still significantly affect the throughput of the network: he may simply forward a packet from the ones received (without coding), not use random coding coefficients, or choose coefficients such that their packets bring the least additional information at the receivers. No previous work attempted to verify if a certain node did code correctly using random coefficients over all of the packets it was supposed to code over. We provide a novel protocol for detecting whether a node coded correctly over all the packets received according to a random linear network coding algorithm. Our protocol enables any node in the network to examine a packet received from another node by running a “verification test”. The worst an adversary can do and still pass the packet verification test is equivalent to random linear network coding, which has been shown to be optimal in multicast networks. Our protocol resists collusion among nodes and is applicable to a variety of settings. Our topology simulations show that the throughput in the best adversarial strategy for our protocol is 2 to 3 times larger than the throughput in various adversarial strategies allowed by previous work. We implemented and ran our protocol in C/C++ and Java as well as on an Android platform (Nexus One) to be used for smartphone P2P file sharing. Our C/C++ evaluation shows that the protocol is fast: the running time at a node to prepare the data for transmission is < 0.3 ms and the time to verify a packet is 2.8 ms with PIP and 0.4 ms with Log-PIP.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;byzantine fault tolerance;c++;coefficient;downstream (software development);file sharing;java;linear network coding;multicast;network packet;router (computing);sensor;simulation;smartphone;throughput;time complexity	Raluca A.

Various MANETs secure routing protocols have been proposed by researchers which could be utilized in the development of secure routing protocols for the Internet of things, thus the study of these secure MANET routing protocols will give a direction for the development and incorporation of secure routing in the Internet of Things. This paper surveys secure routing protocols in MANETs while proposing some secure MANET routing features for enshrining confidentiality and integrity in IoT routing.

Since the patient-related data is significance for medical diagnosis and patients' health-care, the security of distributed data storage is critical need for applications. However, the distributed architecture makes it challenging to build a secure and efficient data storage system due to the resource-constrained nature of sensor node. Besides, due to the lack of physical protection, WBANs are vulnerable to attacks when deployed in hostile environments. In order to address the challenges, we propose a novel secure and efficient data storage scheme with dynamic integrity checking in this paper. Based on the policies of multiple secret sharing, we first propose a secure and efficient patient-related data storage and access scheme for WBANs. Furthermore, to dynamically check the integrity of the distributed data shares, we then propose an efficient data integrity verification scheme based on orthonormal vectors. Finally, the security and performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure and practical for WBANs.	algorithm;bitonic sorter;computation;computer data storage;data integrity;distributed computing;low-density parity-check code;naive bayes classifier;reduction (complexity);scheduling (computing);secret sharing;sensor node;sorting;ubiquitous computing	Rong Fan;Ling-di Ping;Jian-Qing Fu;Xue-zeng Pan	2010	2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633690	computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-50.378517107771856	76.0230811297605	162261

The nature of wireless communications, however, makes attacks against ND easy: An adversary can simply replay or relay (wormhole) packets across the network and mislead disconnected nodes into believing that they communicate directly. Such attacks can compromise the overlying protocols and applications. Proposed methods in the literature seek to secure ND, allowing nodes to verify they are neighbors. However, they either rely on specialized hardware or infrastructure, or offer limited security. In this paper, we address these problems, designing a practical and secure neighbor verification protocol for constrained Wireless Sensor networks (WSNs). Our scheme relies on estimated distance between nodes and simple geometric tests, and it is fully distributed. We prove our protocol is secure against the classic 2-end wormhole attack. Moreover, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation with off-the-shelf WSN equipment: Cricket motes.	adversary (cryptography);norsk data;relay	Reza Shokri;Marcin Poturalski;Gael Ravot;Panagiotis Papadimitratos;Jean-Pierre Hubaux	2009		10.1145/1514274.1514302	embedded system;neighbor discovery protocol;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Security	-52.16997315387353	75.91188445032842	162312
c9b0e8b772dfcc238a92066e21b1904cb78c9ce8	a hybrid key predistribution scheme for sensor networks employing spatial retreats to cope with jamming attacks	sensor networks;key management	In order to provide security services in wireless sensor networks, a well-known task is to provide cryptographic keys to sensor nodes prior to deployment. It is difficult to assign secret keys for all pairs of sensor node when the number of nodes is large due to the large numbers of keys required and limited memory resources of sensor nodes. One possible solution is to randomly assign a few keys to sensor nodes and have nodes be able to connect to each other with some probability. This scheme has limitations in terms of the tradeoffs between connectivity and memory requirements. Recently, sensor deployment knowledge has been used to improve the level of connectivity while using lesser amounts of memory space. Jamming attacks are an easy and efficient means for disruption of the connectivity of sensors and thus the operation of a sensor network. One solution for mobile sensor nodes to overcome the impact of jamming is to perform spatial retreat by moving nodes away from jammed regions. However, deployment based key predistribution schemes may cause a large number of nodes to be cryptographically isolated after they move out of the jammed area. Moved nodes may not be able to reconnect to the network because they do not have any shared secret with new neighbors at new locations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid key predistribution scheme that supports spatial retreat strategies to cope with jamming attacks. Our scheme combines the properties of random and deployment knowledge based key predistribution schemes. In the presence of jamming attacks, our scheme provides high key connectivity (similar to deployment knowledge based schemes) while reducing the number of isolated nodes. We evaluate the performance of our scheme through simulations and analysis.	dspace;denial-of-service attack;key (cryptography);key distribution;mike lesser;radio jamming;randomness;requirement;sensor node;shared secret;simulation;software deployment	Korporn Panyim;Prashant Krishnamurthy	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-03354-4_52	knowledge base;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-50.966475654811596	77.0268171622685	162475

Motivated by the conference key establishment scheme proposed by Harn and Gong in [11], we propose LPKM (Lightweight Polynomial-based Key Management Protocol), a key management scheme for distributed WSNs. LPKM enables sensor nodes to establish different types of keys to bootstrap trust and secure one-to-one and one-to-many communications in a flexible, reliable, and non-interactive way. Moreover, LPKM can effectively mitigate or thwart the most common attacks to WSNs such as node clone attacks, node impersonation attacks, etc. In addition, LPKM can tolerate changes of network topology and incurs little computational and communication overhead. Our experimental results on MICAz motes show that LPKM can be efficiently implemented on low-cost sensor nodes. In particular, a MICAz mote running at a frequency of 8MHz can generate required group keys of 128-bit in a few milliseconds, at a cost of 6.12 KBytes ROM and 68 Bytes RAM.	polynomial	Xinxin Fan;Guang Gong	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-36958-2_13	wireless routing protocol;wireless transport layer security;wireless lan controller;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	-50.29962662815362	76.05905819607777	163540

Symmetric algorithms cannot provide the same degree of security as public-key algorithms, the fact of which has led us to devise a new algorithm, SHESP, which uses public keys within the limitations of sensor nodes. This paper aims to present a way to utilize existing public-key algorithms in the field of wireless sensor network security by dividing the network into clusters. Our algorithm supplies data confidentiality, node authentication and data integrity while remaining within acceptable memory, time and energy constraints. Also, an important feature we opted to establish, which was lacking in most security protocols, was enabling secure node-to-node communication, without the need to route through a distant base station. We provide theoretical as well as experimental evidence to validate our algorithm.	algorithm;authentication;computer data storage;confidentiality;cryptographic protocol;data integrity;network security;public-key cryptography;scalability	Mohamed K.

09fca0f7c169cba98ea7863df7ecfccdafa599c9	regional crl distribution based on the lbs for vehicular networks		To protect the members of the vehicular networks from malicious users and malfunctioning equipments, certificate revocation list (CRL) should be distributed as quickly and efficiently as possible without over-burdening the network. The common theme among existing methods in the literature to reduce distribution time is to reduce the size of the CRL, since smaller files can be distributed more quickly. Our proposal has been concerned with the problem of how to reduce the size of CRL effectively. We propose a regional CRL distribution method that introduces partitioned CRLs corresponding to certificate authority (CA) administrative regions. A regional CRL includes only neighbouring vehicle’s revoked certificates and distributed to vehicles within one CA region. Consequently, since there is no need to process full CRLs by all vehicles, the method can reduce computational overhead, long authentication delay, message signature and verification delay, and processing complexity imposed by full CRL distribution methods.	location-based service	HyunGon Kim;Minsoo Kim;SeokWon Jung;JaeHyun Seo	2013		10.1007/978-94-007-6738-6_128	overhead (computing);vehicular ad hoc network;public key infrastructure;computer science;revocation list;computer network;certificate authority;authentication	ECom	-48.679398996299675	75.10830266144848	163923

To tackle this challenging issue, we present a novel privacy-preserving scheme. Before smart meter SM joins in a network, we require Diffie-Hellman key exchange and registration to authenticate SMs. A function of the group key, time and the number of SMs is introduced to generate pseudo IDs for SMs. Then each SM sends data with its pseudo ID rather than its original ID. A simple message authentication is designed to defend against false data attack. We evaluate the privacy-preserving level by introducing an information theoretic metric - degree of anonymity. Simulations are carried out and results show that our scheme is lightweight comparing to related works.

Typically, they have dynamic topologies and cannot rely on a continuous connection to the Internet. Users' devices often do not have a priori knowledge of each other and cannot rely upon pre-existing shared information. This introduces difficult security issues when attempting to provide authentication, membership management and access control. Designing a framework, which allows the secure establishment and management of ad-hoc communities, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel policy-based security framework to facilitate the establishment, evolution and management of mobile ad-hoc networks. We introduce a community specification, called doctrine, which defines the roles of the participants in the community, the characteristics that participants must exhibit in order to be eligible to play a role, as well as the policies governing their behaviour within the community. Based on the doctrine, we propose a set of security protocols to bootstrap the community, manage the membership, and govern the access to the services provided by the participants. We have investigated the impact of mobility on the proposed security protocols and observed that the protocol is robust to changes in the network topology.	access control;authentication;autonomous robot;computation;cryptographic protocol;display resolution;doctrine;hoc (programming language);interaction;internet;mobile device;network topology;peer-to-peer;randomness;redundancy (engineering);serial experiments lain;simulation	Sye Loong Keoh;Emil C.

Although the underlying RC4 cipher is secure, the potential reuse of the same key stream by different frames is a weakness in the WEP. One enhancement to WEP is the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), which acts as a wrapper to the WEP protocol and uses a 128 bit RC4 encryption to eliminate the possibility of key reuse within a given session. However, TKIP cannot be gainfully employed in devices where the 64 bit RC4 encryption is hardwired. Also, with128 bit encryption TKIP can secure 10 frames per session. Comparing this to the typical number of frames per session (500-1000), it is easy to see that the use of a 128 bit key causes unnecessary drain of power. The Wifi Protected Access (WPA), uses a 128 bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher in the Counter-Mode-CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP). This protocol requires higher computational power than the TKIP and is only intended for devices which possess higher computational power and memory. In this paper, we propose a light weight enhancement to the 64 bit WEP, which provides significant improvement in security (measured as the number of frames securely transmitted before base key change) with small energy and memory overhead. Moreover, our technique can be tailored to the specific needs of resource constrained environments to provide just the necessary level of security. We use the Intrinsyc CerfCube [2] as a resource constrained wireless device and measure the resource consumed by various wireless security protocols on this device. From the experimental results we see that proposed LWE consumes about 62% less power compared to TKIP and99% less power compared CCMP (AES), while providing a security enhancement of 2 ver the WEP protocol. These results demonstrate the utility of LWE as a good security protocol for wireless networks with battery power constrained devices and systems where 64 bit WEP is hardwired.	128-bit;64-bit computing;block cipher mode of operation;cbc-mac;computation;cryptographic protocol;encryption;key (cryptography);learning with errors;overhead (computing);rc4;stream cipher;temporal key integrity protocol;tokenization (data security);ver (command);wi-fi protected access;wired equivalent privacy;wireless security	Chetan Nanjunda Mathur;K.

This paper presents the geographic server distributed model for key revocation which concerns about the security and performance of the system. The concept presented in this paper is more reliable, faster and scalable than the existing revocation techniques used in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) framework in various countries, as it optimises key authentication in a network. It proposes auto-seeking of a geographically distributed certifying authority's key revocation server, which holds the revocation lists by the client, based on the best service availability. The network is divided itself into the strongest availability zones (SAZ), which automatically allows the new receiver to update the address of the authentication server and replace the old address with the new address of the SAZ, in case it moves to another location in the zone, or in case the server becomes unavailable in the same zone. Our scheme eases out the revocation mechanism and enables key revocation in the legacy systems.	authentication server;broadcast delay;broadcast encryption;cluster analysis;computation;fastest;hoc (programming language);internet;key authentication;key distribution;key management;legacy system;operational availability;public key infrastructure;router (computing);scalability;server (computing);simulation;situated	Sudip Misra;Sumit Goswami;Gyan Prakash Pathak;Nirav Shah;Isaac Woungang	2009	2009 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications	10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069448	computer science;public key infrastructure;revocation list;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-48.665913923594914	76.1616677454389	165651

Based on the continuous exchange of both periodic and event triggered messages, smart vehicles can enhance road safety, while also providing support for comfort applications. In addition to the different communication protocols, securing such communications and establishing a certain trustiness among vehicles are among the main challenges to address, since the presence of dishonest peers can lead to unwanted situations. To this end, existing security solutions are typically divided into two main categories, cryptography and trust, where trust appeared as a complement to cryptography on some specific adversary models and environments where the latter was not enough to mitigate all possible attacks. In this paper, we provide an adversary-oriented survey of the existing trust models for VANETs. We also show when trust is preferable to cryptography, and the opposite. In addition, we show how trust models are usually evaluated in VANET contexts, and finally, we point out some critical scenarios that existing trust models cannot handle, together with some possible solutions.	adversary (cryptography);communications protocol;cryptography;hoc (programming language);smart city;trust (emotion);trust management (managerial science)	Chaker Abdelaziz Kerrache;Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate;Juan-Carlos Cano;Nasreddine Lagraa;Pietro Manzoni	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2645452	internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-49.14317726039766	74.659971025078	166401

Among these, the attacks targeted at the base station are the most devastating ones since this essential device processes and analyses all traffic generated in the network. Moreover, this feature can be exploited by a passive adversary to determine its location based on traffic analysis. This receiver-location privacy problem can be reduced by altering the traffic pattern of the network but the adversary may still be able to reach the base station if he gains access to the routing tables of a number of sensor nodes. In this paper we present HISP-NC (Homogenous Injection for Sink Privacy with Node Compromise protection), a receiverlocation privacy solution that consists of two complementary schemes which protect the location of the base station in the presence of traffic analysis and node compromise attacks. The HISP-NC data transmission protocol prevents traffic analysis by probabilistically hiding the flow of real traffic with moderate amounts of fake traffic. Moreover, HISP-NC includes a perturbation mechanism that modifies the routing tables of the nodes to introduce some level of uncertainty in attackers capable of retrieving the routing information from the nodes. Our scheme is validated both analytically and experimentally through extensive simulations. 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this article we propose DIP, a fully distributed, accurate, and robust algorithm for the identification of polluters. DIP relies on checks that are computed by peers upon completing reception of all blocks composing a data chunk. A check is a special message that contains the set of peer identifiers that provided blocks of the chunk as well as a bit to signal if the chunk has been corrupted. Checks are periodically transmitted by peers to their neighbors in the overlay network; peers receiving checks use them to maintain a factor graph. This graph is bipartite and an incremental belief propagation algorithm is run on it to compute the probability of a peer being a polluter. Using a prototype deployed over PlanetLab we show by extensive experimentation that DIP allows honest peers to identify polluters with very high accuracy and completeness, even when polluters collude to deceive them. Furthermore, we show that DIP is efficient, requiring low computational, communication, and storage overhead at each peer.	algorithm;belief propagation;computation;dual in-line package;factor graph;identifier;overhead (computing);overlay network;peer-to-peer;planetlab;prototype;software propagation;streaming media	Rossano Gaeta;Marco Grangetto;Lorenzo Bovio	2014	TOMCCAP	10.1145/2568223	statistical inference;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;machine learning;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;statistics;belief propagation;computer network	Networks	-55.347874977168566	77.39277437441832	167704

In our AAL scenario, these objects collect and transfer real-time information about the patients to the hospital server with the help of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.	atm adaptation layer;adversary (cryptography);denial-of-service attack;internet of things;mesh networking;network packet;real-time data;routing;server (computing);simulation;smart objects;throughput;wireless mesh network	Shaker Alanazi;Jalal Al-Muhtadi;Abdelouahid Derhab;Kashif Saleem;Afnan N.

Data confidentiality and authenticity are critical in these settings. However, the wireless connectivity, the absence of physical protection, the close interaction between WSNs and their physical environment, and the unattended deployment of WSNs make them highly vulnerable to node capture as well as a wide range of network-level attacks. Moreover, the constrained energy, memory, and computational capabilities of the employed sensor nodes limit the adoption of security solutions designed for wire-line and wireless networks. In this paper, we focus on the management of encryption keys in large-scale clustered WSNs. We propose a novel distributed key management scheme based on exclusion basis systems (EBS); a combinatorial formulation of the group key management problem. Our scheme is termed SHELL because it is scalable, hierarchical, efficient, location-aware, and light-weight. Unlike most existing key management schemes for WSNs, SHELL supports rekeying and, thus, enhances network security and survivability against node capture. SHELL distributes key management functionality among multiple nodes and minimizes the memory and energy consumption through trading off the number of keys and rekeying messages. In addition, SHELL employs a novel key assignment scheme that reduces the potential of collusion among compromised sensor nodes by factoring the geographic location of nodes in key assignment. Simulation results demonstrate that SHELL significantly boosts the network resilience to attacks while conservatively consuming nodes' resources	computation;confidentiality;encryption;geographic coordinate system;group key;integer factorization;key management;location awareness;network security;scalability;simulation;software deployment	Mohamed F.

The existing security solutions of WSN are based on multi-round function, which requires high computing complexity and energy consumption. WSN have, however, limited resources that prevent their efficient deployment for a long period. In this paper, a new kind of security system based on a cipher and authentication algorithm called EDCA is presented to ensure the necessary security requirements with low computation complexity. Furthermore, the proposed cipher is based on a dynamic binary diffusion layer. The contents of packets is divided into many blocks, which are mixed together to produce the cipher blocks. Likewise, an enhanced version of cipher is presented to attain a better statistical properties. Additionally, EDCA is evaluated by comparing it with AES, which is considered reliable and robust in several standards of sensor networks. The results show that the proposed algorithm has a reduced computation complexity, and is robust and could be adopted for different types of wireless or mobile networks.	algorithm;authentication;block cipher mode of operation;cipher;circuit complexity;computation;cryptography;randomness;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;software deployment	Hassan Noura;Steven Martin;Khaldoun Al Agha	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952824	wireless wan;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-50.53039481712066	75.45804456889906	169759

There is one simplistic approach for achieving recipient anonymity. If a message is equally broadcasted to all network entities (e.g., routers and hosts), an adversary cannot infer any traffic patterns for the intended recipient. While this technique is unconditionally secure, no one believes that this is a practical solution except in some special network environments since it requires extremely expensive traffic overhead. In this paper we realize this idea with an efficient multicast protocol by introducing the concept of a public routing proxy. A public routing proxy enables a sender to deliver a message to the intended recipient anonymously since the public routing proxy multicasts the message to a set of k network entities including the intended recipient. Thus, in the proposed protocol, the recipient’s k-anonymity can be unconditionally guaranteed. We also demonstrate the practicality of the proposed protocol through intensive simulation based on well-known network topologies. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the work proposes a cooperative algorithm in which the mobile underwater sensors (installed on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles-AUVs) respond to simple local rules based on the available information to perform the mission and maintain the communication link with the network (behavioral approach). The algorithm is intrinsically robust: with loss of communication among the vehicles the coverage performance (i.e., the mission goal) is degraded but not lost. The ensuing form of graceful degradation provides also a reactive measure against Denial of Service. The cooperative algorithm relies on the fact that the available information from the other sensors, though not necessarily complete, is trustworthy. To ensure trustworthiness, a security suite has been designed, specifically oriented to the underwater scenario, and in particular with the goal of reducing the communication overhead introduced by security in terms of number and size of messages. The paper gives implementation details on the integration between the security suite and the cooperative algorithm and provides statistics on the performance of the system as collected during the UAN project sea trial held in Trondheim, Norway, in May 2011.	acclimatization;acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;analysis of algorithms;autonomous robot;behavior;computational complexity theory;denial-of-service attack;drug vehicle;elegant degradation;fault tolerance;information exchange;middleware;network architecture;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;robustness (computer science);rule (guideline);solutions;telecommunications network;trust (emotion);znf365 gene;disease transmission;message;sensor (device)	Andrea Caiti;Vincenzo Calabrò;Gianluca Dini;Angelica Lo Duca;Andrea Munafò	2012		10.3390/s120201967	embedded system;simulation;wireless sensor network;transducer;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;network security;robotics;computer security	Mobile	-57.70020668259649	77.69910441738472	169860
2eebb7968d5e076f23fcd03615a1e4759ef7354c	a trust management based on a cooperative scheme in vanet		VANET is a vehicular ad hoc network, which is highly dynamic, self-organised and without a preexisting infrastructure. VANET works properly if the participating vehicles cooperate to ensure the exchange of packets. This special network confronts many constraints, such as attacks of malicious entity and absence of trust between nodes. To solve these problems, we proposed an approach having a decentralised architecture combining two models: the cluster model and the trust management model. Our approach encourages cooperation between vehicles by broadcast packets using the reward concept. It also ensures the detection of selfish nodes using the trust concept. By applying the punishment mechanism, our approach aimed to prevent malicious nodes from disrupting the network by injecting false information. Besides, in our network, we guaranteed authentic forwarding packets which were controlled by the group leader which takes the function of u0027watchdogu0027. Our approach is based on asymmetric cryptography, which used ...	trust management (information system)	Ahmed Zouinkhi;Amel Ltifi;Chiraz Chouaib;Mohamed Naceur Abdelkrim	2018	IJICT	10.1504/IJICT.2018.10012284	computer network;architecture;public-key cryptography;vehicular ad hoc network;network packet;computer science;broadcasting	DB	-53.22393386678276	78.14005304483878	170734

Much research work has been proposed to address the anonymity of communicating parties, the location privacy of the message source and destination, and the privacy of the network routing paths. However, with the advent of new radio identification and localization techniques, more advanced privacy attacks are possible. We describe a new privacy attack in which the adversary tries to infer the itineraries of the nodes in the network. To protect itinerary privacy, we design an algorithm, called the Delta-mobility camouflaging algorithm, which can be applied upon any mobility model by changing the original motion segments into Delta-shaped camouflaging paths. Our analysis results show that the Delta-mobility camouflaging algorithm is cost-effective, which in most cases decreases the itinerary exposure probability more than 80% at a cost of less than 3% extra travel distance.	ansi escape code;adversary (cryptography);algorithm;elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);privacy;routing;simulation	Lei Tang;Xiaoyan Hong;Susan V.

2b86958ab9fd9216aaa70c2db716c05881995e87	private inter-network routing for wireless sensor networks and the internet of things		"""As computing becomes increasingly pervasive, different heterogeneous networks are connected and integrated. This is especially true in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) settings. However, as different networks managed by different parties and with different security requirements are integrated, security becomes a primary concern. WSN nodes, in particular, are often deployed """"in the open"""", where a potential attacker can gain physical access to the device. As nodes can be deployed in hostile or difficult scenarios, such as military battlefields or disaster recovery settings, it is crucial to avoid escalation from successful attacks on a single node to the whole network, and from there to other connected networks. It is therefore crucial to secure the communication within the WSN, and in particular, maintain context information, such as the network topology and the location and identity of base stations (which collect data gathered by the sensors) private.  In this paper, we propose a protocol achieving anonymous routing between different interconnected IoT or WSN networks, based on the Spatial Bloom Filter (SBF) data structure. The protocol enables communications between the nodes through the use of anonymous identifiers, thus hiding the location and identity of the nodes within the network. The proposed routing strategy preserves context privacy, and prevents adversaries from learning the network structure and topology, as routing information is encrypted using a homomorphic encryption scheme, and computed only in the encrypted domain. Preserving context privacy is crucial in preventing adversaries from gaining valuable network information from a successful attacks on a single node of the network, and reduces the potential for attack escalation."""	bloom filter;data structure;disaster recovery;homomorphic encryption;identifier;internet of things;network topology;pervasive informatics;physical access;privacy;privilege escalation;requirement;routing;semantic network;sensor;tunneling protocol	Paolo Palmieri;Luca Calderoni;Dario Maio	2017		10.1145/3075564.3079068	wireless sensor network;disaster recovery;computer science;network security;computer network;heterogeneous network;encryption;physical access;network topology;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	-52.12284440288499	75.78590266741888	172178

However, in comparison to wired network or infrastructure-based wireless network, MANET is particularly vulnerable to security attacks due to its fundamental characteristics, e.g., the open medium, dynamic network topology, autonomous terminal, lack of centralized monitoring and management. The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs. The proposed method uses promiscuous mode to detect malicious node (black hole) and propagates the information of malicious node to all the other nodes in the network. The simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed method as throughput of the network does not deteriorate in presence of the back holes.	algorithm;autonomous robot;black hole;centralized computing;database;distance-vector routing protocol;effective method;hoc (programming language);intension;mobile device;network topology;overhead (computing);promiscuous mode;shortest path problem;simulation;throughput	Pramod Kumar Singh;Govind Sharma	2012	2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2012.78	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;hierarchical routing;engineering;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;internet privacy;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	-53.760666857231485	76.20298322897992	172615

Considering that in many cases, the sensor nodes’ behavior is both spatio-temporal correlated, and this paper proposes a reputation model called BRMSN (Behavior Reputation Method for Sensor Networks) which focuses on local testing. The model defines the similarity and the similarity matrix by using normal differences among status estimate vectors (or measured values). Using the homogeneity measures that formed by the spatial information between nodes as indirect reputation measurement. Using the reliability measures that formed by the temporal information between nodes as direct reputation measurement. The simulation results show that the model can reduce the number of data exchange among sensors, also our model has the powerful ability to prevent from malicious attacks or faulty nodes.	algorithm;authentication;bilinear filtering;interference (communication);malware;node (computer science);sensor node;similarity measure;simulation;trust management (managerial science)	Ming-Zheng Zhou;Yi Zhang;Sen-Yan Zhao	2009	2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing	10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.42	key distribution in wireless sensor networks;business;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Robotics	-54.04422361945469	77.8137550726297	173470
c2be4f8a40b7cacd237d16260997a2e7ebc909e3	ecpdr: an efficient conditional privacy-preservation scheme with demand response for secure ad hoc social communications		The recent rise and widespread adoption of wireless networked embedded systems for mobile communication applications has sparked numerous visions of an ever more networked and interactive world. One such vision proposed in the past years are wireless ad hoc social networks, where wireless ad hoc communication and mobile devices are combined with integrated social characteristics to exchange data related games, rumors, and interesting information. However, they are still faces many challenges including routing security and privacy preservation. In this paper, the authors propose an Efficient Conditional Privacy preservation scheme with Demand Response, called ECPDR, for implement an effective information security, and achieving privacy preservation of message transmitted over wireless ad hoc social networks. They choose Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) as a reactive routing protocol. This routing protocol has been extended to include the necessary parameters to perform the cryptographic operations at the nodes. Based on the cooperative neighbor and the short signatures technique, the proposed ECPDR scheme can not only detect and avoid but also can preserves the message privacy against elemental attacks and compound attacks. Extensive analyses and experiments are given to demonstrate its high detection rate and practicability under various scenarios.

8d65084aff0d2b89395069ee0730083d1d142843	the security properties of in-network aggregation	engineering and technology;teknik och teknologier	In-network aggregation is an important paradigm for current and future networked systems, enabling efficient cooperate processing of aggregate information, while providing sub-linear scalability properties. However, security of this important class of algorithms has to date not been sufficiently addressed. In this dissertation, we focus on the integrity properties of in-network aggregation algorithms, with emphasis on the sub-goals of correctness and completeness. We propose an efficient solution that provides strong correctness guarantees by ensuring individual node integrity a priori by applying the principles of trusted systems. To this end, we propose dedicated trusted sensor and aggregator modules. Trusted modules, in conjunction with cryptographic authentication and transport protocols, are applied to construct trusted aggregation overlays, giving strong guarantees in terms of correctness. We support our findings by a proof-of-concept prototype in a single aggregator model, as well as a design for a hierarchical in-network aggregation system. Completeness is a more elusive goal than correctness, if only for the fact that drops and message corruptions are a fact of life in distributed systems. Hence, it may not be possible to distinguish between benign and malicious losses. Building on the trusted systems solution for correctness, we propose a protocol that decreases the adversarial influence in a tree-based aggregation network. We exploit the fact that a secure protocol can be executed over a trusted overlay, enabling per-edge fault detection and dissemination of edge ratings. Simulation-based trials suggest that the presented protocol achieves significant reduction in the potential impact an adversary can have on the completeness of aggregate results.

Our approach is based on the well-known simulation paradigm that has been proposed to prove the security of cryptographic protocols. Our main contribution is the application of the simulation-based approach in the context of ad hoc routing. This involves a precise definition of a real-world model, which describes the real operation of the protocol, and an ideal-world model, which captures what the protocol wants to achieve in terms of security. Both models take into account the peculiarities of wireless communications and ad hoc routing. Then, we give a formal definition of routing security in terms of indistinguishability of the two models from the point of view of honest parties. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by analyzing two """"secure"""" ad hoc routing protocols, SRP and Ariadne. This analysis leads to the discovery of as yet unknown attacks against both protocols.

They are self-organized, self-configured and self-controlled infrastructure-less networks. This kind of network has the advantage of being able to be set-up and deployed anywhere and anytime because it has no infrastructure set-up and no central administration. Distributing information between these vehicles over long ranges in such networks, however, is a very challenging task, since sharing information always has a risk attached to it especially when the information is confidential. The disclosure of such information to anyone else other than the intended parties could be extremely damaging, particularly in military applications where controlling the dissemination of messages is essential. This thesis therefore provides a review of the issue of security in VANET and MANET; it also surveys existing solutions for dissemination control. It highlights a particular area not adequately addressed until now: controlling information flow in VANETs. This thesis contributes a policy-based framework to control the dissemination of messages communicated between nodes in order to ensure that message remains confidential not only during transmission, but also after it has been communicated to another peer, and to keep the message contents private to an originator-defined subset of nodes in the VANET. This thesis presents a novel framework to control data dissemination in vehicle ad hoc networks in which policies are attached to messages as they are sent between peers. This is done by automatically attaching policies along with messages to specify how the information can be used by the receiver, so as to prevent disclosure of the messages other than consistent with the requirements of the originator. These requirements are represented as a set of policy rules that explicitly instructs recipients how the information contained in messages can be disseminated to other nodes in order to avoid unintended disclosure. This thesis describes the data dissemination policy language used in this work; and further describes the policy rules in order to be a suitable and understandable language for the framework to ensure the confidentiality requirement of the originator. This thesis also contributes a policy conflict resolution that allows the originator to be asked for upto-date policies and preferences. The framework was evaluated using the Network Simulator (NS-2) to provide and check whether the privacy and confidentiality of the originators’ messages were met. A policy-based agent protocol and a new packet structure were implemented in this work to manage and enforce the policies attached to packets at every node in the VANET. Some case studies are presented in this thesis to show how data dissemination can be controlled based on the policy of the originator. The results of these case studies show the feasibility of our research to control the data dissemination between nodes in VANETs. NS-2 is also used to test the performance of the proposed policy-based agent protocol and demonstrate its effectiveness using various network performance metrics (average delay and overhead).	anytime algorithm;autonomous system (internet);confidentiality;hoc (programming language);network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;requirement;self-organization;unintended consequences	Hamza Aldabbas	2012			vehicular ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;geography;ad hoc wireless distribution service;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-54.62152435835936	74.81358177827444	176089
4f5e10108076f7667d0abc4b935fe6bc04157a65	lightweight and practical node clustering authentication protocol for hierarchical wireless sensor networks		There are many concerns about the sensitivity and the privacy of data in hierarchical wireless sensor networks (HWSNs) because the low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. In existing studies, many researchers only focus on the existence of single node in the network, while the arrangement that multiple nodes attached to one cluster is out of consideration. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and practical node clustering authentication protocol for HWSNs. As we assume that one cluster to be authenticated is attached with a group of nodes. The cluster head (CH) node takes full control of the entire authentication process in its cluster. In addition, the protocol is proved to offer enough security assurances and have resistance to various attacks. The regular operation of the network will not be affected or damaged by the incidents occurred during the authentication process.	authentication protocol;cluster analysis	Dengzhi Liu;Jian Shen;Anxi Wang;Chen Wang	2018	IJSNet	10.1504/IJSNET.2018.092638	wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;computer network;public-key cryptography;cluster analysis;authentication protocol;authentication	Mobile	-51.34530159443767	76.5028500634125	176131

In a wormhole attack, a tunnel is setup in advance between two colluders. The colluders record packets at one location and forward them through the tunnel to another location in the network. Depending on whether or not the colluders are participating in the network functions, the wormhole attack can be further divided into two categories: traditional wormhole attack and Byzantine wormhole attack. Existing researches focusing on detecting traditional wormhole attacks can be classified into three categories: one-hop delay based approach; topological analysis based or special hardware/middleware based approaches. Unfortunately, they all have their own limitations. Most of the researches detecting Byzantine wormhole attack are not addressing the Byzantine wormhole attack directly. Instead, they focus on observing the consequence after a Byzantine wormhole attack, like packet dropping or modification. In this paper, we propose to detect both traditional and Byzantine wormhole attacks by detecting some topological anomalies introduced by wormhole tunnels. Simulation results show that our scheme can achieve both high wormhole attack detection rate and accuracy. Our scheme is also simple to implement.	byzantine fault tolerance;hoc (programming language);middleware;network packet;replay attack;routing;sensor;simulation	King Sun Chan;Mohammad Rafiqul Alam	2014	Int.

Current solutions either exact high overheads on the network and nodes, or only operate in specialized scenarios and prevent a small selection of attacks. Trusted computing provides additional security in open computing environments by allowing software to prove its identity and integrity to remote entities. We propose using trusted computing to prevent misconfigured or malicious nodes from participating in the network. We extend AODV to ensure that only trustworthy nodes participate in the network.

These characteristics render WSNs facing many security threats, which require cryptographic security mechanisms for secure communication, key revocation and management of security issues arising from the addition of new nodes. In this paper, we propose a key management scheme to meet the security requirements of wireless sensor networks. The scheme relies on the theory of random graph to build a fully secure connectivity for distributed sensor nodes. It uses heterogeneous structure to limit ranges of attacks, and utilizes hash chains to realize authentication of pool keys and broadcast messages of auxiliary nodes. The security and network connectivity characteristics supported by the key management scheme are discussed and simulation experiments are presented.	authentication;cryptography;experiment;key management;random graph;requirement;secure communication;sensor;simulation	Huawei Zhao;Jiankun Hu;Jing Qin;Vijay Varadharajan;Haishan Wan	2012	2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2012.171	computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Security	-50.08416148445153	76.7754188849878	177229

Made of tiny sensors, they collect data and communicate through wireless technologies. Because they may take part in sensitive or military applications, security is an essential matter in such networks. Confidentiality and authenticity can be ensured by the use of dedicated mechanisms. Focusing on availability, we propose here a new practical approach to protect the network against denial of service attacks thanks to the use of traffic monitoring agents called cNodes. The approach uses a fair election process of cNodes in accordance with classical criteria related to residual energies and the presence of compromised nodes which may have greedy or jamming behaviors. Results obtained from simulations show that this method is effective both in terms of detection and of energy conservation.	activity recognition;big data;computer cluster;confidentiality;denial-of-service attack;experiment;greedy algorithm;iterative method;model checking;quantified self;radio jamming;randomness;rogue;sensor;simulation;smart city	Quentin Monnet;Youcef Hammal;Lynda Mokdad;Jalel Ben-Othman	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417091	serviceability;availability;wireless sensor network;computer science;sensor;information security;reliability;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;cluster analysis;computer security;computer network	Embedded	-54.8071444947163	77.87345126866192	177330

The outside attackers can be prevented with the help of an efficient key management protocol and cryptography. However, to prevent inside attackers, it should be accompanied with an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper, we propose a novel secure routing with an integrated localized key management (SR-LKM) protocol, which is aimed to prevent both inside and outside attackers. The localized key management mechanism is not dependent on any routing protocol. Thus, unlike many other existing schemes, the protocol does not suffer from the key management - secure routing interdependency problem. The key management mechanism is lightweight as it optimizes the use of public key cryptography with the help of a novel neighbor based handshaking and Least Common Multiple (LCM) based broadcast key distribution mechanism. The protocol is storage scalable and its efficiency is confirmed by the results obtained from simulation experiments.	authentication;communications protocol;credential;experiment;handshaking;hoc (programming language);interdependence;intrusion detection system;key distribution;key management;latent class model;network packet;overhead (computing);public-key cryptography;routing;scalability;simulation	Shrikant H.

Security should be the first concern. But in large scale multi-agent systems, the most challenging problems encountered are locating and communicating of these autoprocessing agents. Some approaches have used several different methods to solve these problems. But unfortunately, they were not satisfied either for their complexity, poor performance or their lack of applicability. In our approach, we propose a secure group communication solution toward the security, locating and communication problems. We differentiated the ”Agent-Based” Multicast concept from the traditional ”Host-Based” Multicast. We then described the requirements for providing secure group services and introduce the key distribution method. A cryptographic method is complemented for further protect the agents.

Due to the characteristics of MSNs, key management must enable direct (without intermediaries) key establishment between two arbitrary nodes. We apply combinatorial design theory to pre-distribute Blundo’s polynomials to MSN nodes. This approach is further combined with Liu and Ning polynomial evaluation optimization yet increasing the scalability of polynomials. It also solves the combinatorial design existence problem of Çamtepe and Yener key pre-distribution scheme (KPS) without a decrease in network scalability or resiliency. The analysis in this paper indicates that this scheme has a number of nice properties, including direct pairwise key establishment, which enables authentication, tolerance to node captures, increased scalability and very low computational and communication overhead.	authentication;key exchange;key management;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);polynomial;scalability	David Sánchez Sánchez;Heribert Baldus	2005	First International Conference on Security and Privacy for Emerging Areas in Communications Networks (SECURECOMM'05)	10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.2	combinatorial design;scalability;mobile telephony;computer science;information security;key management;remote patient monitoring;authentication;distributed computing;computer security;polynomial;computer network	Mobile	-49.75311970475785	77.0875619879411	178511

In several replica node detection schemes, witness nodes fail to work before replicas are detected due to the lack of effective random verification. This paper presents a novel distributed detection protocol to counteract node replication attacks. Our scheme distributes node location information to multiple randomly selected cells and then linear-multicasts the information for verification from the localized cells. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol improves detection efficiency compared with various existing protocols and prolongs the lifetime of the overall network.	randomness;simulation	Yuping Zhou;Zhenjie Huang;Juan Wang;Rufen Huang;Dongmei Yu	2014	EURASIP J.

Due to the lack of physical protection, however, sensor networks are vulnerable to attacks if deployed in hostile environments. When a sensor network is under attack, the most fundamental concern is that information communicated or stored in the network remains safe. The past research has focused on securing information in communication, but how to secure information in storage has been generally overlooked. Meanwhile, distributed data storage and retrieval have become popular for efficient data management in sensor networks, which renders the absence of schemes for securing stored information to be a more severe problem. Hence, we propose in this paper three schemes to deal with the problem. All the schemes have the following properties: (i) only authorized entities can access data stored in the sensor network; (ii) the schemes are resilient to a large number of sensor node compromises. The second and the third schemes do not involve any centralized entity except for a few initialization or renewal operations, and thus support secure, distributed data storage and retrieval. The third scheme further provides high scalability and flexibility, and hence is most suitable in real applications.

e76d8ec9d97481e4e59b971091ae50f37d190dff	mobile sensor localization under wormhole attacks: an analysis		In many application contexts, the nodes in a sensor network may be required to gather information relevant to their locations. This process of location estimation or localization is a critical aspect for all the location related applications of sensor networks. Localization helps nodes find their absolute position coordinates. Like possibly every system, localization systems are prone to attacks. Through this study we intend to do a low-level identification and analysis of broad, large-scale threat to mobile sensor localization systems due to attacks. In this paper, we study the behaviour of some well-known basic localization schemes under by far the most dangerous attacks on localization called wormhole attacks. The network and attacker model assumed in the paper are chosen so that the analysis unleashes the possibility of a resilient solution to the wormhole attacks problem independent of the nodes not under the effect of attacks.

Thus, a practical way to prolong a wireless sensor network lifetime is to reduce the sensor energy consumption in data transmissions. Data aggregation is an efficient way to minimize energy consumption on sensors. In this paper, we propose a practical secure data aggregation scheme, Sen-SDA, based on an additive homomorphic encryption scheme, an identity-based signature scheme, and a batch verification technique with an algorithm for filtering injected false data. We then investigate the feasibility of our scheme using low-cost microcontrollers choosing two popular IEEE 802.15.4-compliant wireless sensor network hardware platforms, MICAz and Tmote Sky, used in real-life deployments.	algorithm;antivirus software;authentication;confidentiality;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;data aggregation;digital signature;end-to-end principle;homomorphic encryption;hop-by-hop transport;microcontroller;networking hardware;real life;requirement;same-day affirmation;sensor node;sensor web;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Kyung-Ah Shim;Cheol-Min Park	2015	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2014.2346764	wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;encryption;computer network	Mobile	-50.39896484120624	75.93309593090203	180638

While it is possible that an adversary obtains a subset of the symmetric keys in use, it has been unclear how to use those to compromise specific secure links. We investigate how the adversary could do this practically. We term this the Stealthy Pre-Attack (SPA), because the adversarial nodes leverage benign behavior to guide their attack. The contribution of this paper is the identification of this adversarial behavior, the evaluation of its benefits for the attacker, which can then much more effectively compromise security, and the proposal of counter-measures to mitigate it.	adversary (cryptography);brute-force search;refinement (computing);secure communication;simulation;software deployment	Panagiotis Papadimitratos;Jing Deng	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364226	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;key distribution;computer security;communications system;computer network	Security	-51.386258150526814	76.62427026844382	181478

This paper considers a pooling problem which models the strategic interaction between an adversary and a sender who chooses relay nodes from a pool of participants, a subset of which is controlled by the adversary. The sender adaptively chooses sets of relay nodes over a number of rounds, while the adversary chooses whether or not to attack in rounds where adversarial nodes are chosen. We introduce a class of strategies, called random pooling strategies, over which it is tractable to optimize and whose performance is within a factor of 1.4 of the optimal strategy when the number of adversaries is given.	adversary (cryptography);cobham's thesis;peer-to-peer;relay	Anoosheh Heidarzadeh;Shiyu Zhao;Tracey Ho;Michelle Effros	2014	2014 52nd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/ALLERTON.2014.7028608	computer science;distributed computing;computer security;adversary model;computer network	Theory	-53.104505360515866	79.01180071675302	181506

Exhaustive probing on each user is extremely unrealistic. Besides, unlike hierarchical systems, the infrastructure of a P2P network is flat, which makes multi-casting based probing schemes impossible. Most P2P security research focus on proactive prevention schemes to secure the system. In this paper, we aim to apply passive anomaly detection to estimate the proportion of malicious nodes in the network, without any network parameter information. Two deployment schemes are proposed for different network attacks. We deploy monitoring nodes which maintain both inand out-of-band P2P communications. Monitoring nodes collaboratively probe one another periodically, and observations at each monitoring node are aggregated by a token message. Simulation results show that after applying our anomaly detection system, we can estimate the status of malicious nodes in a P2P network with high accuracy, and the delivery rate of the network is noticeably increased after successfully blocking suspicious nodes.	anomaly detection;blocking (computing);out-of-band agreement;peer-to-peer;simulation;software deployment	Wei Wang;Hong Man;Fangming He	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425503	out-of-band management;routing;estimation;anomaly detection;computer science;network security;peer-to-peer;mathematical model;distributed computing;hierarchical control system;computer security;statistics;computer network	Security	-55.451223805604876	77.32099466855529	181650

Therefore, we propose a collaborative routing protocol (CRP) to detect and isolate colluding attackers via monitor mechanism. Monitor nodes observe and record the behavior of intermediate nodes. Based on the records of intermediate nodes, source node can distinguish malicious nodes and isolate them. Finally, security analyses and simulation verify that CRP can effectively and efficiently resist black hole attacks, gray hole attacks, modify and fake packet attacks, rushing attacks, and collusion attacks.	black hole;hoc (programming language);malware;network packet;node (computer science);replay attack;routing;simulation	Hung-Min Sun;Chiung-Hsun Chen;Chih-Wen Yeh;Yao-Hsin Chen	2012	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-012-0537-y	robust random early detection;computer science;network security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-54.88658792980806	76.05583863242302	182016
1412e89ffefa4e60250c0d7c9b7ba5f02e659827	on the effectiveness of link addition for improving robustness of multiplex networks against layer node-based attack		Recent research trends in network science are shifting from the analysis of single-layer networks to the analysis of multilayer networks. In particular, the robustness of multilayer networks has been actively studied. There exist two popular multilayer network models: one is interdependent network, and the other is multiplex network. We aim to construct a methodology for effectively improving the robustness of multiplex networks against layer node-based attack. As the first step to achieve this goal, in this paper, we examine the effectiveness of existing link addition strategies, which are proposed for interdependent networks, for improving the robustness of multiplex networks. Through the network attack simulations, we show that the strategic link addition can effectively improve the robustness of multiplex networks. Moreover, link addition strategies are suggested to be effective particularly when a large number of nodes are attacked.	interdependence;interdependent networks;multiplexing;network science;simulation;traffic collision avoidance system	Yui Kazawa;Sho Tsugawa	2017	2017 IEEE 41st Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.180	robustness (computer science);network model;multiplex;network science;computer science;computer network;interdependent networks;multiplexing;distributed computing	Metrics	-57.287423715387575	74.82005549242207	182333

On the other hand, more and more application scenarios require sensor nodes to be mobile, which imposes new technological challenges for security. Key management is the core for secure data communications among the resource-constrained sensor nodes. In this paper, based on the Group Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocols and the energy level of each node in the network, we propose Energy Aware Group Diffie-Hellman key management protocol for mobile wireless sensor networks. The simulation results show that the proposed key management protocol provide significant improvement in maximizing the lifetime of networks. hebing@fim.uni-passau.de p.szalachowski@stud.elka.pw.edu.pl zkotulsk@tele.pw.edu.pl fotiou@aueb.gr marias@aueb.gr polyzos@aueb.gr demeer@uni-passau.de Pobrane z czasopisma Annales AIInformatica http://ai.annales.umcs.pl Data: 28/11/2018 08:49:40	diffie–hellman key exchange;energy level;key management;mobile phone;sensor node;simulation	Xiaobing He;Pawel Szalachowski;Zbigniew Kotulski;Nikos Fotiou;Giannis F.

For example, sensors may be dispersed in the jungle and forward information about the sensed states of the natural ecosystem, such as, humidity, fire detection... However, it is still quite easy for attackers to disconnect the sensors network from the Internet. For example, the sensors usually forward their messages to a base station, the Internet gateway, in a hop-by-hop fashion because they are resource-constrained in terms of energy, the spending of energy dramatically increases with the range of transmission and the attackers may capture intermediate sensors and drop messages rather than forwarding them. In this paper we study how computational trust can be used to mitigate the issue of sinkhole attacks and evaluate our approach on top of the MIX protocol.	computational trust;ecosystem;gateway (telecommunications);hop-by-hop transport;internet;mix;sensor	Olivier Powell;Jean-Marc Seigneur;Lumini&#x0163;a Moraru	2007	The International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems, and Technologies (SECUREWARE 2007)	10.1109/SECUREWARE.2007.4385306	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-51.973762159258754	76.91366988341493	183087

Mainly due to lack of a protected physical boundary, wireless communications are vulnerable to unauthorized detection, interception and and even node capture. Privacy is becoming one of the major issues that jeopardize the successful deployment and survivability of wireless sensor networks. While confidentiality of the message can be ensured through content encryption, it is much more difficult to adequately address the source-location privacy. For WSN, source-location privacy service is further complicated by the fact that the sensor nodes consist of low-cost and low-power radio devices, computationally intensive cryptographic algorithms (such as public-key cryptosystems) and large scale broadcasting-based protocols are not suitable for WSN. In this paper, we propose a two-step routing strategy for the messages to be routed from the actual source node to the SINK node through either a single, or multiple, randomly selected intermediate node(s) away from the source node so that it is to make it infeasible for the adversaries to trace back to the source node through hop-by-hop routing analysis. In the first protocol, the messages will be routed to a single intermediate node. This scheme can provide very good local source-location privacy. We also propose routing through multiple randomly selected intermediate nodes based on angle and quadrant to further improve the performance and security. While providing source-location privacy for WSN, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes are very efficient in energy consumption, and transmission latency. The proposed schemes can also assurance high message delivery ratio. Therefore, they can be used for many practical applications.

These applications often include the monitoring of sensitive information such as enemy movement on the battlefield or the location of personnel in a building. Security is therefore important in WSNs. However, WSNs suffer from many constraints, including low computation capability, small memory, limited energy resources, susceptibility to physical capture, and the use of insecure wireless communication channels. These constraints make security in WSNs a challenge. In this article we present a survey of security issues in WSNs. First we outline the constraints, security requirements, and attacks with their corresponding countermeasures in WSNs. We then present a holistic view of security issues. These issues are classified into five categories: cryptography, key management, secure routing, secure data aggregation, and intrusion detection. Along the way we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of various WSN security protocols and further compare and evaluate these protocols based on each of these five categories. We also point out the open research issues in each subarea and conclude with possible future research directions on security in WSNs.

83a6f08d6738f583a2dcca8e65a0efdf240d8064	a template approach for group key distribution in dynamic ad-hoc groups		The ubiquitous wireless communication medium poses serious threats to the confidentiality and integrity of communication in constrained networks like Internet-of-Things (IoT), sensor nodes or ad-hoc groups of soldiers on a battlefield. Data encryption is essential for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the wireless network communication. We focus on the problem of group key distribution in dynamically formed groups of network nodes. One major challenge is that the neighborhood of a node is not known prior to deployment and therefore, the group key establishment protocol needs to be independent of the physical network topology. In this paper, we describe an efficient template based approach for group key establishment using only shared symmetric secrets. Our template is a logical shared secret distribution built on the network nodes prior to deployment, which ensures that any node shares a distinct set of secrets with any dynamic group of nodes and thus, is able to establish a secure group key. We illustrate our template using two secret distribution protocols: sub-set and dual one-way hash chain distributions. Compared to existing algorithms, our template approach gives flexibility to the network administrator to choose from different secret distribution protocols for fine-grained control over the security levels and performance.	algorithm;confidentiality;cryptographic hash function;encryption;group key;hash chain;hoc (programming language);key distribution;key exchange;network topology;one-way function;shared secret;software deployment	Bezawada Bruhadeshwar;Alex X.

9b08d47bc03d5825d6469fb097b6cf10360bfb11	multi group key agreement mechanism for mobile p2p wireless networks		Secure and efficient communication among a set of mobile nodes is one of the most important aspect in P2P wireless networks. Security of various group-oriented applications requires a group secret shared between all participants. Several group key protocols have been presented in the literature to enable secrecy of communication among dynamic group of participants. However, most of them suffer from the scalability problem. In this paper, we propose a novel multi group key agreement mechanism for P2P wireless network. The proposed model is organized as several neighboring rings. Each group of peer belonging to the same ring has to agree on a contributed key, and the peer belonging to two adjacency rings have one key for each ring. Then, only a small set of nodes has to recalculate the key in case of join or leave operations.	algorithm;cryptography;encryption;fault tolerance;group key;herman ring;key-agreement protocol;matlab;peer-to-peer;performance evaluation;quantum key distribution;scalability;secure communication	Mourad Amad;Djamil Aïssani;Ahmed Meddahi;Mustapha Saadi	2011			secrecy;group key;wireless network;scalability;adjacency list;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;small set;distributed computing;computer science	Security	-50.16997504375232	77.63828622499304	185086

A key component for the wide-spread success and applicability of ZigBee-based networking solutions will be its ability to provide enhanced security mechanisms that can scale to hundreds of nodes. Currently, however, an area of concern is the ZigBee key management scheme, which uses a centralized approach that introduces well-known issues of limited scalability and a single point of vulnerability. Moreover, ZigBee key management uses a public key infrastructure. Due to these limitations, we suggest replacing ZigBee key management with a better candidate scheme that is decentralized, symmetric, and scalable while addressing security requirements. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of implementing Localized Encryption and Authentication Protocol (LEAP+), a distributed symmetric based key management. LEAP+ is designed to support multiple types of keys based on the message type that is being exchanged. In this paper, we first conduct a qualitative security analysis of LEAP+ and the current ZigBee key management scheme. Using the QualNet 5.0.2 simulator, we implement LEAP+ on the ZigBee platform for the very first time. Experimental results show that a distributed key management scheme such as LEAP+ provides improved security and offers good scalability.			2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		embedded system;neurfon;computer science;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-49.0559798891151	75.36024320705705	185660

The way to secure the distributed energy routing process that efficiently utilizes the distributed energy resources and minimizes the energy transmission overhead is essential in smart grid. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of the distributed energy routing process and investigate novel false data injection attacks against the energy routing process. We consider several general attacks, in which the adversary may manipulate the quantity of energy supply, the quantity of energy response, and the link state of energy transmission. The forged data injected by those attacks will cause imbalanced demand and supply, increase the cost for energy distribution, and disrupt the energy distribution. We formally model these attacks and quantitatively analyze their impact on energy distribution. Our evaluation data show that those attacks can effectively disrupt the effectiveness of energy distribution process, causing significant supplied energy loss, energy transmission cost and the number of outage users.	adversary (cryptography);downtime;link-state routing protocol;overhead (computing);simulation	Jie Lin;Wei Yu;Xinyu Yang;Guobin Xu;Wei Zhao	2012	2012 IEEE/ACM Third International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems	10.1109/ICCPS.2012.26	real-time computing;computer science;engineering;distributed computing;smart grid;distributed database;computer security	EDA	-53.70455563574998	80.74594606110708	185864

Current solutions might become brittle in context of new applications, such as pervasive computing, in which there is a large number of components with dynamic interdependencies between them. The inherent complexity of these future systems due to heterogeneity, decentralisation, and emergent technologies also demand scalable and robust solutions. An example of such emergent technologies is ad hoc networks, which are self-configuring networks that enable the connection of thousands of devices in arbitrary topologies. The objective of the panel is to discuss the challenges and the potential solutions when building dependable and secure applications in the context of ad hoc networks.

Reputation-based trust management system is a popular security mechanism used in vehicular networks and proven to be robust in many other applications. In this paper, we propose a similarity-based bootstrapping method using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for trust management in VSN. Then we introduce a reputation mechanism that takes into account, the user behaviors as well as historic features such as the total distance driven. Our simulation results show that the proposed system is robust against high density of malicious nodes (up to 60%). Furthermore, we also prove the accuracy of the proposed system in different conditions.	algorithm;analytical hierarchy;best, worst and average case;bootstrapping (compilers);computation;malware;reputation management;robustness (computer science);simulation;social network;theory;trust management (information system)	Dzhamal Alishev;Rasheed Hussain;Waqas Nawaz;Jooyoung Lee	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108459	vehicular ad hoc network;analytic hierarchy process;robustness (computer science);management system;computer science;information sharing;bootstrapping;data mining;social network;reputation	Mobile	-53.04324517765729	77.31191407278408	186377

Most existing security solutions to these attacks need to share symmetric keys among sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a commutative cipher based en-route filtering scheme (CCEF) that drops fabricated reports en-route without symmetric key sharing. In CCEF, the source node establishes a secret association with the base station on a per-session basis, while the intermediate forwarding nodes are equipped with a witness key. Through the usage of a commutative cipher, a forwarding node can use the witness key to verify the authenticity of the reports without knowing the original session key. As a result, CCEF can achieve stronger security protection than the existing symmetric key sharing approach."""	cipher;sensor;session key;symmetric-key algorithm;the witness	Hao Yang;Songwu Lu	2004	IEEE 60th Vehicular Technology Conference, 2004.

A high degree of security and reliability for BSN is extremely required. An adaptive and flexible intrusion-tolerant scheme for BSN, namely ITFBS, is proposed. ITFBS dynamically detects intrusions according to the collected intrusion-related information, and it can provide an adaptive intrusion-tolerant strategy with passive replication by utilising two-step threshold-based intrusion detection and replicas classification. The correctness and effectiveness of ITFBS is theoretically proved, and the experimental results show that ITFBS can effectively tolerate intrusions with low power consumption and high adaptability.	correctness (computer science);intrusion detection system;smart environment	Guowei Wu;Jiankang Ren;Lin Yao;Zichuan Xu	2011	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2010.0862	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;information security;reliability;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	-55.9459060953478	77.85091163785829	186641

Our solutions take into consideration, important WSN properties like coverage, connectivity, data aggregation and specific communication patterns. The two proposed techniques complement each other when used concurrently. The mutual guarding (MG) technique does not work when nodes are not completely covered by their neighbors or when adversary has shorter transmission range than the sensor nodes. It also does not protect nodes near the boundary. The SRP technique does not have these drawbacks. In this paper, we present our proposed techniques and analyze their performance in terms of successful masquerade detection rate and traffic and computational overhead.	adversary (cryptography);code coverage;data aggregation;iteration;mg (editor);object composition;overhead (computing);scsi rdma protocol;sensor;spoofing attack	Vijay Bhuse;Ajay Gupta;Ala I.

00ce76f956975909f3cc21bdcaa1c895f9da9aeb	mlas: multiple level authentication scheme for vanets	proxy re encryption;secure vehicular sensor network;authentication;message classification;batch verification	The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an emerging type of network which enables vehicles on roads to inter-communicate for driving safety. The basic idea is to allow arbitrary vehicles to broadcast ad hoc messages (e.g. traffic accidents) to other vehicles. However, this raises the concern of security and privacy. Messages should be signed and verified before they are trusted while the real identity of vehicles should not be revealed, but traceable by authorized party. Existing solutions either rely too heavily on a tamper-proof hardware device, or do not have an effective message verification scheme. In this paper, we propose a multiple level authentication scheme which still makes use of tamper-proof devices but the strong assumption that a long-term system master secret is preloaded into all tamper-proof devices is removed. Instead the master secret can be updated if needed to increase the security level. On the other hand, messages sent by vehicles are classified into two types – regular messages and urgent messages. Regular messages can be verified by neighboring vehicles by means of Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) while urgent messages can only be verified with the aid of RSUs nearby by means of a conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme. Through extensive simulation, we show that our multiple level authentication scheme is much more efficient that those RSU-aided authentication scheme as long as the proportion of urgent messages is less than 100%. The verification delay required can be up to 110 times smaller than other protocols. Our implementation shows that batch verification may not be as efficient as expected. In case without batch verification, the verification delay required by our scheme can even be up to 173 times smaller.	authentication	Tat Wing Chim;Siu-Ming Yiu;Lucas Chi Kwong Hui;Victor O. K.

628ca04a785e8198a3de987e5fc49cef47683389	denial of sleep attacks in bluetooth low energy wireless sensor networks		Many of the benefits of an Internet of Things sensor network model stem from the extremely long service life of its base sensing layer. When data from the base sensing layer is provided by very low power technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy, a class of vulnerabilities called Denial of Sleep attacks can be especially devastating to the network. These attacks can reduce the lifespan of the sensing nodes by several orders of magnitude, rendering the network largely unusable. This paper investigates a Denial of Sleep attack against the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol that allows a malicious actor to rapidly drain the battery of a targeted sensing node, including power analysis, simulation results, and an example implementation. The outcome will be utilized to build better defenses and more predictable environments.	bluetooth;internet of things;network model;simulation;usability	Jason Uher;Ryan G. Mennecke;Bassam S.

However, PKC comes with its own problems in terms of certificate management. Specifically, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) need to be maintained and distributed to the smart meters (SMs) in order to ensure security of the communications. The size of CRLs may grow over time and eventually may introduce additional delay, bandwidth, and storage overhead when various applications are run on SG. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for creating customized CRLs with reduced size for IEEE 802.11s-based advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks. Rather than maintaining a huge-size single CRL that introduces unnecessary search time and storage, the idea is to cluster/group SMs within the AMI network and create CRLs based on these groups. The grouping is mainly done in such a way that they bring together the SMs that will be very likely to communicate so that the CRLs will be kept local to that group. To this end, we propose two novel grouping algorithms. The first algorithm is a bottom-up approach, which is based on the existing routes from the SMs to the gateway. Since the SMs will be sending their data to the gateway through the nodes on the route, this forms a natural grouping. The second approach is a top-down recursive approach, which considers the minimum spanning tree of the network and then divides it into smaller subtrees. Via grouping, the length of the CRL for each SM and the corresponding distribution overhead can be reduced significantly. Simulation results have shown that our approach can maintain a balance between the size of the CRL and the number of signatures generated by CAs while guaranteeing security of the communications.	algorithm;bottom-up parsing;certificate authority;computation;file spanning;key management;minimum spanning tree;nan;overhead (computing);pkc (conference);public-key cryptography;recursion;simulation;smart meter;suicidegirls;top-down and bottom-up design;tree (data structure);type signature;xslt/muenchian grouping	Kemal Akkaya;Khaled Rabieh;Mohamed M.

This paradigm is motivated by certain scenarios where historical or digest data (e.g., average temperature in a day), instead of real-time data, are of interest. The data are not instantly forwarded to a central sink upon sensing, thereby saving communication energy for transmission. Such a paradigm can also improve data survivability by making use of distributed data storage in cheap flash memory on nodes. However, the security and dependability of such data storage are critical for the future data accessibility in UWSNs. To address this issue, we propose a secure and dependable distributed storage scheme for UWSNs. Our scheme takes advantages of both secret sharing and Reed-Solomon code, which can achieve computational security and maintain low communication overhead in terms of shortened data dispersing size. We also propose a general coding method to publicly verify data integrity in a distributed manner, with low communication and storage overhead, and without the need of holding original data. The extensive analysis justifies that our scheme can provide secure, dependable and publicly verifiable distributed data storage in UWSNs even in the presence of node compromise and Byzantine failure.	accessibility;authorization;byzantine fault tolerance;clustered file system;computation;computational hardness assumption;computer data storage;cryptographic hash function;data integrity;dependability;flash memory;formal verification;linear code;linkage (software);overhead (computing);programming paradigm;real-time data;reed–solomon error correction;secret sharing;semantic security;sensor;verification and validation	Wei Ren;Yi Ren;Hui Zhang	2010	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-010-0096-7	wireless sensor network;distributed data store;telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-50.380912715650666	76.09104221367056	188460

Thus, an adversary may reprogram them with malicious code to launch various insider attacks. Based on verifying the genuineness of the running program, we propose two distributed software-based attestation schemes that are well tailored for sensor networks. These schemes are based on a pseudorandom noise generation mechanism and a lightweight block-based pseudorandom memory traversal algorithm. Each node is loaded with pseudorandom noise in its empty program memory before deployment, and later on multiple neighbors of a suspicious node collaborate to verify the integrity of the code running on this node in a distributed manner. Our analysis and simulation show that these schemes achieve high detection rate even when multiple compromised neighbors collude in an attestation process.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;authentication;block cipher;distributed computing;malware;pseudorandom noise;pseudorandomness;read-only memory;sensor;simulation;software deployment;tamper resistance	Yi Yang;Xinran Wang;Sencun Zhu;Guohong Cao	2007	2007 26th IEEE International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS 2007)	10.1109/SRDS.2007.31	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Arch	-50.92959883313018	77.15379431306006	188651

To query of the network to get useful information from anywhere and anytime, we need to integrate the WSN into the Internet as part of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this case, it is an important task to design an access control scheme that can authorize, authenticate and revoke a user to access the WSN. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous signcryption scheme to control the access behavior of the users. We give the formal security proof of our scheme in the random oracle model. An important characteristic of our scheme is to allow a user in a certificateless cryptography (CLC) environment to send a message to a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography (IBC) environment. We give an access control scheme for the WSN in the context of the IoT using the proposed signcryption scheme. As compared with existing two access control schemes using signcryption, the computational cost of sensors in our scheme is reduced by about 22% and 53%, respectively and the energy consumption of sensors in our scheme is reduced by about 33% and 54%, respectively.	access control;algorithmic efficiency;anytime algorithm;authentication;cma-es;certificateless cryptography;chinese library classification;ciphertext indistinguishability;computational diffie–hellman assumption;id-based cryptography;information-based complexity;internet of things;provable security;random oracle;sensor node;signcryption	Fagen Li;Yanan Han;Chunhua Jin	2016	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2016.03.007	computer science;information security;signcryption;internet privacy;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Security	-50.02887384672586	75.4549698685543	189440

To be resistant against the various attacks, nodes in a sensor network can establish pairwise secret keys, authenticate all communications with cryptographic functions, and also apply secure information aggregation schemes or hop-by-hop filtering methods. However, these security measures can take considerable overhead in terms of storage, communication and computation, which are scarce resources in sensor nodes. Previously proposed security measures can only resist against a limited number of compromised nodes, which we define as the resistance level. In this paper, we propose a separate solution to any security measure. This technique either significantly reduces the overhead, or increases the resistance level without increasing overhead. The solution is based on a new """"mixed multi-channel"""" (MMC) architecture. In this design, each node can only use one fixed channel. The whole network is thus divided into multiple """"planes"""" by the different planes. Exploiting the characteristics of multi-channel communication, a series of methods are proposed, such as MMC-1, MMC-k and MMC-r. We then present designs to integrate the methods with current security measures, and analyze their resistance level and energy conservation."""	authentication;computation;cryptography;data security;hop-by-hop transport;mmc-1;memory management controller;overhead (computing)	Chao Gui;Ashima Gupta;Prasant Mohapatra	2006	2006 3rd International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems	10.1109/BROADNETS.2006.4374384	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;information security;computer security;computer network	EDA	-50.60209197501655	77.14627794071427	189549

However, the inclusion of multiple heterogeneous sources in situational analyses leads to 2 main issues: (1) a source could deliver (voluntarily or erroneously) wrong data damaging the integrity and the correctness of the analysis, and (2) a significant amount of heterogeneous data need to be processed. As a consequence, the crisis management operator faces a large amount of potentially unreliable data. In this paper, we present a relevance labelling strategy to process information gathered from heterogeneous data streams to select the most relevant events. These are presented to the crisis management operator with the highest priority. Our strategy is evaluated using events collected by the Secure! crisis management system, considering 3 real crisis scenarios happened in Italy in 2015. Results show that our strategy is able to correctly identify sets of relevant events, supporting the activities of the crisis management operator.

db305d6660b314c4b7c7ba87c4d9ac7c2385ee06	muqami: a locally distributed key management scheme for clustered sensor networks		In many of the sensor network applications like natural habitat monitoring and international border monitoring, sensor networks are deployed in areas, where there is a high possibility of node capture and network level attacks. Specifically in such applications, the sensor nodes are severely limited in resources. We propose MUQAMI, a locally distributed key management scheme for resilience against the node capture in wireless sensor networks. Our scheme is efficient both in case of keying, re-keying and node compromise. Beauty of our scheme is that it requires minimal message transmission outside the cluster. We base our Scheme on Exclusion Basis System (EBS).	habitat;key (cryptography);key management	Syed Muhammad Khaliq-ur-Rahman Raazi;Adil Mehmood Khan;Faraz Idris Khan;Sungyoung Lee;Young Jae Song;Young-Koo Lee	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-73655-6_22	distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	-50.04288438321133	77.16521866018235	191268

Among public key techniques, the identity-based ones are very attractive for mobile environment, mainly due to their simple key management process and reduced memory storage cost. However, no proposed identity-based key management solution found in the literature is complete. Current solutions either do not consider the main requisites of these networks, as the absence of central administration or self-organization, or do not detail with important operations, such as key revocation or key update. Thus, this paper presents iFUSO, a complete and fully self-organized identity-based key management scheme for mobile ad hoc networks. iFUSO does not depend on any central authority or third trusted party, even during the network formation. Also, iFUSO provides mechanisms to revoke the private key of malicious or compromised nodes and ways to update the keys of non-compromised nodes. Simulation results show that iFUSO is effective while it does not impose a high communication overhead to the system.	centralized computing;hoc (programming language);information-based complexity;key management;malware;network formation;overhead (computing);public-key cryptography;self-organization;simulation;trust management (information system)	Eduardo da Silva;Luiz Carlos Pessoa Albini	2013	2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2013.6673435	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;information security;ad hoc wireless distribution service;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.73932853734803	76.7152806671255	191937

The cellular connection is used for receiving services (i.e. Internet access) from the base station, while the ad-hoc links are used to improve the quality of the connection. We provide detailed descriptions of several attacks that arbitrarily powerful adversaries, whether outsiders or insiders, can mount against well-behaved members of the network. We introduce a secure routing protocol called JANUS, that focuses on the establishment of secure routes between the base station and mobile devices, and the secure routing of the data. We show that our protocol is secure against the attacks described and experimentally compare the message overhead introduced by JANUS and UCAN.	experiment;hoc (programming language);internet access;mobile device;overhead (computing);routing	Bogdan Carbunar;Ioannis Ioannidis;Cristina Nita-Rotaru	2004		10.1145/1023646.1023649	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;internet access;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;information security;base station;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;wireless network;mobile device;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Security	-49.98193482667515	78.95846264721044	192800

LEACH is a cluster-based protocol for micro sensor networks which achieves energy-efficient, scalable routing and fair media access for sensor nodes. However, the election of a malicious or compromised sensor node as the cluster head is one the most significant breaches in cluster-based wireless sensor networks. We propose a deterministic key management scheme, called DKS-LEACH, to secure LEACH protocol against malicious attacks. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we design and performed a theoretical evaluation of our security model which secures the setup and study phases of LEACH protocol. Secondly, using the TOSSIM simulator, we performed an evaluation of the power consumption of DKS-LEACH. The results indicate clear advantages of our approach in preventing the election of untrustworthy cluster head as well different kind of attacks from malicious sensor nodes.	computer cluster;key management;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;overhead (computing);routing;scalability;sensor node;tinyos	Mandicou Ba;Ibrahima Niang;Bamba Gueye;Thomas Noël	2010	2010 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/EUC.2010.70	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science;information security;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-52.40433564890384	76.35312043607297	193408

In sensor networks, adversaries can inject false data reports containing bogus sensor readings or nonexistent events from compromised nodes. Such attacks may not only cause false alarms, but also drain out the limited energy of sensor nodes. Several existing schemes for filtering false reports either cannot deal with dynamic topology of sensor networks or have limited filtering capacity. In our scheme, a legitimate report is endorsed by multiple sensing nodes using their own authentication keys generated from one-way hash chains. Cluster head uses Hill Climbing approach to disseminate the authentication keys of sensing nodes to the forwarding nodes along multiple paths toward the base station. Hill Climbing guarantees that the forwarding nodes closer to a cluster hold more authentication keys for the cluster than those nodes farther from it do, hence, the number of keys held by each forwarding node can be balanced. In filtering phase, each forwarding node validates the authenticity of the reports and drops those false ones. Compared to existing schemes, our scheme can better deal with dynamic topology of sensor networks. Analytical and simulation results show that our scheme drops false reports earlier even with a lower memory requirement and tolerates more compromised nodes. Our scheme also outperforms others in term of energy efficiency, especially for large sensor networks.	authentication;content-control software;cryptographic hash function;hill climbing;one-way function;simulation	Zhen Yu;Yong Guan	2005	Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1145/1098918.1098961	embedded system;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	-53.87050749990632	76.72991924396851	193685

In this paper, we present a subset coding based anonymization scheme that can safeguard users' location privacy with k-anonymity while preserving almost lossless data integrity at the destination server. Adversary threats to our scheme are comprehensively analyzed to develop robust strategies and analytical bounds on system parameters for location privacy risk mitigation.

In this paper, we propose a distributed key management approach by using the recently developed concepts of certificateless public key cryptography and threshold secret sharing schemes. Without any assumption of prefixed trust relationship between nodes, the ad hoc network works in a self-organizing way to provide the key generation and key management services using threshold secret sharing schemes, which effectively solves the problem of single point of failure. Certificateless public key cryptography is applied here not only to eliminate the need for certificates, but also to retain the desirable properties of identity-based key management approaches without the inherent key escrow problem.	centralized computing;certificate authority;formal verification;hoc (programming language);information leakage;information security;information theory;interactivity;key escrow;key generation;key management;lecture notes in computer science;organizing (structure);proactive parallel suite;programming paradigm;public-key cryptography;reliability engineering;self-organization;single point of failure;spectral leakage;springer (tank);symposium on foundations of computer science;threshold cryptosystem;trusted third party;verifiable secret sharing	Fagen Li;Masaaki Shirase;Tsuyoshi Takagi	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88140-7_11	shared secret;wireless ad hoc network;computer science;network security;internet privacy;pre-shared key;key distribution;computer security;id-based cryptography;computer network	Security	-48.79662592827805	77.10278908411993	194641

In order to provide the service, we use a new threshold scheme, that allows to share a secret key among the current group members. The novelty of the scheme is in that it easily and efficiently enables dynamic increase of the threshold, according to the needs of the group, so that the service provides both adaptiveness to the level of threat the ad hoc group is subject to, and availability. We prove the correctness of the protocol and evaluate its efficiency. The changes to the threshold are performed by using a protocol that is efficient in terms of interactions among nodes and per-node required resources, resulting suitable even for resourceconstrained settings. Finally, the same proposed scheme allows to detect nodes that attempt to disrupt the service, providing invalid contributions to the distributed signature service.	antivirus software;computation;correctness (computer science);cryptosystem;electronic signature;hoc (programming language);interaction;key (cryptography);overhead (computing);rsa (cryptosystem);requirement;secret sharing	Roberto Di Pietro;Luigi V.

To ensure the report process, we present a reliable and privacy- preserving task recomposition (REPTAR) for multiple subtasks sensing in VFC. Modified homomorphic Paillier encryption and superincreasing sequence are employed for aggregating hybrid subtasks into one ciphertext. Reliability is verified by means and variances of each aggregated subtasks from different vehicular fog nodes.

However, the ZigBee nodes are normally resource-limited, making the network susceptible to a variety of security threats. This paper closely investigates a severe attack on ZigBee networks termed as ghost, which leverages the underlying vulnerabilities of the IEEE 802.15.4 security suites to deplete the energy of the nodes. We show that the impact of ghost is very large and that it can facilitate a variety of threats including denial of service and replay attacks. We highlight that merely deploying a standard suite of advanced security techniques does not necessarily guarantee improved security, but instead might be leveraged by adversaries to cause severe disruption in the network. We propose several recommendations on how to localize and withstand the ghost and other related attacks in ZigBee networks. Extensive simulations are provided to show the impact of the ghost and the performance of the proposed recommendations. Moreover, physical experiments also have been conducted and the observations confirm the severity of the impact by the ghost attack. We believe that the presented work will aid the researchers to improve the security of ZigBee further.	computation;denial-of-service attack;depletion region;experiment;ghost;internet of things;replay attack;simulation	Xianghui Cao;Devu Manikantan Shila;Yu Cheng;Zequ Yang;Yang Zhou;Jiming Chen	2016	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2016.2516102	communications protocol;neurfon;human–computer interaction;computer science;information security;wireless network;security service;internet privacy;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Security	-53.06372613553539	74.77765792146593	194956

However, the conventional secure localization algorithms used in wireless sensor networks cannot deal with internal attacks and cannot identify malicious nodes. In this paper, a localization based on trust valuation, which can overcome a various attack types, such as spoofing attacks and Sybil attacks, is presented. The trust valuation is obtained via selection of the property set, which includes estimated distance, localization performance, position information of beacon nodes, and transmission time, and discussion of the threshold in the property set. In addition, the robustness of the proposedmodel is verified by analysis of attack intensity, localization error, and trust relationship for three typical scenes.The experimental results have shown that the proposed model is superior to the traditional secure localization models in terms of malicious nodes identification and performance improvement.

Since it is required to share the common key between nodes in advance to the communication, a key establishment scheme should be considered. Chan and Perring proposed a novel key establishment scheme PIKE (Peer Intermediaries for Key Establishment in Sensor Networks) in which each common key used in each communication between nodes is derived from a pre-shared key, and all common keys are different from each other. In addition, each node is required to have small number of pre-shared keys. However, the number of pre-shared key grows as the number of nodes in the network grows, and more importantly, PIKE has a problem that when the network is established, it is hard to add new nodes into the network, since storing new pre-shared keys in existing nodes is required. This paper proposes a new key establishment scheme SPIKE (Scalable Peer Intermediaries for Key Establishment in Sensor Networks), in which all nodes in the network are required to have a constant number of pre-shared keys. The proposed scheme allows the network to add new nodes after the network has been established.	cryptography;key exchange;pike;pre-shared key;secure communication;symmetric-key algorithm	Yumi Sakemi;Masahiko Takenaka;Tetsuya Izu	2015	2015 18th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems	10.1109/NBiS.2015.94	computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;key space;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-50.14532308734219	76.97241166372218	195919

SATS uses credits (or micropayment) to stimulate the nodes' cooperation in relaying other nodes' messages and to enforce fairness. SATS also makes use of a trust system to assign a trust value for each node. A node's trust value is high when the node actively forwards others' messages. The highly trusted nodes are preferable in data forwarding to avoid the Black-Hole attackers that drop messages intentionally to degrade the message delivery rate. In this way, SATS can stimulate the nodes' cooperation not only to earn credits but also to maintain high trust values to increase their chances to participate in future data forwarding. Our security evaluation demonstrates that SATS can secure the payment and trust calculation.

However, owing to the resource constraints of wireless sensor nodes (i.e., their limited power and spectral diversity), ensuring a timely and jamming-resistant delivery of alarm messages in applications that rely on wireless sensor networks is a challenging task. With current alarm forwarding schemes, blocking of an alarm by jamming is straightforward and jamming is very likely to remain unnoticed. In this work, we propose a novel jamming detection scheme as a solution to this problem. Our scheme is able to identify the cause of bit errors for individual packets by looking at the received signal strength during the reception of these bits and is well-suited for the protection of reactive alarm systems with very low network traffic. We present three different techniques for the identification of bit errors based on: predetermined knowledge, error correcting codes, and limited node wiring. We perform a detailed evaluation of the proposed solution and validate our findings experimentally with Chipcon CC1000 radios. The results show that our solution effectively detects sophisticated jamming attacks that cannot be detected with existing techniques and enables the formation of robust sensor networks for dependable delivery of alarm notifications. Our scheme also meets the high demands on the energy efficiency of reactive surveillance applications as it can operate without introducing additional wireless network traffic.	algorithm;blocking (computing);code;error detection and correction;experiment;floor and ceiling functions;low-power broadcasting;network packet;radio jamming;sensor;simulation;threat (computer);wiring	Mario Strasser;Boris Danev;Srdjan Capkun	2010	TOSN	10.1145/1824766.1824772	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.14745782030913	75.01175235988293	198380

The increase observed in the number of people with PDAs and other handset devices equipped with wireless technologies makes the forwarding paradigm and Oppnets scenarios more interesting and challenging. The main challenge in Oppnets is to take efficient routing decisions on securing the delivery of messages to the destination. Cooperation and trust between nodes in the network saves them from malicious attacks. The trust of a node is a basic value that symbolizes the magnitude of its social responsibility in the network, which include helping groups of nodes in message delivery, saving these nodes from malicious attacks, just to name a few. This paper focuses on blackhole attack against the PRoPHET routing protocol for Oppnets. A Trust-based Security Protocol (TSP) is proposed to secure Oppnets against blackhole attacks. Simulation results are provided to support the effectiveness of our proposed TSP approach, in the sense that considerable control is observed in the number of dropped packets, number of messages captured bythe malicious nodes (so-called malicious count) and overhead ratio.	blackhole exploit kit;cryptographic protocol;malware;message passing;overhead (computing);packet drop attack;personal digital assistant;programming paradigm;routing;simulation	Sahil Gupta;Sanjay Kumar Dhurandher;Isaac Woungang;Arun Kumar;Mohammad S.

Incentive mechanisms in the form of reputation or credit rewards have been proposed to stimulate nodes to cooperate. Complementing each other, a hybrid of the two types of schemes has been proposed to improve efficiency in mitigating selfishness, at the cost of high communication overhead. This paper proposes an alternative to reputation level incentive named Recharge-As-Reward (RAR) mechanism, as an explicit reward to strengthen motivation for nodes to cooperate. RAR is also combined with a Credit-As-Reward (CAR) mechanism that is based on centralized credit-based architecture, which makes our scheme a hybrid incentive mechanism. Through a comparison with another hybrid scheme, we show that RAR/CAR is able to increase nodes' forwarding rates while reducing message/communication overhead by being less reliant on a central agent.	centralized computing;hoc (programming language);online and offline;overhead (computing);rechargeable battery;trusted third party;wireless mesh network	Normalia Samian;Winston Khoon Guan Seah;Zuriati Zukarnain;Azizol Abdullah;Zurina Mohd Hanapi	2016	2016 IEEE 41st Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2016.86	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;particle detector;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-53.02597769315584	78.35558700133203	198742
949044f46f53e071836f7d5d63e8ed82196745b1	a dynamic fake source algorithm for source location privacy in wireless sensor networks		Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are commonly used in asset monitoring applications, where it is often desirable for the location of the asset being monitored to be kept private. The source location privacy (SLP) problem involves protecting the location of a WSN source node from an attacker who is attempting to locate it. Among the most promising approaches to the SLP problem is the use of fake sources, with much existing research demonstrating their efficacy. Despite the effectiveness of the approach, the most effective algorithms providing SLP require network and situational knowledge that makes their deployment impractical in many contexts. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic fake sources-based algorithm for SLP. We show that the algorithm provides state-of-the-art levels of location privacy under practical operational assumptions.	algorithm;privacy;software deployment;superword level parallelism	Matthew Bradbury;Matthew Leeke;Arshad Jhumka	2015	2015 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA	10.1109/Trustcom.2015.416	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-52.568721027286735	75.38141107423375	198930

Many times they do it without any consciousness of the security performance trade-off arisen by this operation.In this paper we present a method for performance evaluation of a modular security architecture for WSNs. Our method evaluates the costs that have to be paid when introducing security, in terms of memory occupancy, network performance and energy consumption. Knowing these indexes leads to awareness of security costs and helps in fine tuning of security performance trade-offs. A designer may apply our method to know the impact on performance of the security modules he needs. Also, we present performance data collected by applying our method on the implementation of PLASA, a modular security architecture we have designed and evaluated.	computer security;consciousness;fips 140-2;memory footprint;network performance;overhead (computing);performance evaluation	Roberta Daidone;Gianluca Dini	2014	2014 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912566	software security assurance;computer security model;cloud computing security;embedded system;security information and event management;security association;performance;computer science;information security;logical security;security service;distributed system security architecture;network access control;computer security;computer network	Security	-52.144104880763386	74.64134309578205	199819
