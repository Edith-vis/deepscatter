476c8651f735aa2a32f68e4ce40451bc0f6ef42f	enacting archetypes in movies: grounding the unconscious mind in emotion-driven media	archetypes;psychological approach;emotion;article;enactive media;movie	The concept of emotion-driven media integrates affective computing into developing new types of digital media by including the human spectator as an essential part of the whole system. Enactive media, as a landmark in this direction, provides a theoretical basis that is rooted in the enactivist approach in cognitive science. Based on this thesis, it is required to establish a practical procedure for developing the media content through integrating psychological approaches. We demonstrate a systematic approach for developing the content for emotion-driven media. The theory of archetypes, one of the psychoanalytical approaches, was applied for editing movie clips as the media content, and coupled the content with emotional responses by using experimental psychological methodologies. The results showed that it is promising to utilise archetypal movie clips as the content of emotion-driven media and archetypal symbolism can be a useful resource for developing the content of media systems.	affective computing;archive;baudot code;cognitive science;digital media;emotion recognition;enactivism;experience;futures studies;mind;nl (complexity);olga (technology);predictive modelling;programming paradigm;three utilities problem;video clip	Huang-Ming Chang;Leonid Ivonin;Marta Díaz;Andreu Català;Wei Chen;Matthias Rauterberg	2015	Digital Creativity	10.1080/14626268.2014.939985	emotion;epistemology;artificial intelligence;multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-53.07594453324302	-31.904882620896867	42896

The research project described within this paper aims to analyze and explore design guidelines for diverse audiences and results of focus group gaming sessions to develop a research toolbox allowing for the easy creation of adaptable and accessible game scenarios. Thereby, a controllable environment for the detailed evaluation of the interrelations between human factors and entertainment systems is provided. Results obtained by further testing will be integrated in the toolbox, and may foster the development of accessible games, thus opening up new opportunities for diverse audiences and allowing them to further engage in digital games.	focus group;human factors and ergonomics	Kathrin Maria Gerling	2011		10.1145/2159365.2159400	user experience design;simulation;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;accessibility;game mechanics;focus group;multimedia	HCI	-56.32526045725687	-37.45328186478955	43418
9bbd355beeffe04405da0e9d0d0abea43b03e7d0	smart airplane seat assignment system for passengers' multimedia preferences		As an advanced transportation mode of people's traveling, air transport meets many passengers' spiritual pursuits and decreases their time management costs. In long-range flights, passengers who have similar interests can set up social circles to make the journey more enjoyable. However, it is a challenge to predict passengers that may have good opinions towards each other and assign neighboring seats for them intelligently. Normally, the analysis that is targeting at passengers' personal information and social networking data may be one-sided to some extent. From the perspective of airliners, the work station gathers and analyzes the contents and operating habits of passengers on multimedia devices in cabins, sets up a model for passenger's individuality and hobbies, and discusses the possibility of assigning seats intelligently through such information. Preliminary research results show that the hypothesis has a solid foundation.	artificial intelligence;chat room;personally identifiable information	Jing Qiu;Chih-Fu Wu;Aihua Wu;Ling Liu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)	10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2017.7947046	simulation;airplane;time management;multimedia;personally identifiable information;social network;computer security;business	Robotics	-59.02833578030669	-29.013381749243035	43729

However, detailed studies of the processes and needs of these creative coders are currently lacking. This paper reports on the preliminary findings of a study into the practices of both novice and expert creative coders by analysing their approach to a creative design task in an observational, qualitative study. The findings have been placed into a taxonomy of needs, which can feed into the design of tools that aim to assist creative coders. The paper concludes by discussing the implications the taxonomy of needs has on defining requirements for a creativity support tool in the Processing environment.	creative coding;programmer;programming paradigm;requirement;taxonomy (general)	Mark C.

5aef61062c0b31341e337792bd84188bb0884be8	can plans and situated actions be replicated?	replication;qualitative methods	This paper discusses a repetition of a study presented in Suchman's book Plans and Situated Actions. There have been complaints about the lack of replication studies in disciplines related to CSCW (particularly Software Engineering and HCI). However, these complaints often become embedded in wider attempts to install a principled scientific method within these disciplines. Plans and Situated Actions was not a scientific text but drew upon naturalistic analysis. This paper shows there is value in recreating Plans and Situated Actions, and argues it would be helpful to recreate other studies. However, such repetition does not and need not constitute a scientific replication. The paper argues that while repetition and reanalysis may improve rigour in computing research, this need not be with a view to making it more scientific.	computer-supported cooperative work;embedded system;human–computer interaction;meteorological reanalysis;plan;situated;software engineering	John Rooksby	2014		10.1145/2531602.2531627	psychology;replication;social science;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;qualitative research;artificial intelligence;sociology;communication;management;social psychology;world wide web	AI	-62.120772025812464	-31.323958613778295	43889

Our approach emphasises the role of taking photographs as an act of constructing realities. This is typically in contrast to the documentary role of photography aiming to capture the realities as they are. Our approach involves the process of taking photographs as a means of ideation. We describe various aspects of constructing realities through photography and demonstrate the use of performative photographs as inspirational resources for design and research ideas.	image	A.

Recently introduced approaches applied task models further to model the cooperative behavior of people using devices within a smart environment. We describe a method of model-based usability evaluation to evaluate interactive systems, with a particular focus on smart environments, which are developed based on task models. We consider the evaluation in early development stages to interactively walk through the models and in later stages to execute a test case within a real environment. The paper provides results of a prototypical implementation.	device independence;human–computer interaction;interactivity;laptop;mobile phone;model-driven engineering;plover;smart environment;software release life cycle;test case;tracing (software);usability;usability testing	Stefan Propp;Gregor Buchholz;Peter Forbrig	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-85992-5_3	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;usability engineering;task analysis;multimedia;smart environment;heuristic evaluation;model-based design;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-51.979232236344345	-37.20396846762463	44152

The aesthetic and tactile qualities produced by these methods at their best,have never been surpassed. Woodburytype is the only photomechanical print process using a printing matrix and ink, that iscapable of rendering true continuous tone; it also has the characteristic of rendering a photographic image by mapping athree-dimensional surface topography. Collotypes absence of an underlying dot structure enables an image to be printed inas many colours as desired without creating any form of interference structure. Research at the Centre for Fine PrintResearch, UWE Bristol aims to recreate these processes for artists and photographers and assess their potential to create adigitally generated image printed in full colour and continuous tone that will not fade or deteriorate. Through this researchthe Centre seeks to provide a context in which the development of current four-colour CMYK printing may be viewed as anexpedient rather than a logical route for the development of colour printing within the framework of digitally generated hardcopy paper output.Keywords: collotype, Woodburytype, continuous Tone, archival, multiple colour printing .	printing;relevance	Stephen Hoskins;Paul Thirkell	2003		10.1117/12.475434	visual arts;computer vision;engineering;digital printing;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-50.35484935033607	-27.437690754852895	44226

The inherent freedom of movement proper to VR - an indisputable element of immersion - collides with the Aristotelian vision of articulated plot events with respect to the given timeline associated with the story in display. This narrative paradox can only be observed in interactive VR applications and it doesn't seem possible to resolve it through the use of existing narrative theories.

In addition to standard photography and more and more interesting kind of photos are used panoramic pictures. Completely new use of such images is to use them for panoramic visualization of the structure of materials - high resolution allows an insight into macro and microstructure of the material surface. The use of panoramic visualization of the surface of metallic materials for macroscopic and microscopic analysis of the structure of materials is a tool of immense possibilities that successfully is widely used in structural studies of materials in various fields of science.

Thus a new Mobile Computing paradigm is required. A functional definition is a system that can be used at any time and anywhere  and does not in any way disturb the user’s interaction with the real world.        Key properties required to achieve this are        (1)   non- disruptive user interfaces characterised by a low cognitive load,      (2)   hands-free operation,      (3)   an unobtrusive form factor,      (4)   the ability to model, recognise and act upon events in the environment (context sensitivity), and      (5)   seamless, ubiquitous connectivity.            On a certain high level the above requirements are fairly obvious. From the application point of view it is equally obvious  that today no system really fulfils them. What is less obvious is how the above functional definition translates into a technical  specification and how the development towards fulfilling such specification should best proceed in the near future.        In the technical and scientific community there is a heated debate about what constitutes such systems with visions ranging  from building upon commercially available ‘PC on a belt’ and PDA solutions to integrate concepts of transistor level integration  of electronics into textiles.        The talk will describe in detail the new requirements for user interfaces and the state of context detection. The architecture  of Mobile and Wearable Computing systems, the middleware and applications in domains like healthcare, production, maintenance  will be outlined in some detail based on the experience of the authors from different research projects on the national and  European level.

Over the past years, a continuously growing communi ty of researchers and practitioners made the idea of using the potential of computer games for serious, primarily educational purposes equally pop ular. However, the present hype over serious games is not reflected in sound e vidence for the effectiveness and efficiency of such games and also indicators fo r the quality of learner-game interaction is lacking. In this paper we look into those questions, investigating a geography learning game prototype. A strong focus o f the investigation was on relating the assessed variables with gaze data, in particular gaze paths and interaction strategies in specific game situations. The results show that there a distinct gender differences in the interaction styl e with different game elements, depending on the demands on spatial abilities (navi gating in the threedimensional spaces versus controlling rather two-di mensional features of the game) as well as distinct differences between high and low performers..	eye tracking;map;pc game;pop-up ad;prototype	Michael D.

The intensive use of informatics by Cartography has allowed an interaction of cartography forms with different multimedia resources, such as texts, graphics, sound, videos and animation that make them more dynamic and interactive. Those new ways of representation and communication of spatial information have been named Multimedia Cartography. School cartography, i.e. the one studied, learned and produced in the scope of regular education, has had to live along with a multimedia cartography education that is produced and spread out of the school walls. We understand that reading Multimedia Cartography from the Cartography for children and scholars can reveal more humanistic and ordered aspects of these relations, as for example, the idea that linearity and hierarchy that dominate printed maps happen under multiple connections and interpretations when produced in flowing networks (less fixed) of spatial representations. This way, our research has a qualitative approach working with a theoretical-methodological referential in Geography. It aims at analyzing in which aspects interactivity allowed by cartography multimedia projects can lead to other readings about the space that is represented by cartography forms supported by discrete available media. It is, therefore, a theoretical-conceptual research where there is no intention to modify the concepts once discussed into methodological proposals for school use. Firstly we introduce concepts such as media, multimedia, interactivity, hipertext, hipermedia, besides Multimedia Cartography, cartographic visualization, electronic atlas, hipermap, interactive map, animated map, these ones aligned to their ways of structure and distribution. We then organize a synthesis table and define three analytical categories: Interactivity of Animation, Interactivity of Selection, and Interactivity of Recreation. Each of them have two different levels of interactivity, with general and specific characteristics that are used for the analysis of three institutional projects of Multimedia Cartography, presented in the second part of this study, that are: a) one of local scope scale known as Armazenzinho; b) the second one has national scope, known as IBGE Teen; c) the third one is of international scope, known as Google Earth. Cartography multimedia projects lead to other ways to see and read the world, as they transform relations with space in real time, helped by animation, selection, and recreation possibilities and, therefore, of social interaction with cartography forms. The cartography language supported by interactive multimedia makes possible another way to communicate space information transforming into signs the inter-agent subjective relations, this way re-signifying his/her world understanding. This way, this new cartography language modifies the way people think and learn, and how they communicate and understand the world as well.	emergence;emoticon;geographic information system;geovisualization;google earth;graphics;informatics;interactivity;local variable;map;multimedia cartography;printing	Suely Aparecida Gomes Moreira	2010			psychology;geography;cartography	HCI	-59.61753662951741	-31.60187811984682	45366
2ce82d8036d5ec1831c4ea42fea811ead4e4a2af	eliciting emotions in design of games - a theory driven approach		As technology becomes more powerful, computer software and game designers have ever-expanding tools available to create immersive, emotional experiences. Until recently, designing emotional experiences was achieved by veteran designers relying on insights from film theory and intuitions developed through years of practice. We propose another approach: leveraging scientific knowledge of emotions to guide the design process. The approach can serve as a resource for fledgling designers trying to break into the field, but will hopefully provide a few new insights for veterans as well. In addition, it may interest emotion researchers and psychologists looking to expand their stimulus repertoire. As a necessary underpinning for the design process, we will discuss several theoretical psychological models of emotions. Classical theories largely treat emotions as basic, universal states that are invariantly evoked by specific stimuli. While intuitive and popular, these theories are not well supported by current evidence. In contrast, a psychological constructionist theory, called the Conceptual Act Theory [6] proposes that emotions are constructed when conceptual knowledge is applied to ever changing affective experiences. The CAT proposes that emotional states can exhibit strong variation across instances and individuals due to differences in situational factors, learning histories and cultural backgrounds. This theory better fits available data, and also provides a framework for modeling emotional changes that vary by situation, person, and culture. The CAT also fits better with the game design process, since it treats users holistically as individuals. During the course of a game, similar to real life, emotions emerge from evaluations of situations and can therefore not be deterministically dictated by a single stimulus. Using the CAT framework, we developed a process to create affective digital game scenarios. Our goal is to give game designers, a scientific framework to better guide the design process.

The specific semantic content of these debugging communications matters because, if the users are not actually seeking the information the system is providing, they are not likely to attend to it. This paper reports a formative empirical study that sheds light on what end users actually want to know in the course of debugging a spreadsheet, given the availability of a set of interactive visual testing and debugging features. Our results provide in sights into end-user debuggers' information gaps, and further suggest opportunities to improve end-user debugging systems' support for the things end-user debuggers actually want to know.	debugger;debugging;programmer;software bug;spreadsheet	Cory Kissinger;Margaret M.

These transformations of our lifestyle demand both a new architecture and interaction modalities that support the new as well as old ways of communicating and living.#R##N##R##N#As a consequence of the prevalent role of information in today’s society, architecture is presently at a turning point. Screens are everywhere, from the billboards which dot the contemporary urban cityscape, to the video walls which welcome us in the entry-halls of corporate headquarter buildings, to our desktop computer monitor at home, the PDA in our pocket, or the tiny private-eye screens of wearable computers. Wearable computers are starting to transform our technological landscape by reshaping the heavy, bulky desktop computer into a lightweight, portable device that’s accessible to people at any time. Computation and sensing are moving from computers and devices into the environment itself. The space around us is instrumented with sensors and displays, and this tends to reflect a widespead need to blend together the information space with our physical space. """"Augmented reality"""" and """"mixed reality"""" are the terms most often used to refer to this type of media-enhanced interactive space. The combination of large public and miniature personal digital displays together with distributed computing and sensing intelligence offers unprecedented opportunities to merge the virtual and the real, the information landscape of the Internet with the urban landscape of the city, to transform digital animated media in public installations, in storytellers, also by means of personal wearable technology.#R##N##R##N#To meet the challenges of the new information- and technology-inspired architecture we need to think of the architectural space not simply as a container but as a living body endowed with sensors, actuators, and a brain (a mind), a space capable of assisting people in the course of their activities within such spaces.#R##N##R##N#On the basis of my work and research I will argue that intelligent architecture needs to be supported by three forms of intelligence: perceptual intelligence, which captures people’s presence and movement in the space in a natural and non-encumbering way; interpretive intelligence, which """"understands"""" people’s actions and is capable of making informed guesses about their behavior; and narrative intelligence, which presents us with information, articulated stories, images, and animations, in the right place, at the right time, all tailored to our needs and preferences.#R##N##R##N#This talk will describe and illustrate a series of models, technological platforms and installations the author developed originally at the MIT Media Lab (1994 to 2002) and later commercially for Sensing Places (2003 to 2005). They contribute to defining new trends in architecture that merge virtual and real spaces, and are currently in the process of reshaping the way we live and experience the museum, the home, the theater, and the modern city."""	spaces	Flavia Sparacino	2005		10.1007/11555261_2	augmented reality;simulation;wearable computer;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;mixed reality;multimedia	HCI	-56.99810092402761	-28.042569140757056	45713

These conversations occur in a mixture of mediums, including text, images, audio, and video, and channels, including Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and blogs, and range in scope from one-to-one exchanges to loosely-bounded meta-conversations that cross cultures and span the globe via remixing of shared meanings like memes.

cbdfd9da1f37e73dc54aa6540d9c4d84fadd9527	physics simulation r&d at square enix		In this talk, we share our R&D experiences in developing simulation systems for games. We have developed systems for cloth, hair, fur and grass simulations as well as their interactions with dynamically changing weather such as wind and rain. During R&D processes, we have encountered many interesting challenges. In recent years, there have been many simulation techniques with higher performance and better realism proposed in the CG community. However, we have found that directly integrating the techniques into games does not work with the unique requirements of games, e.g., artist-designed looks that defy physics and artistry controls of physics behaviors. Therefore, adaptations of the techniques are inevitable for each system. Moreover, differences between technical-minded people and artists are one of the biggest challenges in games development environments. In an ideal situation, R&D Engineers will implement many impressive features for a game engine, and then artists exercise their creativity and imagination to utilize the features and create interesting results. The reality, in fact, is that artists usually struggle with how to control the features. It does not matter how many parameters we provide for artists to control, but rather the way we let artists using the features largely influence the end results. This talk addresses the R&D processes of our simulation systems and what are the differences between R&D processes in academics and in games, and how we maximize the advantages of having creative professional artists in our team.	game engine;interaction;requirement;simulation	Witawat Rungjiratananon	2015		10.1145/2818419.2818426	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-54.58957851818127	-28.621845681829253	46273

However, recent work on vision-based algorithms raises the promise of rapid botanical species identification. The potential for mobile vision-based identification provides opportunities for new user interface techniques. To explore these issues, we present LeafView, a Tablet-PC-based user interface for an electronic field guide that supports automated identification of botanical species in the field. We describe a user interface design based on an ethnographic study of botanists, field tests of working prototypes by botanists at the Smithsonian Institution on Plummers Island, Maryland, and observations at an internal exhibition at the Smithsonian at which other staff members tried the prototypes. We present functionality specific to mobile identification and collection in the electronic field guide and use this to motivate discussion of mobile identification in general.	algorithm;automated species identification;field guide;interaction technique;tablet computer;user interface design	Sean White;Dominic Marino;Steven K.

Students develop a variety of skills in computational thinking by using the small set of images and operations to develop complex images, not only images that the system challenges them to make but also images that they find themselves inspired to create and even images that their peers challenge them to build. MIST also incorporates a community of artists/learners. Images created in MIST are available to other MIST users to comment on and remix (provided the designer permits reuse). MIST community members may also create challenges for other community members and can curate """"galleries"""" of images they find particularly engaging, interesting, or even useful as challenges for others.

As tablet devices continue to gain market share at the expense of the traditional PC, they become a more integral part of the corporate landscape. Tablets are no longer being utilized only by sales executives for presentation purposes, or as addition to the traditional laptop. Users are attempting to perform significant amounts of their daily work on tablet devices, some even abandoning the ubiquitous laptop or desktop entirely. Operating exclusively from a tablet device, specifically Apple IOS tablet devices creates unique challenges in a corporate environment traditionally dominated by Microsoft Windows operating systems. Interactions with file shares, presentation media, VPN, and remote access present barriers that users and helpdesk support are unfamiliar with in a relation to an iPad or iPhone.

Time spent waiting is time wasted and possibly even frustrating if the waiting process does not occur in comfortable conditions. Entertaining people present in such a situation would improve their quality of life and could make them have a more positive mindset towards the event they were queuing for. Our solution not only entertains queue participants but also allows them to experience a group dynamic with other people in the queue making them enjoy the company of their fellow queue members instead of wishing they were the only one there. Who would have thought queues could ever become enjoyable experiences instead of time consuming structures.	abandonware;apply;battle kid: fortress of peril;burst transmission;experience;game mechanics	Danilo Dumeljic;Dennis van Peer;Jonathan Raes;Olivier Dikken;Stephan Dumasy	2015		10.1145/2793107.2810271	simulation;engineering;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-61.17672962749098	-26.050610751030284	47897

Nevertheless we are on the cusp of a more encompassing revolution driven by new expectations of increasingly personal computing experiences. In this talk I will illustrate this nascent relationship between people and computation driven by the emergence of people as equally, and interchangeably, consumers and producers of the computing experience. Although buoyed by achievements in ubiquitous and pervasive computing technologies, this revolution is fundamentally about how a blossoming literacy in computing technologies empowers new forms of communication, reflection and decision making.	computation;emergence;mainframe computer;personal computer;ubiquitous computing	Elizabeth D.

e26fbc5eed8a736dcc70b50c648f7696b0535129	a serious game for public engagement in synthetic biology		Science gamification is an alternative way of science communication aimed to enhance public engagement in the dialog between scientists and broad audiences. This approach conveys information through an informal environment where individuals are more likely to engage in new knowledge areas. One of such new areas is synthetic biology, which aims to apply engineering principles to biology and create new biological parts or systems, or re-design existing biological systems for useful purposes. Biofaction developed the educational game SYNMOD, aimed to communicate basic scientific principles of synthetic biology, in an entertaining and engaging way. The game is based on the SYNMOD project, which aimes to design and produce novel antibiotic molecules. The aim of the game is to help memorize the names and 1-letter codes of 20 standard amino acids, provide additional information about amino acids, explain the modularity of lantibiotic synthesis, and stimulate further interest to synthetic biology among players.	biological system;code;download;gamification;knowledge acquisition;play store;science communication;speech synthesis;synthetic biology;synthetic intelligence;usability;dialog	Markus Schmidt;Olga Radchuk;Camillo Meinhart	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-05972-3_9	simulation;political science;multimedia	Comp.	-61.21616757179164	-33.866563026200815	48588
ba4bdcf3c7f21d3094b7a4c674ef4836480f4419	how inappropriately heavyweight ai solutions dragged down a startup (and made me realize that industrial salaries are high for a good reason)		The basic idea was to build distributed information systems, with intelligent nodes at each repository, able to reflect upon and reason about repository content in order to route queries appropriately. We came up with a heavyweight agent architecture, using ideas from AI planning and robotics. These sorts of architectures were very much in vogue at the time, and the company wanted its own, proprietary technology. We started thinking about programming languages for the agents and the kinds of knowledge representation and reasoning that would be required. We spent a lot of time and money flying from London to the U.S. West Coast, talking to patent lawyers. It transpired that the architecture, its decision-making and action models, were completely inappropriate for the problem at hand. By the time we realized we should have been focusing on basic software engineering, quality assurance, and end-user requirements, the company had burned out much of the goodwill—and most of the funds—of our investors. I jumped ship after less than a year, back to academic life (on a much reduced salary). The company folded about six months later, in the spring of 1998 (about the same time that Page and Brin were launching Google). The experience was traumatic, but I learned a great deal about software engineering, the real priorities of companies, and the kinds of things that do and do not make money.	agent architecture;automated planning and scheduling;information system;knowledge representation and reasoning;norm (social);programming language;requirement;robotics;social capital;software engineering;user requirements document	Michael Wooldridge	2008	AI Magazine		engineering ethics;engineering	AI	-62.81264052218668	-24.547161913115872	48594

To dissolve these problems, the designer’s emphasis should shift from creating beautiful products in appearance to beautiful interactions with products. Consequently, the designer needs new tools like gestural sketching. To develop a gestural design tool, we tested the suitability of gestures to capture expressive ideas and the capability of outsiders to recognise this expression. Scents were used to make this expression measurable. Twentytwo creators made four dynamic sculptures expressing these scents. Half of those sculptures were made through gesturing and half through traditional sketching. Subjects were asked to match the scents and the sculptures. Results show that there is no significant difference between sketching and gesturing. Dependent on the scent, an interpreter was able to capture the expression when looking at the gestures. These findings support the potential of a gestural design tool.	design tool;interaction;interpreter (computing);usability	Caroline Hummels;Kees C. J.

Human– computer interaction (HCI) research has a unique challenge in understanding the activities of professional music producers and in designing DAW user interfaces to support this work. Unlike many other user-interface design domains, in computermediated music production the user is principally engaged in the process of building and editing immensely complex digital representations (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983; Pope 1986; Dannenberg, Rubine, and Neuendorffer 1991; Dannenberg 1993). In this case, those representations model the intricate structure and synthesis parameters of the musical composition the producer is creating. Determining the right vocabulary of abstract representations to build into the user interface of DAWs is a difficult problem, and these design decisions have a critical impact on the activity of professional producers. The design of these abstraction mechanisms has been primarily informed by the historical origins of DAWs in multitrack tape recorders and mixing desks (Théberge 2004), which together we refer to as the “multitrack-mixing model.” Our research has identified many ways in which these user-interface metaphors (Barr 2003) from the past often do not support the activities of professional producers. The evolutionary reliance of DAWs on the multitrack-mixing model can be contrasted with more radical algorithmic approaches to composition and performance, such as those found in visual or Computer Music Journal, 34:4, pp. 22–33, Winter 2010 c © 2010 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. textual programmatic tools that are common in the experimental and avant-garde computer-music traditions. Because these tools have a different set of abstraction mechanisms and corresponding tradeoffs, their procedural rather than declarative nature (Dannenberg 1993) and their focus on “generative” music-making render them less well suited to the work of the participants in this study, and therefore outside the scope of this discussion. This article outlines findings from our detailed qualitative investigation (Duignan 2008) into the activity of computer-mediated music-making in the popular idiom, and the abstraction mechanisms that professional producers use to manage the complex digital representations of their compositions for studio work and live performance. We present a framework that articulates the key interactions and tensions between professional producers and the abstraction mechanisms provided by the tools on which they so heavily rely. This framework helps us understand and clearly identify issues that need to be resolved in the next generation of DAW user interfaces. Theoretical Perspective This research was conducted as a collective case study based on Creswell’s Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design (1998), and it exploits the emphasis of case-study inquiry on developing an in-depth analysis of a particular activity. We employed comprehensive semi-structured interviews of professional producers and conducted extended observations of them in the field. We focused on five participants for the in-depth case study, with twelve additional participants who added breadth of 22 Computer Music Journal Figure 1. Music production tools play a vital mediating role between users and their composition. perspective to better support meaningful triangulation and context for the issues that we discovered. We drew from two theoretical traditions with associated research tools in creating our semistructured interview protocol and in analyzing the findings: activity theory and cognitive dimensions of notations. Activity theory (Vygotskii 1978; Nardi 1996) provides us with a useful terminology, a framework for analysis, and a clear catalog of the important components of human activity (Kaptelinin, Nardi, and Macaulay 1999) that we used to develop an interview protocol (Duignan, Noble, and Biddle 2006). Cognitive dimensions of notations (Blackwell and Green 2003) provides a common vocabulary for describing recurring trade-offs in the conceptual models employed by notational systems. Cognitive dimensions have obvious relevance to our inquiry, having been applied to music typesetting and “live-coding” musical systems in the past (Blackwell and Green 2000; Blackwell and Collins 2005). The cognitive dimensions framework provided us with further content for our interview protocol (Blackwell and Green 2000) and a terminology and framework for analyzing the tensions between music production abstractions and the activity of producers.	ableton live;blackwell (series);cognitive dimensions of notations;cognitive science;computer music journal;computer science;digital audio workstation;human–computer interaction;interface metaphor;live coding;macaulay;pro tools;relevance;robert;semiconductor industry;triangulation (geometry);user interface design;victoria (3d figure);vocabulary	Matthew Duignan;James W Noble;Robert Biddle	2010	Computer Music Journal	10.1162/COMJ_a_00023	multimedia;cognitive dimensions of notations;research design;terminology;abstraction;computer music;musical composition;user interface;popular music;computer science	HCI	-60.52759261849944	-32.58006737648337	49185

The sound model described can be used as the basic design of environmental sounds in user interfaces. This paper describes the different components: physical modelling, interaction, context sensitivity, and metaphorical description. In the paper the term audio framework is ultimately used for the sound model presented. This paper first provides an overview of existing approaches for modelling environmental sounds, then presents the new audio framework, a comparison between real and model generated sounds and finally discusses potential applications.	software architecture;user (computing);user interface;virtual reality	Alireza Darvishi;Eugen Munteanu;Valentin Guggiana;Helmut Schauer;M.

One way to solve this problem is to attract new target groups such as young people. Therefore, some museums started to develop online museums where they digitally present their exhibition artifacts to a larger audience. One way to reach this goal are virtual environments. But how can potential visitors be motivated to visit the museum continuously and how can knowledge of the artwork be transferred? Gamification is one approach that could solve both problems. In this article the authors develop gamification approaches for a virtual museum guide based on different use cases.	book;coherence (physics);gamification;point of view (computer hardware company);vagueness;video game design;virtual reality;virtual world	Andreas Döpker;Tobias Brockmann;Stefan Stieglitz	2013			simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	Web+IR	-57.92348351749548	-34.93799964816119	49736

Some examples of the application of VR for SGs are complex training evacuation problems such as indoor earthquake evacuation or fire evacuation. The indoor 3D geometry of existing buildings can largely influence evacuees' behaviour, being instrumental in the design of VR SGs storylines and simulation scenarios. The VR scenarios of existing buildings can be generated from drawings and models. However, these data may not reflect the 'as-is' state of the indoor environment and may not be suitable to reflect dynamic changes of the system (e.g. Earthquakes), resulting in excessive development efforts to design credible and meaningful user experience.

Because my life and experiences feed into the feral screens, new meanings evolve over time through my continued interaction with those public spaces. This has really enriched and informed the research process, even if it hasn't always been comfortable. One screen was inspired by an underpass that made me feel unsafe. It is made from cardboard and resembles a bird box, a slightly arbitrary, very twee, design choice that then took on new meaning shortly after I photographed the screen: It became apparent that someone was sleeping rough in the underpass. This put the discomfort I felt into perspective; the design was also now uncomfortably reminiscent of the cardboard the sleeper was using to insulate himself from the wind and the cold. I probably wouldn't have made that connection if it wasn't somewhere I passed through every day. Describe what you made. Feral Screens is an ongoing research through design project that seeks to critically examine urban digital screens and to explore alternative ways of using digital technology to mediate public life. A feral animal is a domesticated species that lives in the wild, often on the margins of human populations. This metaphor of """" going feral """" is used as a way to open up an alternative design space to the typical corporate or civic narratives and aesthetics around digital technologies in public spaces. Briefly describe the process of how this was made. The design process for a screen is partially improvised each time but generally I start from a public space or behavior. From that initial inspiration, I make a feral screen typically in the form of a small display controlled by an Arduino in some kind of handmade case. I draw upon my own experiences to inform the work in dialogue with the material and social context of the city where I live. Once I have made a screen, I take it into public space and photograph it in situ. Using the screen, the documentation, and subsequent self-reflection as a prompt, I begin to imagine a social world that could evolve around the feral screen through creative and reflective writing.

We then present a study where we designed, installed and evaluated a user generated art installation through the lens of this framework.	computation;ecology;interaction	Anijo Mathew;Yvonne Rogers;Peter Lloyd	2011		10.1145/2069618.2069630	design;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-56.90085775413237	-37.76871091073422	50682

In recent years, many efforts in shape analysis have developed methods that extract high-level structural and semantic information from geometric shapes and scenes, especially involving man-made objects. One can argue that the ultimate goal of some of these works is to understand the functionality of the objects. Moreover, there have also been works that explicitly model and incorporate functionality into the processing of shapes and scenes. Thus, functionality has been receiving increasingly more attention in shape analysis and geometric modeling, either directly or indirectly, since functionality considerations can aid in applications such as semantic classification, shape editing and synthesis, as well as product design, development, and fabrication.  In this course, we discuss recent developments that incorporate functionality aspects into the analysis of 3D shapes and scenes, to provide a summary of the state-of-the-art in this area, including a discussion of key ideas and literature works. More specifically, we first discuss approaches that are precursors in this front, such as structure-aware and data-driven methods that learn relationships between shape parts or objects in scenes. Next, we cover works that more explicitly model the functionality of shapes and scenes, such as agent- and interaction-based methods. The course is structured in the form of talks given by four different speakers, aided by electronic slides that include notes for subsequent consultation.	geometric modeling;high- and low-level;human–computer interaction;ibm thinkpad 310;icon;information;laptop;raid;siggraph;semiconductor device fabrication;shape analysis (digital geometry);shape context;word lists by frequency	Ruizhen Hu;Oliver van Kaick;Youyi Zheng;Manolis Savva	2016		10.1145/2988458.2988469	computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;geometric modeling;shape analysis;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-49.47363195142035	-27.997400531224827	50932

A metaphor allows us to understand one concept in terms of another. Although considerable research has gone into the mobile technology, little attention has been paid to mobile interface metaphor, which is the key to user interaction. This paper explores the role of metaphor in interfaces in facilitating user interaction with mobile devices. It presents a classification of metaphors. It also proposes a framework with salient factors in relation to visual communication with metaphors. It also offers some thoughts on the use of new metaphors.

People engage in play individually, yet it is often social. This paper explores combining the personal with the social and the connections between playfulness on serious social media sites and seriousness when in a game world. Viewed from this angle, grief play, for instance, is not so much a form of deviant play behavior as it is an alternative way of framing the activity of playing, and Google bombs and edit warring can be recognized as the playful activities that they are.	frame language;framing (world wide web);google bomb;social media;virtual world	Jaakko Stenros	2010		10.1145/1920778.1920781	psychology;simulation;multimedia;communication	HCI	-57.85057390247016	-33.589728422799325	51233

Because interaction with sound may be task oriented or experience-based it is important to understand the nature of action-sound relationships in order to design rich sonic interactions. We propose a participatory approach to sonic interaction design that first considers the affordances of sounds in order to imagine embodied interaction, and based on this, generates interaction models for interaction designers wishing to work with sound. We describe a series of workshops, called Form Follows Sound, where participants ideate imagined sonic interactions, and then realize working interactive sound prototypes. We introduce the Sonic Incident technique, as a way to recall memorable sound experiences. We identified three interaction models for sonic interaction design: conducting; manipulating; substituting. These three interaction models offer interaction designers and developers a framework on which they can build richer sonic interactions.	action potential;computer display standard;database trigger;desktop computer;feedback;graphical user interface;information;interaction technique;mathematical model;scenario analysis;sonic interaction design	Baptiste Caramiaux;Alessandro Altavilla;Scott G.

We transfer dramaturgical reading into the field of user-centered design in order to understand, analyze and represent user-centered material. We compare a persona created with dramaturgical reading to a user profile and persona. We state that adapting a role character as an embodied and concrete user description in user-centered design improves the designers' ability to empathize and understand the users, thus improving the results of the design process. We believe personas must be enabled to """"come to life"""" and allowed to develop in the minds of the designers using them.

Scientific research from the domains of Auditory Display (AD) and Sonic Interaction Design (SID) can play a central role in this development, but in order to make its way to market oriented applications, several issues still need to be addressed. Building on the sound design process employed at the Sound Perception and Design (SPD) team at Ircam, and the information gathered from interviews with professional sound designers, this paper focuses on revealing typical issues encountered in the design process of both science and design oriented communities, in particular the development of a valid and revisable, yet innovative, design hypothesis. A second aim is to improve the communication between sound and interaction designers. In order to address these challenges, a conceptual framework, which has been developed using both scientific and designerly methods, was presented and evaluated using expert reviews.	auditory display;psychoacoustics;sonic interaction design	Daniel Hug;Nicolas Misdariis	2011		10.1145/2095667.2095671	sound design;simulation;scientific method;design process;human–computer interaction;sonic interaction design;computer science;artificial intelligence;interaction design;auditory display;conceptual design;conceptual framework;multimedia;design education	HCI	-61.46499850024244	-36.32754780263974	51645

2cecc34589f689e92dc56ac204d41bf95e0cbd85	making our environments intelligent	qa75 electronic computers computer science	This conference focuses on the theme of intelligent environments, in which smart homes, smart workplaces, and other spaces with which humans interact take on the role of intelligent agents. The conference aims at contributing to the realization of the ambient intelligence vision, where physical space becomes augmented with computation, communication and digital content, thus transcending the limits of direct human perception. Developments in the field of Intelligent Environments span the globe. As an indication of the widespread interest in the field, the IE conference hosted delegates from twenty-five countries around the world. In addition, papers showed the relevance of diverse fields including information and computer science, materials engineering, artificial intelligence, architecture , health care, sociology, design, networking, and intelligent agents, in both research labs and in industry. This issue of the Journal of Pervasive and Mobile Computing highlights the top work that was presented at the 2008 Intelligent Environments conference. We have selected six papers that offer breakthroughs in designing, interacting with, and making use of intelligent environments. In the first paper, titled Ambient intelligence platform using multi-agent system and mobile ubiquitous hardware, Wang et al. describe a middleware platform that offers new levels of flexibility for adding and redefining pervasive computing and intelligent enviornment components. Their platform, which is built on the JADE environment, facilitates fast integration of new and different control algorithms, device networks, and user interfaces , and has been evaluated for its real-time and offline control performance. In the second paper, Ontology-based modeling of dynamic ubiquitous computing applications as evolving activity spheres, Seremeti et al. introduce the notion of an activity sphere to model pervasive computing applications. In this approach , activity spheres are used to capture and store task information including the activity, its context, its agents, and its resources. State transitions for these tasks are modeled based on Discrete Event Systems and controlled using Supervisory Control Theory. Because much of the emphasis in the field of intelligent environments is on adapting the environment to its users, less attention has been given to personalizing the way in which collected information is displayed for the user. In the third paper , Designing an extensible architecture for personalized ambient information, Elsholz et al. abstract over interface modalities such as visual, auditory, and haptic information. They communicate information to a user in an ambient way by abstracting output facilities and ensure privacy by personalizing the way users are …	algorithm;ambient intelligence;artificial intelligence;computation;control theory;definition;digital recording;haptic technology;humans;information and computer science;intelligent agent;intelligent environment;interaction;jade;middleware;mobile computing;multi-agent system;online and offline;personalization;pervasive informatics;privacy;real-time clock;relevance;ubiquitous computing;user interface	Diane J.

This studio will allow exploring the design of tangible interaction with the IoT, what we call Internet of Tangibles. In particular, we aim at investigating the full interaction-attention continuum, with the purpose of designing IoT tangible interfaces that can switch between peripheral interactions that do not disrupt everyday routines, and focused interactions that support user's reflections. This investigation will be conducted through hands-on activities where participants will prototype tangible IoT objects, starting by a paper prototyping phase, supported by design cards, and followed by an Arduino prototype phase. The purpose of the studio is also establishing a community of researchers and practitioners, from both academy and industry, interested in the field of tangible interaction with the Internet of Things.

Nevertheless, off-the-shelf Computer Science books are not particularly tailored to children, who rather need their own language, which is based on fantasy, self-identification, analogy, play, and diverse other features which characterize their bubbling world. These are the main motivations for the introduction of a novel and more children-oriented approach to Computer Science.The manual in use at the University of Verona illustrates the hardware components of a PC. It is composed of eight Chapters. Under the child's point of view, the PC is a Realm where diverse Subjects coexist together. The Realm is lead by His Majesty whose name is Si Piuh. The Mother and the servants are necessary for Si Piuh to complete the job. In this work we'll examine some features of the first chapter where the principal hardware components are presented.The hardware components can be imagined as people who live in a Realm. All the people of the Realm are Goblins, each one devoted to a particular role.With a bit of fantasy, in a Realm there are exactly the same relationships one can find in a PC: gates to the external world, artists who produce paintings and sounds, Masters who guide the whole process, libraries to store material, buses to transport material, ambassadors who know communication protocols, servants and as many other Subjects as one can imagine.The PC (i.e. the Realm) is lead by the CPU, i.e. His Majesty. The name of the king is Si Piuh, which stands for the Italian pronounce of CPU (fig. 1). Synchronizing all the activities inside the PC is a very hard work. By analogy, leading the Realm is not as easy as one can think.	as-easy-as;book;bus (computing);central processing unit;coexist (image);computer science;library (computing);personal computer;point of view (computer hardware company);xfig	Giovanni M.

The game utilizes audio as its principle mechanism for driving the gameplay. The design and production team therefore had to reconsider the ways in which a mobile phone game is developed and how it works. This resulted in some innovative and previously untried techniques in the design process and technical solutions developed for the project. As such, this paper reviews existing knowledge in game design for sound based games, and describes the background and development process of the iSpooks game. In doing so, this paper describes game aspects such as, sound design, designing for the casual gamer, finding appropriate narrative forms and creating non-visual immersion.	immersion (virtual reality);mobile game;mobile phone	Nigel Papworth	2010		10.1145/1859799.1859810	sound design;video game design;first playable demo;game design;simulation;design process;level design;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;game mechanics;game art design;metagaming;game developer;multimedia;simulations and games in economics education;game design document;video game development;software development process;game testing;immersion	HCI	-55.05419584565171	-37.31403695414303	52913

However, the advent of social networked media, serious games, and crowdsourcing platforms calls for a more pervasive notion of user model, capable of representing the multiple facets of a social user, including his social ties, capabilities, activity history, and topical affinities. In this paper, we overview several user models proposed recently to address the platformindependent representation of users embedded in a social context, and discuss the features of the CUbRIK user model, which is designed to support multi-platform human computation applications where users are called as collaborators in the resolution of complex tasks found in the multimedia information retrieval field.	crowdsourcing;embedded system;human-based computation;information retrieval;network media;pervasive informatics	Gerhard Goos;Juris Hartmanis;Jan van Leeuwen;David Hutchison;Alberto Abelló;Ladjel Bellatreche;Boualem Benatallah	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33609-6		Web+IR	-55.73498000222035	-36.928305917827814	52934
b4dd36750492f1fbf2e76402bc64aebae890a5c9	the creative process: a computer model of storytelling and creativity, by scott r. turner	computer model	"""Within cognitive science and psychology, there has been a good deal of interest recently in the topic of creativity. In this book, Scott Turner of the University of California, Los Angeles, presents a theory of creativity applied to generating small stories. Turner can be thought of as a member of the third generation of the Schank family: first, of course, there was grandfather Roger Schank, who in the 1970s with Robert Abelson at Yale, embarked on the research project of understanding narrative text using the ideas of goals, plans, and scripts. The attempt was to propose computational models that would accomplish aspects of narrative understanding. The second generation was a talented group of people, including Wendy Lehnert and Robert Wilensky, who did their Ph.D.s at Yale on story understanding. Turner is a member of a third generation, advised by Michael Dyer who also obtained his Ph.D. at Yale and then moved to an academic position at UCLA. Dyer had turned his attention to story generation as well as story understanding. In the classic mode, Turner took on rather too much for his Ph.D. He wrote a large artificial intelligence program, 17,000 lines of Lisp code, that produces a reasonable output that could, with the suspension of a certain amount of disbelief, pass for the production of a human author. He calls his program """"Minstrel."""" It generates stories of half a page or so about knights and ladies at the court of King Arthur.

They have to go from A to B as fast, efficiently, and safely as possible. Often navigation is not their main activity; they have something else to complete between the two points (particularly in stressful situations). They have to write an article for their boss, buy toys for their kids, go to the next book stall. The majority of these people are using mobile telephones, and researchers and the marketing departments of mobile service providers assume that these moving people could be happier, that they could have a better user experience, if they used their mobiles to get information about where to go next. In fact, there are already a number of devices and services on the market that support navigational tasks for drivers. While they do not sell like hotcakes, they do quite well on the market. Is it possible to also sell such products to pedestrians? Or to put it differently: Would people like hikers or those who are navigating inside cities or complex indoor environments such as railway stations and airports benefit from similar devices and services? From our point of view the answer is """" yes, """" but only if the following three prerequisites are fulfilled: • consideration and integration of landmarks as a means of navigation • more and real consideration of the context of use • provision of content that goes beyond navigational information. In the following we discuss each of these in more detail. LANDMARKS, THE CORNERSTONE OF NAVIGATION. Pedestrian paths are not as clearly defined as roads. Consider environments like airports where there are not any paths, but rather huge areas with different spots and with many different exits. Therefore, descriptions relying on instructions such as """" in 50 meters, turn right """" are useless. Studies such as [4] and [5] investigated the characteristics of the information needed by pedestrians and found that landmarks formed by far the most popular and effective type of cue. The system does not ask you to turn right in 50 meters but does say, """" At the blue sign of the bookstore, turn right. """" Leading users by landmarks, however, means that landmarks have to be defined and updated thoroughly. Sefelin et al.

We argue that there are three different modes of knowledge acquisition which can be identified both in the domains of cognition and science: the empirical, the “constructive”, and the “synthetic” mode. We show that the method of constructing knowledge in the virtual domain (i.e., the synthetic mode of KA) is not only a principal mode of KA in our cognition (e.g., thought experiments, making plans, etc.). It becomes increasingly important in the field of (natural) science in the form of simulations and virtual experiments. The attempt to find an answer to the question of whether simulation can be an information source for science, and to validate the computational approach in science, leads to a new interpretation of the nature of virtual models. This new perspective renders the problem of “feature extraction” obsolete.	3d modeling;accessibility;algorithm;bamboo;cognition;cognitive model;computation;computational model;computer program;data compression;electronic engineering;embedded system;experiment;feature extraction;information source;knowledge acquisition;mathematical model;our world;rendering (computer graphics);simulation;situated;synthetic intelligence;theory;virtuality (gaming);word lists by frequency	Markus F.

This hugely popular console system, codenamed Revolution during development, signaled a turn away from fully immersive, time-consuming MMORPGs or forty-hour FPS games and back toward family fun in the living room. Players using the wireless motion-sensitive controller (the Wii Remote, or """"Wiimote"""") play with their whole bodies, waving, swinging, swaying. The mimetic interface shifts attention from what's on the screen to what's happening in physical space. This book describes the Wii's impact in technological, social, and cultural terms, examining the Wii as a system of interrelated hardware and software that was consciously designed to promote social play in physical space. Each chapter of Codename Revolution focuses on a major component of the Wii as a platform: the console itself, designed to be low-powered and nimble; the iconic Wii Remote; Wii Fit Plus, and its controller, the Wii Balance Board; the Wii Channels interface and Nintendo's distribution system; and the Wii as a social platform that not only affords multiplayer options but also encourages social interaction in shared physical space. Finally, the authors connect the Wii's revolution in mimetic interface gaming--which eventually led to the release of Sony's Move and Microsoft's Kinect--to some of the economic and technological conditions that influence the possibility of making something new in this arena of computing and culture."""	wii remote plus	Heath Row	2015	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444814554342b	simulation;engineering;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	DB	-56.24627197059376	-28.39661591669737	53324

Since interactive dance is a performing art, technologists working as designers must consider how all of the parts -- choreography, media, interactivity -- are integrated to inform the overall gestalt and intent of the piece. To this end, we offer five design principles for making interactive dance: Connected Kinetics, Augmented Expression, Aesthetic Harmony, Interactive Build, and Integrated Process. These design principles have emerged from our practice-based research in collaboratively producing six different interactive dance pieces over the past four years.	gestalt psychology;ibm notes;interactive art;interactivity;kinesiology	Berto Gonzalez;Erin A.

1113aeec473a246f21a470a3876c20e92963abeb	grüt: a gardening sensor kit for children: a digital application that helps children develop ownership for their plants		One of the main problems in modern society is food waste. The main cause of it is the attitude of the consumers, which influence enormously the whole food chain, from production to consumption. Most of buyers see food as a commodity and, especially children, don't have any idea where it comes from. One way to reduce the problem seems to be changing consumers' attitude, which develops during the early years of childhood. Research has shown a change in children's food-related behavior after attending school garden classes. Often the experience of growing crops can't be done in the domestic space, thus causing a loss of the positive effects in the long term. This paper presents a project that tries to teach children how to grow their own food indoor and outdoor, mixing real and virtual reality, connecting something natural as a plant to the Internet of Things (network of physical objects virtually connected to each other and to the web). The use of sensors related to an app makes it more fun and educational. The aim of the project is to change children's attitude towards food, increasing their knowledge about production and consumption in order to reduce waste in the future. The research has been in collaboration with Cisco NL and MediaLAB Amsterdam. The user testing has been executed in Amsterdam, with Dutch children.	food chain;internet of things;nl (complexity);sensor;usability testing;virtual reality	Ilaria Zonda;Jarmal Martis	2015	2015 7th International Conference on Intelligent Technologies for Interactive Entertainment (INTETAIN)		education;simulation;human–computer interaction;temperature measurement;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;internet of things	HCI	-58.80687810161228	-28.246723231325998	53644

The dynamics of this animation are perceived as intricately synchronized with, and connected to ones own bodily movement together with the hammock. The projected texts are short essays and excerpts about technology, mobility, home and identity. The installation is an instrument to generate awareness through rhythmic bodily experience. Interaction is considered as a process to create contemplation and change in outlook, to go beyond playful experience with an interface.	awareness;electrical connector;microsoft outlook for mac;schmidt decomposition	Susanne Schuricht;Michael Hohl;Mirjam Struppek	2007		10.1145/1226969.1227020	psychology;simulation;multimedia;communication	HCI	-49.09541344881197	-35.50340118762112	54009

2f85cb3fe06c37d6d064a69c3a44bed51ac0be86	interfacing realities to the human body (abstract)	new technology;virtual reality;human interface;human body	Almost 25 years ago, the first glimmerings of a revolution in the ways people interact with computers began to appear. However, it was not until the mid-1980s that radically new human interfaces started to be taken seriously. The ultimate computer interface is the human body and the human senses. This idea is now termed virtual reality. The idea works in that it has already changed how people think. The technology is moving rapidly into research labs, but much more slowly into the realm of practical applications. When the ultimate expression of this concept is achieved, any fantasy that can be imagined could be experienced. Long before that time, preliminary implementations of the idea will radically change how we interact with computers. This new technology changes the focus of computer science from the computer to the human. Instead of receiving input from a sedentary user, the computer now perceives the behavior of a mobile participant. It allows conceptual information to be presented perceptually. Similarly, by immersing the participant in a graphic world, this technology suggests a new approach to a host of old problems. By creating a telecommunication environment in which remote participants can share information as if they are together, it will change how we relate to each other. The advent of virtual reality can be seen as a major cultural event. Indeed, it is a medium in which content and aesthetics will be as important as technology. Current virtual reality orthodoxy assumes a goggles-and-gloves approach and is willing to encumber users with as much electronics as necessary to accomplish its purely technical ends. It is not likely that this attitude will succeed in the marketplace. Alternative approaches that instrument the environment instead of the body, but provide some of the functionality of virtual reality are more compatible with the existing workplace. It is likely that such approximations of virtual reality will be the first techniques that are widely used.	approximation;computer science;goggles;human interface device;the ultimate computer;virtual reality	Myron W.

It was originally described in terms of linear or branching chains of finite automata, but its subsequent reformulation in terms of rewriting systems [60] proved more elegant. The close relationship between L-systems, abstract automata, and formal languages attracted the interest of computer scientists, who vigorously developed the mathematical theory of L-systems [40, 104, 106] (for an account of the early history of L-systems see also [67, 107]). This progress was followed by applications of L-systems to the modeling of plants, initiated by the development of the first simulation program based on L-systems called CELIA (an acronym for CEllular Linear Iterative Array simulator) by Baker, Herman, and Liu [3, 4, 39]. In 1984, Smith [112] introduced state-of-the-art computer graphics for visualizing a class of abstract branching structures discovered by Hogeweg and Hesper [43]. The beauty of Smith's images and the life-like appearance of his developmental simulations inspired me to design and implement my own simulation program, called pfg (an acronym for plant and fractal generator, C code listing included in [90]). The first results obtained using pfg were focused on the visualization of fractals and abstract branching structures [83, 84]. This work attracted the interest of Professor Lindenmayer and, along with my graduate student Jim Hanan, we collaborated on the application of L-systems to the realistic modeling of structures and processes found in real plants [90, 96]. The results obtained by 1990 (with crucial contributions by de Boer, Fowler, Fracchia, and Mercer) were collected in our book [95]. Many new results have been obtained since then. The purpose of the present paper is to survey current lines of research, and provide an updated guide to the literature on plant modeling using L-systems.

a96fa169d2d08895277806d7e644f58fb98e30b7	applying the story of the dream of the butterfly in creative design		In recent years, traditional cultural material has been creativity applied to increase the value of artistic designs and expand aesthetic economies worldwide. Cultural creative designs involve extracting and transforming cultural elements and symbols to create new aesthetic meanings in artworks. This study extracts the intangible cultural elements of the Chinese fable, The Dream of the Butterfly, through analyzing its literary meanings to provide inspirational concepts for cultural creative designs. The experience in The Dream of the Butterfly was a turning point in the life of Chuang Tzu. In response to increasing stresses of modern living, soothing emotional designs have become trendy. The light-hearted writing style of Chuang Tzu and the erratic portrayal of the butterfly are ideal inspiration for creative designs. This study aggregates practices based on theories of cultural creative designs and organizes various interpretations of The Dream of the Butterfly through the Chuang Tzu aesthetic theory and by scholars worldwide. The fable was interpreted on three interpretative levels (namely the dreamlike state, the integration between the thing and the self, and the sympathetic circulation of mind and matter) to analyze existing artworks inspired by the fable. Thus, spiritual reflections in the process of creative transformation have been clarified, and a reference for transforming the philosophy of The Dream of the Butterfly into creative designs has been established.

0384c20ed54cd2e151c5d61e5bcdd633ecbe50e5	time to reminisce and die: representing old age in art games		Gender has recently increased in relevance as a game analysis topic. Representations of masculinity and femininity in games have become a growing interest for scholars. Still, little has been written about representations of aging and older persons. Starting from this status-quo, we propose an analysis of age displays in a subtype of video games, namely casual art games. These are designed to encourage reflexivity and perspective-taking on a given topic, examining the human condition and offering a critical view of society. We examine several casual art games and we discuss how they depict and model older characters and the process of aging: What are the game-based narratives of aging? How are elderly characters portrayed and what place do they take in the emerging game story? How do game mechanics model the situation of ‘old age’ and the process of ‘aging’?	aggregate data;die (integrated circuit);elegant degradation;game mechanics;linear algebra;molleindustria;personalization;point of view (computer hardware company);relevance;skyscraper;video game developer	Cosima Rughinis;Elisabeta Toma;Razvan Rughinis	2015			visual arts;art;multimedia	AI	-54.21060137166181	-30.853586168754482	54863

This article examines the use of images in these settings and traces how they function as interfaces and tools in the production of museum knowledge. Because images are not only the main material presented but also become multilayered objects on which to act in order to access or produce knowledge, they play a key role in the involvement of users with museums. This development is analyzed in the context of the Tropenmuseum (an ethnographic museum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands) based on an ethnographic study of visual practices at and about the museum. Drawing on science and technology studies and new media studies, our theoretically driven analysis demonstrates how images as interfaces provide networked contexts for museum knowledge. The various dimensions of images as interfaces in museums are explored through the questions: How are users engaged by these interfaces? Which skills and strategies are needed for this engagement? What are the consequences of visually mediated interfaces for users of digital knowledge in/about/from museums, archives, and other collections? These developments are discussed in terms of their consequences for how museums view their role. Introduction A strong trend in the design and presentation of digital collections is to use images as interfaces. In the context of museums, archives, and libraries, these digital images traditionally have a documentary function; they 664 library trends/winter 2011 posit objects as referents that one might witness during a visit (ethnographic objects, books, maps, etc.). In these contexts, the way images take on instrumental and authoritative roles remediates tradition and supports new practices (Bolter & Grusin, 2000). Comparing, producing, sharing, annotating, searching, and viewing such images are increasingly important epistemic strategies. While all photographs carry traces of their context of production and use, the photographic images considered in this chapter have a particular embedding at the intersection of digital technologies and electronic networks. In this context images are portable, spontaneously produced, and easily translatable across technological platforms. Furthermore, this intersection also means that images can be related to each other within databases or with many other resources on the Web and that they serve as support for mediated social interactions such as discussion, annotation, or photosharing. The images are therefore not only the main material presented but become themselves forms of engagement and of embedding that shape access to and the production of knowledge. In this article we analyze how these new practices are developing in the context of the Tropenmuseum (an ethnographic museum in Amsterdam). The Tropenmuseum is a useful case for our analysis for at least two reasons. First, the museum makes extensive use of a Web-based collection database of images in a system called The Museum System (TMS). The database not only structures much of the institutional work processes within the museum, but also (re)defines what can count as the collection and the ways in which other users can interact with the collection via digital images. Second, the database is progressively configuring images as interfaces to other kinds of information and to other kinds of activities. At the Tropenmuseum, the main institutional investment in collections management has been in the development of the Web-based image database, TMS. This collection database was put into use in 2000 and carried a number of promises: of modernizing the museum, of improving management, and of enabling the museum to become a better caretaker of its collections. In addition, the museum explicitly aimed at using the database to change user interaction with the collections for employees and for museum and museum website visitors alike. The hope was that the networked database would diminish the number of times museum employees would need access to depots by replacing the practice of handling physical objects by that of consulting a collection database. The database was also introduced with the goal of making the museum collections available to a wider audience (including its original community) via the Web and to help multiply the number of visitors to the website and the museum. While TMS is an extremely important factor in transforming interactions with the Tropenmuseum collections, other projects are also changing the role of users. Following international trends in the museum world, 665 de rijcke & beaulieu/image as interface the museum is currently investing in other new, distributed infrastructures for visual knowing. Several of these initiatives focus on involving new users by using images as interfaces. Our analysis of the consequences of deploying images as interfaces for users of museum knowledge is guided by the following questions: (1) How are users engaged by these interfaces? (2) Which skills are needed and how are they learned? (3) What are the consequences of these visually mediated interfaces for users of digital knowledge? Because they cut across issues of digitization, such as metadata, outreach, personalization, and user engagement (Marty, 2007), images treated as interfaces enable us to explore the links between digital culture and museum practices. These images thus help constitute new forms of knowledge production in relation to practices of user engagement via digital forms, including the new values that may arise from such intersections (Mason, 2007). This article is based on ethnographic fieldwork at the Tropenmuseum in 2009. The fieldwork consisted of systematic participant observation; open-ended interviews with museum employees and visitors; a detailed scrutiny of new Web-based initiatives in relation to the museum collection; and an examination of official policy documents, relevant archival material, and funding applications relating to digitization and information management. Conceptually, we draw on two bodies of work: new media theory and science and technology studies (STS). Together, they allow us to analyze mediation processes and the dynamics of technologies involved in manipulating and circulating images. We use new media studies to analyze the co-existence of different frameworks of mediated interactions with images. This approach enables us to scrutinize these interactions in relation to other spheres of visual culture and to the history of representations (Cartwright, 1995; van Dijck, 2005; de Rijcke, 2008a, b). STS emphasizes the importance of innovation and embedding of new forms of knowledge, including material and institutional aspects (Beaulieu, van Heur & de Rijcke, 2010; Hand, 2008). Furthermore, we take from technology studies the practice of understanding the term ‘users’ as those interacting with a technology—in our case, an interface (cf. Oudshoorn & Pinch, 2003). This enables us to treat a variety of actors more symmetrically without using labels that presuppose that those in the museum are producers and those outside are consumers. It also heightens our awareness of potential changes in existing configurations of users and images as interfaces. Our argument is threefold. First, we demonstrate that images become increasingly active objects, which have many functions besides being viewed. This leads to a revised concept of how to interact with an image. This has consequences for how museums then think about images in situ. Second, we argue that images as interfaces provide a networked context for digital knowledge, creating the conditions that can lead to interactions 666 library trends/winter 2011 that exceed the limits of single images, single collections or institutions, and even of single platforms. This has consequences for how museums view their role. Third, having images as interfaces reinscribes museums and other institutions in contemporary visual culture where media coverage and user-generated content is increasingly relevant. The Image as Interface How can we understand the fact that the images are not only the main material presented in a museum but are themselves increasingly multilayered objects on which to act in order to access knowledge? First of all, the particularities of the visual culture within museums need to be taken account. According to Hooper-Greenhill (2000), museums have always ascribed a large role to the visual because of their focus on the museum collection and the visual display of objects: “The power of display as a method of communication lies in its capacity to produce visual narratives that are apparently harmonious, unified and complete. These holistic and apparently inevitable visual narratives, generally presented with anonymous authority, legitimised specific attitudes and opinions and gave them the status of truth” (p. 151). Hooper-Greenhill argues that “display” practices tend to enforce one-way communication and are difficult to modify because they are built into the structures and practices of institutions. Simultaneously she notes that more recent trends emphasize two-way communication, more openness to the voices and expertise of visitors and users (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000; see also Jörgensen, 2004; Simon, 2009). In addition, other tools and settings that also support such trends (such as information infrastructures, digitization, and new kinds of platforms for Web-based interactions) are now being integrated into museums. The material culture of institutions is therefore changing in response to the use of digital images, which have a particular physicality and, like printed photographs, require an adapted environment for preservation, manipulation, and display (think of servers, scanners, screens, and lighting conditions). Our analysis therefore considers change and continuity in the use of images for knowledge 	actor model;archive;autostereogram;book;case preservation;database;digital image;emoticon;fm towns marty;field research;holism;information management;interaction;library (computing);mason;map;new media;nonlinear gameplay;one-way function;openness;personalization;printing;scott continuity;simon;software portability;tracing (software);user-generated content;world wide web	Sarah de Rijcke;Anne Beaulieu	2011	Library Trends	10.1353/lib.2011.0020	museology;library science;museum informatics;new media;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia;sociology;knowledge;world wide web	HCI	-57.34427638904013	-36.8182106030849	54878
2a2b9d0c11da5c0f878669cde781ef91f913ff30	adaptive hypermedia and adaptive web-based systems		A lot of research and development has pushed the limits of personalization far beyond where they were just a few years ago. Yet the major goals of personalization continue to elude us: serving customers what they want, when they want it. Is all this research being developed with pure science in mind, or do the new technologies actually solve real business needs? In this lecture, we will discuss the business needs around personalization. We will explore which technologies have been effective, and which haven't been. We will discuss the importance of mixing technology with smart design to ensure that personalized features are intuitive and easy-to-use. We will also talk about personalization that doesn't require technology.	adaptive hypermedia;business requirements;personalization	Jan van Leeuwen;Paul De Bra;Peter Brusilovsky;Ricardo Conejo;Gerhard Goos	2002		10.1007/3-540-47952-X	adaptive hypermedia;user interface design;user modeling;web application;personalization;adaptive educational hypermedia;human–computer interaction;multimedia;computer science;web navigation;user interface	HCI	-55.919503448912764	-32.79473858347187	54995
833a6976559b140c6ca9ac209546c717055cbc31	feature - the theory of conservation of complexity		perts, we have always claimed that we “tame complexity.” What does that mean? Are we removing the complexity, rearranging it, hiding it, or resolving it in some other way? Depending on the situation, the answer is that all of these methods come into play. We remove, rearrange, and hide, but complexity never really disappears. Designing usable interfaces requires discipline to remove features in some cases, to organize others so they can be found and used, and to shift complexity away from users to more-appropriate places. Is the complexity necessary? It often is. In many technologies complexity is the very heart of the power and functionality. An oil rig is a physical example of a complex system—the structure of the platform must be rigid enough for production activity but flexible enough to cope with changing weather conditions. Another system in which complexity is necessary is the mailrouting software used by the U.S. Postal Service. The system must “read” zip codes and addresses, whether typed or written, through a series of optical scanners, and it must route the envelopes to their destination and deal with a variety of errors (e.g., no zip code, unreadable digits, etc.).

Among the best models to study the identification process in virtual communities are the communities of fans of imaginary universes. Steampunk—neo-Victorian fiction with a science fiction twist—has for instance given rise to a large community, which is very active both in real life and in virtual spaces, for instance in the online 3D immersive platform Second Life. By collecting and analysing hundreds of visual artifacts generated by members of the steampunk community of Second Life, we found a repertoire of visual and lexical characteristics with which to identify the community. In addition, examining the characteristics displayed by visual productions from other communities allowed us to map relationships between different communities based on their aesthetics. This data suggests that the quantification of visual clues points out to interlocking relationships between different community aesthetics, forming a network where differences are visible, but fluidity still dominates. Furthermore, our results could serve as a model to study how communities in different media (immersive universes, games, social media based on visual materials such as Pinterest or Instagram) generate their own visual identity. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Such flocking is mainly applied to game contents or artificial intelligence in virtual reality, and to the theory of network formation. This study aims to interpret flocking, which is usually applied to engineering, in terms of the design elements of visual art including unity, diversity, and rhythm. To do so, this study will actualize flocking through variable control and user interactions that consist the entity behavior rules of separation, cohesion, and arrangement, and show that the elements such as diversity, unity, and rhythm are included in flocking. This study will be able to contribute to researches on sensible and user-friendly technology and contents using artistic visual principles, as the users are becoming more affective. Also, it will be able to contribute to the expansion of artists’ expression.	artificial intelligence;boids;cohesion (computer science);flocking (behavior);interaction;network formation;thickness (graph theory);unity;usability;virtual reality;visual effects	Kyoung-nam Kim;MyounJae Lee	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3925-1	simulation;artificial intelligence	HCI	-48.65781409766852	-36.3048358752896	55344

e9a0f0de1090365ff84e24a3465328d579d6adc4	exploring game aesthetics	point of view	"""This paper explores an approach to understanding player experience and immersion through aesthetic theory. It should be noted that the paper limits itself to a consideration of single­player, avatar­based games with a narrative element. This paper will argue that the experience of immersion is intrinsically tied in with the body and its spatio­temporal positioning within a fictional or constructed space. Seeing immersion from the point of view of the body makes it possible to see a dichotomous relationship between text­ based and audiovisual media. When a reader is immersed in fiction, the 'transportation' from one space to another is purely cognitive ­the readers body is still and the construction of the fictional world takes place in the readers mind. For a player of games to experience immersion, various technologies exist that act directly upon the player's perceptive systems in order to create an experience. Any paper looking at computer games from the point of view of aesthetics quickly faces the problem of justifying its object of study as being worthy of such treatment. For the benefit of the intended audience of this paper, I will not do so here. As Alexander Galloway challenges in the introduction to his collection of essays on game culture; """" Our generation needs to shrug off the contributions of those who view this as all so new and shocking. They came from somewhere else and are still slightly unnerved by digital technology. We were born here and love it. Short attention spans, cultural fragmentation, the speeding up of life ... ­these are neuroses in the imagination of the doctor, not the life of the patient. """" [9] There is perhaps a danger in using theories of aesthetics and artistic practice to understand a medium that is usually seen as having no artistic value, left out of most discourse on contemporary digital culture and digital art. Any analysis may seem forced, and determined to push computer games into a category of 'worthy' cultural production. Is not my intention here to 'prove' that computer games can be 'art'. If we adhere to Bourdieu's notion of art as social and cultural category and construction, such a venture would be inherently meaningless anyway. Computer games are currently not recognized as art, and thus, they are currently not art. Nevertheless, I contend that computer games are objects of expression, storytelling and imagery.

In the intent of promoting a better comprehension, here, we survey concepts on vision, cognition, and Information Visualization organized in a theorization named Visual Expression Model. With a reduced level of complexity, our model organizes the bases of visualization techniques; nevertheless, it is complete enough to discuss guidelines related to design and analytical tasks. Organized in a coherent account, our work introduces the following contributions: (1) Theoretical compilation of vision, cognition, and Information Visualization; (2) Meticulous discussions supported by vast literature; and (3) Recommendations to have visualizations satisfy visualcognitive aspects.

The role of audio was assessed with particular attention to the effect on immersion and emotional engagement. Because immersion also involves the interaction and the creation of presence (the feeling of being in a particular place) these aspects of the sound design were also investigated. Evaluation of the game was undertaken over a three-day period with the participation of 19 subjects. The results gained imply that audio plays an important role in immersing a player within the game space and in emotionally engaging with the virtual world. However, challenges in regards to GPS inaccuracy and unpredictability remain, as well as device processor constraints, in order to create an accurate audio sound field and for the real-time rendering of audio files.	augmented reality;global positioning system;immersion (virtual reality);location awareness;real-time locating system;virtual world	Natasa Paterson;Katsiaryna Naliuka;Søren Kristian Jensen;Tara Carrigy;Mads Haahr;Fionnuala Conway	2010		10.1145/1823818.1823835	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-50.91333053026528	-37.95498209722909	56239

To further the field, we present a set of five design lenses extended primarily from sports philosophy literature to help approach exertion not just as a means of deferring death, but also as an opportunity for personal growth. The lenses facilitate learning how to appreciate a void (Reverie), welcome pleasure (Pleasure), become humble (Humility), as well as be fearful and excited simultaneously (Sublime), whilst being more carefully aware of one's own body (Oneness). Using these lenses, we articulate associated technology opportunities through related work as well as our own craft knowledge. With our work, we aim to support designers who want to facilitate the many virtues of exertion so that ultimately more people profit from the many benefits of being physically active.

While traditional human-to-human play still remains an important form of game play, amateur players, along with some professional players, have shifted the play domain from “off-line” club houses to “on-line” Go servers. Computer Go is an important field of study to develop a software to play Go or a Go engine. In addition to human-to-human play, a Go engine or computer intelligence to play Go adds another axis to play configuration: human-to-computer play and computer-to-computer play. These revolutions in the game of Go happened in an extremely short period of time compared to the history of the game, which is more than 4,000 years. We summarize this unavoidable change for the first time in the literature, to our knowledge, and propose a novel way to interact with the current technological advances. We present the new Human-Machine-Computer-Network Interface concept and our implementation of the machine interface with a robot arm. This Lynxmotion robotic arm named Cheonsoo-I successfully places stones on a board under the proposed architecture.	apache axis;computational intelligence;computer go;human–computer interaction;network interface;online and offline;robot;robotic arm;world wide web	Tae-Hyung Kim;Jared Adam Nisbett;Donald C.

With these artifacts, designers typically deal with representations of fragments of the application, and sometimes have difficulties communicating with one another about design decisions. To face some of the communication challenges during design, we believe that we could use a global view of the system's apparent behavior, from the users' point of view. Such a representation would serve as a common reference for HCI designers from different disciplinary backgrounds, helping to foster communication among them. In our goal to promote a shared understanding of the application, we have investigated different professionals' usage of MoLIC, an interaction modeling language that follows an interaction-as-conversation metaphor. MoLIC allows designers to build a blueprint of all the interactions that may take place when the application is used.	blueprint;human–computer interaction;modeling language;point of view (computer hardware company);systems design;user-centered design	Maíra Greco de Paula;Bruno Santana da Silva;Simone D.

We designate it as massively collaborative creation via the Web. As an example of massively collaborative creation, we particularly examine video development on Nico Nico Douga, which is a video sharing website that is popular in Japan. We specifically examine videos on Hatsune Miku, a version of a singing synthesizer application software that has inspired not only song creation but also songwriting, illustration, and video editing. As described herein, creators of interact to create new contents though their social network. In this paper, we analyzed the process of developing thousands of videos based on creators’ social networks. 1. は じ め に	emergent;interaction;interactivity;motif;nico habermann;social media;social network;speech synthesis;wikipedia;world wide web	Masahiro Hamasaki;Hideaki Takeda;Tom Hope;Takuichi Nishimura	2009				HCI	-60.88853402839776	-33.534238405816005	56500

In the continuing evolution of computing technologies we’re not supposed to see or sense, technical advances have been swift, but the surface is barely scuffed. Many challenges and obstacles still stand between us and the promise of living and working environments embedded with computing devices in a seamless, invisible way. This month’s special section explores how far ubiquitous computing has come and what lies ahead in the next decade. Guest editors Kalle Lyytinen and Youngjin Yoo point out that true ubiquitous computing involves devices embedded transparently in our physical and social movements, integrating both mobile and pervasive computing. The articles they’ve assembled depict some of the primary issues in the field, particularly the effect of ubicomp on knowledge work and organization; on group dynamics and behavior; and on potential business opportunities. Among the other topics we examine this month is Upkar Varshney’s observations on multicasting over wireless networks and methods to maintain the participation of mobile users. Aviel Rubin wonders whether even leading-edge technology has a role in remote electronic voting. Consumer trust, a prime component in any successful e-business venture, plays an equally compelling role in dealings with other consumers. Troy Strader and Sridhar Ramaswami study the dynamics of trust in consumer-to-consumer, e-business relationships.	communications of the acm;customer to customer;electronic business;embedded system;multicast;seamless3d;swift (programming language);ubiquitous computing	Diane Crawford	2002	Commun.

It visualizes multimedia data using the geographic locations in the area of the lunar surface explored by the NASA Apollo missions, providing visitors with a collaborative-learning environment through networked interactive functions. We designed scenarios based on real episodes during exploration activities and assumed a quasi-role-play with children acting as astronauts and their parents acting as mission commanders. Children manipulate a rover on the lunar surface and view a landscape at a viewpoint on the lunar surface. Parents instruct their children to find objects or information to complete tasks. Our contribution is to create a collaborative-learning environment by integrating map-based and virtual environments to view the lunar surface from exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. The system has capabilities that encourage children and their parents to get together to learn.	browsing	Kikuo Asai;Tomotsugu Kondo;Akira Mizuki;Mark Billinghurst	2010	Trans.

From this perspective, televisions, set top boxes, and other CE devices are fraternal twins to Intel's traditional competency, silicon solutions for the PC. In this video, the authors discuss how Intel's User Experience Group has steered the company to accept the television for what it truly is, a fundamentally different device, experience, and ecosystem than the PC. Drawing on ethnographic research data from 21 countries, collected over three years, they detail how teaching Intel to love the television has meant driving consumer-centric perspectives of the role, place, and meaning of television in global homes into Intel's Digital Home Group's strategy and platform roadmaps. This has meant abandoning the idea that “a screen is just a screen,” and that interactive, connected, and smart televisions will be PCs disguised to blend with living room aesthetics.	ecosystem;personal computer;plan;set-top box;television;twin;user experience	Alexandra Zafiroglu;Genevieve Bell	2009	Computers in Entertainment	10.1145/1594943.1594947	innovation;spectrum;user experience design;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;marketing;front and back ends;operating system;multimedia;advertising;television;management	HCI	-58.24295685341512	-29.655214217021147	56976

Littlewood (1885-1977) wrote in his delightful Miscellany: A heavy warning used to be given [by lecturers] that pictures are not rigorous; this has never had its bluff called and has permanently frightened its victims into playing for safety. Some pictures, of course, are not rigorous, but I should say most are (and I use them whenever possible myself). [p. 53] Over the past five years, the role of visual computing in my own research has expanded dramatically. In part this was made possible by the increasing speed and storage capabilities—and the growing ease of programming—of modern multi-core computing environments. But, at least as much, it has been driven by my group’s paying more active attention to the possibilities for graphing, animating or simulating most mathematical research activities.	computation;image;multi-core processor;simulation;visual computing	Jonathan M.

1d481c4a403b64ea6c345b928cae38e363d06284	the to-and-fro of sense making: supporting users' active indexing in museums	augmented environments;embodiment;engaging user experience;interaction design strategy;indexing;situated interaction;museum installations;embedded interactions	Based on case studies from a heritage/museum context, I present and illustrate the notion of “spatio-contextual embedding,” which conceptualizes installation designs that augment real objects and environments while keeping these primary focuses of attention. Key for this “embeddedness” is that interaction is contextualized within a meaningful setting, creating relationships between system and environment. While retaining a focus on original objects or environments, it supports user's active engagement and sense making by inviting, enticing, or forcing them to draw connections. At the heart of this is “indexing”: mindful acts of referencing back-and-forth between here and there, connecting objects or representations. Analysis of case studies provides a repertoire of examples of “indexing,” and examples for high- and low-tech installation designs that foster drawing of connections.  Two core values for design underpin the argument: (1) primacy of real objects and environments and (2) supporting human agency. The case examples highlight how technological arrangements may support or hinder indexing activity. This is condensed into potential design strategies. This article contributes to design knowledge on design for human agency, sense making, and mindful engagement with our environment. “Indexing” is relevant beyond the heritage setting domain, as part of HCI design in support of human agency.	human–computer interaction;primacy of mind;software design;term (logic)	Eva Hornecker	2016	ACM Trans.

bd8bee7f6e77fd9eb2614f37bd6f0c618a0938ca	reflections: a year spent with an interactive desk	qa75 electronic computers computer science	the world to the DigitalDesk [1]. This was the first attempt at revolutionizing office work by integrating the best of the tangible and digital realms. Since then, technology has developed: The Internet has connected us, and large interactive screens are fast becoming a fixture of the modern workplace. Yet despite the romance between computer and desk, the details of a possible relationship have remained elusive and curiously vague. Interactive desks are an idea with a rich history in research. Much of this has focused on short, walk-up-and-use scenarios that focus on evaluating specific aspects of interaction. Subsequently, this has led the technology away from the office and into niche roles suited to specific problem domains. Even today, 21 years later, it is rare to find studies that look at the longerterm impact of interactive desks for general productivity [2,3]. As a result, we lack a contextualized understanding of the interactive desk and its potential roles in the modern office. Given the importance of and trust placed in computers today, are we ready for interactive desks to be considered a serious replacement for the personal computer? Or, critically, are they expensive toys that lack significant transformative benefits? Curious about the possibilities, late one evening in December 2010 I carried several lengths of wood, a projector, and some tools into my office with the intention of building myself an interactive desk. The striking construction that greeted my surprised (and slightly bemused) colleagues the next morning marked the start of a year that I would spend using it as my primary means of interacting with the digital world for both work and pleasure. The desk (shown here) was based on a desktop computer, a 24-inch monitor, and a projection pointing down at a simple white table. Interaction was possible using LED-tipped styluses in addition to a wireless keyboard and mouse. The experience shed light on some of the elusive missing details: a glimpse into the subtle affordances an interactive desk Ref lections: A Year Spent with an Interactive Desk	amiga reflections;desktop computer;game controller;interaction;interactive storytelling;interactivity;internet;niche blogging;personal computer;problem domain;realms;test fixture;toys;vagueness;video projector	John Hardy	2012	Interactions	10.1145/2377783.2377795	human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-57.284655401516375	-28.060150499804937	57631

A preferred approach (in Germany) typically involves navigation and orientation tasks with pictures of a town and city maps depicted in a book. Because of increasing use of computer systems in schools, it is very interesting to explore the value a virtual environment possesses for teaching spatial orientation. This articel describes the ’City Game’, a computer-generated, virtual 3D city, developed for teaching spatial orientation in elementary schools, and an informal study to see first reactions of children and adults when using the ’City Game’.	computer;computer-generated holography;image;map;spatial reference system;virtual reality	Sabine Volbracht;Gitta Domik;Dorothea Backe-Neuwald;Hans-Dieter Rinkens	1998	J.

b8df42fc3701e10e50b828328ea2bccdf7614ae4	experience from two years of visualizing flash with ssdplayer		Data visualization is a thriving field of computer science, with widespread impact on diverse scientific disciplines, from medicine and meteorology to visual data mining. Advances in large-scale storage systems, as well as low-level storage technology, played a significant role in accelerating the applicability and adoption of modern visualization techniques. Ironically, “the cobbler’s children have no shoes”: Researchers who wish to analyze storage systems and devices are usually limited to a variety of static histograms and basic displays.  The dynamic nature of data movement on flash has motivated the introduction of SSDPlayer, a graphical tool for visualizing the various processes that cause data movement on solid-state drives (SSDs). In 2015, we used the initial version of SSDPlayer to demonstrate how visualization can assist researchers and developers in their understanding of modern, complex flash-based systems. While we continued to use SSDPlayer for analysis purposes, we found it extremely useful for education and presentation purposes as well. In this article, we describe our experience from two years of using, sharing, and extending SSDPlayer and how similar techniques can further advance storage systems research and education.	computer data storage;computer science;data mining;data visualization;ftl: faster than light;graphical user interface;high- and low-level;shoes;solid-state drive;static random-access memory;system analysis;systems theory;whole earth 'lectronic link	Gala Yadgar;Roman Shor	2017	TOS	10.1145/3149356	real-time computing;data visualization;data science;computer science;visualization	OS	-55.128701775123005	-25.300234165180612	58166

PDAs can be used to complement traditional computing systems to access personal multimedia information beyond the usage as digital organizers. However, due to the physical limitations accessing rich multimedia contents and diverse services using a single PDA is more difficult. Hence, the Situated Computing Framework (SCF) research project at Siemens Corporate Research (SCR) aims to develop a ubiquitous computing infrastructure that facilitates nomadic users to access rich multimedia contents using small screen devices. This paper describes a new distributed computing concept, the Small Screen/Composite Device (SS/CD) framework, which offers mobile users new classes of ubiquitous and mobile multimedia services without to limit the diversity and the richness of the provided services.	digital rights management;distributed computing;mobile phone;personal digital assistant;situated;television;ubiquitous computing	Thai-Lai Pham;Georg Schneider;Stuart Goose	2000		10.1145/354384.354516	context-aware pervasive systems;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;multimedia;mobile computing;world wide web;ubiquitous computing;autonomic computing	HCI	-50.71034690665615	-31.32573779112813	58307

In contrast, we argue that selectively concealing whose movement controls which representation can facilitate engaging play experiences. We call this """"innominate movement representation"""" and explore this opportunity through our game """"i-dentity"""", where players have to guess who makes everyone's controller light up based on his/her movements. Our work reveals five dimensions for the design of innominate movement representation: concealing the association between movement and representation; number of represented movements; number of players with representations; location of representation in relation to the body and technical attributes of representation. We also present five strategies for how innominate representation can be embedded into a play experience.

Although these academic fields are very important, we believe that other subjects such as language, music, arts, literature, history, etc., are also essential for future generations. For this reason, the goal of this research is to explore the potential use of robots as educational tools for non-technology related fields such as history. We discuss an alternative approach for designing robots inspired in traits and characteristics of historical figures that play an important role in the topic to be studied. We present some examples of conceptual designs of robots inspired in ancient gods of Mesoamerican and South American cultures. We discuss how some of the traits of ancient gods could serve as inspiration for the appearance design of commercial robots, and how these robots could be used in educational environments to attract the attention of students to learn about this history topic.	gods;robot;significant figures	Francisco Fabian Cuéllar;Christian I.

With the aid of a digital slitscan camera of my own invention, the horizontal axis of the image is rendered as a time exposure. A single sliver of space is imaged over an extended period of time, with moving objects inserting themselves into the data stream at different speeds and directions. The result is a mindbending swap of the dimensions of X and time. Counter to classic photography, still objects are blurred and moving bodies are rendered clearly. Some figures are elongated and have stick legs; others are stretched out, and their feet resemble skis. Shadows curve and landscapes are devoid of perspective. Instead of mirroring the world as we know it, this camera records a hidden reality. The apparent “distortions” in the images all happen in-camera as the image is being recorded. There is no Photoshop manipulation. These “distortions” could really be described as a more accurate way of seeing the passage of time, although it is unfamiliar to our traditional concept of the depiction of time and space in art. In other words, this camera is recording a reality that exists, but one we cannot see without it.	adobe photoshop;apache axis;disk mirroring;distortion;paging;sliver polygon	Ansen Seale	2005		10.1145/1086057.1086128		HCI	-54.91142139032698	-27.49367374671996	59387
0330fd5c9b564b4a8e071333ba846c91cf94945d	a mobile exploration solution for virtual libraries in higher education		According to the latest trends, users prefer to acquire knowledge through unconventional streams, using cumulative senses (hearing, viewing, sensing). Access to informational data should be characterized through its ease of use, consistency and reliability. Libraries have become target spaces for the deployment of applications for Augmented and Virtual Reality worlds, due to their complexity of information repositories and the associated indexing processes, as well as to its users' profiles (students, professors, librarians) and their access to technology. The current work models interaction in a virtually rendered library aiming to provide the users with an immersive experience of viewing library resources (books) and their metadata. A low-cost, affordable, technical setup is proposed for deployment, consisting of a mobile device and the Google Cardboard VR Headset. With the purpose of further integration, the virtual scene has been rendered using panoramic-based imagery. Complementary to the state-of-the art virtual tours for educational landscapes (museums, classrooms, libraries), such solutions could enhance indoor exploration for informational or marketing purposes.	book;digital library;google cardboard;headset (audio);librarian;library (computing);mobile device;software deployment;usability;virtual reality headset;virtual tour	Catalina Malinchi;Aurelia Ciupe;Serban Meza;Bogdan Orza	2017	2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	10.1109/ICALT.2017.39	software deployment;visualization;immersion (virtual reality);streams;google cardboard;multimedia;virtual reality;metadata;usability;computer science	Visualization	-51.060246722418064	-36.866030005685154	59500

As a result, they may need to catch up on what they missed upon returning to the meeting. Asking other attendees for a recap is often disruptive. To avoid such disruptions, we have developed an Accelerated Instant Replay (AIR) Conferencing system for videoconferencing that enables participants to privately catch up to an ongoing meeting. We explored several mechanisms where the meeting content is replayed at an accelerated rate so that the participants can catch up to the live discussion reasonably quickly.	goto;multimodal interaction	Kori Inkpen Quinn;Rajesh Hegde;Sasa Junuzovic;Christopher Brooks;John C.

Example adaptations for special users are described in the context of both implementation-oriented and linguistic models of HCI. It is suggested that the language of HCI be used to define standards for special adaptations. This would enhance reusability, modifiability, and compatibility of adaptations, inspire new innovations, and make it easier for developers of standard interfaces to incorporate adaptations. The creation of user models for subgroups of users with special needs would support semantic and conceptual adaptations.	human–computer interaction;user experience	William W.

04ba8714886b2a8e07fa06f4e3be33aff734e95a	human intelligence in search and retrieval	qa75 electronic computers computer science	Crowdsourcing has developed to become a magic bullet for the data and annotation needs of modern day IR researchers. The number of academic studies as well as industrial applications that employ the crowd for creating, curating, annotating or aggregating documents is growing steadily. Aside from the multitude of scientific papers relying on crowd labour for system evaluation, there has been a strong interdisciplinary line of work dedicated to finding effective and efficient forms of using this emerging labour market. Central research questions include (1) Estimating and optimizing the reliability and accuracy of often untrained workers in comparison with highly trained professionals [1]; (2) How to identify or prevent noise and spam in the submissions [4]; and (3) How to most costefficiently distribute tasks and remunerations across workers [2]. The vast majority of studies understands crowdsourcing as the act of making micro payments to individuals in return for compartmentalized units of creative or intelligent labour. Gamification proposes an alternative incentive model in which entertainment replaces money as the motivating force drawing the workers [3]. Under this alternative paradigm, tasks are embedded in game environments in order to increase the attractiveness and immersion of the work interface. While gamification rightfully points out that paid crowdsourcing is not the only viable option for harnessing crowd labour, it is still merely another concrete instantiation of the community’s actual need: A formal worker incentive model for crowdsourcing. Only by understanding individual motivations can we deliver truly adequate reward schemes that ensure faithful contributions and long-term worker engagement.

Morphological analysis (MA) is a versatile problem structuring method that helps teams to build a shared understanding of an issue, generate solution ideas and support decision-making. However, existing MA software has two major drawbacks given the high prevalence of teamwork in modern organizations: (1) it only provides a single user interface and (2) it neglects established practices to improve group performance and creativity because there is no collaboration support. I propose extensions of the classical process model for morphological analysis to incorporate findings from cognitive and social psychology that may serve as a basis for collaborative MA software implementations and discuss the underlying design decisions.	process modeling;user interface;wicked	Marin Zec	2015			simulation;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management	HCI	-62.38492655730993	-37.5685729184376	62189

Performances take place in interactive , immersive, virtual reality environments such as the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE), VisionDome, or Immersadesk. Because it's a 3D immersive world, the Color Organ is also a place—that is, a performance space. We are the principals of the Organ project and have collaborated with a growing list of contributors from both industry and high-performance computing universities (see the """" Acknowledgments """" section for more information). Britton handles the graphics programming and the meta-architecture of the programming structure (see the sidebar """" The Technology Behind the Color Organ """"), while Ox contributes the concept, visual images, musical analysis, visualization systems, and texture maps.

A 3D visual environment that serves as a performance space and the visual vocabulary from which the 3D environment was mod-eled. This visual vocabulary consists of landscape and/or architectural images and provides the objects on which the syntax acts. 3.

The natural starting point for AI researchers interested in MOBAs is to develop an AI to play the game better than a human but MOBAs have many more challenges besides adversarial AI. In this paper we introduce the reader to the wider context of MOBA culture, propose a range of challenges faced by the community today, and posit concrete AI projects that can be undertaken to begin solving them.	artificial intelligence	Michael Cook;Adam Summerville;Simon Colton	2017	CoRR		simulation;data mining;computer science;adversarial system;casual;artificial intelligence	AI	-58.33842477005468	-29.270356740726214	62654

As children become more enveloped in a world of technology and video games, it follows to leverage these kinds of experiences for use in our design toolbox. In addition, continuing to explore how to include a larger global audience through distributed co-design can advance the design process. The study presented in this paper serves as a preliminary exploration of virtual sandbox game environments as a co-design tool. Utilizing a design inclusive research approach, we discuss what led us to explore this environment as a co-design tool, how it evolved over time, and our success in using it to include those who could not attend in-person sessions.	accessibility;amiga reflections;bernard greenberg;client (computing);collaborative software;design tool;human factors and ergonomics;minecraft;open world;sigchi;sampling (signal processing);web application;workspace	Greg Walsh;Craig Donahue;Zachary Pease	2016		10.1145/2930674.2930721	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-58.83224546967767	-36.54267223474245	63017

The process and technique of converting the data into sound is called the sonification technique. One or more techniques might be required by a sonification application. However, sonification techniques are not always suitable for all kinds of data, and often custom techniques are used - where the design is tailored to the domain and nature of the data as well as the users' required tasks within the application. Therefore, it is important to assure the usability of the technique for the specific domain application being developed. This paper describes a new HCI Model for usability of sonification applications. It consists of two other models, namely the Sonification Application (SA) Model and User Interpretation Construction (UIC) Model. The SA model will be used to explain the application from the designer's point of view. The UIC Model will be used to explain what the user might perceive and understand.	human–computer interaction;sonification;usability	Ag Asri Ag Ibrahim;Andy Hunt	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-70816-2_18	usability goals;computer vision;cognitive walkthrough;usability;sonification;human–computer interaction;computer science;user requirements document;usability engineering;multimedia;perception;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-52.44563543124272	-37.22045342876432	63750

Grounded in the concept of animacy, blending theory, and embodied interaction, the approach integrates interpretive analyses with empirical studies. It includes a protocol of cognitive processes in two stages of use facilitating researchers to speculate the user experience of a lively artifact, to craft interview questions inviting participants to retrospectively express their thoughts and feelings during use, and finally to summarize possible interpretations constituting verisimilar design narratives. To demonstrate, three exemplary lively artifacts are examined in the laboratory.		Kenny K. N.

To better understand the importance of physical tools for early design, we conducted contextual interviews with twelve designers. We found that paper is an integral part of the early design process and argue that informal tools will not realize their full potential unless they provide similar benefits. We recommend that informal tools provide a mechanism to connect the use of physical tools to complement their electronic interfaces. We discuss several mechanisms and use lessons from our study to evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses, concluding that a digital ink interface would be most effective. A realistic scenario involving a digital ink interface is evaluated. Results confirm our design rationale and suggest that a digital ink interface would benefit existing design practice.	contextual inquiry;design rationale;floor and ceiling functions	Damon J.

Built around a water-filled transparent acrylic glass container, it resembles an aquarium. It combines colors and tones, light and sound and connects elements of two worlds – the real and the virtual. The background of this artifact is an attempt to follow the old tradition of experimental color-music instruments and to explore the phenomenon of synethesia. Throughout the centuries artists and instrument makers have come up with many ideas on how to integrate music and colors. Among those instruments are the famous color organs, which formed an earlier tradition of visual music. The technological achievements in our modern days have made it possible to build advanced musical instruments that may integrate, generate and communicate colors and sounds in order to simulate a tone-color synesthesia. Probably such instruments can give greater inspiration to music composers and a deeper level of satisfaction for the performers of music. 300 years of experiments may only have brought us to the dawn of the color-music instrument making.	color;experiment;simulation	David Yanagisawa	2007			multimedia;immersion (virtual reality);psychology	ML	-54.84656226735315	-28.335296480795336	64523

At the forefront of narrative innovation are social media channels speculative spaces for creating and experiencing stories that are interactive and collaborative. Media, however, is only the access point to the expressiveness of narrative content. Wikis, messaging, mash-ups, and social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and others) are on a trajectory of participatory story creation that goes back many centuries. These forms offer authors ways to create narrative meaning that reflects our current media culture, as the harlequinade reflected the culture of the 18th century, and as the volvelle reflected that of the 13th century. Interactivity, Collaboration, and Authoring in Social Media first prospects the last millennium for antecedents of todays authoring practices. It does so with a view to considering how todays digital manifestations are a continuation, perhaps a reiteration, perhaps a novel pioneering, of humans abiding interest in interactive narrative. The book then takes the reader inside the process of creating a collaborative, interactive narrative in todays social media through an authoring experience undertaken by a group of graduate students. The engaging mix of blogs, emails, personal diaries, and fabricated documents used to create the narrative demonstrates that a social media environment can facilitate a meaningful and productive collaborative authorial experience and result in an abundance of networked, personally expressive, and visually and textually referential content. The resulting narrative, After Love Comes Destruction, based in Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet, shows how a generative narrative space evolved around the students use of social media in ways they had not previously considered both for authoring and for delivery of their final narrative artifact.	interactivity;social media	Krystina S.

This paper explores the answer via a balanced view on user-learning and machinelearning, and proposes designers’ early engagement in conceptual design together with full awareness of users’ learning constrains, so as to make users happier and thankful since initial contact with the product the designers created.	learnability;user experience	Douglas Xiaoyong Wang	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02574-7_83	user experience design;user-centered design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;conceptual model;conceptual design;learning curve	HCI	-58.87303036839163	-37.55978741428889	65199

The veterans in our community started out in an age when the image processing tools in the publishing industry were graphic arts cameras and screens, pin registers, knives, and goldenrod paper. Their contribution was to invent the technologies that brought us from mechanical processes to electronic publishing: scanners, image enhancement, colorimetric color control, color management, perceptually lossless image compression, and digital halftoning among others. It is a sign of the exponential progress in science and technology, that the same generation of scientists and engineers is able to contribute to a new paradigm shift, namely from electronic publishing to digital publishing. Digital publishing is a fully digital process, from end to end: cameras, scanners, processing, storage, retrieval, syndication, distribution, and rendering. Many underlying electronic imaging technologies remain the same. However, the new fully digital process changes the emphasis of which goals are more important, i.e., it requires us to reconsider the priorities in our research programs and objectives. We briefly review the impact on some application areas.	color management;computer graphics;image compression;image editing;image processing;image scanner;imaging technology;lossless compression;programming paradigm;rendering (computer graphics);time complexity;web syndication	Giordano Beretta;Reiner Eschbach	1999	J.

Yet, despite many excellent research projects and publications, its full potential has not been embraced into mainstream system design. This paper will examine the reasons for this failure and argue that the problem is not simply inertia or lack of education. There are strong organisational influences that cause resistance to this particular approach. The discipline itself has characteristics that make it fragile in the modern corporate structure. In addition, the cognitive engineers themselves are not blameless in the equation. They appear to have done exactly what they criticise the engineering community for doing: they have packaged their product in a manner that is not ‘user friendly’ to its target population, not structured to suit its application, and not output in the format required. Suggestions will be made to rectify the situation: a list of actions is proposed for practising cognitive engineers to make their product more likely to enjoy widespread uptake.	cognition;cognitive engineering;systems design;user interface	H.

ad3a655d8d85d07f4ff09c84d9ae6675fb86ced9	curating digital life and culture: art and information	glam;digital art;digitalism;curation;social media;digital culture	The space between digital life and real life continues to fade and nowhere is this more apparent than in arts and cultural contexts. Facilitated by digital capture and curation, social media, the network, Internet, and the web, these forces combine to empower artists to be digital curators of their own work, giving voice and narration to their artistic expression. In the paper entitled Digitalism: the New Realism, the authors focus on how digital tools and technology have changed ways of doing, knowing, and being, while here we look at how today’s digital landscape is changing ways of artistic expression, narration, communication, and human interaction. The growing use of digital tools and technology in the arts and culture is dramatically transforming traditional curatorial practice and by extension archival practice, so that we are moving from a gatekeeping model to an open model steeped in digital relationships across global networks and the Internet. As we immerse ourselves in the digital world, where anyone with a smartphone can be a digital curator and marshal a range of Internet services, such as Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and more specifically for example Behance (for online portfolios), artists are enabled to freely engage and interact with their audience using to their advantage crowdsourcing, “likes”, chat, blogs, games and email. Emerging artists are particularly expert digitally and are able to curate their life and work directly, living naturally between physical and digital states. To demonstrate this, our study presents specific examples of how artists and GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museum) institutions are adapting to new digital ways of curating collections and conveying meaning. Additionally, we show how notions of what constitutes artistic expression are evolving as art traverses digital media boundaries, especially in terms of visual and textual media. Importantly, as life in the 21st century plays out on the digital stage of the Internet, artists and GLAM institutions find themselves more than ever working at the intersection of art and information which is leading to new and innovative ways of curating contemporary art that are expressive of artistic vision and digital aesthetics, while conveying social and political meaning capable of influencing and impacting our lives.	archive;blog;crowdsourcing;digital life;digital curation;digital media;email;global network;instagram;internet;library (computing);real life;smartphone;social media	Tula Giannini;Jonathan P.

In particular, studio surfaces such as designers’ desks, office walls, notice boards, clipboards and drawing boards are full of informative, inspirational and creative artefacts such as, sketches, drawings, posters, story-boards and Post-it notes. Studio surfaces are not just the carriers of information but importantly they are sites of methodic design practices, i.e. they indicate, to an extent, how design is being carried out. This article describes the results of an ethnographic study on the use of workplace surfaces in design studios, from two academic design departments. Using the field study results, the article introduces an idea of ‘artful surfaces’. Artful surfaces emphasise how artfully designers integrate these surfaces into their everyday work and how the organisation of these surfaces comes about helping designers in accomplishing their creative and innovative design practices. Using examples from the field study, the article shows that artful surfaces have both functional and inspirational characteristics. From the field study, three types of artful surfaces are identified: personal; shared; and project-specific. The article suggests that a greater insight into how these artful surfaces are created and used could lead to better design of novel display technologies to support designers’ everyday work.	baudot code;clipboard (computing);display device;em (typography);field research;image;information;institute for operations research and the management sciences;nl (complexity);observable;orientation (graph theory);physical design (electronics);timeline;workspace	Dhaval Vyas;Anton Nijholt	2012	Digital Creativity	10.1080/14626268.2012.658522	visual arts;design;simulation;human–computer interaction;space;multimedia;ethnography;anthropology	HCI	-59.54165658079725	-35.74602231287017	65604

Last year, sources for its client application have been released under the GPL license, allowing anyone to extend it building a modified client. This work presents an effort to explore the possibilities that haptic technologies can offer to multiuser online virtual worlds, to provide users with an easier, more interactive and immersive experience. A haptic-enabled version of the Second Life Client, supporting major haptic devices, is proposed. Two haptic-based input modes have been added which help visually impaired people to navigate and explore the simulated 3D environment by exploiting force feedback capabilities of these devices.	client (computing);economy of second life;graphical user interface;haptic technology;instant messaging;multi-user;portals;social network;virtual world	Maurizio de Pascale;Sara Mulatto;Domenico Prattichizzo	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69057-3_112	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-48.58406704745899	-37.927797819493684	65652
2c2b440bbccc64e25be409c2ca3a1f75b0cc6923	on the other hand - cognitive prostheses		Opinion used in Europe as an arithmetical prosthesis. In the 13th century, Leo-nard Fibonnacci introduced into Europe the Hindu-Arabic system of numbers and the arithmetic algorithms they made possible. One of the first books after the Bible printed with moveable type was an Arithmetic. Even so, the algorithms were not easy and not widely disseminated. Most 17th century tradesman could not multiply. Today, every shop assistant W hen hands are wringing, they are often wrung over the information revolution: the computer, the web, robots, the automation of manufacturing will all conspire to separate the rich and quick from the poor and slow, hurrying the trend to an informed, skilled, and employed elite living among an uninformed, unskilled, and unemployed majority. But both history and an understanding of human-machine interaction argue otherwise. Any number of forces may work towards the stratification of society, but the computer is not one of them. Computers , especially intelligent ones, are the great equalizers. Humanity has always recognized that the powers of mind are limited, and has always made devices to compensate for those limitations. Our most obvious cognitive limitation is memory, and writing is a device for storing information outside the head so that it does not have to be remembered. Instead, the human brain need only store the code for reading. As soon as it could be economically reproduced and distributed, writing became in Europe an irresistible force for equality: within three centuries after Guttenberg, modern science had been created, ecclesiastical authority had been reduced, the divine right of kings had vanished, and democratic forms of government had emerged. Calculation shows the same history. Roman enumeration methods made addition, multiplication and division impossible except for the gifted. To compensate, the abacus was turning the screws, or someone driving a car not really moving along the highway? With a power screwdriver anyone can drive the hardest screw; with a calculator, anyone can get the numbers right; with an aircraft anyone can fly to Paris; and with Deep Blue, anyone can beat the world chess champion. Cognitive prostheses undermine the exclusiveness of expertise by giving non-experts equivalent capacities. As with any good tool, the effect is to make all of us more productive , more skillful, more equal.

The first is a focus on the non-human in digital media research, and the second is the normalisation of dating apps in society. Building upon ideas from speculative design and speculative method, I introduce the idea of speculative devices, those things that are set in place based on a conjecture of an outcome. Drawing upon a case study of Ashley Madison, generated using a walkthrough method and analysis of media coverage, I demonstrate how the speculative devices of bots and profiles can operate, and why.

It is one of the pillars of Islam and every able Muslim must perform this act at least once in their lifetime. Many challenges are faced by the organizers as well as the pilgrims during this massive religious gathering. Cases of missing Hajj pilgrims are not uncommon and although several tracking and navigation devices have been introduced, there is still a need for a better solution in overcoming the issue. There are several factors that prevent widespread use of the system, such as the operational costs, availability of the connections and the use in uncommon platform. This paper proposes a framework for tracking Hajj pilgrims in a crowded pervasive environment using a system called HajjLocator. A discussion on the prototype of HajjLocator, as a system to track and monitor pilgrims while performing Hajj and to save lives, with an SOS mechanism, is also presented in this paper.

Cases like panicking because of getting separated from the group or getting lost and cannot find the way back are happening almost daily during Hajj. Koshak and Fouda, (2008) mentioned that apart from the Hajj period, Makkah areas become very crowded during the last ten days of Ramadan. During the month of Ramadan, it was reported that there were more than 2,500 cases of missing people in the area of Masjid al-Haram, the grand mosque in Makkah (Fakkar, 2006). Official figures on missing people during Hajj cannot be found, however, looking at the number of missing people during Umrah (rituals in Makkah outside Hajj season), it would be much more than the reported number. We should also note here that the Saudis pilgrims make up the smallest percentage of people that are lost. In other words, majority of Hajj pilgrims are not familiar with the surroundings in Makkah, despite the preparation they made beforehand. Apart from that, there are also pilgrims who are diagnosed from dementia-related diseases such as Alzheimer. While elderly pilgrims are associated with that disease, the young adolescent pilgrims can also lose their way due to fatigue and weariness. After several tiring activities during the Hajj, pilgrims can get exhausted easily and consequently, they are not well-aware of their location and wander aimlessly for certain period of time. These are one of the major factors that lead to the increasing number of missing pilgrims. The above presented figures on the number of missing people in Makkah even before the Hajj period starts are very worrying. It would be very critical if no further improvements made on the management of the safety and security of the pilgrims. In the yesteryears, Hajj authorities use conventional measures in dealing with the missing pilgrim’s situation, where multilingual guards and mobilized scouts are placed to help pilgrims finding their way back. Even a lost pilgrims’ centre was established to further improves the situation. However, these efforts seem to be not good enough, since cases of missing pilgrims still are a major problem faced by everyone involved in Hajj event, i.e., the pilgrims and the organizers. The problem of missing pilgrims occurs due to many factors. One of the major factors causing the missing pilgrim is their disorientation of the environment in Makkah. Guards and scouts are not placed in every corner of Makkah and where there are possibilities for pilgrims in getting lost and cannot be found, such as secluded places. While it may be helpful, maps, signboards and street names in Makkah are not enough to be the pilgrims’ guide in navigating their way. It is because people rarely used information such as distance information and street names, to direct them to places. Instead, they prefer to use familiar objects in sight that are unique and are symbolic, as their navigation cues. Based on May et al. (2003) landmarks were by far the most frequently used category of navigation information. For this reason, there are pilgrims who use technological aids in guiding them to places such as navigational applications. One of the solutions can be addressed by offering a specific framework to accommodate the needs in technology deprived places and densely populated areas. This paper aims on studying the Hajj pilgrimage situations and problems, as well as proposing a better solution for a reliable and affordable Hajj pilgrimage tracking framework. The main objective of the HajjLocator is to provide the availability, reliability and accessibility towards the pilgrims tracking system. Availability is related to the availability/ existence of the connection either by using WiFi, GSM/GPRS or SMS to send the update location data from a PDA/Smart Phone to the HajjLocator server. HajjLocator has the ability to track the pilgrims in both indoor and outdoor environment which provides smooth tracking process.

Despite rapid growth in recent years, affective computing is still an under-explored field, which holds promise to be a valuable direction for future software development. Human-computer interaction has traditionally been dominated by the information processing metaphor and as a result, interaction between the computer and the user is generally unidirectional and asymmetric. The next generation of computer interfaces aim to address this gap in communication and create interaction environments that support the motivational and affective goals of the user. This article will introduce and elaborate on the field of affective computing. First the background and origins of the field will be discussed. Next the elements of affective computing and affective human-computer interaction will be discussed along with associated concerns and issues. Next, examples of the diverse range of affective computing applications in current and recent development will be provided. Finally, the article will present a discussion of future directions for this promising technology, followed by some concluding remarks.

While the IoT potentially breaks down barriers of distance and time, it is interesting to consider how open & accessible it is.

The robot listens to music, thinks (as in processing), and draws a unique abstract painting. Art has been considered as people's specialty, that is, a result of people's creativity, intention, and emotional expression. However, the robot's unique paintings make people think and discuss the meaning of art and the relationship between a robot and art, for example, what the art is, what creativity is, the robot's abstract painting is art or not, how the robot's painting is different from people's, and so on. Public performance is also a part of art. Many human artists express their emotions, feelings, and artistic senses through performance, for example, singing, acting, miming, and so on. As the painting robot publically performed its painting, this expands the discussion. Is the robot an artist?  From our robot's performance, there are remaining artifacts, the abstract paintings (Figure 1). These may be served as catalysts for thoughts, discussions, and debates, similar to masterpieces continuously discussed and studied in our human history. The discussion of a robot and art can further expand to many people.  After watching this short video clip, we want you to ask yourself. What is the art?

The practice of Ergonomics is a rigorous engineering field. Okay, so I oversimplified in order to get your attention, but listen up: There is a lot of truth in that simplification. The discipline that calls itself “Human-Computer Interaction,” or HCI, has two major components: research and practice. The research component is done in universities and research divisions of companies. The practice comes from all those interface and interaction designers out there making real products and Web sites. The research side is a combination of science and engineering, with the major emphasis being on novel applications and means of interacting with machines. I love this stuff, but will have nothing more to say about it here. It is the practice that bothers me. The practice of HCI seems primarily to be an art form and skill, which explains why it is often so bad. The discipline that calls itself “Human Factors” in the United States and “Ergonomics” elsewhere in the world is a real, true engineering discipline, with established methods and procedures. It is what HCI ought to be. Mind you, Human Factors & Ergonomics (henceforth, HFE) has its problems as well. Practitioners tend not to be designers, so they are good at specifying the design requirements, but not at constructing the actual layouts and appearances of the resulting devices and control panels and displays. I have been reading a number of textbooks, both in HCI and in HFE. Originally, I thought the two would be similar, for, to my deluded mind, the practice of HCI is simply a subset of Human Factors that focuses on computers and their applications. Hence, the methodology would be similar. Not according to the textbooks. Alas, textbook writers in HCI are woefully ignorant of the many solid, fundamental techniques discussed in textbooks of HFE. In a recent <interactions> article, I criticized “HumanCentered Design” for many failures [1]. In particular, I suggested that although the layout and design of each screen was well-done, there was little support for the activity to be performed. Now that I have examined the texts, I see why. For example, here are two powerful classes of tools that are common in HFE and rare or non-existent in HCI: “link analysis” and “task analysis.” Task analysis is often mentioned within HCI, but not in great detail. The HFE textbook in front of me devotes two lengthy chapters to the topic, with 11 different techniques. Another important HFE concept is “situation awareness,” critical not just for safety-related tasks (where it is essential) but even for the problem of remembering one’s place after an interruption, a critical problem in HCI design. Or consider “human error”—not just the definition (although even this is seldom well-addressed in HCI texts), but the appropriate classification and treatment. All these topics are essential if we wish to design applications and services that meet real needs, that handle sequences of actions, offer supportive error management, and enable recovery after interruption. HFE is a well-established field, with a history of deep, insightful analysis and the development of useful tools that make equipment easier to use, more effective, safer, and more able to accomplish our underlying needs. Because I was originally educated in these methods, I just took for granted that everyone in HCI knew them, and were simply adapting these well-known methods to the special cases of computers. How wrong I was. University and industrial researchers are indeed often knowledgeable about these techniques, but usually only for those whose training is from industrial engineering, ergonomics, or engineering psychology: Computer scientists and graphic artists seem woefully ignorant. Instead of a rigorous, systematic body of knowledge and methods, HCI practitioners seem to know a hodgepodge of techniques, such as conceptual analysis, scenarios, personas, and card sorting, all useful, but none capable of structuring sequences of operations, of dealing with problems of human error, of interruption, and of complex task sequencing, especially in the face of errors and distractions. These issues are at the heart of human factors and ergonomics. HFE has a body of methods and techniques that are of critical value to practitioners of HCI. But HCI also has skills and talents that would greatly improve the practice of HFE. HFE needs more design skills and, especially, a better appreciation of the role of aesthetics. Both disciplines, HCI and HFE, need better understandT H E W A Y I S E E IT	card sorting;computer scientist;engineering psychology;human error;human factors and ergonomics;human-based computation;human–computer interaction;industrial engineering;interaction design;interrupt;link analysis;out there;requirement;task analysis;text simplification	Donald A.

Rarely has the issue of customer emotions been investigated. Traditional cognitive approaches to product usability tend to underestimate the importance of customer emotions in design. Not surprisingly, the success of a product in the marketplace may be determined by its aesthetic appeal, the pleasure it creates, and the satisfaction it brings to the customer. Emotions influence how a customer interacts with the product. In the interaction, feelings accompany thinking. This article characterizes customer emotions and issues concerning their measurement. The literature has documented various methods for measuring and evaluating emotions, but only a few are relevant to product development. In this article, we illustrate subjective and objective methods that are commonly used in evaluating customer emotion to an artifact.

How do we choose metaphors? How do we distinguish icons from idols? Do we always understand how symbols and icons work?  I will suggest that the experience that theologians have ac- cumulated in the field of hermeneutics is an asset also in the area of science and technology. The critical engagement with the art of interpreting and understanding is necessitated by the potential of scientific concepts to build ideologies as well as by the role that metaphoric processes play -- not only in communication with the general public but also in scientific research and self-understanding.	interface metaphor;self-reflection;software engineering	Antje Jackelén	2012	Proceedings of the 2012 ACM-IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement	10.1145/2372251.2372283	computer science;engineering;software engineering;symbol	SE	-60.0638506507978	-30.756200905095316	66896

Mainly I am dealing with the ordinary theatre performances and the common photograph's documentary practices, which is already losing ground to the marketing department of promotional images. I examine the Peircean concept of three main modes for understanding the signs conveyed by the photos and which elements make up the language of photography. Finally I analyse one theatre photograph from the play The Celebration and make some concluding remarks.	performance;reflection (computer graphics)	Susanna Virkki	2016		10.1145/2994310.2994333	humanities;visual arts;art;multimedia;theatre studies	AI	-56.96956713319837	-27.644022767012345	67249

The next generation of technology represents an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality of life for groups of users who have previously faced exclusion, such as those with impairments and older citizens. At the same time it risks creating a greater digital divide and further exclusion. How we approach design for this new generation will determine whether or not the third wave will provide positive advances towards an inclusive digital world. We therefore need to put forward both a rationale for inclusive design and provide pointers towards technical development and design practice in support of inclusion. It is our belief that there is not only a strong moral case for design for inclusion but also significant commercial incentive, which may be key to persuading influential players to focus on inclusion. Therefore one of our key objectives is to describe and promote the advantages of designing ‘in from the edges’ of the user population rather than designing for a notional ‘average’ user.	design rationale;history of computing hardware (1960s–present);next-generation network;pointer (computer programming);the quality of life	Mark V.

As an extension of man's senses, computer technology can provide an exciting new potential for the creation of art. The frontiers of knowledge in computer research suggest a new approach to problem solving in the arts. With a computer the artist can now deal with different variables in his decision making process than with conventional methods. For example, it is possible to put into the memory of the computer a color representation of a landscape. This landscape can be simulated on a graphic console. Then with computer programs which implement mathematical functions, the artist can watch the effects of wind velocity, temperature and factors which involve the amount of daylight upon his landscape. He can also observe data which are generally unavailable such as the effects of molecular structure, weight, mass and time upon the landscape. In his decision making process, the artist can rely on non-visual cues as well as visual cues. He can modify many more parameters in the total landscape environment to create a work of art than by conventional methods.	color;computer program;daylight;problem solving;velocity (software development)	Charles A.

88a11350b1f5c146c17bac70548516beb4670675	a farewell to air gaps, part 2		L ast month we discussed two successful attempts at bridging air gaps. The first was the Reagan Administration– inspired insertion of malware into controller software supplied by Canadians to the Soviet Union for their trans-Siberian pipeline. That malware, like Stuxnet 30 years later, was specifically designed to cause the targeted systems to self-destruct. Both attacks required some means of bridging the air gaps, which in turn didn’t present much of a barrier. There were many lessons learned from these exploits. “Offense-indepth” (the layering of offensive weapons and tactics to accomplish the objective) was the reason for Stuxnet’s success. A solid foundation in experimental computing with industrial control systems was the sine qua non of this successful hack—the authors had to be solid programmers with access to a testbed of Natanzlike industrial controllers, software, and centrifuges. This fact alone considerably narrows the range of suspects. And, let’s face it, burning five quasi–zero-day injectors would have been considered overkill by all but major state sponsors. From the moment Stuxnet v1.0 began unraveling in the summer of 2010, attribution was never seriously in doubt. From a political perspective, plausible deniability was instantly displaced by nonrepudiable attribution. To this day, alternative accounts haven’t been offered because no one would believe them due to the overwhelming body of circumstantial evidence and indisputable political motives.

The result is a useful tool for educational applications and virtual reality (VR) research. Our modifications are open source and freely available to the public (see www2.sis.pitt.edu/~jacobson/ut/). CaveUT provides multiple views—left, right, up, and down—from one point in the virtual environment. It is also capable of off-axis projection, which supports correct display when used in the very small one-person theaters researchers refer to as caves. An important branch of engineering for VR applications centers on building an enclosure where imagery is projected onto the walls. An early example of this is a planetarium, which creates the illusion of a night sky, or an IMAX theater that displays a specially made movie on the inside of a half-sphere-shaped screen. Members of the audience experience some degree of immersion, the feeling of being there in the world depicted by the movie, because the screen covers such a wide angle of view. While film is capable of providing the most detailed imagery, producing the visual effects by computer has some distinct advantages. With the right software, scenes could be generated rapidly and with no special equipment. Most importantly, computer-generated imagery could respond to input from a performer or the audience itself. At this point it is more like an interactive game—a boon for entertainment and educational applications, as well as certain areas of research. An example of a fully digital display is the Earth Theater at the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh (see Figure 1).

d47c45b9015783e15ba5c60f14b808efc7be71e2	exploiting the social graph: increasing engagement in a collaborative interactive evolution application		Interactive evolution, where users' preferences guide the search, is one of the techniques employed by Evolutionary Art researchers. It can be implemented as a web application to lower the access threshold since it often depends on volunteers who visit the system for fitness assignment. However, several drawbacks limit user participation: human fatigue and boredom result from evaluating a large number of phenotypes. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose an IEC system designed using a human-centered approach, with a framework consisting of a social network of volunteers interacting with a population also consisting of a network of phenotypes. The use of a graph model is proposed as a practical and efficient tool for mapping the relationships between actors and objects in the system. A case study is presented as proof-of-concept, providing both conceptual and implementation details of the graph model as it is applied in the implementation of an IEC system. Our experiments show that the data model can be successfully used to implement a gamification technique developed to increase users' engagement, which implies that this technique can be successfully used to decrease user fatigue and thus increase the performance of the interactive system.	data model;entity;evolutionary art;experiment;gamification;interaction;interactive evolutionary computation;interactivity;multi-model database;point of view (computer hardware company);refinement (computing);social graph;social network;software repository;web application	Mario García Valdez;José Christian Romero;Alejandra Mancilla;Juan Julián Merelo Guervós	2017	2017 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2017.7969385	machine learning;artificial intelligence;evolutionary art;human–computer interaction;evolutionary computation;computer science;web application;data model;social graph;boredom;population;social network	Web+IR	-59.65320342998036	-37.64419554162189	69862

To this end, we use a semiotic engineering model that explores both direct and indirect messages sent from designers to users via systems' interfaces. These messages represent how the designers conceived of the application, how they built it, and why. The online help system is an important component, because this is where designers have the best chances to explicitly express their vision. In this paper we review some of the classifications used to characterize help systems, and suggest that user-intent sensitivity should be explored as a new classification if we are targeting at efficient designer/user communication. We allow users to signal their intents by choosing among a limited set of predefined utterances, which provide an entry point to a cohesive discourse structure. The discourse is about the application's design rationale, and the operational and tactical instructions about how to use the application. Coupled with the application's conceptual model, and also the task and interaction models, these utterances allow help systems to provide information with increased probability of addressing the user's intentions.	design rationale;entry point;mathematical model;semiotic engineering	Milene Selbach Silveira;Clarisse Sieckenius de Souza;Simone D.

For this purpose we have developed an interactive table based on the 3D game engine Virtools, together with the reacTIVision software and have studied and evaluated the use of the table in a full-scale, realworld situation in the toy department of a major Danish retailer. Our detailed analysis highlights the wide range of interaction forms and interaction modes facilitated by the table, moving from initial exploration to playful and engaging experiences, both on individual and social levels. We sum up our findings and their relevance for future design and show how the interplay of physical design, interaction, and content has been instrumental in giving children and adults a richer and extended experience of the toy -- even though it remains in the box.	experience;full scale;game engine;out of the box (feature);physical design (electronics);reactable;relevance;thinking outside the box;toys	Rune Nielsen;Jonas Fritsch;Kim Halskov;Martin Brynskov	2009		10.1145/1551788.1551800	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-58.44708010260872	-35.61755594089936	70016
d77451a7239c2cfd00d96c9153561df3d4ebc503	emotionally centered design		Web 2.0 is coming. Rich Internet applications (RIA) are here. Hurrah! The Internet has caught up with the desktop, at long last. As a result, some natural experiments in emotionally attractive Web sites are provided, allowing us to contrast the more traditional, static HMTL-page Web sites with these more interactive, dynamic ones, where there are natural controls for information content, utility, and usability. So let’s see what we can learn from them. In this exploration, I concentrate on map Web sites because they provide the ingredients for appropriate comparisons. We know how to make products that are easy to use and understand. But what about emotions? What about designs that delight? What do we know about how to produce an emotional impact? Why are Google Earth, Google Maps (maps. google.com), the Beta version of Yahoo! Maps (maps. yahoo.com/beta) and Microsoft’s Windows Live (local.live.com) so compelling, addictive, delightful? They provide the same information as the older, static maps from Yahoo!, MapQuest, MSN, and others, and the very same driving directions. They aren’t any more usable or easy to understand than the older, more static sites— some people have even found them more difficult, especially in their beta deployments. But they are more fun and engaging. What lessons can be learned from this? To see what I am referring to, enter a geographical location into your favorite, old-style mapping program. Then go to all three of the RIA sites: maps.google.com, maps.yahoo.com/beta, and local.live.com and look at the same location. The maps on the RIA sites look the same as the more traditional ones, that is until you try to move a map so you can see more area to the sides, and zoom in and out, or superimpose satellite images (only available on Google and Windows Live). The main ingredients of RIA are pre-cacheing of content coupled with more processing on the client side. The result is instant response, the ability to drag and drop Internet content, and fluid, responsive graphics. Macromedia’s Flash was a precursor to this style of interaction, and Macromedia’s Flex tools improve upon the experience. Lately, developers have exploited AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) for these purposes. Laszlo Systems provides developer tools: You can find interesting sites at MyLaszlo.com. (Also visit Wikipedia for their articles on Ajax and Rich Internet Applications.) Google Mail and Maps were perhaps the first mainstream applications of AJAX tools, although they were not the first deployment. Where Google goes, the competition follows, including the mapping Web sites listed above. The main result of this competition is that everyone has benefited. Expect to see this style of interaction proliferate. But most of you already know all this. The question I want to ask is, why are these so compelling? Is it the joy of immediacy after so many years of slow, clunky Web sites? Or perhaps it is the pleasure of the fluid movement, with information overlaying the maps. Many Flex and Laszlo applications grow and shrink, making the traditional bird’s-eye display of information exciting and useful. Or look at Google Earth (download required: Windows only). Although it is indeed useful and fun to examine the entire world in exquisite photographic detail, a good deal of the pleasure comes from the smooth movement as one flies around the world, soaring up in the air to travel large distances, then swooping down at the destination points. It’s emotionally engaging. The immediacy of response is both fun and useful. The fluidity of the graphics is engaging. These are visceral experiences: viscerally exciting Web sites. The traditional map sites, with sensible, reasonable interaction and instructions are behaviorally appropriate, but they lack excitement. I believe that a good deal of the visceral excitement comes from the graceful movements. Interestingly, I believe the best display of route instructions comes from a more traditional, static Web site: LineDrive. LineDrive comes from Maneesh Agrawala’s PhD thesis at Stanford. Agrawala developed a method for displaying routes that are structured the way people think: so the route only contains major landmarks and turning points and the drawing is simplified to eliminate extraneous detail. The route drawing is not to scale: It is expanded in complex areas, shrunk in simple ones. His technique was first made commercially available by MapBlast, which was purchased by Microsoft, where it now resides. To see it, go either to mapblast.com or maps.msn.com, give a starting and ending location, and then click the radio box labeled “LineDrive” before clicking “Get Directions.” I find the result both behaviorally useful and viscerally compelling, although not in the same way as Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live maps.

a6c3c38d0dbe06d0f81589e1ed9d9717e47c05fb	what can gis offer history?		As the papers in this volume and elsewhere testify, there is ample evidence that GIS has been embraced successfully as a tool to explore and visualize historical events. This is no surprise since GIS is a generic tool that in the hands of a creative tool user can be applied to any field or situation that has a spatial component. I use ‘spatial’ here deliberately since it helps illustrate where thinking about GIS is now and how much further it can, and needs to, evolve. Put simply, fully benefiting from the use of GIS in History, as in any other field, requires much more than simply applying the tool. Importantly, proper use of the tool of GIS requires an understanding of what happens to knowledge when it is transformed to information and digital data in the computer. A mostly untapped value in the scholarly use of GIS lies in the opportunities for new understanding that arise through thoughtful awareness of what changes are made during these transformations. So, let us consider the nature of GIS use in History today, how GIS might be differently used, and how the major changes on the horizon for GIS may impact all users whether they are ready or not.	digital data;geographic information system	Karen K.

However, most findings are based on a posteriori surveys trying to infer how happy people have been.

We then propose a new kind of economy model where people pay depending on the emotions they have experienced. We have combined current commercial-on-the-shelf software and hardware components to create a proof-of-concept of the model.	brain–computer interface;wearable computer	Jean-Marc Seigneur	2011		10.1145/1959826.1959850	psychology;simulation;multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-57.19024171408358	-37.054694361706495	70929

Building on social network theory and techniques, we examine the role of social networks in shaping individuals’ ability to generate a creative outcome. More specifically, we argue that individuals who occupy an intermediate position between the core and the periphery of their social system are in a favorable position to achieve creative results. In addition, the benefits accrued through an individual’s intermediate core/periphery position can also be observed at the team level, when the same individual works in a team whose members come from both ends of the core/periphery continuum. We situate the analysis and test our hypotheses within the context of the Hollywood motion picture industry, which we trace over the period 1992–2003. The theoretical implications of the results are discussed.	hollywood;network theory;noise shaping;situated cognition;social network;social system;triune continuum paradigm	Gino Cattani;Simone Ferriani	2008	Organization Science	10.1287/orsc.1070.0350	psychology;social science;simulation;sociology;management;social psychology;social network	HCI	-59.76102644131899	-33.39771636339526	71664

Unfortunately, what users take from a diagram may not always be the same as what its designers intended to communicate. This tutorial explores the use of verbal protocol analysis in the area of diagram interpretation, and offer practical support for systematic analysis procedures. This includes a close look at the way people formulate their thoughts about a design, which can reveal underlying conceptualisations and perspectives that the speakers may not be aware of.	diagram	Thora Tenbrink	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-91376-6_4	management science;diagram;protocol analysis;computer science	EDA	-60.03729157003069	-35.47541729330189	71783

4c56860cb7ef04682779101126897b11be119839	book review: evaluating networked information services	information service	Arguably such a definition could apply to any, certainly any post-agrarian, society – depending, of course, on how widely you interpret ‘information’. But the picture presented in this book is misleading. To take an example: the distinguishing characteristic of the internet, compared at least to broadcasting, is said to be its interactivity, and this is illustrated by its use for e-commerce. While this demonstrates that this particular technology can be used interactively, it does not imply that it has changed the way society behaves; it has simply updated the mail order catalogue and the telephone purchase. Probably a much greater societal change was made in this field with the introduction and widespread availability of the credit card. The argument appears to be that industries such as shipbuilding, coal mining and steel making have moved away and been replaced by commerce and services based on information. The implication that such industries were driven out by the knowledge industries is of course wrong – they were driven by salary levels. Manufacturing industry still exists in this country, and it is recognized as necessary; moreover, the information is only commercially valuable because of what someone else can do with it, usually in terms of physical production. The ‘new economy’ sustains only part of the world, and sustains it only because the other part exists; a wholly information-based society might have problems with eating and keeping warm. Ironically, had the authors kept more closely to their title, and discussed the effects of networks, microprocessors and hyperlinks on the approach to information and on society, the book could have been a valuable introduction – as is shown by the discussion of EU activity in this area. In the event, however, focusing on the abstract concept of the information society has resulted in a book of which the value rests largely on its ability to stimulate thought into why it has got so much wrong.	e-commerce;hyperlink;interactivity;microprocessor	Charles Oppenheim	2002	JOLIS	10.1177/096100060203400213	computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;sociology;world wide web	AI	-62.84280239289362	-24.80191004674759	71930

0eeb15a1d7cf5114701240da26e9a4bfc16893fe	"""special electronic issue: """"the use of virtual reality for environmental representations"""""""		From breathtaking vistas observed between the tranquil shade trees of a forest recreation area to the myriad choices we make about where to enjoy a relaxing cup of coffee in a café along an urban street, visual experiences are part of our everyday life; they constantly influence and impact our choices. Yet to better understand and learn about these experiences we encounter face many challenges. Some visual spaces are too complex, too ephemeral or simply unavailable at appropriate scales for experimentation and examination. The creation of virtual environments gives us an opportunity to replicate, construct, deconstruct, embellish and analyze complex real-life images and the human experiences that accompany them. A laboratory of visual experience can be created employing a variety of methods using virtual reality tools and technologies. This is not a new concept, of course, but the bringing together of a number of disciplines centered on the field of urban and regional design is clearly sorely lacking. Such investigation can be aided by combining resources and knowledge. A number of faculty members and guests of the Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning of the Technion Israel Institute of Technology conducted a successful and inspiring VizWorld Workshop to celebrate the opening of the faculty's virtual reality laboratory, the “VisLab’”. At the conclusion of this inspiring event we, the editors of this special issue (SI), invited some of the leading participants to contribute and to continue to present their work for Computers, Environment and Urban Systems. The result is this special issue, (SI) entitled “The Use of Virtual Reality for Environmental Representations”. The issue showcases research implementing state-of-the-art methods taking place in virtual reality laboratory settings. Its authors come from a variety of disciplines: cognitive psychology, architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, urban planning and ecology, focusing on environmental studies. The use of Virtual Reality (VR) has its roots in visual communication science but disparatemechanisms and applications set it apart from the many tools of visualization. The SI reports on studies that use representations ofmyriad environments, both urban and natural, and at a variety of scales from buildings, interior and public spaces to landand seascape scale scenarios that demonstrate the broad capabilities of virtual systems. The studies share common features, such as subjective evaluation and/or public participation solicited through representations of virtual environments, using theater-like laboratories and technologies. This issue opens with the paper “To go where no man has gone before: virtual reality in architecture, landscape architecture and environmental planning” by Portman, Natapov, and Fisher-Gewirtzman (2015) This paper reviews the use of VR environments for research and teaching in the context of the three disciplines indicated in the paper's title.	ecology;experiment;fisher information;real life;self-replicating machine;user experience;virtual reality	Dafna Fisher-Gewirtzman;Michelle E.

Given the overabundance of video available, the attention of someone searching for video needs to be allocated efficiently among the video sources.#R##N#Searching for Videos studies how to support interaction with video in such a way that people can efficiently satisfy their needs. Interaction is seen as a process of bridging gaps. The cognitive tools to bridge these gaps are defined in terms of information foraging theory or IFT. This theory states that people forage through an information environment in search of a piece of information that associates with their interests the way animals forage for food. In the framework of IFT, efficient video browsing takes the form of optimizing video patches and their related scent in a browsing structure that supports decision-making in a three-gap decision model. The qualities of video patches and scent were analyzed in two survey studies and two experiments.#R##N#Within the restricted domains that were studied, the IFT framework (including the concepts of patches, scent, and gaps) proved highly useful for describing searching behavior. IFT is a valuable concept for understanding browsing: the research described here convincingly supports the theory. Moreover, the IFT framework provides useful tools for the design and evaluation of video interaction environments.	information foraging	Ynze van Houten	2009			allocative efficiency;decision model;satisfiability	Vision	-49.39071099581557	-36.8537567124084	73078

In the first half of this invited talk, four Augmented Music-Understanding Interfaces that facilitate deeper understanding of music are introduced. In our interfaces, visualization of music content and music touch-up (customization) play important roles in augmenting people’s understanding of music because understanding is deepened through seeing and editing. In the second half, a new style of music listening called Crowd Music Listening is discussed. By posting, sharing, and watching time-synchronous comments (semantic information), listeners can enjoy music together with the crowd. Such Internet-based music listening with shared semantic information also helps music understanding because understanding is deepened through communication. Two systems that deal with new trends in music listening — time-synchronous comments and mashup music videos — are finally introduced.	comment (computer programming);mashup (web application hybrid)	Masataka Goto	2011			appreciative listening;acoustics;multimedia;communication	Web+IR	-58.09174554061361	-36.228819877080284	73106

While in the past entertainment technology traditionally offered predominantly passive experiences, continual advances in network and computer technologies are providing tools for implementing greater interactivity and for enabling consumers to enjoy more exciting experiences, such as, for example, interactive digital TV, interactive theatre and orchestrated music and sound design. This phenomenon is pulling together an extremely diverse group of experts specializing in different technical areas, such as networking, computer graphics, artificial intelligence, games, animation, multimedia design, human-computer interaction, educational media and software engineering. Even though high-tech entertainment promotes interdisciplinary fusion, yet only the ubiquity of wireless/wired communication is considered suitable for accepting the challenge of building a large interactive environment for the delivery of the maximum entertainment value to millions of consumers worldwide. In this respect, there is a great hope that the wired and wireless may take over this complex scenario for fulfilling the consumer expectations. The second IEEE International Workshop on Networking Issues in Multimedia Entertainment provides an open forum for researchers, engineers and academia to exchange the latest technical information and research findings on next-generation networked multimedia concepts, technologies, systems, and applications for entertainment covering existing deployments, current developments and future evolution.	artificial intelligence;computer graphics;experience;human–computer interaction;interactivity;serial experiments lain;software engineering	Newton Lee	2005	Computers in Entertainment	10.1145/1077246.1077266	sound design;simulation;next-generation network;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;marketing;operating system;data mining;multimedia	Visualization	-52.148459507089854	-30.803327148555944	73143

Designers of screen content and layout should be able to apply existing Visual Design knowledge. Most engineers and designers, however, are no specialist in Human-Computer Interaction. We aim at making this knowledge readily available for engineers who are responsible for designing screens. We provide an overview of knowledge available, and show our attempts to make this usable for engineers. 1 Screen Design is not Just About Pixels Information Technology (IT) has been using displays for over 40 years. The variation in screen sizes is still growing. Screens are designed for clients of design (industries as well as buyers of products) who intend their products to be used by people. Screens are being used by people to see, understand, and experience things. Today’s screen users are no longer IT specialists. Consequently, screen design should be based on insight in how visual presentations interact with human perception, understanding, decisions, and actions. Engineers design (1) the screens, and most of the time engineers design (2) the way content data will be displayed. Both design efforts require attention to the prospective users of the screen. However, engineers who have to design the graphical user interface often lack sufficient education in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) or Visual Design (VD) to optimally serve the user, especially in small and medium sized enterprises. This paper is about knowledge of how information could / should be displayed. The paper shows our ongoing research in developing support for engineers. We aim at enabling them to make optimal use of design knowledge from HCI and VD. In fact this knowledge is available, (1) in the format of user interface design patterns (e.g., [We09], [Ti08]); (2) in publications from the design community (e.g., [LH03]); and (3) in (webbased) accounts of ongoing research (e.g., [OR09]).	design pattern;graphical user interface;human–computer interaction;pixel;prospective search;user interface design;user-centered design	Gerrit C. van der Veer;Elbert-Jan Hennipman;Evert-Jan Oppelaar	2009			visualization;human–computer interaction;user experience design;user-centered design;computer science	HCI	-56.7076010320573	-32.600418819897165	73254

Since Playfair, many different forms of media have arisen beyond ink and paper. Yet printed charts (or their digital representations) remain, by far, the most commonly used tools of data visualization. Their evolution over many centuries has allowed them to achieve a degree of sophistication that time-based and interactive representations have yet to achieve.	chart;data visualization;game mechanics;julia;printing;william playfair;yang	Colleen Macklin;Julia Wargaski;Michael Edwards;Kan Yang Li	2009			data visualization;sophistication;computer graphics (images);inkwell;game mechanics;playfair cipher;computer science	HCI	-51.026443154406486	-26.85351495596456	73334

fe3692ee9560e5b115df51cfb2fdc6dbf09afa50	special issue on the abuse and misuse of social agents	social agent	Coming across an unknown creature generates anxiety. Its autonomy gives rise to fears; its agency requires vigilance. In the primitive world of predators and prey, it is wise to be leery of anything that moves and to learn as quickly as possible whether a creature is aggressive or possesses dangerous weapons of self-defence. What better way to find that out then to throw a rock at it from a safe distance to see how it reacts and what it is capable of doing to protect itself. Testing, teasing, and poking creatures is so crucial for human and animal survival that it is no wonder these behaviours are also pleasurable, as are play fighting and play chasing (for a review of the literature, see Aldis, 1975). Apparently an elementary predator–prey schema runs across cultures and most species (Lorenz, 1939). Novel mechanical inventions, such as the automobile, can trigger the same predator–prey schema. In the early 20th century, for example, it was not uncommon for people to behave towards cars and tractors as they would towards unknown animals. As reported in Billerter (1997), a groom once reacted to the klaxon of a car going off as he would to the growl of a wild animal, warning his master, ‘‘Sir, sir, don’t go in there, the car is gone crazy, it might take the bit between its teeth and run you over.” (p. 1). Ongoing familiarity with machines quickly corrects mistaken human and animal attributions and primitive fears, but in recent years interactive machines have been developed that look like human beings and that talk and imitate human behaviour. These machines are designed to elicit the natural tendency to animate and to anthropomorphize. Developers would love nothing more than to create beings that sustain the suspension of disbelief for the long term in	autonomy;prey	Sheryl Brahnam;Antonella De Angeli	2008	Interacting with Computers	10.1016/j.intcom.2008.02.001	computer science	AI	-56.64853914488097	-25.473401998966178	73363

The NPCs are still made desperately from a &'third party' point f view, the exact opposite of the subjective experience, while we want to show that this method only produces weaker user experience. This is a hard problem, described by David Chalmers in the philosophy of the mind: we know what it is to be ourselves, we know what the outside world looks like from our point of view, but we have no idea what it is to be something, or even more difficult, someone else. Our goal as in Crawford is to reach the meaningful interaction with the NPC and we want to prove that this may not be attained through third party cognitive models. As a prospective we invite the developers to work on psychodynamic psychology. Moreover, French psychodynamics are a valuable intercultural tool spread in the entire Latin world and can be powerful to describe, heal, and treat human features, while Fodor's followers have exclusive theoretical access to our game models. It is a good way to introduce diversity in our community.	intelligent agent;interactive storytelling;interactivity	Olivier Guy;Ronan Champagnat	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39229-0_9	psychology;artificial intelligence;social psychology	AI	-56.71984077093298	-30.170777838621227	73420

1c4f8c79153b3d3c477a6b452c12607d8cca94a5	tutorial 1: adaptive augmented reality (a2r): where ar meets user's interest	abstracts	Adaptive behavior is one of the main challenges in building computerized systems, especially in the case of systems which are delivering information to the end users. Indeed, since the information overload has become the main drawback for the future development of such systems (cf. Big Data challenge), there is a huge movement in the research community to develop concepts for better adaptation of the form and size of information that will be delivered to a user (usually taking different forms of the personalization). However, the main effort has been dedicated to the contextualization of the user's task in order to determine what is the best way to tailor/adapt the presentation of information to the user, neglecting the role of the user's internal context, expressed as the user's (short-term) interest. The same is valid for the AR systems. In this tutorial we present novel results in modeling users' interest in the context of AR systems and demonstrate some practical results in realizing such an approach in a multisensor AR system based on the usage of the see-through AR glasses. Due to the need for continuously adapt the AR content to the user's interest, such models are facing many challenges in sensing the user's behavior (using acoustic-, video-, gesture- and bio-sensors), interpreting it as an interest and deciding in real-time what kind of the adaptation to perform. We argue that this lead to a new class of AR system that we coined as adaptive AR (AR) systems.This work has been partially realized within the scope of the FP7 ICT research project ARtSENSE (www.artsense.eu), that is developing new AR concepts for improving personalized museum's experience. The tutorial will present practical results from applying the approach in three cultural heritage institutions in Europe (Paris, Madrid and Liverpool).	adaptive behavior;ar (unix);augmented reality;bmc remedy action request system;big data;british informatics olympiad;information overload;liverpool;personalization;real-time locating system;sensor	Nenad Stojanovic;Areti Damala;Tobias Schuchert;Ljiljana Stojanovic;Stephen H.

How will we know whether we have done a good job in creating usable visual interactive systems that help users accomplish a wide variety of goals? How can people share the results of their explorations with each other, and for innovative tools to be remixed? Widely-used tools such as Web Browsers, Wikis, spreadsheets, and analytics environments like R all contain models of how people mix and combine operators and functionalities. In my own research, system developments are very much informed by models such as information scent, sense making, information theory, probabilistic models, and more recently, evolutionary dynamic models. These models have been used to understand a wide-variety of user behaviors in human-centric computing, from individuals interacting with a search system like MrTaggy.com to groups of people working on articles in Wikipedia. These models range in complexity from a simple set of assumptions to complex equations describing human and group behavior. In this talk, I will attempt to illustrate how a model-driven approach to answering the above questions should help to illuminate the path forward for Human-Centric Computing.	complexity;information foraging;information theory;interaction;model-driven architecture;model-driven integration;simple set;spreadsheet;wiki;wikipedia	Ed Huai-hsin Chi	2010	2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing	10.1109/VLHCC.2010.9	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;world wide web	HCI	-56.74912043085234	-34.583316654319226	73670

The tradition to base reasoning on ‘understanding the world’ dates from the time of Aristotle. The extension plan for Barcelona (Eixample), developed by Cerdà, which opened the era of modern urban planning, was preceded by analyses of rich data, describing both detailed demographic issues and physical structures. The contemporary, postmodernist city planning continues this tradition, although a shift towards analyses of more human-related issues can be observed, covering, inter alia, citizens’ perception, cultural differences and patterns of human activities with regard to distinct social groups. The change towards a more human-related perspective and the inclusion of urban morphology analyses are direct consequences of this trend. The required data may be gathered within a crowd-sourcing participation process. According to communicative planning theory, communication with the wider public is indispensable in order to achieve the best results, and can be realized with the use of sophisticated IT tools. Evidence-based reasoning may be supported by images of significant aesthetic values, which inspire immediate reactions.	crowdsourcing;galaxy morphological classification;geomatics;urban computing	Malgorzata Hanzl;Karol Dzik;Paulina Kowalczyk;Krystian Kwiecinski;Ewa Stankiewicz;Agata Wierzbicka	2012	Future Internet	10.3390/fi4010347	computer science;artificial intelligence;urban planning;management;world wide web;computer security;mashup	HCI	-60.75258273654676	-30.813477418545556	74270

When entering into a persistent virtual game world the player leaves the body behind. It is up to the game designer to create a virtual body with skills, needs and drives necessary for survival and pleasure in the game world. Would it be sensible also to create a virtual mind for the player to possess and evolve? Can models like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and ‘being-values’, or the personality trait model popularly called ‘the big five’ be used for character design in a way that suits massive multi-player game form? Based upon a view of the player character as the concentrated mirror of the functionality of an RPG game and adding features inspired from psychology, cognitive science and behavior science, this paper presents the high-level system design of a virtual mind for the player to possess in a MMORPG. The mind model is being implemented in a research demonstration game in which game play emphasizes emotional engagement and dramatic interaction. This research is conducted in the Zero-Game Studio within the frame of the open research MMORPG Ouroboros.	cognitive science;high- and low-level;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;mind;open research;pc game;rpg;systems design;video game design;virtual body;zero	Mirjam Eladhari;Craig A.

Understanding the building blocks of user experience helps in defining and designing better information systems and increasing market success of products. This paper focuses on user experience via users’ evaluations of virtual product prototypes. User experience being subjective, we analyse it through users’ own interpretations. The specific aim of this paper is to explain the alternative views on how consumers understand virtual product prototypes. We presented threedimensional prototypes of furniture to twenty test users and interviewed them afterwards. Phenomenography was used as a research approach for analyzing the descriptions, allowing us to outline, with the help of two layers, the differences in consumers’ understandings. The first layer contains the conceptions which consumers use when they describe virtual product prototypes. Based on the variations in the versatility of each test user’s description we constructed the second layer, which focuses on the forms of thinking. The three forms are: seeing I) a picture of a product via new technology, II) a separate product, and III) a product in its context. In our results, the user experience is understood as a unique combination of various elements, which extends over time.	a/ux;categorization;chinese room;curve fitting;harri porten;human-readable medium;information system;norm (social);user experience	Taina Kaapu;Tarja Tiainen	2010			user experience design;simulation;human–computer interaction;user journey;computer science;virtual machine;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-56.61906325376107	-34.015575337485025	76566

99c88edf08d75f04947f0c96485cbc7fb45402a2	cultural heritage and new technologies: trends and challenges		The relationship between the cultural heritage (CH) domain and new technologies has always been complex and dialectical, often characterized by the pursuit of technologies that can become a ‘‘deadweight’’ during users’ cultural experiences. Innovative applications and services can shorten the distance between cultural spaces, such as museums, art exhibition, historical center and archeological parks, and citizens: Technology can become a facilitator of interactions and connections between all involved actors, and where interventions can be sustainable, where enjoyment can be enhanced and where people can learn more effectively about culture. Some important challenges still exist, such as supporting users when inside a cultural space, design interoperable and noninvasive ICT solutions, and managing the cultural knowledge. These challenges are the focus of this theme issue, where international experts all over the world have presented and discussed state-of-the-art solutions and current trends related to the application of new technologies, methodologies and techniques in the cultural heritage domain. Twelve papers were accepted for this issue. The paper [1] entitled ‘‘Social Recommendation Service for Cultural Heritage’’ proposes a novel recommender system to individual and group based on artwork features and user experience. Specifically, a novel architecture of recommender system to individual and group based on the features of artwork, context of user and social affinity between users from user experience is illustrated and discussed. The rationale behind the research idea derives from the need to personalize the visitors access to cultural objects, to their knowledge and connections, of a typical cultural space, and to ensure that content and technological containers are effective with respect to its end users. The paper [2] entitled ‘‘Experiencing Touchless Interaction with Augmented Content on Wearable Head Mounted Displays in Cultural Heritage Applications’’ describes an interactive wearable AR system to augment the environment with cultural information, since the integration of touchless interaction and augmented reality is particularly challenging. The experimental results show the robustness of the proposed method in different scenarios, with various lighting conditions, in terms of the accuracy and sensitivity of the fingertip detection and of the realtime applicability. The paper [3] entitled ‘‘Questions-Matrix Method According to Divided Dimensions of Infographics Evaluation’’ aims to draw the essential summary according to the important issue of infographic evaluation, for the audience can find the way to improve and create the better infographics, since the visual/image is a very good expression in the cultural heritage domain. To design good infographic, experimental results suggest to focus on the story, tell it nicely, simple and beautiful in good design.

However, their application is limited because they can inform only by describing ; they require the user to make his or her associations with an exhibit with no visual cues to assist. More recent museum guidebook systems have tried to improve on this experience with multimedia content. The Exploratorium, an interactive science museum in San Francisco (www.explorato-rium.edu), is a challenge because its physical environment already requires much of the user's personal resources (eyes, hands, and mental attention). A successful interactive tool must, therefore, provide a valuable service while making few demands on these resources. This article presents our experiences designing, implementing , and deploying applications to enhance visits to an interactive museum. We conducted this research very much in collaboration with the Exploratorium and its staff. Our work is part of the Cooltown project, 2,3 which researches infrastructure and applications for nomadic computing systems—ubiquitous systems in which people move about while using portable devices to access services and applications integrated with the physical world. Our museum study has focused our attention on nomadic computing tools: applications that enhance users' interactions with the physical world but whose functionality is sufficiently simple to make them largely transparent. With the introduction of inexpensive portable devices that can render multimedia content, several projects have developed prototype or commercial systems for museum augmentation or navigation with handheld and wireless technologies (see www.exploratorium.edu/guidebook). Technologies such as PDAs and pagers have provided a means by which museums can communicate with their visitors in a more personal manner. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, for example, uses static and local content on a PDA, including a short video clip of the artist explaining his or her work, to provide visitors with a different perspective about the exhibits. The Experience Music Project (see www.emplive.com) in Seattle uses infrared beacons at which the user points the device to select relevant content. The Sotto Voce electronic guidebook, tested at the Filoli mansion, 4,5 also provides content about exhibits on a handheld device. Users see images of the rooms in the historic house on their PDAs. They thus orient themselves in both the physical and …	acoustic cryptanalysis;handheld game console;interaction;interactive design;interactivity;mobile device;patrick hanks;personal digital assistant;prototype;ubiquitous computing;video clip	Margaret Fleck;Marcos Frid;Tim Kindberg;Eamonn O'Brien-Strain;Rakhi Rajani;Mirjana Spasojevic	2002	IEEE Pervasive Computing	10.1109/MPRV.2002.1012333	human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;exhibition;multimedia;mobile computing;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-49.43718215570228	-37.52970684589855	77149
9352ff24b27e7fb4aeed10e3350727fe2f17ddc2	the desktop fab	desktop fab	Why does a laptop cost more than a newspaper? The answer has to do not principally with the raw cost of materials but rather with our inexperience in manipulating atoms and molecules with great precision in parallel and at very low cost. A newspaper is made using continuous roll-to-roll fabrication with web-press speeds as fast as 1200 meters per minute, resulting in over one trillion impressions per year for the printing industry. Computer chips, on the other hand, are fabricated one wafer at a time. Presently it takes in excess of two weeks (seven days a week, 24 hours a day) of processing to create a typical computer chip like a Pentium. A new set of chemistries, printing technologies, and new design tools will allow logic and micro-machines to be fabricated in several seconds by direct printing without the use of photolithog-raphy. In addition the time required from design phase to actual fabrication might similarly be cut from several weeks to as short as minutes. Our group, The Nanomedia Group, at MIT's Media Laboratory is presently working toward enabling such a desktop fab for printing out both functional logic and micromachines. To date we have demonstrated the ability to print early versions of both logic elements [1] and micromachines [2] on printers that can fit on a desktop. The technology is based on new chemistries composed of small clusters (on order of 100 atoms) of an inorganic semiconductor, which are further covered with a cap of organic molecules that allow the clusters to be suspended in a liquid suitable for direct printing. When the clusters are printed onto a surface such as plastic or glass the organic molecules are removed leaving only the semiconductor, thus forming logical devices and/or microma-chines without the requirement of either large and expensive vacuum deposi-tion machinery or photolithogra-phy. Using special printing processes we have demonstrated printing resolutions of about 200nm, similar to the resolution of present top-of-the-line chips. What are the implications of such a technology? The obvious implication is to be able to make logic vastly less expensively and in vastly larger quantities than what exists now. The least expensive logic circuits presently on the market cost on the order of tens of cents. As an example where price drives the ability to enable a market there is a great interest in being able to close the so-called e-commerce loop.

This archaeological site is located on a great hill at Prima Porta, at the ninth mile of the via Flaminia, a very important Roman consular road built at the end of the third century BC to connect Rome to Ariminum (today Rimini). Starting from digital acquisition on the field, both the archaeological landscape and the actual site have been modeled in 3D, together with the reconstruction of how this context could have been in the past, in particular during the augustan age. The 3D scenarios have been implemented in a Virtual Reality application using mid-air gesture based Interaction. The installation introduces a novel approach in storytelling, combining different media and languages: real time exploration, cinematographic paradigms, use of real actors and virtual set practices. This installation has been created reusing and updating the dataset previously realized for the Virtual Museum of the Ancient via Flaminia, a virtual reality and multiuser environment that was installed in the Roman National Museum-Diocletian's Baths in Rome in 2008. The new version of installation, Livia's Villa Reloaded, has been presented and opened to the public in February 2014 in the same location, and promoted by the V-Must network as a successful example of trans-media project.	multi-user;porta-color;source-to-source compiler;virtual reality;virtual studio	Eva Pietroni;Massimiliano Forlani;Claudio Rufa	2015	2015 Digital Heritage	10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2015.7419567	visual arts;art;mixed reality;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-50.258479816919696	-29.257810150929583	77574

It is now possible to make them more usable by providing them with conversational capabilities based on collaborative discourse theory. This paper discusses an approach for designing programmable appliance interfaces towards supporting person-product collaboration, A central component of the approach is an adaptive menu, called Some Things to Say (SenSay), generated using collaborative discourse theory. The SenSay provides suggestions the product may have at any time for what the user can say or do next. The paper highlights four important challenges for SenSay design, and presents the results of a study exploring one of those issues: item presentation. Results showed a relationship between item presentation style and test participants' subjective reactions to the interface, but no significant effects on participants' task performance.

d4168c387876ad0e0bb90aa77bb1808c6ef2c420	mobile and ubiquitous multimedia	multimedia	Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia (MUM) is an annual international conference sponsored by ACM, which provides a forum for presenting the latest research results on mobile and ubiquitous multimedia. Every year, the conference brings together experts from both academia and industry over a period of 3 days in mid-winter, and boasts a rich technical program with plenty of opportunities for discussion and interaction with colleagues. MUM 2010, which took place in early December in the beautiful town of Limassol in Cyprus, was no exception. Sixty-two high-quality qualifying submissions were received from 20 countries across Europe, North America and Asia and 27 were selected for presentation at MUM. The papers presented covered areas, such as architectures, protocols and algorithms, middleware, interfaces, security, media management, social networks, user studies, field trials, and their application in areas, such as streaming, games, entertainment, transportation, location and context awareness, and intelligent and adaptive environments. This special issue comprises the extended versions of five papers originally submitted at MUM 2010 that have since successfully made it through two additional rounds of reviews. The selection process was particularly tough because a very high number of quality contributions were up for consideration for the special issue. The editor has made no effort to select papers of matching content but rather papers that are representative of the work presented at MUM 2010 and which promote understanding of the wider problems and issues which are pursued by researchers and practitioners working in the field. As a result, some papers of truly high quality had to be omitted from this special issue. Dinesh Babu Jayagopi and Daniel Gatica Perez of the Idiap Research Institute in Switzerland and Taemie Kiim and Alex Pentland of the MIT Media Lab in the USA address recognition of the different group conversational contexts during brainstorming and decision-making interaction using nonverbal behavioural cues and record their data using privacy-sensitive mobile sociometers. Their experiments serve to reveal that group communication patterns and dynamics are significantly different between the two. Andreas Löcken, Niels Henze and Susanne Boll of the University of Oldenburg in Germany and Tobias Hesselmann and Martin Pielot of the Research Institute for Information Technology, also in Germany, propose a user-centred process for deriving gestures for controlling music playback. The resulting gesture set can serve as a benchmark for evaluating gesture recognition algorithms. Matthias Rehm of Aalborg University in Denmark and Karin Leichtenstern of Augsburg University in Germany present a gesture-based approach to intercultural training in non-verbal behaviour that makes use of what they call ‘‘enculturated’’ virtual agents, interactive systems that utilise cultural heuristics for interpreting and generating behaviour. A mobile system they have developed adopts the sensory capabilities of smart phones for gesture recognition during user interaction. Yefeng Liu, Todorka Alexandrova and Tatsuo Nakajima of Waseda University in Japan and Vili Lehdonvirta of the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology in Finland present a mobile crowd sourcing platform that is built on top of social media.

CDR is an approach that focuses on imagining futures and learning through the making and testing of prototypes to construct new knowledge about how people engage with the world. While the body of research on smart domestic environments includes a wealth of human-centered research, the use of CDR is marginal. Our work demonstrates how such a process engages residents in activities to imagine why people might value smart domestic environments and how they might want to interact with them. Through goal setting activities, paper prototyping, and field-testing of resident designed technology probes, we present use cases, design principles and experiential insights. After sharing these findings, we introduce the emergence of smart domestic environments as possessing persuasive, personified and artful qualities.	emergence;futures and promises;home automation;marginal model;paper prototyping	Ryan Brotman;Winslow S.

Experience has taught many designers that interfaces based exclusively upon intuition, artifacts, or even existing design principles often have poor usability, Fortunately, several empirical methods exist that, when applied, nearly always improve usability. Collecting input from users throughout the design process, rapid prototyping and other iterative design techniques, formal usability testing, and integrated design are now proven methods for assuring good user interfaces. In the years since Gould & Lewis’s “Designing for Usability” paper [2], evidence for the value of these methods has been steadily accumulating. Refinements and extensions of their “key principles” continue to appear at this conference and eksewhere in the CHI Literature. They have made their way into handbooks and textbooks, and are taught in the human factors curncuium.	artifact (software development);chi;human factors and ergonomics;iteration;iterative design;rapid prototyping;usability testing;user interface	Robert M.

Recent technological developments make video an exciting and powerful tool for scientific investigation that is both accessible and appeal ing to students. The deve lopment of digitized video and inexpensive video capture boards introduces a new realm of scientific phenomena to the scholastic world. Technical Education Research Centers (TERC), an educational research and. development organization based in Cambridge, Mass., is explor ing the potential of videobased learning. In the Video for Explor ing the World project (VIEW), TERC is developing a product which supports the use of video as a type of laboratory instrument. VIEW provides students with quick access to real-world data such as human and animal motion, the behavior of crowds, flocks, and traffic, and pat terns of growth and decay. Once captured, video phenomena combine the immediacy of real action with the ability to repeat and analyze laboratory experiments. With this use of vide(), students are able to analyze real phenomena, ra ther than abstract models with which they have only an indirect connection. Students can ask and investigate questions such as """"How fast is a rope turning dur ing a Double Dutch game?,"""" """"What do the arcs of jugg led balls look like?,"""" or """"How fast does a hibiscus flower open? Are there times when it is opening more slowly or more quickly?"""" The significant potential of video laboratories rests on several characteristics of the medium itself as well as on learning activities that combine the power o f video with that of computers. Video's ability to make transient events pe rmanen t means that exper iments can be viewed and analyzed many times. Simple features of video, such as f rame-by-frame viewing and time-lapse taping provide students with the ability both to shrink and to expand time to work with phenomena that would otherwise be unavailable in the classroom. Addit ionally, software can provide measurement instruments that work on video images and simulations that can be overlaid on video. Such a system also has the potential to change students ' relationship to video technology, which they generally experience in a passive way, acting only to switch channels. With VIEW, students see video as an ins t rument with which they can capture the world, make it stand still, speed it up, go back and capture it again, analyze it, and ultimately unders tand it. The VIEW project is based on the success of an earl ier exper iment with a similar approach to educational video. TapeMeasure , designed and built at Bolt Beranek and Newman, made it possible for students to use video to capture and analyze their runn ing styles. A middle school math class in Cambridge, Mass. spent several weeks investigating the variables that might affect students ' runn ing speed. Besides variables such as height and weight, students conside red variables measurable only by using a videotape, such as stride length, stride angle, knee angle, and step frequency. Before doing actual measurements , they fashioned several conjectures to focus their analysis. Many students originally thought that the less someone weighed, the faster that person ran. But Shana, a slightly p lump girl, of fered an opinion that was later re fe r red to as """"Shana's con jec tu re"""" the re was little connection between weight and race time. Alex, a track star, of fered his conjecture that faster runners would have more arm pumps than steps. He based this belief on his coach's advice, who told him that if he moved his arms more quickly, he would be able to run faster. Students then designed their exper iment , deciding how far to run, where to run, and where to place the video camera. Once the videotapes of the exper iments were made, students used a palette of on-screen measurement tools to find out the videodependen t variables. To measure stride length, for example, a s tudent would find a frame where the left foot was on the ground, place a dot at that point on the screen, run the video until the left foot was again on the ground, and measure with a calibra ted ruler the distance between the dot and the final point.

As new cost-effective digital recording technologies are introduced to the marketplace, this becomes a salient issue to understand for producers and production teams. In order to define cameras’ image quality capacities, three almost identical short fiction film sequences were tested on a young audience in a comparative blind test. Surprisingly, the result unambiguously showed that most viewers preferred the film recorded on an iPhone. Based on Barbara Maria Stafford’s theoretical framework on the cognitive work of images and theories that concern ecological moving image theory, the analysis of this article aims to explain the reception study’s result by illuminating the sublime and ambiguous figure–ground constellation of the iPhone video and its cognitive ramifications.	digital recording;image quality;sublime text;theory;turing test	Per-Erik Eriksson;Yvonne Eriksson	2015	Digital Creativity	10.1080/14626268.2014.993653	image quality;visual arts;simulation;cognition;human–computer interaction;epistemology;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;sociology;management;world wide web	HCI	-53.72876161679693	-30.56611256232825	79490

In initialization workshops scenarios are created together with the customer. These scenarios reflect respectively single socio-cultural trends in form of narrative stories, which describe a detailed product environment. This serves as an extensive briefing for the interdisciplinary design team: Industrial, interface, color and material designers, anthropologists, psychologists and engineers. Different product concepts are developed and verified qualifiedly by different methods of testing. The top resulting ideas are developed further and culminate in first functional prototypes. They cover a predefined performance range and are subject to further international usability and acceptance tests. Also later during the specification and implementation phase rapid prototyping helps to guarantee the user centered design process and implement a common understanding in the international interdisciplinary development team. In the following this innovationprocess is briefly represented with the example of the development of a new office phone generation for Siemens.	user interface design	Claude Toussaint	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73111-5_86	user interface design;innovation;user experience design;user-centered design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;usability engineering;design review;product design;management	HCI	-61.883066934006585	-37.7955505710852	79519

Character information is fitted for sharing knowledge and a thought but it is assumed that there is methods what make available to share the feelings more intuitively, because we can understand feelings of others in real world without conversation. For example, without character information, there is a method that an avatar of the viewer is shaking to express the feelings in the video hosting service. This method makes other viewer find that a viewer has feelings or a thought. Although, they can not find what feelings the man has. Therefore, this study was made to develop Real-time Effecter for sharing specific feelings such as joy, anger, grief, and pleasure more intuitively.	avatar (computing);real-time transcription	Yusuke Araki;Hidenori Watanabe	2013	2013 International Conference on Cyberworlds	10.1109/CW.2013.50	the internet;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	Robotics	-55.49602008148619	-31.132471993949757	79704

This is exemplified by a short discussion of the persuasive appeals known from classical rhetoric as well as the so-called ‘aptum-model’. It is suggested how these sets of rhetorical concepts may be developed into guidelines for persuasive design. Moreover, classical rhetoric can be related to social psychology in an interesting and informative way. This combination of classical and modern disciplines of persuasion however also suggests that there is an inherent limit to the power of persuasive strategies.	information	Anne-Kathrine Kjær Christensen;Per F.

It becomesmore natural and intuitive by using gesture and speech to real-time interact with various sensors. These technologies focus on facilitating the use of future computing environments by keeping the human user in mind. The realtime interactive NUX/NUI technologies have rapidly emerged as an exciting new industry and life paradigm. These research has been the most comprehensive field focused on the various aspects of advances in information technologies, applications, and services. There might be many issues to realize and provide smart services and much effort and enormous attention have been focused on NUX/NUI technologies for the reality media services. Theoretical research contributions presenting new technologies, concepts, or analyses, reports on experiences and experiments of implementation and application of theories, and tutorials on new trends should be needed on IT research fields.

In particular, we argue to research methods that foster serendipitous encounters with music items and to integrate ways for social interaction while exploring music collections and discovering the gems in today's huge catalogs available through online streaming platforms. We identify two major challenges here: the need for (i) highly efficient clustering and information visualization techniques that scale to these music catalogs and (ii) novel user interfaces that explain the clustering of music items and provide means to make the exploration of music a social event.	cluster analysis;generic eclipse modeling system;information visualization;intelligent user interface;recommender system;streaming media	Markus Schedl	2017		10.1145/3039677.3039678	human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia;pop music automation;world wide web	Web+IR	-56.08704917400408	-36.76298715351816	80530

Our reasonably priced technological setup provides practical and expressive means for creating immersive and rich experiences to support physical exercise education in schools. Studies conducted in schools showed that the story and drama elements draw children into the world of the exercise game. Moreover, children who do not like traditional games and exercises engaged in these activities. Our experiences also suggest that children's imagination plays a great role in the design and engagement into exercise games, which makes co-creation with children a viable and exciting approach to creating new games.

The following quote (from a researcher at a major computer firm) is a bit extreme, but makes it clear the concern clear.  “From my point of view, natural language processing is unethical for one main reason: It plays on the central position which language holds in human behavior. I suggest that the deep involvement Weizenbaum found some people to have with ELIZA, is due to the intensity with which most people react to language in any form. When a person sees a lingusitic utterance in any form, the person reacts, much as a dog reacts to an odor. We are creatures of language .... Since this is so, it is my feeling that baiting people with strings of characters (tokens) clearly intended by someone to be interpreted as SYMBOLS, is as much misrepresentation as would be your attempt to sell me property for which you had a false deed. In both cases, an attempt is made to encourage someone to believe that something is a thing other than what it is, AND, only one party in the interaction is aware of the deception.”  This talk will examine the ethical and practical choices in developing machines which mimic human behavior.	eliza;natural language processing	Terry Winograd	1984		10.1145/800171.809648	template;computer science;artificial intelligence;human behavior;pipeline	AI	-56.58049926456999	-25.655125835014452	80663

In particular, the paper discusses the reliability of information that can be inferred from certain biological sensor data and ways in which positive benefits can be ensured or measured relating to the use of the feedback that can result from its use. One important and emerging application area for physiological feedback in interactive computing is in interactive art systems. In some respects, this application has been making strong progress for the particular reason that the interactive experience itself, rather than more abstract and problematic information handling, is at the core. Another interesting aspect of the applications in art is that they provide informal experimental investigations into these new forms of human–computer interaction, and artists are already devising new applications and interfaces for physiological information. The paper describes an art work employing physiological feedback, including a discussion of how it was built and of the participating audience reactions when exhibited. q 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The original contribution of this survey is two-fold: (1) Present a concise characterization of almost the entire spectrum of agent-based modelling and simulation tools, thereby highlighting the salient features, merits, and shortcomings of such multi-faceted application software; this article covers eighty five agent-based toolkits that may assist the system designers and developers with common tasks, such as constructing agent-based models and portraying the real-time simulation outputs in tabular/graphical formats and visual recordings. (2) Provide a usable reference that aids engineers, researchers, learners and academicians in readily selecting an appropriate agent-based modelling and simulation toolkit for designing and developing their system models and prototypes, cognizant of both their expertise and those requirements of their application domain. In a nutshell, a significant synthesis of Agent Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) resources has been performed in this review that stimulates further investigation into this topic. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Two rooms are showing a projected mirror, where the user can see and recognize himself. On the floor there is a spiral, containing a luminescent ball. When the user grabs the ball, spontaneously attempting to play with it, the projected mirror will start erasing, showing the other room. The ball, as an interface, will act on the video as an eraser on a pencil drawing. The two rooms / spaces are symmetrical.  After the complete erasure of the image, the mirror will show the remote room only. At this point the game flips: the ball, rubber and pencil at the same time, gets the capability to erase the other person / space / video. Therefore this deletion of the Otherness corresponds to the redrawing of the Self. You draw as much as you erase, in a direct proportion.  The process continues endlessly rendering the installation a social happening where the user becomes the main character of an improvised performance."""	ball project;rendering (computer graphics);self;spiral model;television	Eleonora Maria Irene Oreggia;Silvano Galliani	2007		10.1145/1291233.1291317	computer vision;interaction;simulation;computer science;operating system;machine learning;multimedia;world wide web;culture;computer graphics (images);technology	HCI	-52.60833164890474	-29.59804513064768	81195

However, Digital Emily was rendered offline, involved just the front of the face, and was never seen in a tight closeup. In this collaboration between Activision and USC ICT shown at SIGGRAPH 2013's Real-Time Live venue, we endeavoured to create a real-time, photoreal digital human character which could be seen from any viewpoint, in any lighting, and could perform realistically from video performance capture even in a tight closeup.

This schema is presented through diegetic quick time events presented in a way that is faithful to the conditions the game characters find themselves in. The match between player action and character action contributes to the process of identification and serves to make the choices feel more real to the player. A new type of “interaction-image” is theorized as a hybrid of game action and controller options that invites the contemplation of the virtual, further reinforcing the process of identification with the game’s characters. The interaction-image evolves from Deleuze’s categorization of cinema images and their relationship to space and time.	categorization;cinema 4d;emergence;immersion (virtual reality);interaction;quicktime;theory;vocabulary	Michael Nixon;Jim Bizzocchi	2013			pleasure;phenomenology (philosophy);categorization;immersion (virtual reality);psychology;contemplation;schema (psychology);artificial intelligence	HCI	-56.63898084702367	-30.707324824573348	81368

As part of ubiquitous computing that aims at combining the physical and the digital worlds, understanding how to design two-handed interaction is therefore important. This article presents a new design space for two-handed interaction, called 2M. The 2M design space takes its foundations in two complementary research domains: multimodal interaction and two-handed interaction. On the one hand we enrich the multimodal design space to take into account the roles of the two hands. On the other hand, we extend the two-handed interaction design space to cover the temporal as well as fusion aspects of multimodal interaction. This article presents the resulting 2M design space and demonstrates its descriptive power. We finally study the generative capacity of 2M for designing new forms of two-handed interaction in the context of the NavGraphe project that focuses on the interactive manipulation of very large biological structures (e.g., RNA structures).	espace;interaction design;multimodal interaction;ubiquitous computing	Gilles Bailly;Laurence Nigay;David Auber	2005		10.1145/1102613.1102649	simulation;interactive systems engineering;human–computer interaction;sonic interaction design;computer science;communication	HCI	-54.21983747197845	-36.448158175738165	81551

And by performance, I mean both “scored” material, as well as the ability to improvise.

Cognitive psychology approaches to spatial thinking consider how we think about space (i.e., thinking in space, and thinking about space) and how we use space to think (i.e., thinking with space). This paper outlines topics to be covered on each of these topics in a course on spatial thinking, with recommended readings for each topic. Depending on the audience, it might be appropriate to put more emphasis on fundamental understanding or to also address applications of spatial cognition research, for example in education or to the development of spatial technologies.

While advancements in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research offer considerable potential for supporting creative work practices, particularly collaborative practices, we believe this design space is underexplored. We invite researchers from the fields of HCI who are interested in creativity research to come together to further our understanding as well as explore opportunities for future research in this area. We will discuss workshop participants' visions and experiences in order to identify central themes that can shape the future design of digital tools in collaborative creative work.

Our participants' attachment to these experiences made them sensitive to the potential consequences of introducing new tools.

A cadaster is an official register that records land properties (e.g., location, ownership, value and size) for land valuation and taxation. Such mapping of old and new cadasters can help historians understand the social/economic background of changes in land uses or ownership. With JigsawMap, historians can continue mapping older or newer cadasters. In this way, JigsawMap can connect the past land survey results to today and to the future. We conducted usability studies and long term case studies to evaluate JigsawMap, and received positive responses. As well as summarizing the evaluation results, we also present design guidelines for participatory design projects with historians.	interactive visualization;usability;value (ethics)	Hyungmin Lee;Sooyun Lee;Namwook Kim;Jinwook Seo	2012		10.1145/2207676.2207740	cadastre;land use;simulation;interactive visualization;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;management;world wide web	HCI	-57.73227570226525	-31.878303627777733	83134

It is based on an IFIP [4] workshop that took place during the Interact’09 conference in Uppsala [3]. This workshop, co-organized by IFIP WG TC13.7 on ”HCI and Visualization” [2] and the European VisMaster Coordinated Action [5], surveyed and expanded our understanding of the cognitive and perceptual issues of interactive visualization and visual analytics and brought together researchers interested in these issues. It outlined the research required to understand what aspects of analysis match human capabilities most closely, and how interactive visual support should be designed and adapted to make optimal use of human capabilities in terms of information perception and processing. This is a challenging agenda that has to take into account many factors including user roles, tasks, collaborations, interests and previous knowledge as well as understanding the capabilities of display devices and computation methods for dealing with often very large data sets. The workshop goals required the cooperation of scientists from different disciplines addressing aspects of visualization and analysis. This enabled a mapping between foundational theories in the different research areas to support collaboration among researchers in these fields. This included researchers and developers already working at the intersection of HCI, visualization, visual analytics, and related areas such as data mining, data management, perception and cognition.	cognition;computation;data mining;display device;human–computer interaction;information visualization;interactive visualization;international federation for information processing;theory;visual analytics	Achim Ebert;Alan J.

First, the original definition of parasocial interaction by Horton and Wohl from 1956 will be defined and compared to the various uses of the theory in the field of digital games theories. In the following analysis it will be established that it is possible to enter into a parasocial relationship with many different constructs of digital entities, if they live up to the requirements for a constructed persona as established by Horton and Wohl. However, parasocial interaction in relation to the player's own digital representation might only be experienced in a digital game context when the player experiences himself as being separate from the character of the avatar.	entity;experience;game theory;requirement	Katrine Kavli	2012		10.1145/2393132.2393150	simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-57.5112328866876	-33.43504301132911	83343

In the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) there is an emerging and promising field of research that focuses on the study of gender differences in the use of computers and the Internet, as well as providing recommendations for the design of technology with gender perspective. In this article, we will present different methodological approaches that allow for the inclusion of a gender perspective in technology design, and, recommendations for the design and development of software focused on gender.

cab1efb469ca7225bb784bf7edb7012ec5c84a7c	multimodal interaction for data visualization		Multimodal interaction offers many potential benefits for data visualization. It can help people stay in the flow of their visual analysis and presentation, with the strengths of one interaction modality offsetting the weaknesses of others. Furthermore, multimodal interaction offers strong promise for leveraging data visualization on diverse display hardware including mobile, AR/VR, and large displays. However, prior research on visualization and interaction techniques has mostly explored a single input modality such as mouse, touch, pen, or more recently, natural language. The unique challenges and opportunities of synergistic multimodal interaction for data visualization have yet to be investigated. This workshop will bring together researchers with expertise in visualization, interaction design, and natural user interfaces. We aim to build a community of researchers focusing on multimodal interaction for data visualization, explore opportunities and challenges in our research, and establish an agenda for multimodal interaction research specifically for data visualization.

Visual programming approaches are limited in their usefulness if they do not include a profile of their users that defines exactly who is attempting to solve what kind of problems using which tools and why.

Knowledge of the mind sets, attitudes, and skills of endusers empowered by visual programming is important to understand the role of programming environments. For instance, most VCRs can be programmed, but VCRs are not considered programming environments, nor do most people using VCRs think of themselves as programmers enjoying the process of programming. For the majority of computer end-users the very notion of programming is daunting and, at the same time, completely secondary to the solution of a problem, such as taping a specific TV program. It is exactly this kind of programmer, who does not want to program, for whom visual programming could potentially make the biggest difference. Currently there are 90 million users of PCs — machines that are programmable — but the question is why should they want to program and what hope would they have to be able to program? Many people argue that programming a VCR is already so difficult that programming a much more complex device, such as a computer, would be an even more intricate process for that they see little hope of achieving. The following discussion refers to these kind of """"forced"""" programmers, but by no means implies that visual programming should completely focus on them.

The following discussion refers to these kind of """"forced"""" programmers, but by no means implies that visual programming should completely focus on them. In the past, some visual programming environments such as LabView [8] and Prograph [6] have successfully supported skilled programmers. Who is the programmer? With the next millennium in sight, the visual languages community is starting to take inventory of its successes and failures in order to develop new directions in which research can explore new ideas to increase the effectiveness of visual programming approaches. Several classification schemes [10, 18] have been proposed to structure a complex space populated with a variety of programming approaches. A nice and increasing set of cognitive dimensions [7] has not only been proposed but has also been used to evaluate and contrast both existing and hypothetical programming systems. Taxonomies and cognitive dimensions are important instruments of analysis, but they provide little information about the actual users of visual programming environments. Specifically, it is important to understand the backgrounds of users, their motivations, and their needs, and to get at least a sense of the problems they want to solve using visual programming environments. Visual language """"superlativism"""" — that is, the bias toward overly optimistic and general assertions about the positive value of visual programming, excellently surveyed by Blackwell [2] — is As a programmable machine, the computer holds enormous potential as the ultimate flexible medium — a kind of computational clay — for people to express themselves or to communicate information to other people in new ways. The idea of using or even creating a computer as a simulation or game environment is appealing to many people [21], but, unfortunately, the current programming approaches — visual or not — place the ability create these things out of reach for the majority of people. We believe that in order to make the computer a more malleable medium in the next millennium it is necessary to get a much better sense of exactly who these people that we are trying to empower with visual (or other kinds of) programming really are. We may have to reconceptualize the very process of programming and its role in society. While cognitive dimensions and programming approach taxonomies are necessary instruments, we may have to increasingly draw from other fields of study such as anthropology, ethnography, and sociology. These users are not likely to employ elaborate analytical top-down planning processes to create working programs. These circumstances leave user manuals unread, resulting in """"let's see what happens if I press this button"""" approaches. For typical Agentsheets users, the same situation holds true. That is, their main interest is to get a simulation running and not to write an elegantly generalizable program. Could this be a taste of what is to come for the next generation of end-user programmers? Turkle maintains that in the 1990s, as computing shifts away from a culture of calculation, bricolage has been given more room to flourish [21]. The emerging question is how a programming environment can accommodate bricolage. This paper can be little more than a small step toward this kind of goal. However, by drawing from experiences with a diverse group of users ranging from middle-school children creating educational simulations of the world (in which they live) to environmental design professionals simulating issues of sustainability in city planning, we hope to start a process of recon"""	agentsheets;blackwell (series);bricolage;central processing unit;cognitive dimensions of notations;compiler;computer science;defense in depth (computing);embedded system;end-user development;experience;fax;integrated development environment;java applet;java bytecode;java virtual machine;labview;next-generation network;nice (unix);personal computer;population;programmer;prograph;server (computing);simulation;small matter of programming;taxonomy (general);top-down and bottom-up design;videocassette recorder;visual language;visual programming language;web page	Alexander Repenning;Andri Ioannidou	1997		10.1109/VL.1997.626611	human–computer interaction;computer science;theoretical computer science;real time java;programming language	HCI	-60.842710241794265	-29.212260614485626	84082

417a5eff908260aa60288c4ec61597785214737f	ice-bound: combining richly-realized story with expressive gameplay		This paper describes the design and implementation of IceBound, an indie game that uses dynamic story techniques. Storygames with high narrative process intensity (where story is generated or recombined in algorithmically interesting ways, rather than being simply pre-authored) are still rare, in part because story creators are hesitant to cede control over output quality to a system. As a result, most readers still encounter digital fiction in the form of linear e-books or simple branching-path models of interactive story. Getting more dynamic models into the public consciousness requires exploring new frontiers of design space driven by the twin concerns of fiction authors (for high-quality story realization) and game designers (for frequent, high-impact player decisions). Our design for Ice-Bound rejects both branching-path models of interactive story as well as overly simulationist approaches, targeting a middle-road aesthetic of sculptural construction that marries a focus on quality output with the player’s exploration of both an emergent expressive space and an AR-enabled art book. Through implementing Ice-Bound, we developed design strategies and practical lessons useful to other interactive narrative designers, including three high-level lessons. First, quantifiable metrics and tools for content authoring for a combinatorial system are essential to maintain control over such a system. Second, authors should consider embedding highly dynamic but less narratively cohesive mechanics within layers of less dynamic but more tightly authored storytelling, so each part of the story can be told within a framework to which it is best suited. Finally, iterating the design of all story layers at once leads to tighter coupling between ludic and narrative levels and a stronger narrative experience overall.	algorithm;book;consciousness;e-book;emergence;high- and low-level;interactive storytelling;ludic interface	Aaron A.

A technology is developed that changes how people live. Over a period of time, the technology remains essen­ tially the same, with perhaps a few minimal changes. Then, sud­ denly, somebody comes up with a radically different technology that quickly makes the previous tech­ nology obsolete. Evolutionary biologists call this punctuated equilibrium. The term was first used in a paper by Ste­ phen Jay Gould and Niles Eldridge in 1972.1 Gould and Eldridge no­ ticed that, judging from the fossil record, species tended to exhibit little change over long periods of time and then to suddenly morph into something radically differ­ ent. In their paper, they referred to the long period without sig­ nificant change as “stasis” and the sudden change as a “morphologi­ cal discontinuity.” It’s not hard to see parallels in the technology world. Consider, for example, the telephone. For most of the 20th century, the telephone handset didn’t change much; eventually the rotary dial was replaced by a touchpad, and you could order a phone in colors other than black, but the functionality of the device remained much the same. Then, suddenly, toward the end of cen­ tury, the cell phone emerged. This new, invasive species quickly took over the habitat of the traditional landline telephone, and after cross­ breeding with the handheld com­ puter and wireless Internet, yet another species emerged—the smartphone. What causes these technologi­ cal leaps? Again, we can learn from the biologists. Changes in the environment can make life difficult for the old species and more favorable for the emerging species. Many paleontologists believe that a meteor impact 60 million years ago led to the ex­ tinction of the dinosaurs and the emergence of mammals. Simi­ larly, changes in the regulatory environment—specifically, the deregulation of the telephone industry in the 1980s—have con­ tributed to the decline of the landline telephone and rise of the mobile phone. However, not all emerging spe­ cies adapt successfully to a new environment. While humans, dogs, and cats have done well from an evolutionary standpoint, sabre­toothed tigers and mam­ moths have not—having long since gone extinct. Similarly, not all “next big thing” technologies have survived the test of time. Al­ though the cell phone has found its environmental niche, some of its contemporaries—like quad­ raphonic stereo, eight­track tapes, and citizens’ band radio—have been relegated to a dusty cor­ ner in the museum of forgotten technology.	color;cooperative breeding;emergence;fossil;habitat;handheld game console;landline;mobile phone;niche blogging;parallels desktop for mac;reflections of signals on conducting lines;rotary system;smartphone;the next big thing;touchpad;yet another	Thomas Jepsen	2011	IT Professional	10.1109/MITP.2011.107	knowledge management;data science;advertising;law;information technology;business studies	HCI	-58.39232346922205	-25.89320156280655	84496

b1637f2fe5258f7bf4e86566c51e1ad889600d5d	pattern sequences		1. Introduction At EuroPLoP 2001 we had a session on pattern sequences. It started with a small exposition of ideas from Alexander, mostly from his explicit discussion of sequences in a draft of his forthcoming work The Nature of Order. But the meeting quickly segued into stories from experience, including some brilliant sequences from workshop attendees. There were particularly powerful contributions from Alan O'Callaghan and Rebecca Rikner. Neil Harrison and Jim Coplien decided to get something started here that recalls and captures that experience. If you have ideas to add to this, please write to us at the above addresses. We pattern folks have gathered patterns, but have not gathered sequences. Nevertheless, the sequences were there all the time, we just didn't notice. And we were registering them unawares. A sequence is one path through a pattern language. It is the process we follow to build something. After we got a critical mass of patterns (in an area), we could arrange them in a language (static), and we could trace sequences through the language. The sequences we trace may well have come from the sequences that lodged themselves in our brains earlier. Note that patterns happen in much the same way. We didn't notice patterns, either. After the fact, the patterns began to emerge. But sequences are a level beyond patterns; they are even harder to immediately perceive. You may be able to get at them only through patterns—like moving leaves make wind visible to us, patterns make the sequences visible. To get it [a sequence], a static pattern language similar to the languages illustrated earlier, was then restated as a generative sequence. In its sequence form it shows the user the process of unfolding, in sequence, in such a way as to allow a good building to be made, very easily, for the particular conditions of a given site. (Christopher Alexander, Nature of Order Volume 2, p. 303) Now, think about the master builder—master builders don't use patterns consciously, nor do they use sequences consciously. The patterns just flow from one to another. See comment below under Architecture. Indeed the nature of order is interwoven in its fundamental character with the nature of processes which create the order (Christopher Alexander, The Nature of Order, p. 8) The idea is that you build beautiful systems using the fundamental process: order comes from the process that creates the order.

This research proposes the concept of ‘perceptive media’ in which the content creators have at their disposal different tools and sensors to allow for the subtle adaption of the narrative without any direct interactions from the audience members. The concept is demonstrated through the creation of a ‘perceptive radio’ that is able to play specially designed content that adapts to the physical and social context in which the radio resides.

However, there are many design processes that, often for good reason, remain technology-centred. We present a case study of introducing scenarios into two digital library development processes. This was found to disrupt established patterns of working and to bring together conflicting value systems. In particular, the human factors approach of identifying users and anticipating what they are likely to do with a system (and what problems they might encounter) did not sit well with a development culture in which the rapid generation and informal evaluation of possible solutions (that are technically feasible and compatible with stable system components) is the norm. We found that developers tended to think in terms of two kinds of user: one who was exploring the system with no particular goal in mind and one who knew as much as the developer; scenarios typically work with richer user descriptions that challenge that thinking. In addition, the development practice of breaking down the design problem into discrete functions to make it manageable does not fit well with a scenario-based approach to thinking about user behaviour and interactions. The compromise reached was scenario-informed design, whereby scenarios were generated to support reasoning about the use of selected functions within the system. These scenarios helped create productive common ground between perspectives.	digital library;human factors and ergonomics;interaction;mind;software design;user-centered design;value (ethics)	Ann Blandford;Suzette Keith;Richard Butterworth;Bob Fields;Dominic Furniss	2007	Interacting with Computers	10.1016/j.intcom.2006.07.003	digital library;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;software engineering;management;world wide web;software development process	HCI	-62.497446838499094	-34.73803376865446	86122

Indeed, our experience with various publics allows us to notice that technology definitions pose ambiguity and representation problems for informed as well as novice users. In this paper we present Immercity, a content curation system designed in the context of a collaboration between the University of Montpellier and CapGemini, to deliver a technology watch.

fcef2b4f1f0398d87c4e1b4b50ca2f5556cd5e0b	procedural content generation in games		This chapter introduces the field of procedural content generation (PCG), as well as the book. We start by defining key terms, such as game content and procedural generation. We then give examples of games that use PCG, outline desirable properties, and provide a taxonomy of different types of PCG. Applications of and approaches to PCG can be described in many different ways, and another section is devoted to seeing PCG through the lens of design metaphors. The chapter finishes by providing an overview of the rest of the book. 1.1 What is procedural content generation? You have just started reading a book about Procedural Content Generation in Games. This book will contain quite a lot of algorithms and other technical content, and plenty of discussion of game design. But before we get to the meat of the book, let us start with something a bit more dry: definitions. In particular, let us define Procedural Content Generation, which we will frequently abbreviate as PCG. The definition we will use is that PCG is the algorithmic creation of game content with limited or indirect user input [32]. In other words, PCG refers to computer software that can create game content on its own, or together with one or many human players or designers. A key term here is “content”. In our definition, content is most of what is contained in a game: levels, maps, game rules, textures, stories, items, quests, music, weapons, vehicles, characters, etc. The game engine itself is not considered to be content in our definition. Further, non-player character behaviour—NPC AI—is not considered to be content either. The reason for this narrowing of the definition of content is that within the field of artificial and computational intelligence in games, there is much more research done in applying CI and AI methods to character behaviour than there is on procedural content generation. While the field of PCG is mostly based on AI methods, we want to set it apart from the more “mainstream” 1 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016 N. Shaker et al., Procedural Content Generation in Games, Computational Synthesis and Creative Systems, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-42716-4_1 2 Julian Togelius, Noor Shaker, and Mark J. Nelson use of game-based tasks to test AI algorithms, where AI is most often used to learn to play a game. Like all definitions (except perhaps those in mathematics), our definition of PCG is somewhat arbitrary and rather fuzzy around the edges. We will treat it as such, and are mindful that other people define the term differently. In particular, some would rather use the term “generative methods” for a superset of what we call PCG [8]. Another important term is “games”. Games are famously hard to define (see Wittgenstein’s discussion of the matter [36]), and we will not attempt this here. Suffice it to say that by games we mean such things as videogames, computer games, board games, card games, puzzles, etc. It is important that the content generation system takes the design, affordances and constraints of the game that it is being generated for into account. This sets PCG apart from such endeavours as generative art and many types of computer graphics, which do not take the particular constraints and affordances of game design into account. In particular, a key requirement of generated content is that it must be playable—it should be possible to finish a generated level, ascend a generated staircase, use a generated weapon or win a generated game. The terms “procedural” and “generation” imply that we are dealing with computer procedures, or algorithms, that create something. A PCG method can be run by a computer (perhaps with human help), and will output something. A PCG system refers to a system that incorporates a PCG method as one of its parts, for example an adaptive game or an AI-assisted game design tool. This book will contain plenty of discussion of algorithms and quite a lot of pseudocode, and most of the exercises that accompany the chapters will involve programming. To make this discussion more concrete, we will list a few things we consider to be PCG: • A software tool that creates dungeons for an action adventure game such as The Legend of Zelda without any human input—each time the tool is run, a new level is created; • a system that creates new weapons in a space shooter game in response to what the collective of players do, so that the weapons that a player is presented with are evolved versions of weapons other players found fun to use; • a program that generates complete, playable and balanced board games on its own, perhaps using some existing board games as starting points; • game engine middleware that rapidly populates a game world with vegetation; • a graphical design tool that lets a user design maps for a strategy game, while continuously evaluating the designed map for its gameplay properties and suggesting improvements to the map to make it better balanced and more interesting. In the upcoming chapters, you will find descriptions of all of those things described above. Let us now list a few things that we do not consider to be PCG: • A map editor for a strategy game that simply lets the user place and remove items, without taking any initiative or doing any generation on its own; • an artificial player for a board game; • a game engine capable of integrating automatically generated vegetation.	ascend;algorithm;computation;computational intelligence;computer graphics;design tool;game engine;graphical user interface;level editor;map;middleware;np-completeness;pc game;population;procedural generation;procedural programming;programming tool;pseudocode;springer (tank);switzerland;the legend of zelda;video game design	Noor Shaker;Julian Togelius;Mark J.

This piece, and also the sonification, is exactly 300 seconds long. My aim is to provide a sonification/composition that can be created in (near) real-time and takes its title literally. This is done by loading the data into a software program Artwonk by John Dunn and performing all mappings in real-time. The results are, again in real-time, sent to several software samplers that ‘play’ the music. Software samplers were chosen because of their low CPU cycle consumption. If the number of sonification data streams is low (3 to 5) near real-time sonification is certainly possible.	computer program;instruction cycle;real-time clock;real-time computing;sonification	Hans Van Raaij	2004			appreciative listening	ML	-53.32146070007299	-24.880017037534053	86861

To take advantage of powerful human vision, we generate visualizations for people to view and to understand the underlying data. However, these a thousand words do not necessarily tell the truth about the data. A good visualization can make the data understanding process effective, while a bad visualization may hinder the process, even convey misleading information. To produce effective visualizations, it is important for us to have a good understanding of how people actually perceive and process the visual information. People view visualizations using their eyes, and tracking their eye movements can be a useful method for this purpose. In this talk, I will present a series eye tracking studies on how people read graphs. These studies demonstrate that: 1) eye tracking is an effective method for gaining insights into how people read graphs, and 2) how obtained insights from eye tracking can be used to inform the design of visualizations.	a picture is worth a thousand words;effective method;eye tracking;information;soul;tell-tale	Weidong Huang	2012	2012 Ninth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization	10.1109/CGIV.2012.11	computer vision;simulation;information visualization;computer science;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-57.631641485725886	-31.88645764594309	87112

E. Adams distinguished between tactical, strategic and fictional immersions. In Half-Real, J. Juul has notoriously declared that video games encompass two things: fictional worlds and real rules. Many approaches stress the distinct nature of the immersive experience in games on account of their participatory nature. By contrast, M. Csikszentmihalyi’s model of flow – a common foundation to discuss immersion in sports and games – has been applied without any modifications to art appreciation, an “activity” that many would argue doesn’t propose clear goals and retroactions. Is there any common ground between games and fictional forms that can help us understand the cultural magnitude achieved by their synthesis through the video game medium? Building on current doctoral research and on Jean-Marie Schaeffer’s effort to theorize our involvement with digital worlds as a continuation of the fictional immersion experienced in other media, this contribution seeks to evaluate the relevance of a general framework to discuss immersion. The optimization of experience in both video games and fiction films, and the various strategies that seek to shape an ideal immersive for us to inhabit, serves as foundation for the discussion.	continuation;immersion (virtual reality);immersive technology;jean;list of code lyoko characters;ludic interface;mathematical optimization;poor posture;relevance	Carl Therrien	2009			psychology;simulation;game mechanics;multimedia;communication	HCI	-60.0044259302922	-32.89773638954163	87152

The cheap digital storage also encourages people to take lots of photos as they want. However, due to the tremendous amount of digital photos, it is not easy for people to browse all of them. Therefore, some techniques are proposed to help people to enjoy the photos, although it may be difficult for some people to arrange a time slot to watch them intentionally. Hence, in this extended abstract, we propose a system, which can utilize the large number of photos as the program themes (background), so that people will not notice the synthesized background while they are working, but the program themes may still be able to remind their good memory when they taking a short rest.	browsing;digital camera;theme (computing)	Kai-Yin Cheng;Ko-Yuan Chou;Sheng-Jie Luo;Bing-Yu Chen	2009		10.1145/1599301.1599357	seam carving;computer vision;simulation;computer science;feedback;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-60.31127688326101	-26.562409379585798	87576

A  specific configuration interface was realized to support the user in expressing and envisioning his creativity: by altering  some specific parameters of the model implemented in the system, he/she can effectively change the behaviour of the adaptive  lightning and immediately visualize the implications of his choice on parameters’ values. This experience has been further  developed towards the realization of a product based on the same model and approach: a configurable modular adaptive lightning  system. The paper presents the starting scenario and its main characteristics, then the model supporting adaptive lightning  is introduced. The model configuration and envisioning interface is described and the recent developments towards a product  based on the model and configuration system conclude the paper.

The farmer, as we have come to think of these first revolutionaries, was able by his husbandry to feed himself and several others, freeing those from the need to feed themselves. They turned to making things, spades for the garden, buckets and bowls for the house, chariots and ships in which to explore the world. They began to write and record, to frame laws and protect large areas from their enemies. Many must have mourned the loss of a simpler more innocent existence, indeed the story of the garden of Eden may reflect this, but the change broadened mankind, the population grew and spread.

Participants communicate primarily by speech and are represented as colored circles in a two-dimensional space. Behaviors such as subgroup conversations and social navigation are supported through circle mobility as mediated by the environment and the crowd and distance-based attenuation of the audio. The circles serve as platforms for the display of identity, presence and activity: graphics are synchronized to participants' speech to aid in speech-source identification and participants can sketch in their circle, allowing a pictorial and gestural channel to complement the audio. We note user experiences through informal studies as well as design challenges we have faced in the creation of a rich environment for computer-mediated communication.	computer-mediated communication;graphics;image;multimodal interaction	Roy Rodenstein;Judith S.

As such, it is closely connected to the disciplines of zoology, animal science, behavioural ecology and non-human genetics. Only rarely (in reality, almost never) is this concept deployed in relation to human population movement. Yet, as a result of colonisation, globalisation, intermarriage, wars, political unrest and other diasporic forces, increasing numbers of migrants and asylum seekers now settle in places far away from their countries of birth. Travel, often involving long distances back and forth between people's adoptive and natal homelands, and frequently taking place on a repetitive, seasonal, basis, has become a significant contemporary phenomenon. In the Yugoslav-born, Australian conceptual sculptor Marijana Tadic's recent installation and sculptural exhibitions, collectively titled Wandering Albatross, exhibited in South Australia February-March 2011, the artist has appropriated the concept of philopatry, applying it to ideas about contemporary patterns of migrancy with thrilling conceptual and aesthetic results.	asylum;coherence (physics);dos;ecology;kinesis (keyboard);no-wandering-domain theorem;population;relocation (computing);testament;unrest	Christine Nicholls	2011	2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation	10.1109/IV.2011.105	geography;archaeology;ecology	Robotics	-56.37113752170969	-26.577114635389716	89281

However, this does not guarantee the identification of requirements for technology development. This paper argues that a more systematic approach is needed for choosing and making best use of a driving problem for CVE technology. The method consists of identifying the stakeholders in the technology development project. A series of issues must then be addressed: choice of problem area, choice of application, choice of research approach, design of the application, ensuring use by real users, choice of method of study, and identification of technology requirements. The method is illustrated by considering the development of the Deva CVE system with an art-based application and with an educational application.	common vulnerabilities and exposures;requirement	William L.

The academic discipline of art history and its subjects are currently undergoing changes that will lead to a rising importance of computers. However, the computer is generally not the art historian's tool of choice. We feel that this is due to existing GUI systems not fully meeting researchers' needs. We therefore propose a design for a tabletop tangible user interface considering art historians' desire """"to collect things as tokens"""" [1] and to remain within traditional techniques. We present a case study of the usage of image cards within iconographic work. Based on our results, we derive implications for the design of the tangible interface that integrates approved traditional paper based techniques with the advantages of digital representation."""	computer;graphical user interface;tangible user interface	Tanja Döring;Steffi Beckhaus	2007		10.1145/1226969.1226986	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-56.013455393557024	-36.68416637516529	89611

In this paper we present a design exercise that has a strong focus on the body and how interaction is experienced. The exercise utilizes the designer's own bodily experiences in the design of new tangible interfaces. The design exercise was done with a group of design students. We asked them to design interactive sculptures to convey the interaction qualities they had extracted from video material. The interactive sculptures served as a physical reflective tool that allowed the students to test and experience the qualities of interaction they wanted to bring into a new design, before they moved on to designing the actual product. We conclude that interactive sculptures serve as a rich design material that provide the students with relevant insights and a richer vocabulary concerning interaction qualities from a bodily perspective.	experience;tangible user interface;vocabulary	Mads Vedel Jensen;Marcelle A.

Designers have problems designing good web sites, and it would be reasonable to anticipate that they will have problems creating good digital libraries via the web. The immediate research challenge is to ensure that designers do things well from the start. Remedial work correcting problems can be both time-consuming and extremely costly. How can designers be helped? This paper describes a framework for an application development model to help designers build user-centred digital libraries. The objective of this model is to define essential design and usability issues that are crucial to the success of digital libraries.	digital library;library (computing);usability	Yin Leng Theng	1999			digital transformation;user experience design;digital library;web design;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;information design;rapid application development;world wide web	HCI	-56.16679326137278	-32.96542467644997	90017

In animal-computer interaction (ACI) the idea of intuitive use holds great potential as it offers a way to conceptualize and further design better interaction. With the aim to inform future design, this paper discusses how the notion of intuitive use can be applied to interaction design for non-human animal users. We argue that tangible user interfaces together with knowledge transfer from other domains familiar to the animal may allow intuitive use of digital technology. Examples will be drawn from an ongoing game design research project which aims to build digital games for Bornean orangutans.	digital data;digital electronics;human–computer interaction;interaction design;simulation;tangible user interface	Hanna E.

These connections can be made by choosing from different criteria: teachers, pupils, influenced by, influenced on, human figure, landscape, drawing and paintings. The data for this project was provided by the RKD (Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie) and an application built with Java and Javascript was used for its display. This application is an innovative tool that is helpful to display museums data in an efficient fashion, which can be a good support for visualizing and connecting data in museums and exhibitions (and can be used with different artists data).

13c35596fa8f862136305508d085443f8eb36c5a	design principles for dependable robotic assistants	design principle;multi modal communication;dependability;long term experiments;cooperative learning	A large number of functionalities have been integrated into a single fully autonomous humanoid robot, HERMES. To evaluate the dependability of this extremely complex machine, and its ability to interact with strangers, HERMES was exhibited in a museum, far away from its home laboratory, for more than six months. During this period the robot and its skills were regularly demonstrated to the public by non-expert presenters up to 12 hours per day. Also, HERMES interacted with the visitors, chatted with them in English, French and German, answered questions and performed services as requested by them. Only three major failures occurred during the 6-month period, all of them caused by failures of commercially available modules that could easily be replaced. The key to this success was the dependability that had been originally designed into HERMES. During the design process certain design principles were followed in both hardware and software. These principles are introduced, and some longand short-term experiments carried out with the real robot in real environments are presented. In fact, by demonstrating HERMES in the museum, at trade fairs and in TV studios — besides our institute environment — we have learned valuable lessons, especially regarding the interaction of a complex robotic assistant with unknown humans. Although we did not quantitatively evaluate the robot’s performance or acceptance by the non-expert users, several qualitative results are given in this paper, and many videos highlighting these results can be downloaded from the HERMES homepage.	autonomous robot;dependability;experiment;humanoid robot	Rainer Bischoff;Volker Graefe	2004	I.

656fb4404ce873095dcc99717b15c7fb3bd3d182	it takes two, baby: style and tangibles for recommending and interacting with videos		Children, nowadays, are great consumers of media for them [6], and there is growing interest towards novel mechanisms that can consider their specific needs and improve both the recommendation process and output of videos for them. Children, in fact, have unique characteristics, which change with age. In particular, in the 8–12 age range, they like challenging interactions with systems, they enjoy exploring and “to feel the experts”. The majority of current recommendation solutions are unable to leverage on such specific features of children, and others, when interacting with them and recommending adequate videos. In this paper, we introduce ITTuB, an exploratory project, set at the intersection of recommender system and interaction design for children. Starting from previous research in the two areas, it plans to introduce tangibles for enhancing the interaction of children with videos, and to leverage stylistic features of videos in order to deliver recommendations that are optimized for children. This workshop paper presents the main ideas of ITTuB.	interaction design;recommender system	Mehdi Elahi;Rosella Gennari;Alessandra Melonio;Francesco Ricci	2018				HCI	-58.78988564927601	-37.02011528550851	90952

The main contribution of the paper is to design and add some functionalities to the games in order to transform them in serious games, that is, in games with learning and educational purposes. To do that, at the beginning of the game, players choose one or several topics and during the game, players have to anwers questions on these topics in order to move their markers. We choose classic board games because a lot of people are familiar with them so it is very easy to start to play without wasting time learning game rules and, we think that this is an important element to make the game more attractive to people.

Visualisation makes data easier to understand through direct sensory experience (usually visual), as opposed to more linguistic/logical reasoning. This chapter examines reasons for using information visualisation both for professional data analysts and also end-users. It will also look at some of the history of visualisation (going back 4,500 years), classic examples of information visualisations, and some current challenges for visualisation research and practice. Design of effective visualisation requires an appreciation of human perceptual, cognitive and also organisational and social factors, and the chapter discusses some of these factors and the design issues and principles arising from them.	data structure;graphics;information visualization;interactive visualization;scientific visualization;volume rendering	Alan J.

Such applications motivate the development of ever more intelligent and capable autonomous robots and technologies that can work collaboratively with people in human environments. In the consumer marketplace, intelligent conversational technologies are entering the home at a surprising rate as Internet of Things devices are enabled by AI-based SDKs. Affordable social robots are also poised to enter the market as mass consumer products and 3rd party developer platforms. The importance of developing and understanding the beneficial and longitudinal impact of such technologies on daily life never been more relevant. This keynote presentation highlights a number of provocative research findings from the Personal Robots Group at the MIT Media Lab along these themes. We develop social robots and apply them as a new kind of scientific tool to understand human behavior. We then use these insights to design and develop social robots that can longitudinally engage people to enhance quality of life outcomes. In this presentation, we highlight relevant work in healthcare and early childhood education.  Research in social robotics builds a critical foundation for real world applications. Social robots can be viewed as a new medium for content that is capable of humanized engagement. As such, social robots are a highly differentiated and compelling platform for 3rd party content and app developers.

Drawing on a three-year ethnographic study, this paper reports on the digital video production and appropriation of approximately 200 older people (aged 60–85). They generated 320 videos over the course of the study. We show their motivations for engaging in digital video production, discuss their planned video making, and highlight their creativity while editing videos. We show the different meanings they ascribed to digital videos in their social appropriation of these objects, the meaningful strategies they adopted to share videos, and the impact on their perceived wellbeing. Furthermore, we outline the solutions the participants developed to overcome or cope with interaction issues they faced over time. We argue that the results portray older people as active and creative makers of digital videos with current video ca...	digital video	Susan M.

The artwork was developed using extended Microsoft® XNA#8482; game-engine technology and over 300 motion-capture sequences to produce an algorithmically driven world of virtual characters. The real-time application uses 6 interactive torches to reveal a world of thirty 'humans', inspired by the Samuel Beckett piece of prose The Lost Ones (1972). Infrared cameras capture the torch users and display the real-time video inside the virtual world, as a strategy of augmentation. This paper explains both the technologies of the display system Re-Actor and the artwork together with philosophical underpinning of UNMAKEABLELOVE as a future form of situated cybernetic theatre and the potential for large-scale stereographic situated gaming.	algorithm;augmented reality;cybernetics;digital camera;game engine;humans;motion capture;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;situated;stereoscopy;torch;virtual world	Sarah Kenderdine;Jeffrey Shaw	2009		10.1145/1690388.1690460	simulation;engineering;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-48.76349747066322	-32.8021218510524	92372

A scenario based approach is used to elicit real-world requirements, with further data captured through user profiling, task analysis and context definition using experts in relevant domains. Specific scenarios and profiles are analysed and generic requirements proposed as an initial step to encourage user need before unsolicited software design is imposed.	computer;information needs;requirement;software design;task analysis	Paul Ryan;Enda Finn	2005		10.1145/1085777.1085849	user interface design;user;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;scenario;software design;task analysis;automatic identification and data capture	SE	-52.54308814716896	-37.97094074896523	92466

So far, the use of this technique for the evaluation of visual analytics and visualization is less prominent. We investigate recent scientific publications from the main visualization and visual analytics conferences and journals that include an evaluation by eye tracking. Furthermore, we provide an overview of evaluation goals that can be achieved by eye tracking and state-of-the-art analysis techniques for eye tracking data. Ideally, visual analytics leads to a mixed-initiative cognitive system where the mechanism of distribution is the interaction of the user with visualization environments. Therefore, we also include a discussion of cognitive approaches and models to include the user in the evaluation process. Based on our review of the current use of eye tracking evaluation in our field and the cognitive theory, we propose directions of future research on evaluation methodology, leading to the grand challenge of developing an evaluation approach to the mixed-initiative cognitive system of visual analytics.	artificial intelligence;eye tracking;grand challenges;scientific literature;visual analytics	Kuno Kurzhals;Brian D.

7fb17a95330baa26fc668be7d5fca0522267e1f3	extracting insights from experience designers to enhance user experience design		User Experience (UX) summarizes how a user expects, perceives and assesses an encounter with a product. User Experience Design (UXD) aims at creating meaningful experiences. While UXD is a rather young discipline within product development and traditional processes predominate, other disciplines traditionally focus on creating experiences. We engaged with experience designers from the fields of arts, movies, sports, music and event management. By analyzing their working processes via interviews and observations we extracted triggers that can possibly lead to outstanding experiences in the original disciplines as well as in UXD: incorporating and shaping the atmosphere of interaction, balancing new and established aspects, connecting products with attributes of living beings, providing challenge and competition, enabling inductive and multifaceted learning and interaction processes, and using souvenir artifacts for connecting user and product after usage.	user experience design	Simon Kremer;Udo Lindemann	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40409-7_29	user experience design;human–computer interaction;experience design;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-60.793024377939744	-36.15140936538474	92859

Issues such as fear, loneliness, dependency, and physical decline may be hard to observe or discuss in interviews. Pastiche scenarios and pastiche personae are techniques that employ characters to create a space for the discussion of new technological developments and user experience. This paper argues that the use of fictional characters can help to overcome restrictive notions of older people by disrupting designers’ prior assumptions. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences using pastiche techniques in two separate technology design projects that sought to address the needs of older people. In the first pastiche scenarios were developed by the designers of the system and used as discussion documents with users. In the second pastiche personae were used by groups of users themselves to generate scenarios which were scribed for later use by the design team. We explore how the use of fictional characters and settings can generate new ideas and undercut the potential in scenarios, for weak characterisation of “the user” to permit scenario writers to fit characters to technology rather than vice versa. To assist in future development of pastiche techniques in designing for older people, we provide an array of fictional older characters drawn from literary and popular culture.	interaction design;iteration;persona (user experience);rounding;technological singularity;user experience	Mark Blythe;Andrew M.

The costume designer has to put a lot of creative and investigative effort into the creation of costumes to provide the right clothes for a particular role, which means the costume reflects the place and time of play as well as it shows understanding of the characteristics of the role, actor and screenplay overall. Consequently, the creation of a costume is a difficult problem that is more or less occurring often, whereas the frequency of problem occurrence strongly depends on the genre and specifics of the film. For the genre of Western films, for example, the costume of a Wild West Sheriff is qualified for identification and description as a pattern because it appears frequently. In this paper, we propose a pattern language for composing costume patterns through a rich set of composition operators, more fine-grained costume patterns, and costume primitives. The pattern language aims at supporting media science, costume design, and costume management through providing a basis for the development of advanced information systems assisting the management of costumes considering their inherent structure and relations between their constituent parts. Our pattern approach is exemplified through deep-dive modeling of two costume patterns.	information system;pattern language	David Schumm;Johanna Barzen;Frank Leymann;Lutz Ellrich	2012		10.1145/2602928.2603083	humanities;costume design;engineering;multimedia;communication	AI	-59.45775308308793	-30.796934607423832	93581

e8bb178348141dd55e6e21d9d93d4b4bb771a05b	tutorial: making better use of the crowd		Over the last decade, crowdsourcing has been used to harness the power of human computation to solve tasks that are notoriously difficult to solve with computers alone, such as determining whether or not an image contains a tree, rating the relevance of a website, or verifying the phone number of a business. The natural language processing and machine learning communities were early to embrace crowdsourcing as a tool for quickly and inexpensively obtaining annotated data to train systems. Once this data is collected, it can be handed off to algorithms that learn to perform basic tasks such as translation or parsing. Many times this handoff is where interaction with the crowd ends. The crowd provides the data, but the ultimate goal is to eventually take humans out of the loop. Are there better ways to make use of the crowd? In this tutorial, I will begin with a showcase of innovative uses of crowdsourcing that go beyond data collection and annotation. I will discuss direct applications to natural language processing and machine learning, hybrid intelligence or “human in the loop” AI systems, and large scale studies of human behavior in online systems. I will then dive into recent research aimed at understanding who crowdworkers are, how they behave, and what this can teach us about best practices for interacting with the crowd. I will debunk the common myth that crowdsourcing platforms are riddled with bad actors out to scam requesters. In particular, I will describe the results of a research study that showed that crowdworkers on the whole are basically honest, and describe what requestors can do to encourage this honest behavior. I will talk about experiments that have explored how to boost the quality and quantity of crowdwork by appealing to both well-designed monetary incentives (such as performance-based payments) and intrinsic sources of motivation (such as curiosity or a sense of doing meaningful work). I will then discuss recent research—both qualitative and quantitative—that has opened up the black box of crowdsourcing to uncover that crowdworkers are not independent contractors, but rather a network of workers with a rich communication structure. Taken as a whole, this research has a lot to teach us about how to most effectively interact with the crowd. Throughout the tutorial, I will discuss best practices for engaging with crowdworkers that are rarely mentioned in the literature but make a huge difference in whether or not your research studies succeed.

This paper proposes the main research goals in providing users with a personalized interface and content independent of physical networked devices, and space and time. As a case study, we describe an indoors, mobile mixed reality guide system: Chloe@University. With a see-through head-mounted display (HMD) connected to a small wearable computing device, Chloe@University provides users with an efficient way to guide someone in a building. A 3D virtual character in front of the user guides him/her to the required destination.	anna karlin;content adaptation;continuation;converge;distributed networking;guidance system;head-mounted display;information sciences institute;interaction;interactive media;international components for unicode;mixed reality;personalization;seamless3d;switzerland;wearable computer;wearable technology	Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann;Achille Peternier;Xavier Righetti;Mingyu Lim;George Papagiannakis;Tasos Fragopoulos;Kyriaki Lambropoulou;Paolo Barsocchi;Daniel Thalmann	2008	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-008-0264-6	computer-mediated reality;simulation;wearable computer;human–computer interaction;content management;computer science;optical head-mounted display;mixed reality;multimedia;interactive media;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-49.2118535614063	-37.97259548128262	94175

Both the operation and the evaluation of recommender system applications are most often driven by analyzing the behavior of users. In this paper, we argue that listening to what users say about the items and recommendations they like, the control they wish to exert on the output, and the ways in which they perceive the system and not just observing what they do will enable important developments in the future of recommender systems. We provide both philosophical and pragmatic motivations for this idea, describe the various points in the recommendation and evaluation processes where explicit user input may be considered, and discuss benefits that may result from considered incorporation of user preferences at each of these points. In particular, we envision recommender applications that aim to support users' better selves: helping them live the life that they desire to lead. For example, recommender-assisted behavior change requires algorithms to predict not what users choose or do now, inferable from behavioral data, but what they should choose or do in the future to become healthier, fitter, more sustainable, or culturally aware. We hope that our work will spur useful discussion and many new ideas for recommenders that empower their users.	algorithm;programming paradigm;recommender system;user (computing)	Michael D.

Longevity of digital hard copy materials is affected by the stability of the material and the storage conditions. Secondly, the digital files that are the counterpart of the conventional negatives need to be readable not only on various systems and platforms today but also in the future. Third, the encoding of digital images should be such that any improvement in processing algorithms and display/output technologies can be applied in future image workflows. The safe keeping of digital data requires an active and regular maintenance of the data. This paper will discuss encoding issues for archival images and strategies to make image preservation happen for digital photographs.	algorithm;digital data;digital photography;human-readable medium	Franziska S.

What characteristics of Communication Appliances affect how users keep track of who is connected to whom? We developed the Com-Bar, a simple communication appliance, to act as a test-bed for comparing the effect of personalisation of exchanged images and separation across groups. Users made significantly more errors and took longer in the non-personalised and non-separated groups. However, adding either personalisation or separating the groups improved performance significantly, with optimal performance for non-personalised, separated groups.	ambient awareness;bibliothèque de l'école des chartes;chi;channel (communications);human factors and ergonomics;linear algebra;peripheral;personalization;secam;schmidt decomposition;testbed	Nicolas Masson;Wendy E.

Through its turn to user experience, the community was able to create products whose use is pleasant and exciting. There are, however, design contexts where the corresponding focus on fostering use might be in need of a complementing perspective. During the last couple of years, the topic of technology non-use has appeared within the scope of HCI. Within this text, we will explore how these recent conceptualisations and anlyses can be employed in order to turn non-use into a design resource. We do so by discussing them in the context of a concrete development project aimed at creating interactive technology for exhibition contexts.	human–computer interaction;requirement;user experience	Michael Heidt;Kalja Kanellopoulos;Linda Pfeiffer;Paul Rosenthal	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20886-2_5	knowledge management;user experience design;critical technical practice;business	HCI	-61.26400087178571	-35.321491820173435	94678

dd65d8188486aab16269cb072af745e683083cc7	a roadmap towards versatile mir		Most MIR systems are specifically designed for one application and one cultural context and suffer from the semantic gap between the data and the application. Advances in the theory of Bayesian language and information processing enable the vision of a versatile, meaningful and accurate MIR system integrating all levels of information. We propose a roadmap to collectively achieve this vision.	information processing	Emmanuel Vincent;Stanislaw Andrzej Raczynski;Nobutaka Ono;Shigeki Sagayama	2010			computer vision;simulation	AI	-55.92083400884266	-35.18742135765474	94983

Interactive technology demonstration systems produced typically at the end of their projects show great potential for taking advantage of technological possibilities.These demo systems or “demonstrators” are, even if crude or farfetched, a significant manifestation of the technologists’ visions in transforming emerging technologies into novel usage scenarios and applications. In this paper, we reflect on design processes and crucial design decisions made while designing some successful, web-based interactive demonstrators developed by the authors.We identifymethodological issues in applying today’s requirementdriven usability engineering method to designing this type of novel applications and solicit a clearer distinction between designing mainstream applications and designing novel applications. More solution-oriented approaches leveraging design thinking are required, and more pragmatic evaluation criteria is needed that assess the role of the system in exploiting the technological possibilities to provoke further brainstorming and discussion. Such an approach will support a more efficient channelling of the technology-to-application transformation which are becoming increasingly crucial in today’s context of rich technological possibilities.	computation;computer vision;experiment;exploit (computer security);human–computer interaction;information retrieval;interaction design;interactivity;noise shaping;semantic web;usability engineering;usability testing;user research;web application;wireless access point	Hyowon Lee;Nazlena Mohamad Ali;Lynda Hardman	2013	Adv.

Over fifteen years of research on multimodal interaction at Telecooperation have led to the compilation of a list of important issues for HCI and UI concepts, appropriate for the ‘post PC’ era of computing: (1) Integration of HCI & SW engineering: the two research disciplines HCI and software engineering, and in particular their models, notations, and mehods, must be more tightly integrated. Human factors and task analysis results must lead to human-computer models that drive and accompany the entire software lifecycle up to and beyond the point where automatic user testing is ‘automatically’ inserted into code in order to measure UI quality and feed it back to the beginning of the integrated HCI/SWE life cycle. (2) Efficient Development: Model driven software development and other means must be furthered in order to foster the necessary ‘quantum leap’ in user interaction that would want users to like the vision of being surrounded by hundreds of computers – with todays GUIs, they have to fear it! (3) Modality abstraction: for the first time in its history, software engineering cannot assume a dominating interaction paradigm (after two decades each of punch cards, character cell terminals, and windows-based GUIs); rather, software must be developed with a large and unpredictable number of devices and device federations in mind: devices range from mobile phones, headsets, and the like to multitouch wall displays – and federations of all these. This requires a layered approach, with developers relying on a ‘modality independent’ interaction layer plus sophisticated means for mapping onto physical interaction. (4) Context & user awareness, proactivity: context-aware interaction was emphasized in research lately, but both human learning and machine learning must be added. As to the first one, more elaborate user models must be emphasized, which adapt to changing user knowledge. As to the second one, the ‘intelligence’ of user interfaces must (in contrast to former AI visions) gradually approach the vision of ‘software acting in the user’s stead’, by proactively proposing ready-to-launch operations ‘learnt’ from user data and social networks. (5) Better support for natural modalities: voice based and tangible user interfaces as well as natural-language interaction made progress with respect to the underlying technology (voice recognition, NLP etc.) – which is not yet complemented by appropriate HCI concepts. Holistic concepts for the development of user friendly UIs based on such natural modalities is key for interaction beyond the desktop i.e. on the move, while executing a primary task, etc. Reflection on AAL: user friendliness is even more important for AAL than for the ‘post PC’ era as a whole; hence, the points above require intensified efforts. As to point (5), particular methods and tools must be established that reflect the particularities of different disabilities / diseases and patient / helper needs.	atm adaptation layer;computer simulation;defense in depth (computing);desktop computer;headset (audio);holism;human factors and ergonomics;human–computer interaction;machine learning;microsoft windows;mobile phone;modality (human–computer interaction);model-driven engineering;multi-touch;multimodal interaction;natural language processing;programming paradigm;punched card;social network;software development process;software engineering;tangible user interface;task analysis;text mode;usability testing;user experience	Max Mühlhäuser	2007			simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-52.10042198847554	-37.29691690590131	95344

We identify viable alternatives to the text-only translations currently employed in making graphics accessible to blind and/or low-vision individuals by introducing sounds bearing strong ecological resemblances to Minard’s depictions. Our integration of theoretical work about classic distinctions with common properties across diagrammatic and auditory display communities reveals practical opportunities for designing inclusive and accessible graphics.

There is no precedent, save perhaps in pitch battle, for the astonishing bit rates entering the human mind and emotions through eyes, ears and even noses. Yet, despite the awesome intensity of stimuli to which we, from the tenderest age, are daily exposed in movies, in computers, in television soon to become digital high definition television, in the content and delivery systems of music, in ever more glossy magazines, in the raw magnetism of best selling books, in robotic toys and dolls, in the ever more sophisticated techniques of marketing and advertising, precious little is said about the human, societal and environmental impact of such intense and increasing exposure. Only when an off-the-wall event, like the hospitalizing of more than 700 children after watching a TV cartoon, do people belatedly take notice. What then is happening to us as we interact with ever more powerful technical amplifiers and prostheses? What is happening to our relationships, to our sensitivities, to our abilities to be moved, to our abilities to perceive? The conventional wisdom is that we, as naked human beings, are more because we are in command of ever more potent technics? But is this really the case? A teenager begins to go deaf under the onslaught of sidewalk cracking sound from his multi-hundred watt car audio. Is he more or is he less? People ride the subways, buses, planes and trains, each in their own walled off world with headphones, a world increasingly devoid of person to person contact. Are we more or are we less? Precipitated by the massive emissions of greenhouse gases by way of sheer numbers X per capita consumption, global warming, with the potential for catastrophic cooling should be a significant item on the backburners of most people's minds. But under the incessant intensifying barrage of media whose primary message is consume 'till you drop, it is not.	privilege escalation	Jeff Robbins	1998		10.1109/ISTAS.1998.689163	simulation;engineering;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-58.530498059279054	-26.162033132687718	95525

Narrator 2 There's no Santa Narrator 3: my friend insisted, but I knew he was wrong. Late that night I did hear the sounds, though not of ringing bells. Narrator 4: From outside came the sounds of hissing steam and squeaking metal. I looked through my window and saw a train standing perfectly still in from of my house. Narrator 5: It was wrapped in an apron of steam. Snowflakes fell lightly around it. A conductor stood at the open door of one of the cars. Narrator 6: He took large pocket watch from his vest, then looked up at my window. I put on my slippers and robe. I tiptoed downstairs and out the door. Narrator 4: I took his outstretched hand and he pulled me aboard. Narrator 5: The train was filled with other children, all in their pajamas and nightgowns. We sang Christmas carols and ate candies with nougat centers as white as snow. Narrator 6: We drank hot cocoa as thick and rich as melted chocolate bars. Outside the lights of towns and villages flickered in the distance as the Polar Express raced northward. Narrator 7: Soon there were no more lights to be seen.

b67cb449376b85957c2be70ce21e41e5aa427aa1	2nd international workshop on creativity in requirements engineering: creare 2012	creativity;innovative ideas;requirements engineering;design	Requirements Engineering (RE) is a socially constructed activity and as such it includes the creation, development, assessment and communication of innovative ideas. An idea can take the form of a thought related either to the analysis of a problem, or to the search of a solution to this problem, and it can be concrete or abstract. Creative thinking is what RE professionals tacitly or explicitly use in their RE processes to conceptualize smart solutions to problems. RE demands the stakeholders to create visions of a future software system and to imagine all its implications. Creativity techniques that have been practiced in other fields can support this creative part of RE. The CreaE series of workshops brings together RE practitioners and researches who are interested in discussing the role of creativity in RE and the ways in which creativity techniques from other disciplines can be leveraged in RE. CreaRE 2010 aimed at creating awareness of the importance of research on creativity in RE and initiated the conversation on experiences of applying creativity techniques in support of RE activities. CreaRE 2012 builds upon this foundation and extends the discussion on creativity in RE by actively fostering the exchange of ideas among members of diverse communities that are engaged in RE research and practice. CreaRE 2012 united an audience reaching out to areas such as design, theatre improvisation, stakeholder interactions, studies on cultural heritage and multimedia systems.

We build on the philosophy of Larry Laudan, who develops problem and solution as the foundational concepts of science. We argue that most HCI research is about three main types of problem: empirical, conceptual, and constructive. We elaborate upon Laudan's concept of problem-solving capacity as a universal criterion for determining the progress of solutions (outcomes): Instead of asking whether research is 'valid' or follows the 'right' approach, it urges us to ask how its solutions advance our capacity to solve important problems in human use of computers. This offers a rich, generative, and 'discipline-free' view of HCI and resolves some existing debates about what HCI is or should be. It may also help unify efforts across nominally disparate traditions in empirical research, theory, design, and engineering.	computer;human–computer interaction;problem solving	Antti Oulasvirta;Kasper Hornbæk	2016		10.1145/2858036.2858283	human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;management science;management;scientific progress	HCI	-61.42321003504021	-34.67232215144464	97245

Public discussions, marketing, and academic research often emphasize the new and innovative ways in which people use their ubiquitous digital cameras, especially camera phones, in combination with the Internet. In this paper we present our qualitative study of 13 people and their picture taking habits with regular cameras and camera phones. We focus on their videography practices in the context of their general use of photo and video media. Our results contradict the general assumption that the availability of ubiquitous video technology has significantly changed people's practices in home-mode pictorial communication. The models for capturing videos are often taken from situations in which previously taking snapshot photographs was the only option. Therefore, we suggest that mobile media creation and sharing technology has only gradually changed people's snapshot photography and videography practices.	camera phone;digital camera;image;internet;mobile media;snapshot (computer storage);snapshot isolation;video clip	Asko Lehmuskallio;Risto Sarvas	2008		10.1145/1463160.1463188	computer vision;video;computer science;qualitative research;multimedia;camera phone;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-57.2932433572153	-35.78881650723224	97438

The pioneers, like Computer Film Company in London, started in the mideighties and not only had to develop their own software, but hardware to scan film in high resolution and ers to process the tremendous amounts of data. Mike Boudry last year received a technical Oscar for his groundlaying work. When you follow the development of computer graphics and animation, especially in the field of 3D animation, as screened yearly in the electronic theatres of Siggraph and Imagina, you will see a tremendous progress. Today, photographic images in Hollywood movies can be seemlessly mixed with computer generated images. Actors, like Sly Stallone in “Judge Dredd”, are already replaced for stunts by digital replicants or “Synthespians”. Synthetic Creatures, like the murderous flea in “Children of the Lost City” are being created in the computer with a stunningly real look.	3d film;computer graphics;creatures;hollywood;image resolution;oscar;projection screen;replicant;siggraph;sly 3: honor among thieves;synthetic intelligence;turbulence	P.

Unfortunately, they are usually engraved on soft and non durable materials. The project described here originated from the request for a new approach to the preservation, study and ubiquitous access to Pompei's graffiti. A multidisciplinary team was setup to design a new methodology to support the digital acquisition, the study and the presentation to the public of this peculiar type of Cultural Heritage. We have investigated the use of 3D scanning technologies and graphics modelling to produce accurate digital reconstructions and to enhance them for an improved readability. The specific issues have been considered and ad hoc solutions have been devised. In terms of presentation, we have provided both visual media (interactive visualization) and physical reproduction, obtained by adopting modern rapid reproduction techniques. The work described is a sort of preliminary feasibility study: we are now planning to apply this methodology on a much wider scale at Pompei.	multimodal interaction	Marcello Balzani;Marco Callieri;M.

843f4902eff52e50fd975cb8af22a36638b5ff9d	manifesting the cyborg through techno-body modification: from human-computer interaction to integration		A community of DIY cyborgs has emerged, known as 'grinders', who practice techno-body modification-the embedding of computing technology into the body. This paper reports on an ethnographic study following GrinderTech, an organization working to design, build and sell these technological artifacts, as it shifts from hacker collective to biotech startup. As technologies are embedded in the body, the boundary between human and machine starts to blur. We find that GrinderTech members, through the design and making of technologies for embedding, do so as a means to move beyond social and gendered binary constructions-or, societal norms that are practiced and performed, and re-enforced through language, as a way of creating power differentials in society, e.g. citizen/scientist and man/woman. Moreover, their motivations for designing and making these devices reflects their desire to re-imagine society. Finally, we re-conceptualize Human-Computer Interaction to include Integration-when technology is embedded in the human body-and discuss the theoretical and design implications of human-computer integration.	citizen science;cyborg;embedded system;human–computer interaction;norm (social)	Lauren M.

Designing and building hardware takes skill, patience, and time, which is why many software developers simply write code and use hardware designed and built by someone else. A microcontroller such as Arduino shifts this traditional separation, making it much easier for anyone to build hardware—developing something like a thermostat that senses when someone enters the room, for example, is well within the reach of any computer scientist. Not only is building hardware much easier and more fun with microcontrollers, it’s also relatively inexpensive, which lets a wide range of engineers solve problems using a combination of custom-developed hardware and software. I met with Massimo Banzi, one of the cofounders of the Arduino project, at his office in Lugano, Switzerland, to understand how Arduino was developed. To view our discussion in full, visit www.computer.org/ computingconversations.

In this paper we discuss physically interactive environments with narrative structure in which the ability to choose among multiple story lines is replaced with having users, first, interact with the story characters in small, local “windows” of the narrative and, second, actively engage their bodies in movement. In particular, we found that compelling interactive narrative story systems can be perceived as highly responsive, engaging, and interactive even when the overall story has a single-path structure, in what we call a “lesschoice, more-responsiveness” approach to the design of story-based interactive environments. We have also observed that unencumbering, rich sensor technology can facilitate user immersion in the experience as the story progresses—users can act as they typically would without worrying about manipulating a computer interface. To support these arguments, the paper describes the physical setup, the interactive story, the technology, and the user experience of four projects developed at the MIT Media Laboratory: KidsRoom, It/I, Personal Aerobics Trainer, and Swamped!	hypertext;immersion (virtual reality);interactive storytelling;microsoft windows;responsiveness;user experience	Claudio S.

A current BIM topic that requires attention is the integration of BIM with Virtual Reality (VR), where the user visualizes a virtual world through interactive devices or a total immersion. VR combines several devices for interaction, creating virtual environment, and this must followed by studies concerning how to use devices or how to establish links for the presentation of information contained in a BIM model. By adding VR, the BIM solution can address retrieving and presenting information and increasing efficiency on communication and problem solving in an interactive and collaborative project. The text presents a review of actual perspective of the use of VR applied in 4D/BIM models.	bim;building information modeling;immersion (virtual reality);information model;interaction;problem solving;report;virtual reality;virtual world	Alcínia Zita Sampaio	2017		10.1145/3110292.3110298	immersion (virtual reality);building information modeling;virtual reality;human–computer interaction;virtual machine;computer science	HCI	-53.45105183857298	-37.05922309686224	99915

The new interface technologies are broadly impacting music technology and culture. New musical interfaces use a variety of sensing (and actuating) modalities to receive and present information to users, and often require techniques from signal processing and machine learning in order to extract and fuse high level information from noisy, high dimensional signals over time. Hence they pose many interesting signal processing challenges while offering fascinating possibilities for new research. At the same time the richness of possibilities for new forms of musical interaction requires a new approach to the design of musical technologies and has implications for performance aesthetics and music pedagogy. This tutorial begins with a general and gentle introduction to the theory and practice of the design of new technologies for musical creation and performance. It continues with an overview of signal processing and machine learning methods which are needed for more advanced work in new musical interface design.	alpha compositing;high-level programming language;machine learning;modal logic;music technology;signal processing;user interface	George Tzanetakis;Sidney S.

A much greater emphasis will be placed on the information content of the articles rather than on the broad subject categories in general use for computer retrieval citations to book materials. Needed approaches include the linking of selected external reference sources and the extraction of character-encoded index information from the page images by OCR techniques.

The docents played an integral part of the AR Façade experience, replacing imperfect recognition technology to achieve speech and gesture interaction for the players. Our investigation of the wizard docents revealed insights into two conceptually different wizard-of-oz implementations. The docents initially resisted the interface option that required more cognitive load, but after learning how to make it work, many preferred that interface because it provided them more agency within the system and freedom to diversify the experience for audiences.	augmented reality;floor and ceiling functions;intentionality	Steven Dow;Blair MacIntyre	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-89222-9_23	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-51.01053536392508	-37.39793797716352	100327

Music applications have often been at the forefront of research in social-interactive aspects of emerging technologies. Music, as a social activity and time-based medium makes demands in terms of intuitive and responsive interactions that later find relevance in other application domains. This workshop will discuss the specific interaction design challenges for deploying engaging and creative musical activities on mobile devices. These devices are characterised by powerful, but not unlimited processing power, touchscreen, small form factor, networking capability, embedded tilt, microphone, camera sensors, and compact GUI. The workshop will allow interaction designers, musicians, and developers who may not already be involved in mobile music development to engage with and learn about this rapidly developing field, and the design research methods that are at the core of creative mobile music applications.	application domain;embedded system;graphical user interface;interaction design;microphone;microsoft forefront;mobile device;relevance;sensor;small form factor;touchscreen	Koray Tahiroglu;Atau Tanaka;Adam Parkinson;Steve Gibson	2012		10.1145/2317956.2318084	social relation;mobile search;simulation;design research;form factor;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;operating system;mobile technology;interaction design;mobile device;multimedia;mobile business development;emerging technologies	HCI	-54.21177170430804	-37.372715403968456	100487

9378c31fb376eeaef0582b72966abb1dce294cf9	transference of pim research prototype concepts to the mainstream: successes or failures		Personal Information Management (PIM) refers to the practice and the study of how people acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve, archive and discard information for various reasons in physical and digital worlds. Many PIM tools are available for managing information on our desktop computers while many research prototypes tried to augment or replace them. The development of these tools was based on knowledge drawn form the fields of psychology, human computer interaction, information retrieval, knowledge management and research in the PIM field. Different metaphors and ways of organizing were introduced. However, the prevailing beliefs are that most of these prototypes were not extensively tested and that the radical design (not addressing real world issues) and quick abandonment of prototypes prevented transfer to mainstream products. This paper looks at what has been developed and learnt, what has been transferred to mainstream applications, discusses the possible reasons behind these trends and challenges some parts of the above mentioned beliefs. • Survey of Personal Information Management research prototypes. • Discussion on how these prototypes were evaluated and how the research focus has changed during the last 20 years. • Overview of what technologies have been transferred into publicly available software and possible reasons why this occurred.	archive;desktop computer;human computer;human–computer interaction;information retrieval;knowledge management;organizing (structure);personal information management;prototype	Matjaz Kljun;John Mariani;Alan J.

Because designers often refer to past ideas, we argue storyboards can be constructed by reusing shared ar tifacts. We present a study in which we explore how designers reuse artifacts c onsisting of images and rationale during storyboard construction. We find mages can aid in accessing rationale and that connections among features aid i n eciding what to reuse, creating new artifacts, and constructing. Based on requirements derived from our findings, we present a storyboarding tool, PICUP, to facilitate artifact sharing and reuse and evaluate its use in an explor atory study. We conclude with remarks on facilitating reuse and future work.	artifact (software development);category theory;design rationale;fits;iteration;requirement;storyboard	Shahtab Wahid;Stacy M.

For example, multimodal interfaces or dialogue-based communications with virtual and real agents greatly benefit from the analysis of the user’s visual attention as a vital source for deictic references or turn-taking signals. Current approaches to determine visual attention rely primarily on monocular eye trackers. Hence they are restricted to the interpretation of two-dimensional fixations relative to a defined area of projection. The study presented in this article compares precision, accuracy and application performance of two binocular eye tracking devices. Two algorithms are compared which derive depth information as required for visual attention-based 3D interfaces. This information is further applied to an improved VR selection task in which a binocular eye tracker and an adaptive neural network algorithm is used during the disambiguation of partly occluded objects.

For example, a web development tool is created by one development team then used by others to compose web pages for use by yet other people. Little work within Human– Computer Interaction (HCI) has considered how usability considerations propagate through such chains. In this paper, we discuss three-link chains involving people that we term Creators (commonly referred to as designers), Composers (users of the tool who compose artefacts for other users) and Consumers (end users of artefacts). We focus on usability considerations and how Creators can develop systems that are both usable themselves and also support Composers in producing further systems that Consumers can work with easily. We show how CASSM, an analytic evaluation method that focuses attention on conceptual structures for interactive systems, supports reasoning about the propagation of concepts through Creator–Composer–Consumer chains. We use as our example a knowledge representation system called Tallis, which includes specific implementations of these different perspectives. Tallis is promoting a development culture within which individuals are empowered to take on different roles in order to strengthen the ‘chain of comprehension’ between different user types.	attribute-value system;composer;human–computer interaction;knowledge representation and reasoning;software propagation;usability;web development tools;web page	Ann Blandford;Thomas R.

John Cage's Variations II is a prime example, utilizing only dots and lines as its basis. I describe an interactive version of Cage's piece, called here Variations 10b, where a performer can change the score and receive immediate auditory feedback as to the results of the manipulation. This stands in contrast to the process of working through the analog score, where the aural output was not coincident with movement of the dots or lines. I suggest that creating and using digital versions of these early experimental music works radically changes the process of interacting with the pieces.	calculus of variations;graphical user interface;interaction	Nicholas A.

0a67b26271b166b422e92307853b4de3b5fc889b	why doing user observations first is wrong	user observation	How many times have you had to fight hard for the ability to do field studies and other observations at the very start of the project? How many times have you patiently explained that taking time now would be rewarded by faster time to market overall? And how many times were you successful? The HCI community has long complained about product processes that do not allow time to start with good observations. The more I examine this issue, the more I think that it is we, the HCI community, who are wrong. This includes me, for I have long championed the “study first, design second” approach. Well, I now suggest that for many projects the order is design, then study. Let’s face it: Once a project is announced, it is too late to study what it should be—that’s what the announcement was about. If you want to do creative study, you have to do it before the project’s launch. You have to be on the team that decides what projects to do in the first place—which means you have to be part of the management team. (HCI bug one: Not enough HCIers are executives.) Most projects are enhancements of preexisting projects. Why do we have to start studying the users all over again? Haven’t we already learned a lot about them? Shouldn’t we be studying them all throughout the adoption period? Once a project starts, it is too late. Think about it. But note this contradiction, too: All of us usability theorists have long argued for iterative design, trying to get rid of the lengthy, inflexible linear project schedules that stymie flexibility and change, that slow up projects. Instead, we have championed iterative design, with frequent, rapid prototyping and frequent, rapid tests. But wait a minute. Our continual plea for up-front user studies, field observations, and the discovery of true user needs is a step backwards: This is a linear, inflexible process inserted prior to the design and coding stages. We are advocating a waterfall method for us, even as we deny it for others. Yes, folks. By saying we need time to do field studies, observations, rapid paper prototypes and the like, we are contradicting the very methods that we claim to be promoting. The programming community has long struggled with similar issues. They too are trying to eliminate the lengthy, inflexible, linear schedules that slow up projects. They are experimenting with a variety of new methods, for example Agile, XP (Extreme Programming), and other rapid, iterative programming methods. Hurrah for them. The linear project procedures (also called “waterfall methods”), with lengthy setting of objectives, followed by design, coding, and then test, are dead. Thank goodness. The new programming styles practice iterative design and promulgate multidisciplinary teams: everything we should be striving for. Now it is time for the UI community to follow their lead—to do what we ourselves have been preaching. Field studies, user observations, contextual analyses, and all procedures that aim to determine true human needs are still just as important as ever—but they should all be done outside of the product process. This is the information needed to determine what product to build, which projects to fund. Do not insist on gathering this information after the project has begun. Then it is too late; then you are holding everyone back. Once the project is underway, it is going to be severely constrained by time and resources. That’s a fact of life: All product teams feel these constraints. Our goal is to work in multidisciplinary teams to produce effective, pleasurable designs rapidly and efficiently. Design first, on day one, if you can. Review, test, and redesign. Let the programming and marketing teams know how the product will look and behave at the very start of the project. Have faith in our ability to design well-crafted, understandable interfaces and procedures rapidly, without the need for (lengthy) research. Become an essential part of the team, so our input comes simultaneously with everyone else’s. Fortunately, that’s a component of the new programming methods. One correspondent to a debate on this topic on a CHI mailing list said: “Nothing I have seen or read suggests that agile programmers are the least interested in slowing down their scrums1 meeting waiting for usability testing to happen. There is no utilization of user research at all in so-called agile usability practices—it’s just a game of guessing what users need.” This correspondent is confused. Usability testing is like Beta testing of software. It should never be used to determine “what users need.” It is for catching bugs, and so this kind of usability testing still fits the new, iterative programming models, just as Beta testing for software	agile software development;arithmetic coding;chi;day one;experiment;extreme programming;fits;human–computer interaction;iteration;iterative design;iterative method;paper prototyping;programmer;rapid prototyping;schedule (computer science);software bug;software testing;usability testing;user research;user interface;wait state;waterfall model	Donald A.

With JackIn, people's activities can be shared and assistance or guidance can be given through other peoples expertise. This can be applied to daily activities such as cooking lessons, shopping navigation, education in craft-work or electrical work, and sharing experiences of sporting and live events. For a better viewing experience with frist-person view, we developed the out-of-body view in which first-person images are integrated to construct a scene around a Body, and a Ghost can virtually control the viewpoint to look around the space surrounding the Body. We also developed a tele-pointing gesture interface. We conducted an experiment to evaluate how effective this framework is and found that Ghosts can understand the spatial situation of the Body.	experience;gesture recognition;head-mounted display;human–computer interaction;streaming media;television	Shunichi Kasahara;Jun Rekimoto	2014		10.1145/2582051.2582097	computer vision;simulation;geography;multimedia	HCI	-49.593921683145176	-36.829054509524546	102392

It was almost totally destroyed in 1860 at the end of the second Opium War by English and French troops in one of the worst acts of cultural vandalism in recorded history. Rebuilding it has proven impossible, but now computer technology, based on 130 years of scholarly documentation makes it possible to build an accurate and detailed model, and will allow us to experience at least virtually the beauty and grandeur that was the Yuan Ming Yuan. This paper describes a project to build such a model, and details the main challenges and difficulties encountered. While commercially available graphics workstations and modelling software can take us most of the way in this task, they fall short with the modelling of natural phenomena such as plants, rocks andbodies of water. In addition the sheer size of the resulting database pushes rendering engines past their limits.	cd-rom;css zen garden;computer;documentation;ming library;pei-yuan wei;virtual reality;web browser engine;web page;workstation	Lifeng Wang;D.

The aim is to provide multi-sensory interfaces that support collaboration and allow users to immerse themselves in their data in a way that supports real-world analytics tasks. Immersive Analytics builds on technologies such as large touch surfaces, immersive virtual and augmented reality environments, sensor devices and other, rapidly evolving, natural user interface devices. While there is a great deal of past and current work on improving the display technologies themselves, our focus in this position paper is on bringing attention to the higher-level usability and design issues in creating effective user interfaces for data analytics in immersive environments.	augmented reality;display device;natural user interface;thrust;usability	Tom Chandler;Maxime Cordeil;Tobias Czauderna;Tim Dwyer;Jaroslaw Glowacki;Cagatay Goncu;Matthias Klapperstück;Karsten Klein;Kim Marriott;Falk Schreiber;Elliot Wilson	2015	2015 Big Data Visual Analytics (BDVA)	10.1109/BDVA.2015.7314296	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;software analytics	HCI	-53.57086829708512	-37.24757784706483	102841

This is accomplished by means of an object oriented continuous simulation language, called OOCSMP, and a Java generating compiler for this language called C-OOL. This compiler is also able to create VRML worlds. The behaviour of the VRML world is specified in the OOCSMP models. Change of simulation parameters is possible at run time by means of a Java interface, generated by the compiler. An example of the simulation of the inner Solar System is presented. Introduction The growing popularity of Internet, and the increasing number of computers connected to it, makes it an ideal framework for distant education. Not only educational sciences, but also a large number of disciplines are re-thinking their traditional philosophies and techniques to adapt to the new technologies [1]. One of these disciplines is computer simulation. Virtual Reality (VR) techniques offer immersive environments in which the user has great possibilities of interaction. The emergence of the Virtual Reality Modelling Language VRML [2] and browser plug2 Juan de Lara, Manuel Alfonseca ins for this language [3] has made it possible to build virtual worlds accessible through Internet. The VRML97 [4] standard defines an external API that allows us to control VRML objects from a Java applet. Its advantages, such as new possibilities of interaction and more realistic and pleasant learning environments, are turning VR into a valuable tool in distance education [5,6]. In this paper we present some improvements to the tools that we use to automatically generate web courses based on simulation [7]. These enhancements include the possibility of incorporating VR panels to the simulation applets. An example with the simulation of the Inner Solar System is presented. Our Simulation Tools The OOCSMP continuous simulation language was conceived in 1997 [8] as an object oriented language. The language is specially suited when the system can be modelled with similar interacting objects. A compiler (C-OOL) was built for this language in order to produce C++ code or Java applets with the simulation models. This approach simplifies the generation of simulation based web courses. Several web courses have been generated using this language, on gravitation, partial differential equations, ecology and basic electronics, which can be accessed from: http://www.ii.uam.es/~jlara/investigacion The language and the compiler have been designed with an educational focus, for example: n It is possible to include several forms of output displays in the same simulation. n Multimedia elements can be synchronized with the simulation execution. n The user interface allows changing parameters, object attributes or even adding or deleting objects during the simulation execution. n Alternative simulations can be designed and can be accessed from the main simulation. In this way, the teacher can identify VR in distance education. 3 interesting situations that arise when changing some parameter, or when adding some object, etc. n There are also instructions that allow us to describe the appearance of the web page where the simulation models are going to be placed. Extending the language to handle VR In OOCSMP, there is the possibility of associating an icon to each object taking part in the simulation. This icon can be used in all the output forms. The VR extensions allow us to assign also a VRML node to each object, by means of the new attribute type VRMLobject. A new instruction (VRMLworld), to include OOCSMP objects (considered as dynamic components of the Virtual World) in a virtual world, has also been added. This instruction also configures the virtual world with static elements. For example, suppose we want to simulate the behaviour of the inner solar system [9]. To model it, we will encapsulate the behaviour of a planet in a class, and declare an object associated with each planet of the solar system. The class has an attribute to assign to the planet a VRML object. A scheme of the OOCSMP Planet class is shown in listing 1.

It also declares a termination condition (FINISH), and inserts all the objects of the Planet class in the virtual world (VRMLworld), where they will be the dynamic elements. The three parameters (X, Y, Z) control the position of the object inside the virtual world.

Why would anyone want to wear a computer? Is it just to look cool, or do wearable computers offer genuine benefits unattainable through any other form factor? Experience over the past decade has shown that wearable computers can be especially valuable in situations where a mobile user is engaged in tasks such as vehicle maintenance, bridge inspection, or aircraft inspection. Thus, wearable computers have established their first foothold in such industrial applications, where hands-free computer operation provides a compelling advantage. User comfort is a critical design consideration for success in these applications. The key to user comfort is creating small, lightweight, body-conforming designs with long battery life. Unfortunately , this typically means substantially sacrificing computing power. Consequently , a wearable computer typically has less memory, CPU speed, and disk capacity than a desktop or laptop of the same vintage. This limitation in computing power makes augmented reality one of the most challenging yet intriguing uses of wearable computers. In AR, a user looks through a transparent heads-up display connected to a wearable computer. Any displayed image appears superimposed on the real-world scene before the user. AR thus creates the illusion that the real world is visually merged with a virtual world. This opens up a host of fascinating applications that border on science fiction. Imagine AR combined with image recognition. When you look at a person through magic glasses (that is, a heads-up display), his or her name could pop up in a balloon in case you didn't We are pleased to bring you this special issue on Wearable Computing Technologies and Applications.

bd1394c1fec334ed6a6663cd463b6cc1f702c5b9	movement, time, technology, and art		This chapter highlights that kinetic sculpture has at times been used in art history today to refer to an antiquated artistic practice, which has consequently contributed to a long-standing ‘flagrant dearth’ of critical and historical engagement with movement in art. Despite this attitude there has been an increasing amount of exhibitions which have turned to avant-garde kinetic artworks and sought new interpretations of the roles and affects of movement in sculpture and installation. This chapter argues that this turn towards movement in art contributes to a key trend in contemporary art and give indication to our current sense of contemporaneity in art and society. 1.1 Movement and Technology for Contemporary Audiences For contemporary audiences the notion of technology in art feels like a given. Inmany situations the experience of art is dependent on the performance of technology that the audience interacts and moves with the work of art. We’re accustomed to an array of technological spectacles that are art dynamic, including immersive installations, interactive and participatory digital works, advanced robotics, carnival-esque light shows, and steampunk performances filling art institutions. While some argue that technological media in art is often marginalised from discussion around traditional visual arts, there is undoubtedly an increased use of mechanical and digital technology in museums, galleries, biennales and studios today. Movement, Time, Technology, and Art focuses on the use of technology in art in a specific way, by concentrating on the affects of technology to create actual of movement in art. Actual movement (or kinesis) has the ability to affect our perceptions of the present in ways different to representations of movement in the screen arts. For instance, movement has a powerful capacity to generate suspense, protract a long duration, or cut our experiences up in multiple instances as we move-with the artwork. Actual movement can also raise questions around our interactions with an artwork, how we could respond to its movement and how we © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 C. Chau, Movement, Time, Technology, and Art, Springer Series on Cultural Computing, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-4705-3_1 1 might move our body around or in relation to it. Rather than looking at how technology has been used in art, this book focuses on what affect movement in art has on use as audience members, and how these affects have been framed over time in art history. 1.2 What is Kinetic Sculpture and Kineticism? The term ‘kinetic art’ in art history and theory usually refers to the work of avant-garde artists who were interested in creating movement with mechanical media. However over time kinetic art has also accumulated some critical baggage and has been considered a forgotten and antiquated experimentation between with movement, technology and art. For example, the exhibitions Force Fields, Phases of the Kinetic (2000) was publicised as ‘an investigation of movement in art, which in the mid-twentieth century became obscured by waves of more fashionable movements’ (Nash 2000, p. 313). Similarly the exhibition Ghosts in the Machine at the New Museum in New York (2012) was promoted as ‘an unsystematic archive’ that displayed a ‘cabinet of curiosities’ made by artists of past technological ages, predominantly mechanical sculptures that move (New Museum). In these instances kineticism is approached as the aestheticisation of modern industrial technology in movement, and as a tendency that reached a climax in popularity during the 1960s, and is now remembered as a nostalgic trend that is ‘rooted in another age’ (Riding), that came and went quicker than a ‘flash in the pan’ in the 1960s (Bois 2000, p. 145). Even though the use of actual movement is common to a variety of contemporary art practices, the terms ‘kinesis’, ‘kinetic’, and ‘kineticism’ have been used to describe the movement of industrial machines in art that act as an art historical precursor to the ‘more refined’ contemporary media art practices (Popper 2007). Therefore there is a history that assumes mechanical movement in art as the clunky ancestor of the sleek and immediate digital technology that we often see in contemporary art. The assumption that kinetic art is an obsolete modern antiquated practice suggests that we’ve neatly categorised the practice, and have also moved on to more advanced and experiments between art and technology. This attitude is partially due to kineticism being a form of technological art, which according to Edward Shanken “little scholarship has explored the relationship between technology and conceptual art” (2004). Consequently Arnauld Pierre has argued that there is a long-standing ‘flagrant dearth’ of critical and historical engagement with kinetic art (p. 91). Why would there be a deficiency in discussing the movement of technology in art especially when movement is commonly performed in contemporary art? One of the first art historians to consider kineticism as an out dated practice was Jack Burnham in Beyond Modern Sculpture: The Effects of Science and Technology on the Sculpture of this Century. Burnham argued that prior to 1968 kineticism had the 2	angular defect;climax community;digital data;digital electronics;experiment;interaction;kinesis (keyboard);kinetic monte carlo;nash equilibrium;performance;robotics;springer (tank)	Christina Chau	2017		10.1007/978-981-10-4705-3	computer science	HCI	-56.25976620457489	-27.041913432690944	103611

To this direction, our study has focused on the provision of services supporting and enhancing the players’ in-game community and collaboration activities. We have designed and implemented innovative tools exploiting a game adaptation technology, namely, the In-game Graphical Insertion Technology (IGIT), which permits the addition of web-based applications without any need from the game developers to modify the game at all, nor from the game players to change their game installation. The developed tools follow a design adapted to the MMOG players’ needs and are based on the latest advances on Web 2.0 technology. Their provision is performed through the core element of our system, which is the so-called Community Network Game (CNG) Server. One of the important features provided by the implemented system’s underlying framework is the utilization of enhanced Peer-toPeer (P2P) technology for the distribution of user-generated live video streams. In this paper, we focus on the architecture of the CNG Server as well as on the design and implementation of the online community and collaboration tools.	cascading style sheets;client-side;computer graphics;feedback;html;high- and low-level;insertion sort;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;online community;opensocial;peer-to-peer;server (computing);streaming media;usability;user (computing);user-generated content;virtual community;virtual world;visual effects;www;web 2.0;web application;web server	George Adam;Christos Bouras;Vaggelis Kapoulas;Andreas Papazois	2012	Int.

Consider the following set-up for the plot of a possible future episode of the TV series Black Mirror: human brains can be connected directly to the net and MiningMind Inc. has developed a technology that merges a reward system with a cryptojacking engine that uses the human brain to mine cryptocurrency (or to carry out some other mining activity). Part of our brain will be committed to cryptographic calculations (mining), leaving the remaining part untouched for everyday operations, i.e., for our brain’s normal daily activity. In this short paper, we briefly argue why this set-up might not be so far fetched after all, and explore the impact that such a technology could have on our lives and our society.

9bb3b46849f9a67336f639817b91f119eea0e506	a new strategy for bridging the semantic gap in image retrieval		Content-based image retrieval CBIR research is currently faced with the so called the u0027semantic gapu0027 problem. CBIR researchers work at the near end of the gap, applying computer science methods to bridge the gap. Cognitive psychology researchers work at the far end of the gap, studying how humans perceive things in their environment. This article looks at the literature from a new perspective, and presents a structured analysis of what CBIR researchers have done, in their efforts to bridge the gap. This analysis suggests that more emphasis should be placed on studying the far end of the gap. The second part of this article discusses a study conducted at the far end of the gap, to begin the process of developing and testing techniques for externalising and analysing the visual concepts that are evoked by images. This more disciplined approach has the potential to guide researchers in their efforts to bridge the gap.	bridging (networking);image retrieval	Mohammad A.

In particular, we are interested in the impact that distance has when remote collaborators are working together with digital artifacts that are complex (and often visual) in form, such as data that results from complex scientific simulations. We call this artifact-centric collaboration. In order to understand such collaborations, we performed a longitudinal ethnographic study of a group of collaborating scientific researchers. We observed a single research group during its regular research meetings, performing over 18 h of observations spanning a 5-month period. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of two meetings where artifact interaction is prominent, one where all participants are collocated and the other where participants are distributed. Our analysis consists of a detailed coding of the artifact-centric interactions in both meetings as well as an analysis of these interactions. We conclude the paper with a summary of our findings, including a set of guidelines that can be used to inform the design of collaboration software that supports distributed, artifact-centric collaboration.	collaborative software;diamondtouch table;digital artifact;file spanning;fundamental interaction;gesture recognition;interaction;mathematical model;multi-user;pointer (computer programming);pointer (user interface);problem solving;proxy server;seamless3d;simulation;smart board;user-centered design	Brian D Corrie;Margaret-Anne D.

Novel interface structures, in recent media art practice, are defying the traditional interface of mouse and joystick to engage the corporeality of the participant in sensuous as well as physically compromising ways. This paper takes a phenomenological perspective from which to critically engage in a discussion of tactility in media art against a background of three case studies that optimise sensory stimuli in the form of moisture, softness and the effect of stimulation in the form of pain. This primary focus of the discussion will be couched in a consideration of how media art interfaces are distinguished from those of traditional art in terms of the nuances of participation demanded by the particular interface in question.	consciousness;critical point (network science);file spanning;joystick;materiality (digital text);physical computing	Laetitia Wilson	2011	IJART	10.1504/IJART.2011.043444	psychology;visual arts;art;aesthetics;human–computer interaction;phenomenology;artificial intelligence;multimedia	HCI	-58.284575122010295	-36.645752864578796	104666

Improvements in hardware and software technology coupled with changes in preparation, interest, and abilities of incoming students are driving the need for curriculum change. Past courses focussed on lowand intermediate-level rendering principles, algorithms, and software development tools. Many of these algorithms have migrated into hardware. Though important knowledge for advanced graphics programmers, most graphics applications programmers have no need to study at this level, much as application programmers have no need to study hardware systems or assembly level programming. Courses need to focus on intermediateand high-level principles, algorithms, and tools. A fundamental need in modern graphics curricula is integration of a 3D graphics API into the instruction. This paper presents experiences teaching this focus with both low and high level graphics programming API's. The experiences were gained in courses at an undergraduate university and in multi-day industrial courses for experienced professional programmers.	3d computer graphics;algorithm;application programming interface;computer hardware;high- and low-level;high-level programming language;programmer;programming tool;requirement;software development	Lewis E.

These myriad claims cohere in being implemented together in a running system. Thus, HCI artifacts themselves are perhaps the most effective medium for theory development in HCI. We advance a framework for articulating the psychological claims embodied by artifacts. This proposal reconciles the contrasting perspectives of theory-based design and hermeneutics, and clarifies the apparent paradox of HCI application leading HCI theory.	artifact (software development);human–computer interaction;usability	John M.

7cea25f2ecc694e5b89624483c87884b567921d7	visual abstraction for games on large public displays		From its earliest developments video game design has arguably been closely coupled to technological evolution particularly in relation to graphics. In very early games the limitations of technology led to highly abstracted graphics but as technology improved, abstraction has largely been left behind as developers strive towards ever-greater realism. Thus, games are generally drawing from conventions established in the mediums of film and television, and potentially limiting themselves from the possibilities abstraction may offer. In this research, we consider whether highly abstracted graphics are perceived as detrimental to gameplay and learnability by current gamers through the creation of a game using very low-resolution display that would accommodate a range of display options in a playable city. The results of trialing the game at a citywide light festival event where it was played by over 150 people indicated that abstraction made little difference to their sense of engagement with the game, however it did foster communication between players and suggests abstraction is a viable game design option for playable city displays.	graphics;learnability;television;video game design	David Gullick;Daniel Burnett;Paul Coulton	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-49616-0_27	first playable demo;game design;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;game mechanics;game art design;game developer;multimedia	HCI	-58.193721800014366	-36.06605446818921	105040

ae40937708b1215ef2cbffc710d6f9dd5eced3c4	perspectives on engineering more usable context-aware systems		The expectations of the abilities of context-aware systems (C-AS) often differ from reality. It becomes difficult to program contextual services that react adequately to the circumstantial needs of users as developers need to know, beforehand: the set of contextual states that may exist, what information could accurately determine a contextual state within that set, and what appropriate action should be taken in that particular state. Although there exist many frameworks and tools which support the design and implementation of C-AS, there is less conceptual help for developers to inform them of what contextual situations and services are appropriate (or feasible) to be implemented. This report reviews the state-of-the-art conceptualisation of context, which is more focused on the representational interpretation of the concept, to introduce a perspective that also acknowledges its interactional interpretation. A combination of revised and new definitions is introduced, which give key insights for the development of more useful C-AS. By acknowledging situations as a dynamic phenomenon that arises from action (interaction), and needs to be understood by the developers, it facilitates the analysis of these subjective interpretations into programming constructs (representation). The conceptualisation is also complemented with a set of guidelines for developers, an illustration of their usage, and a further discussion on the future directions for the engineering of more usable C-AS. The introduced conceptualisation is targeted towards the creation of an open-source tool supported framework for the engineering of C-AS.	context-aware pervasive systems	Unai Alegre Ibarra;Juan Carlos Augusto;Carl Evans	2018	J.

And just as the previous controversy—over the browsers that display content—ended, a new one has sprung up—over the tools that create content. Not long ago, there was concern because Microsoft and Netscape, makers of the most popular browsers, did not fully or equally support current World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards. The browsers thus didn’t take full advantage of the latest standards’ capabilities. This noncompliance left developers with three unpleasant choices: design separate sets of Web pages for each browser, which cost time and money; develop pages for just one browser, thereby ignoring users of the other; or build Web pages with only the two browsers’ common capabilities, thereby losing functionality. These issues are no longer problems because the two leading browsers generally support the new standards. Now, however, standards proponents, particularly the Web Standards Project (WaSP), contend that Web-authoring tools produce pages that support older Web-design and -browser approaches but don’t fully support the latest standards. (See the sidebar, “Important WebDevelopment Standards.”) In fact, said WaSP member, consultant, and author Tom Negrino, none of the major tools—Adobe’s GoLive, Macromedia’s Dreamweaver, or Microsoft’s FrontPage—writes code that complies with the newest standards. WaSP, a coalition of Web developers and users that tries to persuade vendors to support standards, says that letting users continue working with older, less capable browsers has delayed full adoption of the latest standards, which would give users better, more functional Web pages.

WaSP Group Leader Jeffrey Zeldman, founder of Happy Cog, a Web-design and -publishing company, noted that new standards such as cascading style sheets (CSS) also let Web designers more easily build versions of sites that will work with nontraditional Web browsers like those in smart phones and other wireless devices. While some Web developers agree that producing standards-compliant pages is important, they disagree over how and how quickly to transition to the latest standards. For example, said Sheila Colbert, Ziff Davis Media’s production manager, “If you have a new standard and only 10 percent of your readers can see it, then it’s not worth using.”	adobe dreamweaver;adobe golive;cascading style sheets;cog (project);consortium;microsoft frontpage;smartphone;standards-compliant;tom;tempest;web content;web design;web developer;web page;web standards;world wide web	Steven J.

In order to inform the design of a photo preservation service, we are currently collecting information about relevant practices in a large survey. In this paper, we report intermediate results from a sample of 236 European students aged between 18 and 34. 76% of our participants are keen to preserve their photos for future generations, but far fewer report photo management practices that support preservation. We discuss implications for design and outline three groups of users that can be distilled into personas.	image organizer;persona (user experience);smartphone	Maria Klara Wolters;Elaine Niven;Mari Runardotter;Francesco Gallo;Heiko Maus;Robert H.

I have worked for many years on a computer environment for realizing live electronic music that I named in honor of Max Mathews. Three currently supported computer programs—Max/MSP, jmax, and Pd—can be considered as extended implementations of a common paradigm I refer to here as ‘‘Max.’’ The Max paradigm appears to be stable enough now that a printed description of it no longer risks becoming too quickly outdated. We can now usefully assess what Max (the paradigm) does well, what it does less well, and what we can all learn from the experience. The Dartmouth Symposium on the Future of Music Software, organized by Eric Lyon, offers the perfect occasion to start this project. I apologize in advance if, for obvious reasons, parts of this article might not seem perfectly objective or impartial. The Max paradigm can be described as a way of combining pre-designed building blocks into configurations useful for real-time computer music performance. This includes a protocol for scheduling controland audio-rate computations, an approach to modularization and component intercommunication, and a graphical representation and editor for patches. These components are realized differently in different implementations, and each implementation offers a variety of extensions to the common paradigm. On the surface, Max appears to be mostly concerned with presenting a suitable graphical user interface for describing real-time MIDI and audio computations. However, the graphical look and editing functions in Max are not highly original, and most of what is essentially Max lies beneath the surface. In my experience, computer music software most often arises as a result of interactions between artists and software writers (occasionally embodied in the same person, but not in my own case). This interaction is at best one of mutual enabling and mutual respect. The design of the software cannot help but affect what computer music will sound like, but we software writers must try not to project our own musical ideas through the software. In the best of circumstances, the artists remind us of their needs—which often turn out quite different from what either of us first imagined. To succeed as computer music software writers, then, we need close exposure to high-caliber artists representing a wide variety of concerns. Only then can we can identify features that can solve a variety of different problems when in the hands of very different artists. Many of the underlying ideas behind Max arose in the rich atmosphere of the MIT Experimental Music Studio in the early 1980s (which became part of the MIT Media Lab at its inception). Max took its modern shape during a heated, excited period of interaction and ferment among a small group of researchers, composers, and performers at IRCAM during the period 1985–1990; writing Max would probably not have been possible in less stimulating and demanding surroundings. In the same way, Pd’s development a decade later would not have been possible without the participation of the artists and other researchers of the Global Visual Music Project, of which I was a part. My work on Max and its implementations has been in essence an attempt to capture these encounters in software, and a study of Max will succeed best if it considers the design issues and the artistic issues together.	computation;computer music journal;computer program;graphical user interface;interaction;midi;max mathews;printing;programming paradigm;real-time cmix;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);eric	Miller Puckette	2002	Computer Music Journal	10.1162/014892602320991356	implementation;musical;visual music;multimedia;software;electronic music;computer science;computer music;midi;graphical user interface	Graphics	-52.806337870063395	-25.69252801144372	106122

9b00eda33f9277f05d286bd0974aa748af13b5cc	reading and interpreting ethnography		Although ethnographic methods are still regarded, to an extent, as new aspects of HCI research practice, they have been part of HCI research almost since its inception, and certainly since the early 1980s, about the same time as the CHI conference was founded. What, then, accounts for this sense of novelty and the mystery that goes along with it? One reason is that ethnographic methods have generally been associated with what we might call non-traditional settings in relation to HCI’s cognitive science roots, emerging at first particular in organizational studies of collaborative work (in the domain of CSCW), being applied later in studies of alternative interaction patterns in ubiquitous computing, and being associated with domains such as domestic life, experience design, and cultural analysis that have been more recent arrivals on the scene. Another is that ethnographic methods are often associated with forms of analysis and theorizing of human action – ethnomethodology stands out as an example here – that are themselves alien to HCI’s intellectual traditions and which have not always been clearly explained. Indeed, debates within the field have often founded on these sorts of confusions, so that in the internecine battles amongst social theorists, ethnographic methods suffer collateral damage (e.g. Crabtree et al. 2009). Finally, in a discipline that has often proceeded with something of a mix-and-match approach, liberally and creatively borrowing ideas and elements from different places, ethnography has often been seen instrumentally as a way of understanding important aspects of technological practice while its own epistemological commitments have remained somewhat murky.	chi;cognitive science;computer-supported cooperative work;experience design;human–computer interaction;ubiquitous computing	Paul Dourish	2014		10.1007/978-1-4939-0378-8_1	linguistics;literature;anthropology	HCI	-61.61029708192643	-29.89260647820226	106705

This study showed the basis-step dance classification and the correlation between other disciplines; the correlation of dance relates to language closer than to genetics. The classification described in this paper could serve as the basis for a study of observation of ethnic cultural correlations.

The methodological and epistemological foundations of the field are shifting to reflect the diversity of contexts in which rapidly changing digital technology is being used. Alongside these changes, new ethical challenges emerge for the HCI community, both in terms of research ethics and responsible research and innovation. Open dilemmas include issues such as the shifting meaning of informed consent, anonymisation or privacy in an always-online world. The SIGCHI Ethics Committee has been established to look into the processes, practices and structures at SIGCHI venues to deal with such ethical dilemmas and how they can be addressed in a transparent, consistent and open way. This town hall style panel will be an opportunity to prompt community discussion and collect input into how we can further address these challenges.	digital electronics;human–computer interaction;sigchi	Christopher Frauenberger;Amy Bruckman;Cosmin Munteanu;Melissa Densmore;Jenny Waycott	2017		10.1145/3027063.3051135	engineering ethics;social science;political science;media studies	HCI	-62.20786563851426	-32.12371798999459	106828

In this position statement, I address this question from the perspective of cultural forms. My argument is that in the creation of novel forms of interaction it is advantageous to present strong and recognizable cultural forms to help parents and children structure their activity around familiar artifacts. This, in turn, helps activate valuable cognitive, physical, and emotional resources that parents and children can bring to bear on the new task.	book;cognition;interaction design	Michael S.

The entire human visual system is the first part of that process, providing extensive spatial processing. Painters have used spatial techniques since the Renaissance to render HDR scenes. Silver halide photography responds to the light falling on single film pixels. Film can only mimic the retinal response of the cones at the start of the visual process. Film cannot mimic the spatial processing in humans. Digital image processing can. This talk studies three dramatic visual illusions and uses the spatial mechanisms found in human vision to interpret their appearances. Keywords: HDR vision, illusions, spatial image processing, Retinex. 1. INTRODUCTION The challenge of a reproduction is to capture the information contained in the physics of light (original 3-D color space) and to render it in a different size and shape of media (reproduction color space). The reproduction problem is very similar to moving everything in your house to a new one. The reproduction house has different dimensions for the length (amount of red), width (amount of green) and height (amount of blue). On a clear day, shadows cast by the sun are 32 times darker than direct sunlight. The 32:1 range of reflectances in a 32:1 range of illumination creates a 1024:1 range of light. Real-life scene reproduction is analogous to moving a castle into a cottage. Reproductions move everything in the old house into the new house, keeping all contents in corresponding rooms, even though the dimensions of the entire house, and each room, are different. Good reproductions are never exact physical copies of the original, because that is not possible. Good reproductions capture the appearance and relationships of objects in the scene.[1] The papers in this section of the conference, organized by Huib deRidder, studied the interaction of science and art in rendering scenes. There are many examples of works by artists that design their pieces with human visual mechanisms in mind. By the skillful anticipation of the """"way humans see things"""" the artists can make unusual and striking displays. The definition of the word paradox is a seemingly absurd, or self-contradictory statement or proposition, that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true. Visual illusions are striking examples of apparent paradoxes. The greater the departure from the expected appearance, or behavior, the better the illusion.The usual pattern in research is to dissect the complex whole into separate components with well known mechanisms that can be assembled into the ensemble of all the properties. This paper will analyze three popular and dramatic illusions to see if understanding the components can make sense of the illusion. In other words, can we understand the magic of the illusion by identifying the tools of the magicians? The three illusions are found as movies on YouTube. They are:¥ """"Impossible Balls Illusion!""""

Discussed in his book ‘Digital Harmony’ (Whitney 1980), Whitney argued that all composition in music was firmly based on a methodology that excluded improvisation and if a similarity of scale was applied to the use and development of colour, a system could be devised that met his objective of providing an agreed means of finally equated colour with sound, through computer programing.	color;complementarity theory	Joe Osmond	2011			computer facial animation;digital art;acoustics;computer animation;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-54.91723120128456	-29.18787339855805	107129

The panel will discuss the roles that engineers, commercial artists and art academicians play in influencing the development of the process, the content, the product and the context of computer art. One of the main social functions of art is to understand and communicate the human experience. Because the foundation of understanding is creating relationship and correlation between thoughts, computer technology, with its ability to store many “thoughts,” is ideally suited to expanding our base of understanding. And because the nature of communication is connection, computer technology, with its ability to connect the “thoughts” it stores and present a variety of different views and relationships of those thoughts, is a powerful means of elucidating the very process of communication. However, as Richard Saul Wurman stated several years ago, from his position outside the computer technology arena, “There are only three businesses involved in communication today. The first is the transmission business, all companies starting with tele: television, telephone, telex, etc. The second is the storage business. There, the technology is exploding because of the compression of storage: laser, compact disk, ROM, CD ROM, CDI and all kinds of floppy and hard disks. The third business is the understanding business, and nobody is in it... writers... serve the god of style and the god of accuracy. Graphic designers... and all the universities serve... the god of looking good.” If we notice how other high tech communication forms of this century such as film and video have evolved, we can see what Mr. Wurman means. Both media have been influenced greatly by the gods of style and looking good. In addition, because of the high cost of use, mass market saleability has dictated product and the limited accessibility of the media has led to a narrowness of the language and a dearth of form. If we do not want the high tech nature of the computer to force the art which it mediates to devolve toward either the banal or the overly precious, and if we desire the growth of the understanding business, we must become aware and make use of the essential changes that the computer has wrought. This awareness is being forged in a number of ways: peoples work and leisure are merging as computer technology becomes a presence in all aspects of living; engineers and artists are becoming collaborators in ways that breed a healthy respect in each for the process of the other; engineers are noticing how people really work and incorporating the unintended use that people make of their tools back in to the tools themselves; artists are rejecing the classic role of standing outside the culture in order to see it and instead infusing themselves into the very heart of the culture... the computer communications industry... and changing it. We are at the crossroads of development of this tool and each of us, by virtue of being a part of this community, can guide that development. Perhaps a bit of hindsight and a bit of projection will illuminate our task: The limits of communication and understanding inherent in how the printing press developed has lasted for 400 years. In fifty years will the computer have become just another toy, a pastime? Will it have become just another way to do the same things we’ve always done? Or will we develop it and, in turn, allow it to change us, so that it becomes the most powerful tool we have seen to date, a tool that allows the artist to create with thought itself and for all of us to realize the basic artistic nature of our work? I believe that the crux of these question lays within the institutions of business and academia. If the changes that we see in individuals can begin to trickle upwards into the larger institutions of which we are a part and become incorporated into their processes before they trivialize them or make them too precious we may actually see a whole new culture emerge. If academia could share with industry what it knows about thought, reflection and learning for the sake of learning and help create products that are essential, not frivolous, enduring not throw-away; if industry could share with academia its wealth and what it knows about pragmatic application of knowledge and help connect ideas to realities... perhaps we will create a culture of learning companies and working intellectuals, with more inherent balance than our current culture of excess.	accessibility;cd-rom;computer graphics;floppy disk;gods;hard disk drive;nobody (username);offset binary;printing;read-only memory;television;dialog	Jane Flint DeKoven;Tim Binkley;Glenn Entis;Delle Maxwell;Alvy Ray Smith	1994		10.1145/192161.192301	ray tracing;path tracing;radiosity;simulation;3d rendering;rendering;computer science;monte carlo method;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-56.73026333892268	-27.89507390529525	107454

Perhaps that's why when Crytek launched its VR First academic initiative back in January this year, we had a strong sense of our own history. Roughly 17 years earlier, the three brothers who brought the company into existence-Avni, Cevat, and Faruk Yerli-attended the E3 expo in Los Angeles, California, hoping to find an attentive audience for a demo on which Crytek had been working. Instead, they were rejected at almost every turn before eventually (and somewhat forcefully) securing 15 min of tech giant NVIDIA's time to show off their wares as the day's business drew to a close. The rest, as they say, is history. NVIDIA loved the early glimpse into Crytek's CRYENGINE technology that day, setting in motion a chain of events that has seen Crytek continue to establish itself as an influential independent developer of both video games and the software used to create them.	cryengine;maxima and minima;virtual reality	Ferhan Ozkan	2016	IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine	10.1109/MCE.2016.2594398	game theory;simulation;media;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;marketing;software development;operating system;virtual reality;multimedia;computer security;internet of things;computer graphics (images)	Arch	-57.99125266675077	-25.445786159770652	107960

When multiple Beatbugs are connected in a network, players can form large-scale collaborative compositions by interdependently sharing and developing each other’s motifs. Each Beatbug player can enter a motif that is then sent through a stochastic computerized """"Nerve Center” to other players in the network. Receiving players can decide whether to develop the motif further (by continuously manipulating pitch, timbre, and rhythmic elements using two bend sensor antennae) or to keep it in their personal instrument (by entering and sending their own new motifs to the group.) The tension between the system’s stochastic routing scheme and the players’ improvised real-time decisions leads to an interdependent, dynamic, and constantly evolving musical experience. A musical composition entitled “Nerve” was written for the system by author Gil Weinberg. It was premiered on February 2002 as part of Tod Machover’s Toy Symphony [1] in a concert with the Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin, conducted by Kent Nagano.

What Desmonde has provided, for a student, is a somewhat easy to read introductory glance at some of the essentials of computer characteristics and their uses. I am dubious of the value of this book to anyone already familiar with computers. However, this book offers the uninitiated some basic understandings of computers together with insights into their social value and impact. The book paints the computer in various lights. It touches on some areas of current social concern surrounding computer usage as well as a few of its societal advantages.	computer;value (ethics)	Earl C.

The end result is an experiment in superimposition of one experiential reality on top of another, hopefully opening a new window into an artist's creative process.

Given that the impact will be felt not only by neuroscientists, but by diverse members of society, it is imperative that conversations engage all stakeholders. Doing so will allow for the sharing of diverse views and perspectives to understand and frame the science, better educate and prepare the public for new developments, and provide a shared approach to identifying and resolving ethical challenges.

c37863e0a2a133f2e3b392ebff8afea9552e0007	demo chairs' welcome		"""As the leading international conference for research into interactive experiences for online video and TV, the ACM TVX 2017 conference brings together international researchers and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines, ranging from human-computer interaction, multimedia engineering and design to media studies, media psychology and sociology. Much of this work has a very practical, tangible form, and the demo track offers the opportunity to showcase it in that form, and for delegates to poke and to prod and to play, and thereby to get a richer understanding.  The response to the call for demos this year was impressive: 16 submissions were received, from academics and industry, and from countries across Europe and North America. Our reviewing process, where each submission was reviewed by at least two reviewers, revealed a high-quality field, and selecting the best was a challenge for the programme committee. In the end, we chose 10 demos, maximising our coverage by running two sessions. These demos cover a broad range of topics, with something to interest everyone.  The theme of the conference this year is """"Alternate Realities"""", and we were pleased to see the submissions reflect this. The award for best demo goes to """"Social VR platform"""", which looks at Web technologies to enable people to share virtual spaces. Another VR-based demo allows users to navigate an environment to view 360 video content from various locations, while a third investigates integration of 360 video and TV content.  As ever, there are chances to try novel user interaction techniques, for choosing what to view, controlling the television with smartwatches, or searching through video. Augmenting content is another theme, particularly the presentation of information that is coordinated over multiple devices. In this area we have a framework for delivering customisable subtitles, and two demos taking a production perspective. One of these highlights the affordances of """"Object Based Media""""; these are also explored by a video application presenting a personalised, interactive cookery show. A more unusual form of augmentation is the use of mid-air haptics to enhance the experience of watching short movies.  The demo sessions at TVX clearly bring the greatest benefit to the delegates at the conference, who have the opportunity to see the work in action, try it for themselves, and question the presenters. However, the papers are a valuable contribution and can give more than a flavour of the work to those many people unable to attend. We are therefore particularly pleased that the papers will be included in the ACM digital library this year. Many contributors have also created high-quality videos explaining their contributions, and these offer a valuable adjunct to the papers themselves --- we would encourage you to view them where possible."""	delegate (cli);demo (computer programming);digital library;digital video;haptic technology;human–computer interaction;interaction technique;object-based language;smartwatch;video clip	Andy Brown;Lucia D'Acunto	2017		10.1145/3084289.3106685	affordance;digital library;haptic technology;media psychology;human–computer interaction;broadcast television systems;workflow;ranging;multimedia;chose;computer science	Visualization	-58.07064048488127	-33.26160573112062	109045

In the last decade, research in the field has increased tremendously, and the research community has pushed the state of the art in many novel directions. In 2014, the IEEE VIS Conference celebrated its 25th year and grew to incorporate new symposia on large-scale data analysis and visualization (LDAV) and biological visualizations (BioVis). It also featured an increasingly popular art program (VISAP) and an impressive array of workshops and tutorials. The VIS 2014 workshop program, through eight extremely well attended half-day and full-day events, offers a unique peak at emerging research topics in the field of data visualization. The 2014 program showcased a range of research directions, all attracting researchers and practitioners from a variety of other domains, from machine learning experts to decision makers and medical doctors. (The full program for each workshop is accessible at http://ieeevis.org/year/2014/info/overview-amp -topics/accepted-workshops.) This special issue samples contributions made to these workshops by showcasing two research pieces that aim at pushing the state of the art to enable data-driven discoveries with visualization.	data visualization;educational workshop;imagery;machine learning;visual instruction set	Nathalie Henry Riche	2015	IEEE computer graphics and applications	10.1109/MCG.2015.54	visualization;human–computer interaction;computer science;computer graphics;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-55.20495144728463	-24.593786309424083	109130

But when you converse with a programmed computer, neither of you is likely to know much about what the other one knows.  Indeed, in some respects this is desirable - as when we're concerned with our privacy. We don't want strangers to know our most personal goals, or all the resources that we may control.  However, when we turn to our computers for help, we'll want that relationship to change - because now it is in our interest for those systems to understand our aims and goals, as well as our fears and phobias. Indeed, the extents to which those processes """"know us as individuals"""".  Issues like these will always arise whenever we need a new interface - and as one of my teachers wrote long ago, """"The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today.""""1  Indeed, the '60s and '70s saw substantial advancestowars this but it seems to me that then progress slowed down. If so, perhaps this was partly because the AI community moved from semantic and heuristic methods towards more formal (but less flexible) statistical schemes.

This has led to a demand that information systems should be ubiquitous in the sense that they are available to all users under all circumstances, everywhere and at all times, and independent of the access devices and channels used. The authors believe the key to meeting that demand is existence of an omnipresent media of interaction and existence of information systems that within that media adapt themselves to context parameters at run-time. The World Wide Web is considered as that omnipresent media. Thus, the task is left to design adaptive information systems in a way that avoids unnecessary replication. In this article it will be shown how context parameters can be utilised to enable system adaptivity. The latter is supposed to increase usability and targets the quality of use, the content, and the functionality. We propose using an algebraic approach that aids in providing the leanest appropriate interface via user typing and story boarding. Our approach furthermore limits the content delivered to a user to the amount that can be dealt with in a usage scenario. The latter is based on defining hyphenation points within the content.	information system;systems design	Roland H. Kaschek;Claire Matthews;Klaus-Dieter Schewe;Catherine Wallace	2006	Inf. Syst.

While content was previously created primarily by a small set of entities, today, individual users -- empowered by devices like digital cameras and services like online social networks -- are creating content that represents a significant fraction of Internet traffic. As a result, content today is increasingly generated and exchanged at the edge of the network. Unfortunately, the existing techniques and infrastructure that are still used to serve this content, such as centralized content distribution networks, are ill-suited for these new patterns of content exchange. In this paper, we take a first step towards addressing this situation by introducing WebCloud, a content distribution system for online social networking sites that works by re- purposing web browsers to help serve content. In other words, when a user browses content, WebCloud tries to fetch it from one of that user's friend's browsers, instead of from the social networking site. The result is a more direct exchange of content ; essentially, WebCloud leverages the spatial and temporal locality of interest between social network users. Because WebCloud is built using techniques already present in many web browsers, it can be applied today to many social networking sites.

17fd44a99f6a50de32e4db8c36ff3c1c9face02a	creating the human standard for ethical autonomous and intelligent systems (a/is)		Like most people, I first encountered Artificial Intelligence through movies - The Terminator, Blade Runner, 2001. As a rule, the future in these stories was always dystopian which I found irritating. If humanity was able to create such amazing technology, wouldn't they also have created ethical codes or standards to keep things from going awry? Granted, a film about a code of ethics isn't as sexy as killer robots, but picturing utopian futures powered or assisted by AI seemed like something not enough people were doing in my estimation.	artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;blade runner;code;futures and promises;the terminator	John C.

Most of these cameras are owned by businesses and institutions. People generally know about the cameras, but most don’t consciously think about them or change their behavior because of them. It seems that our society is now used to ubiquitous surveillance cameras—and we assume that nobody ever really reviews the recorded material. However, as surveillance cameras become affordable, more individuals are setting up their own cameras in personal environments—in homes, on car windshields, or even on their clothing. The reasons for using such cameras are manifold: to have evidence in case of an unforeseen event (such as a break-in, an accident or assault, or officer misconduct), to monitor safety-critical situations (involving the elderly, infants, or pets), to provide healthcare assistance (in the form of personal memory aids or introspection), or simply to record memorable events (such as a holiday trip or a birthday). Yet use of such cameras by individuals rather than disembodied institutions often radically alters the perceptions of those being recorded. Steve Mann, one of the pioneers of wearable camera technology, coined the term “sousveillance” for individual-controlled recordings,1 positioning wearable cameras as a distinct grassroots pushback to institutional surveillance, with the potential to alter the prevalent power structure of surveillance. Yet recent developments in pervasive computing research have re-positioned such cameras from an activist device to a consumer product. In particular, the SenseCam Project has shown how wearable cameras can be realized and how they can aid human memory.2 Today, numerous devices are commercially available that enable ubiquitous image-based lifelogging.

This dynamic content is updated manually and represented using plain text (e.g., “Meeting new friends at the gym”). While this sort of input provides the ultimate flexibility, the requirement for manual input places a barrier between a person’s dynamic status and its representation on a users profile page. As a result, the minutiae that provide texture to our daily lives is filtered from a person’s online self, and as a result friends are less connected. The CenceMe system [5] transparently makes useful inferences from data gathered from sensors embedded in mobile phones, and exports the resulting “sensing presence” to social network applications. CenceMe fills the gap left between manual status updates by automatically updating activity and location presence information to a person’s social network profile page. The system currently supports Symbianbased Nokia phones and the Apple iPhone, and integrates with Facebook profiles.	dynamic web page;embedded system;minutiae;mobile phone;presence information;sensor;social network	Andrew T.

This process often results into long video sequences that need to be edited down and summarized in order to be properly archived, shared within social media, or simply projected to family and friends. For those who do not possess video-editing skills, isolating the most appropriate moments is a difficult and time-consuming task. This work presents """"ActionTrip"""", a system that provides gestural user interaction during video-capture, in order to seamlessly tag personal points of interest. In addition, the system captures contextual information about nearby landmarks and information from social networking systems. This combination of personal with social preferences has enabled a single-step final editing process, which presents to the user a small list of points interest (public landmarks and personal preferences), instead of the actual recorded video that might be very long to comprehend.

In many technological systems (medical applications, social networks etc.) values (privacy, autonomy, trust etc.) play a role and are sometimes violated. In working with stakeholder requirements or user needs, various design methods in requirements engineering (RE) [3] and human computer interaction (HCI), in specific user-centered (UCD), deal with “soft issues” [4], “social issues”, “people issues” or values. At the same time, applied ethics has begun to pay attention to design. We believe that many of the approaches could complement each other in useful ways. The aim of this workshop is to bring together people from different disciplines to share knowledge and insights about how to account for values in technology design, and to work towards integrating approaches, thereby putting value conscious design approaches (e.g. values-in-design [1] or value sensitive design [2]) to practice.	autonomy;human computer;human–computer interaction;privacy;requirement;requirements engineering;social network;user-centered design;value sensitive design	Christian Detweiler;Alina Pommeranz;Jeroen van den Hoven;Helen Nissenbaum	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23768-3_145	human–computer interaction	HCI	-61.14907456980345	-34.09147699446411	111827

This article draws on design and strategy literature to propose that designed artifacts can and do play a role as symbolic communication resources in sensemaking and sensegiving activities that impact strategic decision making and change. Extracts from interviews with three designers serve as illustrative examples. This article is a call for further empirical exploration of such a complex subject.	cognition;scientific literature;sensemaking;software prototyping	John Stevens	2013	AI EDAM	10.1017/S0890060413000036	design;strategy;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management science;management;mechanical engineering	HCI	-61.635474294606844	-36.91960974803183	111989

Air is the invisible carrier of microbial life-forms, gases, chemicals, pollens and particulates. Recent studies have found that plants and insects share complex airborne chemical messages making it an ancient means of communication [1]. Human computer interactions generate similar complex communications through air, as satellites, radio, television, radar, wifi, and cellphones broadcast wave vibrations through walls and skeletons. This project draws on the sociological writing of Gabriel Tarde, who conceived air as a social assemblage: a space of vibrations and flows that generate affective atmospheres at macro and micro levels, rejecting established ideas of dualism like nature/culture and organic/technological. These interactions often pass without conscious thought, as the human sleep walks through life mesmerized and contaminated by their social environment. As technological networks and biological experience merge, social and cultural network communications become increasingly inseparable and exploitable [2]. This installation (fig.1) places the audience within a cube of air in the vicinity of RAF Digby, a GCHQ intelligence gathering station (fig.2) which specialises in electronic communication surveillance. The cube was mapped by flying a microlight aircraft through three levels of air (fig.3) while using electromagnetic modulation equipment to record audio traces. Using mobile phone technology and projected images the exhibition highlights the complexity and vulnerability of our communications, audibly puncturing our perception of a 'natural' air space.	affective computing;airborne ranger;cube;human computer;interaction;mobile phone;modulation;puncturing;radar;separable polynomial;spectral density;tracing (software)	Joanna White	2015		10.1145/2783446.2783637	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;cartography	HCI	-57.43952785812041	-27.46940335302034	112267

9ad7ec3e4107f0a5ac80ee7d43d0e2ffc9e0ea8b	will we hit a wall? forecasting bottlenecks to whole brain emulation development		Whole brain emulation (WBE) is the possible replication of human brain dynamics that reproduces human behavior. If created, WBE would have significant impact on human society, and forecasts frequently place WBE as arriving within a century. However, WBE would be a complex technology with a complex network of prerequisite technologies. Most forecasts only consider a fraction of this technology network. The unconsidered portions of the network may contain bottlenecks, which are slowly-developing technologies that would impede the development of WBE. Here I describe how bottlenecks in the network can be non-obvious, and the merits of identifying them early. I show that bottlenecks may be predicted even with noisy forecasts.

T h e PC brought power to the people in their offices, their homes, their schools, and even their cars. Similarly, parallel coniputers will bring the power of the largest computers and their applications to many people. Parallel computers will speed progress in scientific and medical research, allow manufacturers to build all kinds of new products, offer new services along the information highways, and foster more effective education. When our industry was emerging, we needed lots of debate about the differences in designs of parallel computers, and I have a great deal of respect for the innovations the very smart hardware designers produced. Thanks to their efforts, we now have a variety of parallel products that elegantly lash together multiple processors to create computing power that scales almost beyond the imagination. However, I believe computer applications and not computer architecture -will ultimately drive the market for parallel computing. Now that parallel processing is maturing, people will buy our machines in much the same way they buy cars. While certain auto enthusiasts and race-car drivers might he greatly interested in automotive breakthroughs a new engine design, for example most of us are less concerned with innovation under the hood than we are with how fast and how far -the car will take us. Likewise, those of us who qualify as computer “nerds” may be fascinated with the latency and bandwidth of the latest switch design. But our potential customers would much rather hear about how fast the machine will nin their critical applications or how Far ahcad of the competition the machine will take them. Of course, car buyers and computer buyers alike want to balance the raw performance of their new machines against their cost. Figure 1.

This study examined how using two different ways of displaying the solar system—a true-to-scale mode vs. an orrery mode—affected students’ knowledge of astronomical concepts. Solar system displays were presented in a software application on a handheld tablet computer. In the true-to-scale mode, users navigated a simulated three-dimensional solar system environment using a tablet’s pinch-to-zoom touchscreen interface; this provided an accurate representation of sizes and distances of planetary bodies. The orrery mode, which is the more common way of displaying the solar system, exaggerated the size of planetary bodies relative to their orbits so surface features could be displayed. The study included 152 students from science classes in a high school in eastern Massachusetts.	environment variable;handheld game console;planetary scanner;simulation;tablet computer;touchscreen	Matthew H.

It can be argued that sometimes product, and at other times process, will be a good, useful, or even the only way something can be viewed. But when one looks at process, one ignores product; and vice versa. This is a fundamental human problem, not an oversight, and as a metaphor echoes Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle that suggests we can never know position and momentum simultaneously, but are limited to knowing one or the other. I illustrate briefly how a focus on product dominates discourse on core library issues including scholarly communication and library assessment. I then explore further the implications of this focus for the emerging practice and theory of data curation, despite widespread acknowledgement of both data production and data curation as processes. I conclude by urging greater attention to the possibility and challenge of reshaping practice in data curation around attention to process.	data curation;digital curation;library (computing);uncertainty principle	Anna Gold	2013		10.1002/meet.14505001088	social science;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;sociology;world wide web	HCI	-62.589391850606575	-30.073792217700635	114117

This paper describes techniques for producing three types of graphics: halfone pictures, line drawings, and solid-jlled areas. An overview of the software system is also presented. A graphics system that incorporates an experimental high-resolution , all-points-addressable printer has been in use for several years at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. This system produces camera-ready copy of printed text and graphics of sufficiently high quality for publication.' The combined use of graphics software and hardware provides the Research user community with nearly complete control over the visual quality of their printed work. All the figures in this paper have been produced by this high-resolution computer graphics system. Discussed here are techniques used to produce the three types of graphics included here-halftone imagery, line drawings, and area-filled images. The high-resolution printer uses a computer-controlled cathode ray tube (CRT) that is capable of projecting an image of 800 dots per inch, both horizontally and vertically, onto photographic film. These dots are uniform in size and intensity. The individually ad-dressable dots are called picture elements or pixels. The printer projects text characters onto the film by referencing appropriate fonts (files of prestored character images of the same size and style). Enhancements to the software allow users to send their own raster data to the printer either as fonts of regular characters or as fonts of special characters that contain elements of larger graphic images.

A concept demonstration was formulated in the late 1950s to show the feasibility of applying computer technology to the problem of vehicle body design. The narration then traces the history of a joint project between GM and IBM for development of new and unique computer graphics hardware. The salient features of the Design Augmented by Computer (DAC-1) system are summarized in terms of nine separate technologies that were brought together for the first time to form a complete computer based design environment. t is always instructive to rediscover an idea that still I has some merit today and is relevant to current technology and problems. In writing this article, I have, across the distance of time, gained a new perspective of some things that were done right and some that were done wrong during the course of a rather large and involved technical project. As early as 1952, the General Motors Research Laboratories (GMR) were using a card-programmed digital computer for engineering and scientific analyses. However, notably absent from the applications were problems related to graphical design. To gain an insight into the automotive design process, research personnel began discussions with General Motors (GM) engineers and designers. It soon became obvious to the researchers that drawings, pictures, and models were the principal media for communication and documentation of design ideas. As a result of these discussions, four distinct types of man-machine communication were identified: 1. 2. 40 Existing engineering drawings. The research project was realistic enough to realize that computers could not replace all the drawings used in the design process. Such a claim would have been akin to the office automation claims of the paperless office, which still shows no prospect of being achieved. Therefore, it was concluded that a computer system must provide means for reading existing engineering drawings and for creating these drawings. Fortunately, because of the nature of automotive design, body drawings are primarily drawn to scale on a background of grid lines with no dimensions. Digitizing this line information seemed to be a feasible task. Interactive manipulation of graphic information. The design process frequently involved one person indicating a problem on a drawing to another person and then their joint exploration of potential changes to the drawing.

A large collection of representative pictures can be used in text-to-picture communication systems, and may also be used to teach computers to learn what representative pictures are. We have developed a web application to help players of Draw Something, a popular social mobile game, search pictures for drawing inspiration while at the same time they implicitly help us collect representative pictures for words. Our preliminary result shows that the proposed approach has the potential to harvest Draw Something players for collecting desired data.	computer;human-based computation;image;mobile game;web application	Bei Yu	2012			computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;multimedia	AI	-49.01066068273217	-36.248673718662	114672

42bcbea47a8124bf7cfb0064bcac15c854296989	special issue: organic user interfaces		Until recently, the ways in which we interacted with computers were limited by the flat, rigid and rectangular form factors of cathode-ray tubes and liquid crystal displays. Technical limitations forced user interfaces into boxes, limiting interactions to 2D pointing and keyboard input. With technological advances in flexible sensor and display technologies, we are experiencing a new revolution in human– computer interaction (HCI): one in which user interfaces can be worn on the body as if they were cloth, used in the office as if they were paper and used in architecture as if they were wallpapers (Co and Pashenkov, 2008; Buechley and Mellis, 2010; Lahey et al., 2011). Rather than being rigid and static, the user interfaces of tomorrow will be able to have a shape that accommodates the user’s context and fits the data on display. For instance, if a user wants to explore geographic information, they can use a spherical display that does not require distortion of the earth projection (Stevenson, 2010). When reading an interactive map, users can extend their mobile’s screen real estate by unfolding their pocket-size flexible e-paper display. We call such novel user interfaces as organic user interfaces (OUI): interfaces with non-flat multi-touch displays that can exist in both rigid or flexible form factors (Holman and Vertegaal, 2008; Vertegaal and Poupyrev, 2008). OUIs can have any shape that everyday products can have, and can potentially change shape: this flexibility can be driven by either user manipulation or actuators inside the display. OUIs are an interplay of computation and form through a renewed focus on computational materiality. OUIs are opening up unprecedented opportunities for innovation over the next decade of HCI that require us to re-examine and re-evaluate some of the most basic user interface design principles. Following the significant interest resulting from the publication of the special issue of Communication of ACM on OUIs (Vertegaal and Poupyrev, 2008), the first workshop on OUIs and transitive materials at CHI 2009 (Coelho et al., 2009) and the second workshop on OUIs at TEI 2011 (Girouard et al., 2011), this special issue seeks to debate and develop further the concepts behind the OUI vision and stimulate research in related areas, such as in tangible, embedded and embodied interfaces. We invited researchers from a broad spectrum of disciplines to explore emerging materials, prototype nextgeneration interfaces, create tools to design OUIs and discuss the concept and future of this new interface paradigm. With anthropomorphic resonances, Bongers (2013) presents a historical context of OUIs in art, architecture and design. Through a journey of his own work supplemented by broader discussion, Bongers examines the evolution of organic musical interfaces, liquid architecture and video-based projects. Bongers links human centred design—including human-shaped or anthropomorphic design—to the customized design for individuals. He observes that new techniques in design and 3D printing will allow for mass customization of products that meet individual needs. Holman et al. (2013) outline the need for new methods of non-planar interactive design, which includes technologies for rapid hardware prototyping. The authors present SketchSpace, a system for sketching OUIs without hardware components to provide functional interactive behaviours to passive 3D objects. SketchSpace uses depth sensing and projection to provide a board range of sensors and interactions to common objects. Holman et al. concludes by discussing the concept of hypercontextualized design, in which computational objects will have minimal, specialized interactive content pertaining to one particular task. Zhu et al. (2013) offers a tool to support OUIs as well as a taxonomy of papercraft manipulation. They present two novel methods to provide multi-channel wireless power transfer in papercraft devices, through selective inductive power transmission. Their oscillation prototype can provide enough power to activate shape memory alloys and Nichrome wire, while their amplifier prototype can light up LEDs and heat thermochromic ink. This novel technology can wirelessly actuate folds in a paper substrate, to create wireless self-folding origami. Through the exploration of MoleBot, a robotic tabletop creature, Lee et al. (2013) focus their research on the physical transformability of object surfaces. MoleBot suggests the presence of a mole that lives and moves under an interactive table surface, creating a molehill along its path.

Yet research interest towards them has diverged over the years. It seems that nowadays they are on focus again with the evolution of socially oriented and community-supporting virtual worlds. Instead of technical factors, human factors and the motivation behind the use are highlighted. In this paper, we will briefly review the research efforts made in the 90's, and derive a set of themes that were of interest back then. Next, we will expand the set by arguing for newer themes, identified in the latest information systems literature. These two sets of themes form a basis of a research agenda for studying virtual worlds in the next five years. The sets also compose N-dimensional space for further theorizing and developing new virtual worlds or virtual places for work and pleasure. Hence, the paper presents and argues for a transition from technology engineering to social engineering.	human factors and ergonomics;information system;social engineering (security);theme (computing);virtual world	Mikko Jäkälä;Samuli Pekkola	2007	DATA BASE	10.1145/1314234.1314238	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;metaverse;virtual reality;multimedia;world wide web;information system;immersion	DB	-61.5787756317297	-34.03751684599262	115213

The text discusses the abstraction of the human body in this performance by an interactive costume of light whose motion is analyzed by a 3D motion-rendering programme, which assembles and recombines the captured frame in real time in electronic 3D space. Thus appears a juxtaposition of 3 visions on the body making up the representation: the eye of the spectator, the camera and the 3D camera view: 3 visions constituting the contemporary body. Furthermore, the text questions the dislocation of the sensual body in physical space to the reading of body as a data in the matrix of virtual space in performing arts.In order to investigate the meaning of the aesthetics of abstraction, and dislocation of human body in performance art and motion analysis, the article puts 'man in |e|space.mov' in perspective to historical references of the 20th century, in particular to the work of the physiologist and pioneer of cinema J.

92a497d62b3a08b55b6be4eac931fba5ed69fad5	contextually proximate approach to develop smart user interface		Researchers and experts are taking efforts in delivering an optimal user experience from a long time. Computer interfaces are being developed to keep user ‘in the flow’ as well as for making users more connected to the real world while using virtual environment. Developing ubiquitous user interfaces for novices and experts at the same time is crucial work for interaction designers. This paper moulds the designing approach of user interface in bit different parameters by reviewing the existing literature and proposing a different way to develop a smart user interface to make user more familiar with the design and to keep user 'in the flow'. Contextually proximate approach (CPA) will help users to minimize their feeling of insecurity as designing process includes local resources of users to develop the user interface. These various resources and parameters are explained further in the paper by giving different	fma instruction set;heuristic;information;interaction design;user experience;user interface;virtual reality	Pushkar Joshi	2015	CoRR		user interface design;user;user experience design;user modeling;computer user satisfaction;interface metaphor;human–computer interaction;user journey;multimedia;natural user interface;user interface;world wide web	HCI	-52.54181295836109	-38.00878427908499	115365

During the Industrial Revolution, for instance, we developed machines fueled by steam and oil to assist us in our labour-intensive tasks, and saw dramatic increases in our productivity. But we worried, maybe rightfully so, because we saw machines that outpaced us physically and we knew that we could not compete. After a while, we learned to accept them. It has been our nature to accept new technologies after we have seen how they can improve our way of life—at least up to now. Today we have a new type of machine to worry about. This one is powered not by steam but by knowledge, and is designed to aid us in our mental tasks. It is this design goal that troubles us the most. Perhaps it stems from the notion that although we can now accept being surpassed by machines in mechanical tasks, we consider mental creativity to be the province of humanity. The development of an intelligent machine, therefore, stirs our emotions. This paper looks at our emotional relationship with intelligent machines. It considers questions, both old and new, that may have concerned us about our machines and ourselves. To focus the discussion on this introspection, the paper takes a close look at the films """"2001: A Space Odyssey"""" and """"Artificial Intelligence: A.I."""" By no means does this paper answer the questions that we have lived with when building intelligent machines.

Many driver interfaces do not adhere to this simple rule. We explore interaction possibilities which follow this principle by introducing the Back-of-the-Steering-Wheel (BotSW) as an automotive input design space. Since the steering wheel is in the peripheral vision of the driver when looking ahead this space can be seen as an ambient interaction space for the driver. In order to explore this design space, we follow a research through design approach. We present the development of three “explorations” which we consider as evolutionary prototypes built to investigate the BotSW design space: two-sliders, six-buttons, and braille-keyer. Based on our experiences, we discuss the BotSW design space systematically by identifying its interaction design related properties: ring shape, rotating, not visible, supporting bimanual and multi fingers interaction. The intention of our work is to show possibilities of interaction at the back of the steering wheel and inspire designers to envision novel solutions to interact with the car while leaving the hands on the wheel.	hands-on computing;steering wheel	Alexander Meschtscherjakov;David Wilfinger;Martin Murer;Sebastian Osswald;Manfred Tscheligi	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-14112-1_24	steering linkage;torque steering	HCI	-54.005846235516174	-37.76182588680774	115728

40b630f77ed96fd4056e65577584ef54db03198e	from the walls to the web: media aesthetics, technological innovation, and audience attention to artwork representations		Aesthetic theory considers the reciprocal relationship between the creator, the object, and the viewer of an artwork. When viewing artworks on a museum website, a new element is added to the aesthetic model: the mass-mediated representation of the art object. This research brings together art and media theory, as well as technological understanding, to study mass-mediated presentations of artworks and to gauge audiences’ visual attention to artworks based on differences in media presentations. Study findings indicate that art museums are generally showing rigor for visual displays of their artworks on their websites, thereby providing a legitimate visiting experience for their virtual patrons. However, regarding technology, art museum websites are not fully embracing web capabilities. Eyetracking data provide empirical evidence of the effects of certain changed aesthetic variables in the viewing experience. From a theoretical perspective, the research showed how aesthetic theory can be placed within a media aesthetic theory model to study the mass mediated viewing experience.

We present a new approach to tabletop interaction by using multiple handheld computers embedded in plastic tokens. Drawing from the rich physical experience of tradition film editing techniques we designed the TVE to engage multiple users in a collaborative process and encourage the exploration of narrative ideas. We used active tokens to provide a malleable interface, enabling users to organize the interface components in unspecified ways. Our implementation improves upon common projection-based tabletop interfaces in a number of ways including a design for use beyond dedicated two dimensional spaces and a naturally scaling screen resolution.	computer;digital video;display resolution;embedded system;image scaling;mobile device;multi-user;tangible user interface	Jamie Zigelbaum;Michael S.

However, the scientific community making advances in relevant algorithmic techniques is not, in many cases, the same community that is currently making advances in the design, evaluation, and user-experience aspects of creativity support.  The primary objective of this workshop is thus to bring together participants from diverse backgrounds in the HCI, design, art, machine-learning, and algorithms communities to facilitate the advancement of novel creativity support tools.	algorithm;computation;computational creativity;computer;emergence;human–computer interaction;machine learning;signal processing	Dan Morris;Jimmy Secretan	2009		10.1145/1520340.1520728	user experience design;simulation;human–computer interaction;creativity technique;computer science;signal processing;management science;creativity	HCI	-61.31570300787878	-35.13166567125323	116794

This enhanced ease has generated an opportunity for the everyday photographer to creatively communicate through the distribution of their images.  This paper applies research results from a qualitative visual ethnographic study focusing on the non-verbal posts of a select group of Facebook users. The Dell Hymes' SPEAKING framework was used to structure the visual data; analysis leveraged Gerry Philipsen's Speech Codes Theory and James W. Carey's Ritual Communication Theory contributes to the creation of a communicative framework for the non-verbal social media postings.  In conclusion, what emerges through the data is a visual speech code that tacitly leverages traditional photographic genres while at the same time supporting a system of meanings and symbols that enhance the instantaneous posts and communications of the day-to-day ebb and flow of life.	code;mobile phone;social media	Robin Fogel Avni	2015		10.1145/2757226.2757233	social media;human–computer interaction;computer science;photography;multimedia;camera phone;creativity;management;world wide web;communication theory;visual communication;interpersonal communication	HCI	-57.9801381718988	-36.76286879448579	116877

All real-time systems ultimately involve interaction with the physical world. This world, as the apocryphal Murphy suggests, can seem to conspire against us: events will often occur at the wrong time or in the wrong order. The ultimate and inevitable source of complexity in real-time software, therefore, is the physical world itself. The sad fact is that no matter how hard we try and no matter which technology we use this fundamental complexity cannot be eliminated. Compounding this is our persistent demand for ever-greater functionality. This is fueled in part by competitive business pressures but also by the natural human propensity for increasingly sophisticated machinery. In telephony, for example, there are close to 500 different types of “features” defined. These are specialized services, such as call forwarding, voice mail, or mobile phone roaming, that we now take for granted. Unfortunately, many of these features were defined independently of each other and are often mutually incompatible. In spite of that, we expect the software inside a communication system to provide all of these various features and somehow to resolve the inconsistencies between them.	communications of the acm;mobile phone;persistence (computer science);real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;real-time web;requirement;unified modeling language	Bran Selic	1999	Commun.

As such, they offer a unique means to support us in our various and diverse activities. However, little information is available for understanding the intricacies of taking a modular, constructive assembly approach to TUI design. Based on an analysis of extensive data collected from interviews with eight world-class TUI experts, we propose a descriptive, conceptual framework to facilitate systematic investigation and critical consideration of constructive assemblies. The paper presents a lifecycle model for constructive assemblies and discusses their main design qualities and associated parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to structure critical discussions by applying the principles to existing works and the design of our own constructive assembly.	ambiguous name resolution;chart;interconnection;tangible user interface;user experience;utility	Joanne Leong;Florian Perteneder;Hans-Christian Jetter;Michael J Haller	2017		10.1145/3024969.3024985	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence	HCI	-61.92883739533709	-37.6946237093692	117392

Computational caricatures capture and exaggerate statements about the game design process in the form of computational systems (i.e. software and hardware). In comparison with empirical interviews of game designers, arguments from established design theory, and the creation of neutral simulations of the design process, computational caricatures provide more direct access to inquiry and insight about design. Further, they tangibly demonstrate architectures and subsystems for a new generation of humanassisting design support systems and adaptive games that embed aspects of automated design in their runtime processes. In this paper, we frame the idea of computational caricature, review several existing design automation prototypes through the lens of caricature, and call for more design research to be done following this practice.	artificial intelligence;computation;embedded system;random access;simulation;video game design	Adam M.

Objects have boundaries, but even these are a function of context. Soak them, roast them, freeze them, squeeze them, drop them, or swing them and their forms may no longer endure. Our idealized reification of things strips away contingencies to construct “normal” encounters and usage, but every property that we attribute (e.g., color, weight, strength) is the result of interactions in context. Digital objects have little in the way of obvious boundaries. They blend into the world of interactive usage, making it hard to assign fixed properties or qualities to them. The language and concepts of physical product design do not transfer well to interaction design. Few aesthetics of form can be immediately perceived, as with physical objects. The same holds for affordances, which are strictly physical (see Don Norman’s take on this in interactions May+June 1999). Instead, aesthetics and affordances unfold within the user experience. Furthermore, users’ evaluations of interactions evolve beyond the “end” of an experience. What endures here cannot be properties of the digital artifact or the interaction. Rather, what endures are properties of the world, inscribed in people, places, and things. This is why we interact with all objects in the first place. Good experiences can give rise to revisitable good moods and enduring, reworkable memories. Good outcomes embed value in the world. Goodness here can be evaluated without any reference to the features or qualities of a digital artifact or a user’s experience of it. My writing as you now read it is good or bad independently of my writing experiences, or the feature set of the word processor that I used to write it. If we think of designing qualities, properties, or value into artifacts, then we enter a nonsensical world critiqued by Nietzsche and many after him. Our world is one of relations, not things. Our intellectual challenge is to relate, not to excavate. The archaeologies of things are genealogical, not ontological. If we thus conceive just “a thing” during design, there is nothing to relate it to. We are reduced to making wild claims for deterministic properties of manmade objects that have power over others. To escape such a fetishized world of “cool stuff,” we must relate the means of digital designs through the further means of interaction to the ends of people as users or consumers. Designing is thus not just a question of conceptualizing and realizing things (although without that there is no design), but also one of connecting between stuff and us.	artifact (software development);digital artifact;interaction design;our world;reification (knowledge representation);strips;user experience	Gilbert Cockton	2008	Interactions	10.1145/1374489.1374502	computer science;engineering;operations management;advertising;management;engineering drawing	HCI	-59.64818858035841	-34.90469312824892	117915

However there is a recent trend towards Empathic Interfaces that are designed to go beyond understanding user input and to recognize emotional state and user feelings. In this presentation we explore how Augmented Reality (AR) can be used to convey that emotional state and so allow users to capture and share emotional experiences. In this way AR not only overlays virtual imagery on the real world, but also can create deeper understanding of user's experience at particular locations and points in time. The recent emergence of truly wearable systems, such as Google Glass, provide a platform for Empathic Communication using AR. Examples will be shown from research conducted at the HIT Lab NZ and other research organizations, and key areas for future research described.	augmented reality;emergence;experience;glass;intelligent user interface;wearable computer	Mark Billinghurst	2014		10.1145/2557500.2568057	augmented reality;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;collaboration	HCI	-54.42211559016267	-37.04920372798946	118116

c46a7caf6e1d83c5ded801218c5d817657f17d4a	computing for the masses? constructing a british culture of computing in the home		The creation of the personal computer during the late 1970s and early 1980s is heralded as a time that people were liberated by computers as tools for everyone. The proliferation of affordable and relatively powerful computers changed the landscape of computing across the globe. This chapter looks at the introduction of one machine, the BBC Microcomputer, and its influence on the culture of computing in Britain. It has been celebrated as a computer that transformed the educational landscape and brought the power of these tools to a new generation of users. The chapter shows how the machine was constructed within a broader ambition for computer literacy within Britain, and discusses the role of the BBC team in creating the meaning and values of the machine in the home. It illustrates the interplay between a broadcaster, government desire for a high-tech industry and perceived consumer needs. Drawing on the social construction of technology by a variety of actors (Woolgar, 1991) the chapter suggests that enthusiasm for the BBC Microcomputer came not only from the creation of a concept of utility for home machines, but in its role as a technology that embodied the future and symbolised the social capital of the home. Recent nostalgia for the BBC Microcomputer and Computer Literacy Project has celebrated this moment in the 1980s as a time when the government seeded a new passion for computing. The chapter suggests that similar projects today, which aim to create an interest in programming, should facilitate a social need for empowerment and interaction in the home, rather than focus purely on the technical capabilities of the machine or push a concept of the perceived utility of computers in education.	bbc micro;microcomputer;personal computer;social capital	Tilly Blyth	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33899-1_15	engineering;data science;software engineering;world wide web	HCI	-58.311670581266796	-28.997727065467085	118629

However, playersu0027 experience of emotional challenge has received little empirical attention. It remains unclear whether players enjoy it and what exactly constitutes the challenge thereof. We surveyed 171 players about a challenging or an emotionally challenging experience, and analyzed their responses with regards to what made the experience challenging, their emotional response, and the relation to core player experience constructs. We found that emotional challenge manifested itself in different ways, by confronting players with difficult themes or decisions, as well as having them deal with intense emotions. In contrast to moreu0027conventionalu0027 challenge, emotional challenge evoked a wider range of negative emotions and was appreciated significantly more by players. Our findings showcase the appeal of uncomfortable gaming experiences, and extend current conceptualizations of challenge in games.	experience	Julia Ayumi Bopp;Klaus Opwis;Elisa D.

The content-display gap reflects accelerated growth and progress in the two segments adjacent to video processing. It is characterized by the increased access and sheer amount of heterogeneous content that is available anytime, anywhere for users to view it on any display. Next come the multimedia interaction paradigms, which have continued evolving along new dimensions such as sensorial experience (e.g., haptic, voice, gestural), moved from lean-back toward lean-forward experience, and increased quality and variety of experience (i.e., immersive, social and affective interaction). Along with the first two drivers, the computing platform provides the means to deliver the most demanding user experiences, including best picture quality, web connectivity, immersiveness, and gestural user interfaces while optimizing overall system performance. The evolution of video processing has also led to the creation of new product concepts such as the Smart TV in which content consumption, visual experience, social experience, and immersiveness are integrated and delivered through a multiplicity of highly compelling applications.	anytime algorithm;display device;emergence;evolution;haptic technology;image quality;shattered world;smart tv;user interface;video processing	Jorge E.

We investigate which aspects of this tangible game make it popular and show how experienced fun can increase by elaborating such aspects through an iterative design process. A questionnaire and field study, tailored to the user group of primary school children aged 9–12 years old, revealed that aspects within areas of physical control, surface of the playground, opponent, and stakes of the game had the biggest influence on the fun experience of shooting marbles. A gameflow model and fun toolkit were used to improve the game in these respective areas. This resulted in a moving marble hole entitled Marbowl: a tangible marble game that augments existing game aspects such as timing, distance, surface, and other physical and environmental influences. A working prototype was field tested with 24 children at a primary school. Results show that different gameflow areas like concentration needed, playability, difficulty to win the game, and amount of challenge, increased in a positive way. Together these findings concluded that compared with the original marble game, children experienced a higher level of fun while playing with Marbowl.	curve fitting;field research;fun school;human–computer interaction;iteration;iterative design;marble;nonlinear gameplay;prototype;requirement;video game developer	Jabe Piter Faber;Elise van den Hoven	2011	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-011-0405-1	iterative design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;field research	HCI	-58.09522749287446	-36.05310086827476	119645
cb02f160a966dd0c31f2c4f5b3c6729b06e3ca5b	using agents as a currency of exchange between end-users		The Behavior Exchange is an AgentSheets-based forum employing the web for the collaborative creation of SimCityTM-like interactive simulations. While initially the Behavior Exchange was geared to empower geographically distant users to build and exchange simulation pieces it turned out to be just as useful in facilitating collaboration between kids working in the same class room. Example applications of this technology include the design of sustainable eco systems in life science curricula letting kids create their own animal species and exchanging them via the Behavior Exchange. Introduction The web is predominately broadcasting medium of information. However, from the point of view of education it is too passive, as the majority of its users are primarily consumers of information. Becoming an active designer or producer on the web is not trivial. Authoring is usually delegated to HTML literate webmasters that serve as high-tech scribes, in the same way as illiterate people delegated writing to scribes during the Middle Ages. Newer generations of WYSIWYG HTML editors simplify the task of creating static web pages but provide little support for more dynamic content such as simulation and animation. Java allows programmers to include programs into web pages, but to computer end-users this technology remains out of reach. For end-users to harness the power of the web and be encouraged for more active and productive participation, the image of the web as a broadcast medium should be expanded to include end-user mechanisms in support of collaborative design, construction and learning. This can be done by supporting: • Bi-directional use of the web: Enable and motivate consumers of information to become producers of resources on the web. • Richness of content: Make rich and expressive computational artifacts, such as simulation components and behaving agents, utilizing the web as a forum of exchange. From the educators' perspective, enabling and motivating consumers to become producers of resources on the web and therefore utilizing it as a bi-directional medium for collaborative learning, introduces a more social aspect to the classroom setting, which has traditionally been instructionist [Papert 1993]. With constructionism [Papert 1980], however, an alternative approach to learning has been offered. Constructionism proposes that people best construct new knowledge when they are engaged in personally meaningful tasks. In this spirit, the web needs to become an open medium for active participation in order to become an effective educational medium. Web content need not be restricted to textual information, pictures and movies, but can include rich and expressive computational artifacts. For instance, the web can become a medium through which users exchange individual components that we call agents of SimCityTM-like interactive simulations. Such a medium allows users to add their own agents to a community repository. Users need to be able to find relevant agents in the repository and integrate them with their own simulations. This paper describes the framework that enables and motivates end-users to become producers of computational web artifacts, namely AgentSheets, presents the Behavior Exchange, a web-based forum supporting the social aspects of this process, and describes our experiences with students producing interactive simulations by sharing agents over the web. End-User Programmable Agents To empower web users in becoming active producers rather than passive consumers, we have employed the end-user programmable design environment of AgentSheets [Repenning and Sumner 1995], available for Macintoshes. We use the notion of agents as shareable computational units that can be created and exchanged over the web. AgentSheets is used to create SimCityTM-like interactive simulations, domain-oriented visual programming environments, games and infobots. Combined with its novel programming approach, Visual AgenTalk (VAT) [Repenning and Ambach 1996], AgentSheets is a versatile computational medium for a variety of computer end-users ranging from K-12 students to professionals. Over 1000 applications have been created with AgentSheets in areas including education, art, computer science, biology, medicine, and engineering. Users of AgentSheets create agents for their simulations, by defining both their look and behavior. An agent is given its look by use of simple drawing tools, such as a bitmap editor. The behavior of an agent is defined using VAT, a graphical rule-based language that was specifically designed for computer end-users with no programming experience. In AgentSheets, agents are autonomous processes able to perceive and act in their environment. An extendible set of sensors allows agents to perceive mouse clicks, sound input, voice commands, keyboard input and even read and parse web pages. Agents can act by moving in a simulation world, changing their appearance, play sounds, speak and open URLs. The mapping between perception and action is determined by the agent's end-user programmable behavior, in the form of IF-THEN rules. A collection of these agents that interact with each other make up an AgentSheets simulation. Figure 1: The AgentSheets Environment; Left: Behavior Editor, Right: A fish simulation world.. Figure 1 shows the AgentSheets Fish Tank simulation. The worksheet (window in the back) contains agents representing different types of fish, rocks, divers, air bubbles and water. The Behavior editor (window in the front) contains a Visual AgenTalk program for the yellow fish. The first rule in the window declares that, with a 10% chance, the fish will turn left. Once a simulation is finished, using the RistrettoTM Java generator built into AgentSheets [Repenning and Ioannidou 1997], the complete project can be instantly turned into a Java applet and published on the web. The goal of this work is to support more directly the requirements of programming in social settings where programming is no longer considered a solitaire activity. In contrast to the original before-and-after graphical rules based language [Bell and Lewis 1993, Furnas 1991, Kirsch 1964] used in AgentSheets [Repenning 1994] and KidSim/Cocoa [Smith, et al. 1994] the new Visual AgenTalk language was designed with web-based collaboration in mind [Repenning and Ambach 1996]. This kind of support requires that computational artifacts can be easily shared [MacLean, et al. 1990], comprehended and modified. Agents as Social Currency The Behavior Exchange [http://www.agentsheets.com/behavior-exchange.html], an evolving web-based information space, allows users to efficiently exchange agents that have been created in AgentSheets through the web. It contains two kinds of information. Informal information is not interpreted by the computer. The look of an agent, e.g., a scuba diver, textual descriptions concerning what the agent does, who created it, why and how it is used belong into the informal information category. Formal information is interpreted by the computer. All the rules that determine the behavior of an agent are considered formal information. The combination of informal and formal information turns these agents into a social currency of exchange. Users produce agents and share them. Other users pick them up and modify them to better fit into their own environment. There can be a variety of reasons to trade agents. Agents can be complete solutions to problems. For instance, somebody may set up an agent to retrieve weather information from web pages and summarize it in useful ways and place this agent in the Behavior Exchange. Other users may find this functionality useful and wish to download it and use it. Still others may find this agent is a partial solution to their problem and wish to not only download it but to modify it as well and tailor it to fit their needs. Exchanging Agents: A Scenario For the Behavior Exchange, the web serves as a medium through which the formal and informal information of agents is exchanged. Collaborative activities include building, sharing, locating, acquiring, comprehending, and modifying agent. These activities are explained in the following sections in form of a scenario. Building Bob, is working on a fish tank simulation [Fig. 1]. Bob wants to have a scuba diver that can breathe in this fish tank. He creates a scuba diver and a bubble agent for which he defines two icons using the AgentSheets icon editor. Bob wants the scuba diver to create bubbles when he hits the space bar on the keyboard. Using the behavior editor Bob defines this simple behavior in a single rule [Fig. 2]. Figure 2. The Behavior Editor shows the simple behavior of the diver: IF the space key is pressed (conditions are on the left) THEN the diver creates a new air bubble (actions are on the right) above itself. AgentSheets includes a rich set of condition and action commands that can be dragged into IF-THEN rules structures. Considerably more complex behaviors can be built than the one shown including procedural abstractions, numerical operations, colorization [Repenning and Ambach 1996], but a simple example is used to focus on the exchange of agents. Command parameters, e.g., which key to test for or what location to use to put a new agent, are all defined using direct manipulation. For instance, Bob specifies the key that he wants to use to trigger the bubbles by clicking at the Key condition and pressing the key of his choice on the keyboard. Sharing Bob wants to share his scuba diver and bubble agents by submitting them to the Behavior Exchange. Bob simply selects the agents to be shared and annotates each agent with some text explaining what the agents do and how they can be used. This text will be visible to other Behavior Exchange users and will help them to find and use relevant agents.

A growing body of work in HCI provides understanding in the activities of designing and making by novices and in maker communities. However, we know little about how casual users might employ these technologies with the goal of having an object in their home that satisfies a need. We present a long-term qualitative study in which we followed 16 households during a purchasing process of furniture items for their homes. We looked into how families discover what they need, find solutions, realize a solution in their house and put it to use. The results provide insights into their design activities and workflow and we identify two distinct stages: understanding needs and prototyping a solution. Based on the findings, we discuss the social practice of acquiring and appropriating furniture in the home and within families, and identify design opportunities for digital design and fabrication to support people as they create the objects they need, want and desire.	human–computer interaction;logic synthesis;purchasing	Bokyung Lee;Gyeol Han;Jundong Park;Daniel Saakes	2017		10.1145/3025453.3025666	design;fabrication;management	HCI	-59.33324480251058	-35.25210276128781	120251

Problem solving in such systems requires insight, i.e. the capability to make non-obvious connections. In this paper, we present a game-based problem solving environment, where users can explore biological interactions with navigation on atomic to macroscopic scales, role-play, and networked collaboration. The study investigates the system architecture of the biological game, bio-morphing characters, and bio-interactions with biosensing and biodynamics. The prototype has been implemented on PC and tested in a preschool environment where users have little knowledge in biology. The experiment shows that the game greatly inspired users both in concept learning and entertainment.	artificial intelligence;british informatics olympiad;computer graphics;computer vision;concept learning;interaction;morphing;one-way function;page size extension;personal computer;problem solving environment;prototype;system dynamics;systems architecture	Yang Cai;Ingo Snel;B.

In the history of mathematical notation, written notation is usually considered. However, to be an effective thinking tool, notation must be properly perceived. Blind and partially sighted people run into difficulty in making, exploring and understanding mathematical concepts conceived for being represented in multi-dimensional space. In this paper, we capitalize on the multifaceted nature of digital symbols to define multimodal digital notation for graph structures that allows blind and partially sighted people to represent graph structures, reason about them and communicate their reasoning with sighted people as well as each other. As support tool for notation proposed we have designed a multimodal interactive system, in which haptic signals play a crucial role. An evolutionary prototype of the system has been developed and evaluated according to the star life cycle model.	multimodal interaction	Cristian Bernareggi;Piero Mussio;Loredana Parasiliti Provenza	2009	J.

But how can we design for appropriation? We need to strike a good balance between making the user an active co-constructor of system functionality versus making a too strong, interpretative design that does it all for the user thereby inhibiting their own creative use of the system. Through revisiting five systems in which appropriation has happened both within and outside the intended use, we are going to show how it can be possible to design with open surfaces. These open surfaces have to be such that users can fill them with their own interpretation and content, they should be familiar to the user, resonating with their real world practice and understanding, thereby shaping its use.	noise shaping	Kristina Höök	2006		10.1145/1182475.1182501	simulation;human–computer interaction;knowledge management	HCI	-59.925683653012335	-35.25702017455301	121081

Many consumers use a Smart TV to gain quick access to the Internet including video on demand, social networking and instant messaging. Most Smart TVs also provide capabilities to connect with external devices such as a USB flash drive, a mobile phone etc. All of these features make a Smart TV a potentially rich source of information for forensic purposes. With increasing utilisation, it is also easier for malicious users to abuse a Smart TV. Therefore a digital forensics study on the field of Smart TV is imperative. This paper proposes new procedures for acquiring, analysing and investigating a Smart TV. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

95798114d669f3dcea614ecc6e32418876be204d	design metaphors for procedural content generation in games	adaptive games;game design;procedural content generation;metaphor;game ai	Procedural content generation (PCG), the algorithmic creation of game content with limited or indirect user input, has much to offer to game design. In recent years, it has become a mainstay of game AI, with significant research being put towards the investigation of new PCG systems, algorithms, and techniques. But for PCG to be absorbed into the practice of game design, it must be contextualised within design-centric as opposed to AI or engineering perspectives. We therefore provide a set of design metaphors for understanding potential relationships between a designer and PCG. These metaphors are: tool, material, designer, and domain expert. By examining PCG through these metaphors, we gain the ability to articulate qualities, consequences, affordances, and limitations of existing PCG approaches in relation to design. These metaphors are intended both to aid designers in understanding and appropriating PCG for their own contexts, and to advance PCG research by highlighting the assumptions implicit in existing systems and discourse.	algorithm;artificial intelligence (video games);procedural generation;software design;subject-matter expert;video game design	Rilla Khaled;Mark J.

95e6f543d348d66ac68f1f15ed270dca4238aec1	bursty human dynamics		Bursty dynamics is a common temporal property of various complex systems in Nature but it also characterises the dynamics of human actions and interactions. At the phenomenological level it is a feature of all systems that evolve heterogeneously over time by alternating between periods of low and high event frequencies. In such systems, bursts are identified as periods in which the events occur with a rapid pace within a short time-interval while these periods are separated by long periods of time with low frequency of events. As such dynamical patterns occur in a wide range of natural phenomena, their observation, characterisation, and modelling have been a long standing challenge in several fields of research. However, due to some recent developments in communication and data collection techniques it has become possible to follow digital traces of actions and interactions of humans from the individual up to the societal level. This led to several new observations of bursty phenomena in the new but largely unexplored area of human dynamics, which called for the renaissance to study these systems using research concepts and methodologies, including data analytics and modelling. As a result, a large amount of new insight and knowledge as well as innovations have been accumulated in the field, which provided us a timely opportunity to write this brief monograph to make an up-to-date review and summary of the observations, appropriate measures, modelling, and applications of heterogeneous bursty patterns occurring in the dynamics of human behaviour.	complex systems;digital footprint;dynamical system;human dynamics;interaction;mathematical model;power supply;renaissance;tracing (software)	Márton Karsai;Hang-Hyun Jo;Kimmo Kaski	2018	CoRR	10.1007/978-3-319-68540-3	machine learning;artificial intelligence;mathematics;human dynamics;communication studies;data structure	ML	-55.30633926201919	-24.28389476111366	122089

The disappearance of self and technology in achieving transparent and skilful action -- the ideal aspiration of ubiquitous and context-aware computing -- overlooks the potential of self-awareness as a critical resource for interactive experiences grounded in the body. We propose a body-centred perspective on wearable technology informed by phenomenological theories on the body-tool relationship and pragmatist Somaesthetics prioritising the cultivation of the self through somatic awareness for improved life quality. We extend Heidegger's concept of present-at-hand with a new concept of present-at-body, defined as the reflective use of tools for developing bodily self-awareness. In our body-centred approach to wearable technology, we emphasise the dynamic interplay between visibility and transparency of body and tool as a fundamental resource for learning and self-development.	computation;context awareness;interaction;self-awareness;theory;wearable technology	Claudia Núñez-Pacheco;Lian Loke	2014		10.1145/2598510.2598546	simulation;self-awareness;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;multimedia;wearable technology	HCI	-59.62090724845385	-36.990997377038944	123478

0de6e7b7772838a0613d6a71a9fd9bb39949e1da	stepping back to progress forwards: setting standards for meta-evaluation of computational creativity	q335 artificial intelligence	There has been increasing attention paid to the question of how to evaluate the creativity of computational creativity systems. A number of different evaluation methods, strategies and approaches have been proposed recently, causing a shift in focus: which methodology should be used to evaluate creative systems? What are the pros and cons of using each method? In short: how can we evaluate the different creativity evaluation methodologies? To answer this question, five meta-evaluation criteria have been devised from cross-disciplinary research into good evaluative practice. These five criteria are: correctness; usefulness; faithfulness as a model of creativity; usability of the methodology; generality. In this paper, the criteria are used to compare and contrast the performance of five various evaluation methods. Together, these metaevaluation criteria help us explore the advantages and disadvantages of each creativity evaluation methodology, helping us develop the tools we have available to us as computational creativity researchers.	computation;computational creativity;correctness (computer science);feedback;ground truth;stepping level;tripod;usability	Anna Jordanous	2014			psychology;artificial intelligence;cognitive science	Web+IR	-61.93217846385356	-34.589774886365376	123748

New trends in HCI create new and interesting challenges for User Modeling. While consolidating results in traditional domains of interest, the User Modeling field now also addresses problems of personalized interaction in mobile, ubiquitous and context-aware computing and in user interactions with embodied, autonomous agents. It also considers adaptation to user attitudes and affective states. Previous successes in User Modeling research reflect the cooperation of researchers in different fields, including artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, education , cognitive psychology, and linguistics. Topics of Interest The areas of interest include, but are not limited to: • theoretical issues of user modeling • construction of user models • exploitation of user models to achieve • applications of UM techniques • practical issues of UM Submissions • Papers and Posters: Submissions are invited that describe original academic or industrial research on some aspect of user modeling.

Siemens as a global player possesses a tremendous portfolio of innovative technologies. In an effort to highlight some of these technologies, Siemens has organized an Internet-based event for selected industrial partners. The event comprised a virtual world showcasing five technological innovation areas, including video-based requirements engineering (VBRE). Attendees were connected to the virtual tradeshow and could visit manned booths, choose which technology presentation to attend, and even follow a guided tour.  The film we present shows VBRE immersed in a virtual world where the avatars of participants are guided in a tour, can interact with the technology, and experience the effects in real-time. A presenter first gives an introductory talk along with animated slides explaining key technology elements. During the tour, questions are asked by participants and answered by the presenter akin to following a tour guide in a museum. The avatars then interact with the virtual objects from the demonstrated VBRE technology. The film shows all of these aspects and in particular demonstrates how several different technologies are harmoniously brought together.	internet;presenter first;real-time transcription;requirement;requirements engineering;virtual world	Naoufel Boulila;Oliver Creighton;Georgi A.

Originally, the term was purely technical, and denoted the parts of a computer system that, unlike “hardware,” which was unchangeably manufactured in system electronics, could be altered freely. The first software amounted to the plug configuration of cables or switches on the outside panels of an electronic device, but as soon as linguistic means of altering computer behavior had been developed, “software” mostly denoted the expressions in more or less human-readable language that both described and controlled machine behavior.1	computer;digital revolution;human-readable medium;network switch	Eben Moglen	1999	First Monday		operating system;computer security	HCI	-56.78363680116903	-27.009238489499417	124034

Once these were the ways we used our operating systems and applications. Now they are reemerging within search engines. They are hidden and not easy to learn about, but I expect them to grow in power and, over time, become the dominant means of interaction. In this column I will talk about a second trend, one that also has much earlier origins: the return to physical controls and devices. In the theoretical fields that underlie our field, this is called embodiment: See Paul Dourish's book, Where the Action Is. But the trend is far more extensive than is covered by research on tangible objects, and somewhat different from the philosophical foundations implied by embodiment, so I use the term """" physicality. """" Physicality: the return to physical devices, where we control things by physical body movement, by turning, moving, and manipulating appropriate mechanical devices. We have evolved as physical creatures. We live in a complex, three-dimensional world filled with physical objects. We are analog beings in an artificial world of digital devices, devices that abstract what is powerful and good from the physical world and turn it into information spaces, usually in arbitrary ways. These new approaches put the body back into the picture. They require us to control through physical action rather than virtual, which means through mechanical devices, not electronic or graphic. At one point, when digital circuits took over the control of such mundane objects as automobile radios, physical controls were removed. Ugh. The most recent advances in automobile radios and other audio equipment is to reintroduce knobs for tuning and loudness control. Even BMW, in its attempt to replace all knobs, buttons, and controls with a single control knob and complex menu hierarchy, has been forced to bring back physical switches and knobs. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this trend is the Nintendo Wii game machine. Here, physical movement is the major method of interacting with its video games. The Wii has completely changed the game world: kudos to Nintendo!

5ed59abf8edcb5e729dbc032f537dcab020ab674	understanding musical practices as agency networks		This position paper proposes that creative practices can be usefully understood as agency networks. In particular it looks at interactive algorithmic musical practices and the takes a distributed view of the influences involved in such music making. The elements involved include humans, tools, culture and the physical environment that constitute a system or network of mutual influences. Such an agency network perspective is intended to be useful for the pragmatic tasks of designing new interactive music systems and developing new musical practices that utilise them. Drawing on previous research into generative music and computational creativity, various views on interactive music systems are canvassed and an approach to describing these as agency networks is developed. It is suggested that new human-machine musical practices may arise as a result of adopting an agency network perspective and that these, in turn, can drive cultural innovations.	computational creativity;dynamic music	Andrew R.

Within the language-sites initiative we have brought together a broad range of links to digital language corpora and resources. Via Google Earth's visually appealing 3D-interface users can spin the globe, zoom into an area they are interested in and access directly the relevant language resources. This paper focuses on several ways of relating the map and the online data (lexica, annotations, multimedia recordings, etc.). Furthermore, we discuss some of the implementation choices that have been made, including future challenges. In addition, we show how scholars (both linguists and anthropologists) are using GIS tools to fulfill their specific research needs by making use of practical examples. This illustrates how both scientists and the general public can benefit from geography-based access to digital language data. Geographic Information Systems are becoming very popular in searching language resources, presenting language related material, and merging linguistic evidence together with information from other disciplines. At the MPI for Psycholinguistics and within the DOBES project (Wittenburg, Mosel, & Dwyer, 2002) an increasing number of researchers is making use of this technique. Until now the following case scenarios were analyzed and implemented: • offering a geographic browsing option to locate language resources as an alternative for the normal metadata-based access • offering access to web applications to present complex resource bundles such as annotated media recordings or lexica with multimedia extensions • organizing the data of fieldworkers according to a procedure taken at the field site that is motivated by microvariations in a language • visualizing ethnologically relevant data via geographic markers Currently, Google Earth (Goodchild, 2006) is chosen as the primary system for rendering geographic information since it is the most popular one and many people are acquainted with it. However, the overlays that contain the linguistic and anthropological information are created as XML-based KML 2 files which means that we could easily transform them to fit with other (possibly web-based) geographic presentation frameworks. This is considered to be very important, since the availability of research information should not be restricted by the use of proprietary formats. 1. Reference to Catalogues Many potential users of language resources do not like to look for interesting data via the formal metadata 1 http://earth.google.com 2 http://code.google.com/apis/kml/ descriptions – be it in the form of electronic IMDI (Broeder, Offenga, Willems, & Wittenburg, 2001) or OLAC (Bird & Simons, 2001) catalogues. Mostly the semantics of the vocabularies are not known and the simple search options result in an information overload. The geographic metaphor is much more intuitive, since in general we relate cultures and languages with geographical areas. In addition, the geographical metaphor itself attracts much more non-experts, who are just curious. Therefore a worldwide initiative has been started by the DELAMAN network 3 of endangered language and music archives called Language-Sites.

The main diiculty that lays obstacles to the further development of real-time interactive systems for accelerated computer and telecommunications is the essential scantiness of a volume of information transmitted per unit of time. If for the non-interactive systems and for the conventional time interactive systems arranged for accelerated communications this diiculty may be more or less overcame by the using of various methods of compression and encoding as well as by the simultaneous development of the matherial (technical) basis then for the real-time interactive systems it becomes almost insurmountable under a naive approach. Moreover, the using of the real-time interactive systems for accelerated communications on large distances produces a new diiculty related to the impossibility to synchronize the internal rythms of subjects of a communication caused by the relativistic eeects; thus, if the distance is about N thousand of kilometers then a deviation in synchronization is theoretically not less than N=300 second and practically much more. 1 This is an English translation of the original Russian version, which is located at the end of the article as an appendix. I regret that the translation is too far from the precision of the original so in a case of any diierences between English and Russian versions caused by a translation the least has the priority as the original one. A remark is convenient: the term \informatics"""" widely adopted in Russian literature as for \computer science"""" as for \information science"""" and sometimes for the whole cybernetics (as it was proposed by N.Wiener) is used in the article without any speciication of its meaning.

The framework provides analysis techniques that can ensure the effective use of sound for a variety of applications, including virtual reality and data sonification systems. Specifically, we discuss data collection techniques for the perceptual qualities of single auditory stimuli including identification tasks, context-based ratings, and attribute ratings. In addition, we present methods for comparing auditory stimuli, such as discrimination tasks, similarity ratings, and sorting tasks. Finally, we discuss statistical techniques that focus on the perceptual relations among stimuli, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Pathfinder Analysis. These methods are presented as a starting point for an organized and systematic approach for nonexperts in perceptual experimental methods, rather than as a complete manual for performing the statistical techniques and data collection methods. It is our hope that this paper will help foster further interdisciplinary collaboration among perceptual researchers, designers, engineers, and others in the development of effective auditory displays.	multidimensional scaling;sonification;sorting;virtual reality	Terri L.

This is a place where you can eat Green Eggs and Ham. You can meet Big Bird or Donald Duck. This is not a place where adults roam freely. This is a place where fantasy can be a reality, And learning can be playful. This is a place which now includes computers. Today, children can interact with characters in ancient fables or new original poetry. With computer tools they can wander through animated reference materials that explain the scientific principles behind a zipper or a nuclear reactor. With computer games they can go out in space, back in time, or across the world and learn facts about science, history, and geography. Children can also be authors of their own multimedia experiences. They can create slide shows that feature the growth of a plant, music videos that animate the parts of the body, or	computer;flappy bird;pc game;reactor (software);where the wild things are	Allison Druin	1996	Interactions	10.1145/223500.223506	multimedia;human–computer interaction;engineering	HCI	-54.08315526135277	-27.733530082720147	125057

A computer vision system was required to generate digitized pictures for projects involving picture processing and ultimately to provide visual feedback for robot manipulators. High resolution was not as important as low cost in this application. A vision system was developed which used a modified dynamic RAM circuit to produce a 64 x 128 picture element binary image. Knowledge of the operation and physical layout of the dynamic RAM circuit was essential for design of the system.		R. A.

Touchless sensing products are being launched across consumer electronics, home, automotive and healthcare industries. Recent advances in haptics and display technologies has meant that interaction designers can also provide users with tactile feedback in mid-air AND display visual elements wherever the user needs them without in anyway instrumenting the user. The overarching goal of this workshop is to bring together a group of researchers spanning across multiple facets of exploring interactions with mid-air systems to discuss, explore, and outline research challenges for this novel area. We are especially interested in exploring how novel display and haptic technology provide users with more compelling and immersive experiences without instrumenting them in anyway.	computer;display device;experience;file spanning;haptic technology;instrumentation (computer programming);interaction	Sriram Subramanian;Sue Ann Seah;Hiroyuki Shinoda;Eve E.

0b2eab907e3c7db7b1a0556ddcffed6b7914ca12	the gui shock: computer graphics and human-computer interaction	human computer interaction;computer graphic	Someone recently wrote that SIGCHI was formed by computer scientists. This was an understandable error, but in addition to erasing several years of history, it glided over arguably the most wrenching transformation in human-computer interaction (so far). The transition from interfaces based on commands, forms, and full-page menus to graphical user interfaces based on windows, icons, and the mouse created opportunities, presented challenges, and wreaked havoc with some dominant HCI research programs of the early 1980s. Another such disruption is entirely possible. Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad, initiated in 1960 on the MIT Lincoln Labs TX-2 to make computers “more approachable,” launched computer graphics. To do so, Sutherland used the $10 million machine as a personal computer. (All prices in this article are converted to 2006 US dollars [1].) Sutherland’s appealingly informal 1963 thesis, beautifully digitized by Alan Blackwell and Kerry Rodden [2], introduced fundamental work on iconic representations, object-oriented techniques, constraints, interaction techniques, and approaches to animation. Sutherland noted economic as well as conceptual possibilities for digital cartoon creation 22 years before Toy Story. His goal of applying graphics to engineering practice was in his words “a big flop,” but the refreshingly frank analysis of that experience helped subsequent researchers develop computer-assisted design, adding to the value of a wondrous thesis. The TX-2 was very limited. Since then, aspects of computing capability have increased almost a billion-fold. This staggering change is easily overlooked when we focus on conceptual development, which has advanced much more slowly, but it is at the heart of how and when computer graphics and HCI research came together. HCI and computer graphics looked at hardware change differently. HCI research and development emphasized widely used or potentially widely used systems and applications. Therefore, it focused on relatively modestly priced systems or terminals. To HCI researchers, hardware advances meant greater capability at a fixed low price. Computer graphics research focused on very high levels of computation. Hardware advances meant lower cost for a fixed high level of computation. The details in Figure 1 (page 45) can be debated, but the contrast is clear. The difference in perspective had two effects. Computer graphics researchers were drawn to a handful of heavily funded centers—MIT, University of Utah, NYIT, Xerox PARC. This is not unusual: Leading physicists clustered around major observatories and accelerators; neuroscientists gathered in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan centers. But in contrast, useful human-computer interaction research could be conducted by anyone with a computer. The second effect was that the two fields remained largely apart until the price of computation declined.	alan f. blackwell;blackwell (series);ct scan;computation;computer graphics;computer scientist;computer terminal;computer-aided design;denial-of-service attack;flops;graphical user interface;high-level programming language;human–computer interaction;interaction technique;kerry mitchell;microsoft windows;personal computer;sigchi;sketchpad;tx-2;tomography	Jonathan Grudin	2006	Interactions	10.1145/1116715.1116751	computational science;human–computer interaction;computer science;graphics software;computer graphics;3d computer graphics;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-55.23660864853001	-26.60452485429077	126173
ff76ff05aa1ab17e5ca9864df2252e6bb44c8a17	gender recognition or gender reductionism?: the social implications of embedded gender recognition systems		Automatic Gender Recognition (AGR) refers to various computational methods that aim to identify an individual's gender by extracting and analyzing features from images, video, and/or audio. Applications of AGR are increasingly being explored in domains such as security, marketing, and social robotics. However, little is known about stakeholders' perceptions and attitudes towards AGR and how this technology might disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. To begin to address these gaps, we interviewed 13 transgender individuals, including three transgender technology designers, about their perceptions and attitudes towards AGR. We found that transgender individuals have overwhelmingly negative attitudes towards AGR and fundamentally question whether it can accurately recognize such a subjective aspect of their identity. They raised concerns about privacy and potential harms that can result from being incorrectly gendered, or misgendered, by technology. We present a series of recommendations on how to accommodate gender diversity when designing new digital systems.	advanced graphics riser;autonomy;computer security;digital electronics;embedded system;population;reductionism;robotics;social robot;systems design	Foad Hamidi;Morgan Klaus Scheuerman;Stacy M.

30516c0eb711342efd668e797fea427f46e197fe	towards a holophonic musical texture		Since the Middle Ages to the present, the nature of musical texture in western music has developed from Monophony through Polyphony to Homophony. It has been continuously modified as a reaction to the need to redefine the structural formation of the overall sound of the music of each period. In the last century, musical texture looks as if it has no clear direction. For example, music today often can exhibit more than one type of texture at the same time; this is called mixed texture or open texture. A more recently introduced type of texture, first used by Ligeti in the 1960s, is micropolyphony. This paper will present recent theories and ideas about the layering of sounds and their relationships from eminent electroacoustic music composers whose work covers a wide range of different aesthetics, styles and directions. The concept of the sound object in Schaefferian theory will be considered, and Smalley's spectromorphological approach, as well as ideas of Risset and Xenakis. In addition, ideas on theoretical models on the fusion of sound objects and perceptual processes by McAdams and Bergman will be examined. A theoretical background to musical texture and its main types will also be presented. The aim of this paper is to introduce and define the terms Holophony and Holophonic musical texture as a possible type of musical texture of our time following the paradigms of Monophony, Polyphony and Homophony. The explanation of compositional methodologies and techniques, as well as the analysis of compositional examples that fall under the type of Holophonic texture, are beyond the scope of this paper.	theory	Panayiotis Kokoras	2005			humanities;art;aesthetics;musical development;communication	Vision	-59.474686286465555	-31.046046362878187	126272

Can we develop an interactive game that will continue to engage the child in gameplay when the electricity supply fails? 2. What are the discernable differences in the ways children in Nepal and Portugal interact with the game given the huge socio-economic and cultural differences between them? The studies highlight the potential of the design in fostering continued engagement in the game when the electricity supply fails. They also show surprising little difference between the children in Nepal and Portugal. The observations suggest game mechanism and basic interactions can be regarded as universal across cultures and levels of income and can thus be designed and tested in any location and be expected to work and be understood by children from any culture and background.	avatar (computing);interaction	Yoram Chisik;Mon-Chu Chen;Maria Clara Correia Martins	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40477-1_44	multimedia;socioeconomics;cultural diversity;computer science	HCI	-57.960723077519894	-35.52634746848096	126358

L)OC 95-10/95 Savannah, Georgia, U S.A @ 1995 ACM 0-89791-713-8/95/0010 .$3.50 We created the online documentation (help) in Microsoft Word for Windows, and used the WinHelp authoring tool, which provided basic hypertext and indexing functionality. To do the testing, we adapted a “do-it-yourself” documentation formative usability test created by my colleague, SopKle Kohn Kaminsky. The klt includes a pretest questionnaire, the testing template, and a post-test feedback form. According to Ms Kohn Kaminsky, “I?orrnative usability testing involves asking peop~e to use a portion of the infomnation and give feedback, turning the feedback into improvements to the document, thel~ asking someone else to try it again. Formative usability testing is not gathering authoritative empirical dara for or against any broad principle in irtfonnation design. Nor is it an exhaustive test of all as ects of an information pa&age to rate its level of quality. Y“ As such, we found that formative usability testing is very appropriate to a prototyping design process. With prototyping, we have the opportunity to make successive refinements to documentation as refinements to the product are also being made. However, we made a significant change in the test itselfhy shifting its focus from documentation usability to product usability. The test basically required the subject to install the product, following directions in a “read-me” file, then to browse the online documentation to get familiar with the product, and then to perform a number of typical tasks with the product. We made sure to emphasize to tRe subject tha[ he or she was helping us to test the user interface, and that we were not testing his or her knowledge or abilities. The pre-test questionnaire gave us information about the subject’s background and experience level, which we took into consideration when interpreting the test results. The post-test questionnaire gave the subject the opportunity to provide subjective comments about the product and online help. 1. Sophie Kohn K,aminsky, Formative Usability lesting.

We introduce and frame an emerging research agenda that seeks to enhance social policy by working at the interface between the social sciences and the physical sciences (including mathematics and computer science), and term this research area the ‘‘social science interface’’ by analogy with research at the life sciences interface. We locate and exemplify the contribution of complexity science at this new interface before summarizing the contributions collected in this special issue and identifying some common themes that run through them.

As consequence, it is used in the context of digital curating to enable remote exhibition visits. In this paper, we are exploring what visitors win and what they lose in virtual exhibitions compared to their original. We created a virtual representation of a physical exhibition those values highly depend on its authenticity by being located in an original historical place and showing only original artefact. In a user study, we compared the exhibition experience of the physical with the virtual exhibition and gathered ideas about how the pure virtual exhibition can be augmented using digital media. Afterwards, we conducted an interview with museum experts. We discussed the results and ideas proposed in the first experiment. In conclusion, we summarize potential application for augmented VR exhibitions and highlight their values and limitations.	a/ux;digital media;experiment;gamification;money;usability testing;virtual artifact;virtual reality;visual artifact	Katrin Wolf;Jens Reinhardt;Markus Funk	2018		10.14236/ewic/EVA2018.15	multimedia;exhibition;art	HCI	-55.6495895650217	-30.883455602367757	127823

Many interaction designers have responsibility for a part of a larger application; many have sole responsibility for the overall experience of an application; and many have responsibility for the care and nurturing of a user experience, where others are free to chime in and change things. This last point reflects the nature of open source: You never know what someone will think up next, or how someone may change what you have already done.  Working successfully as a designer in an open source project means a huge amount of freedom and a lot of homework. You can do almost anything the technology will permit, because that's the point: It's an open and collaborative environment, where anyone can make a contribution. But it's not without rules, and that's where the homework comes in. For designers, it's imperative to understand where the flexibility lies and where the rules apply.  The articles in this section address project management, licensing options, and some of the community issues around open source software from experts working in this field. We also have a case study from the OpenOffice project and a technical introduction to SMIL, an open format for interactivity. We extend our sincere thanks to all of our contributors, and we hope you enjoy this exploration into open source.	imperative programming;interaction design;interactivity;mdl chime;open-source software;openoffice basic;primer;synchronized multimedia integration language;user experience	Elizabeth Dykstra-Erickson;Yann Cheri	2007	Interactions	10.1145/1300655.1300676	user experience design;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;interaction design;advertising;management;world wide web	SE	-60.319918460461395	-28.920320367135194	127892

To understand the issues better, this work first seeks insights into embedding from narrative theory and sets up a descriptive framework that includes a categorization of horizontal, vertical and modal embedding, as well as their associated characteristics. The paper then applies the framework to game narratives and examines how narrative embedding is implemented in games, how it helps structure the narrative content, and how it influences the narrative experience. By relating theoretical discussions to game examples, the findings of this study can potentially help game narrative designers make more informed decisions when embedding narrative in games.	categorization;embedded system;modal logic;narrative designer;video game developer	Huaxin Wei	2010		10.1145/1920778.1920818	narrative inquiry;game design;simulation;narrative criticism;narrative network;computer science;game mechanics;game art design;multimedia;game design document;communication	HCI	-60.55231165045047	-36.69676014649237	128103

Linking the two together i.e. creating context-aware user interfaces (UIs) remains a great challenge in computer science since ubiquitous computing calls for lean, situated, and focused UIs that can be operated on the move or intertwined with primary tasks grabbing the user's attention. The paper reviews major categories of context that matter at the seam of humans and computers, emphasizing quality issues. Approaches to the marriage of context-awareness and user modeling are highlighted, including our own approach. Both sides of the coin are inspected: the improvement of UIs by means of quality attributed context information and, to a lesser extent, the challenge to convey context quality to the user as part of the interaction.	computer science;context awareness;holism;human computer;human–computer interaction;information processing;microsoft outlook for mac;mike lesser;situated;tag (metadata);ubiquitous computing;user (computing);user interface;user modeling	Max Mühlhäuser;Melanie Hartmann	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04559-2_1	user interface design;user modeling;computer user satisfaction;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;context model;natural user interface;user interface;world wide web	HCI	-53.64348000278319	-36.81752765764418	128456

We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE. The paper considers single and multiparticipant shared environments, and draws on the experience of ComputerSupported Cooperative Working (CSCW) research as a guide to understanding presence in shared environments. The paper finally outlines the aims of the FIVE Working Group, and the 1995 FIVE Conference in London, UK.	autonomous robot;computer;computer-supported cooperative work;consciousness;immersion (virtual reality);neuromancer;programmer;realization (linguistics);virtual reality	Mel Slater;Sylvia Wilbur	1997	Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments	10.1162/pres.1997.6.6.603	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;virtual machine;artificial intelligence;operating system;multimedia	Visualization	-56.141299062574674	-34.49860361611371	128567

However, content is increasingly being geo-coded and semantically labeled, making explicit connections between the physical world around us and the virtual world in cyberspace. Most augmented reality systems simulate a portion of the physical world, for the purposes of rendering a hybrid scene around the user. We have been experimenting with approaches to terra-scale, heterogeneous augmented reality mirror worlds, to unify these two worlds. Our focus has been on the authoring and user-experience, for example allowing ad-hoc transition between augmented and virtual reality interactions for multiple co-present users. This form of ubiquitous virtual reality raises several research questions involving the functional requirements, user affordances and relevant system architectures for these mirror worlds. In this paper, we describe our experiments with two mirror world systems and some lessons learned about the limitations of deploying these systems using massively multiplayer and dedicated game engine technologies.	augmented reality;cyberspace;experiment;functional requirement;game engine;hoc (programming language);interaction;internet;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;mirror world;simulation;user experience;virtual reality;virtual world;world-system	Alex Hill;Evan Barba;Blair MacIntyre;Maribeth Gandy Coleman;Brian Davidson	2011	2011 International Symposium on Ubiquitous Virtual Reality	10.1109/ISUVR.2011.28	augmented reality;computer-mediated reality;artificial reality;the internet;simulation;human–computer interaction;content management;computer science;metaverse;virtual reality;mixed reality;multimedia;user interface;ubiquitous computing;immersion	Visualization	-50.4004753796111	-36.29612781489557	128979

Let me be more specific. A scientist gets a great idea about some important features of the individual organisms she wants to model. The first task in ALife is then to translate these features into algorithms and routines in a program. Our scientist expects the program to give some information about the global dynamics of the corresponding ecosystem (the so-called macro level). A naive view is to believe that “global properties to be compared to those observed in Nature will emerge from the computer simulations.” Most of us engaged in complex dynamical system research are aware that	algorithm;artificial life;complex dynamics;computer simulation;dynamical system;ecosystem	Gérard Weisbuch	2001	Artificial Life	10.1162/106454601300328043	computer science;artificial intelligence;artificial life	AI	-58.27711056421469	-24.346546408463738	129448

In particular we describe the ideal of contextual communications, where contextual cues collected by the wearable computer are used to establish and enhance communication links. We describe the hardware and software technology we have developed to support contextual communication and two experimental contextual communication systems. The first, a wearable conferencing tool uses the user's physical location to select the online conference which they connect to.

8aa7d4c9ab17e33b708f480880e66c5362f46e8b	toward meaningful engagement: a framework for design and research of gamified information systems		Gamification, an emerging idea for using game design elements and principles to make everyday tasks more engaging, is permeating many different types of information systems. Excitement surrounding gamification results from its many potential organizational benefits. However, few research and design guidelines exist regarding gamified information systems. We therefore write this commentary to call upon information systems scholars to investigate the design and use of gamified information systems from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and theories, including behavioral economics, psychology, social psychology, information systems, etc. We first explicate the idea of gamified information systems, provide real-world examples of successful and unsuccessful systems, and, based on a synthesis of the available literature, present a taxonomy of gamification design elements. We then develop a framework for research and design: its main theme is to create meaningful engagement for users; that is, gamified information systems should be designed to address the dual goals of instrumental and experiential outcomes. Using this framework, we develop a set of design principles and research questions, using a running case to illustrate some of our ideas. We conclude with a summary of opportunities for IS researchers to extend our knowledge of gamified information systems, and, at the same time, advance existing theories.	gamification;information systems;information system;theory	De Liu;Radhika Santhanam;Jane Webster	2017	MIS Quarterly		knowledge management;information system;discipline;behavioral economics;computer science;experiential learning;everyday tasks;design elements and principles;game design	HCI	-61.41259036840213	-35.30884385051044	129714
d7eeb1a2bd16ac2aa487b5ab5f33354d402d005c	guidelines to design playful multi-device environments based on tangible interaction	multi device environments;tangible interaction	Ubiquitous computing involves computers and technology that blend seamlessly into day to day living. In this way, the real and digital worlds have joined, offering interaction mechanisms which are more natural and tangible. However, the diversity of end-users has increased, that is, end-users have a wide range of skills, knowledge, disabilities, literacy, and so on. The first challenge is how the designer distributes the interfaces/information around the environment without overwhelming the user. The second is how to motivate and guide the user around the MDE (Multi-Device Environment) without distracting attention away from the task or the main objective. Taking into account that Tangible Interaction is more familiar and easier to learn for users without prior technology experience, we have developed and evaluated four prototypes. They are based on MDE games and Distributed and Tangible User Interfaces. Interfaces are distributed on devices and objects which offer tangible interaction with the user (with smart objects). After assessing the prototypes, 8 guidelines have been proposed based on the lessons learned. The aim is to provide a guide to design and to investigate Multi-Device Environments based on tangible interaction. 8 guidelines have been detailed in order to contribute to the design of the three interrelated elements: 1. real/space/interface distribution; 2. multi-user/collaborative tasks; 3. motivation/engagement interaction.	computer;model-driven engineering;multi-user;smart objects;tangible user interface;ubiquitous computing	Elena de la Guía;María Dolores Lozano;Victor M.

The resultant popular attitude toward artificial intelligence, we argue here, is by turns disdain, grudging acceptance, and fear. That attitude not only limits our work's potential, but also imperils its support. This paper proposes a constructive alternative: the development of collaborative intelligence. As envisioned here, a collaborative intelligence does not require encyclopedic command and need not be limited to a single problem. The necessary components of a collaborative intelligence are nearly at hand, and the key issues readily identified. As a first step, this paper proposes three challenging but accessible problems that would both change the public perception of artificial intelligence and spur substantive research to advance our science.	artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);cobot;cognitive dimensions of notations;computer;goto;intelligent agent;machine learning;our world;principle of good enough;resultant;simulation;software agent;synergy;wikipedia;world wide web;eric	Susan L.

It is derived from the Latin Carrus meaning """"car,"""" """"a load,"""" and, ult imately, """"overload or exaggeration."""" Since their inception, cartoons have presented a commentary on current events. The Greeks caricatured their gods and heroes, and in manuscripts from the Middle Ages, caricatures were used to satirize Satan, Death, and other unpopular personages [2]. The cartoon is a comic statement on human frailties and weaknesses. It reflects our fundamental delight in poking fun at the almighty or omniscient and has broad popular appeal because of its immediacy. As a caricature, the cartoon indicts personal, social, and political evil more incisively in many cases than tirades, lectures, or sermons [2]. A good cartoon can be as powerful as a thousand-watt spotlight, evoking a visceral reaction that not even the most stirring editorial can duplicate [1]. Historically, the most potent cartoons have been the political ones. Within the area of politics, cartoonists have influenced, as well as been influenced by, public opinion. In other areas, cartoons have provided insights into the social climate and even solidified public thinking on important social issues. Modern cartoons as social commentary trace at least as far back as Wil l iam Hogarth, the eighteenth century British painter and engraver. In America, Ben Frankl in drew one of the first-known cartoons in 1754, exhorting the Colonies to unify in fighting the French and Indian War. For the most part, the early American cartoons were solemn and heavy-handed; but by the late nineteenth century, Thomas Nast had added a touch of savage wit in his merciless drawings of Boss Will iam"""	dbpedia;gods	Walter M.

I know, big hot topic of debate. I’m going to sidestep that one and just say that for my purposes they all fall into the same camp. Why? Because, unlike that most despised language Java, there is in all those other languages and approaches a way to dig into something where you can see, feel, almost smell the results. With assembly (usually not CS1 material, but CS1+ material) there was the wonderful joy of manipulating those registers and drool-worthy opportunities to create tie-ins for new students about just how their mysterious machines worked! C had a similar ability to drill down into the system and I still get a joyous pedagogical grin when I think of all the times I created situations where unwary students would run over the bounds of an array and bring everything crashing down around their heads (or so it seemed to them). They learned something they never forgot about the internals of the machine, memory allocation, the importance of error checking, and developing their own debugging skills. Let me tell you: rarely did a student make that particular array mistake twice. More importantly they asked so many engaged questions and learned so much! C supported the creation of exercises like this whereas that darned Java and those darned bloated IDEs make it darned difficult to teach my fresh CS1 students in such a visceral way. Instead, we (they and me both) wade through Dante-esque agonies concerning the use of APIs, automated “helpful” features, and wads of other things that are not at all fun. Python, though I did not ultimately get to teach with it, was a blast to learn and I was all excited again about the possibilities for cutting past the smothering gobs of user interface helpfulness and developing exercises that not only taught a language but other things as well. Even more recently I sat in on a CS0 class using Alice which I helped develop in its early stages. Although there are many protective layers in Alice, I felt that those layers played a positive role. Introductory computing was fun again because I could see things hapI’ve been ponderIng thIs for a while because it is (mostly) true. I used to love teaching CS1 and other courses that came immediately on its heels. But now, with a few exceptions, I don’t. I’ve been wracking my brains about this because I am as passionate as ever about teaching, I love working with students and helping them learn especially when they are first getting their feet wet. In the last few years, I have channeled my interests into CSEd research, primarily on ... CS1 students. I continue to be fascinated by the way they think and by trying to figure out how to assist them with their learning. I got my first ever pair of glasses this week and in the odd synchronicity that I have come to expect in life they led me to think about teaching CS1+. When I sat those strange objects upon my nose I realized I was seeing the world as I used to see it. I hadn’t realized how much my vision had altered while I was paying attention to other things. Visual change snuck up on me just as a lessening interest in teaching CS1 snuck up on me. Unfortunately, resolving the CS1 issue isn’t a simple matter of plopping something on my nose or anywhere else. I had to think about this one. I re-read articles in the ACM Inroads magazine and other places for inspiration, percolated for a while, and finally, I think I got it. Teaching CS1 used to be fun—really fun. Now it is boring—really boring. I don’t care for programming in and of itself and I never have so that isn’t the source of the attitude change. But I can say with great emphasis that I really dislike Java. I will go so far as to say I really and truly dislike Java. Most CS1 courses nowadays are taught in Java.

The question I repeated was: """" How can the clutter of satellites cycling around the universe, the nature of electrons cycling through transistors , and microchips in computers, and Ott's ideas about the effects of artificial light cycling through the body affecting our health, be connected? """" I happened to be staying at a friend's house that night, sleeping on a couch several rooms away from his. In the middle of the night I awakened everyone in the house by repeatedly chanting: """" Break the binary code with light! Break the binary code with light! """" Some years later, I participated in a small network of futur-ists who were meeting at yet another conference. In sharing ideas with each other, I described my dream that some day photons rather than electrons would drive computers and other technologies. A new myth perhaps, yet how to achieve that seemed beyond reach to some scientists at Bell Labs, one of whom was in my network. Reflecting on that time, the effort in most earlier research was concentrated on speed: how to accelerate the movement of increasing bits of information into multiple binary pathways. Thus the potential for a new myth, slowing down the light, has recently emerged to break the limitations of the binary code with light. As reported in the Washington Post in January 2007: """" Scientists say that they have achieved a long-sought goal of slowing wave lengths of light to a relatively leisurely pace and using those harnessed pulses to store an image. """" The article goes on to say that the fast-paced field of """" slow light """" is a field that barely existed a decade ago: """" The fastest form of energy in the universe, light has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of technologies. Pulses of light can substitute for the digital 'ones' and 'zeros' that are today conveyed by relatively massive electrons on silicon chips.

378c1690d962767761252ca422a5263d45f77448	another take on renovating dated technology for concert performance		In a decade of collaborating closely with performers on concerts of electro-instrumental music, not as a composer but as a technological co-performer of other composers’ works, it has been regularly necessary to update – and sometimes improve – the technology used. This need often stems from the rapid obsolescence of both the hardware and software that has been used throughout the years. Indeed, many compositions that were created as recently as a decade ago need to have their technical component re-evaluated before a performance: all too often hastily designed and poorly maintained software necessitates some degree of overhaul in order to be used reliably in rehearsal and concert. Although this is not a new topic in computer music, many of the initial writings about this re-design of obsolescent technology have concerned themselves with a “historical performance practice” approach. Many performers and composers, however, concur that it is necessary to rethink and improve pieces’ technological component in order to be able to re-interpret them afresh. Just as performers desire to make the music they perform come alive for their audience through the use of creative interpretive decisions within the confines of the musical style and limits prescribed by the score, so, too, should the technological performer endeavor to make the electronic and computer music repertoire sound its best, from both technical and musical standpoints, in order to entice and enchant today’s increasingly discerning, technology-savvy audiences.

The EPA discovered that the German automaker had installed software in some of its diesel-engine cars that controlled a system for reducing the emission of environmentally hostile nitrogen oxides—but only during an emissions test. On the open road, the car belched nitrogen oxides, unbeknownst to its driver. Computers have been stealthily controlling cars for decades. My second car, a 1993 Honda Civic hatchback, had a computational device—an engine control unit—whose microprocessor received data from sensors in and around the engine. On the basis of those data, the ECU would consult preprogrammed lookup tables and adjust actuators that controlled and optimized the mix of fuel and air, valve timing, idle speed, and other factors. This combination of ECU and direct fuel injection not only reduced emissions and boosted engine efficiency, it was also less bulky and mechanically simpler than the device it replaced, the venerable carburetor. Unfortunately, however, the trend for computers in cars is toward greater complexity, not simplicity. Consider another Honda, the second-generation Acura NSX, which went on sale earlier this year. The supercar’s hybrid power train consists of a turbocharged V6 engine mated to three electric motors: one each for the two front wheels and one for the two rear wheels. An array of sensors, microprocessors, and actuators ensures that all three motors are optimally deployed during acceleration, cruising, and braking. And talking of braking, the NSX’s brake pedal isn’t actually mechanically connected to the brakes. Rather, it activates a rheostat, which controls the brakes electronically. To preserve the feel of mechanical braking, a sensor gauges how much hydraulic pressure to push back on the driver’s foot. In Formula One racing, the proliferation of computer control has led to an arms race among manufacturers, which reached its apogee in 1993. Thanks in part to its computer-controlled antilock brakes, traction control, and active suspension, the Williams FW15C won 10 of the season’s 16 races. The sport’s governing body responded by restricting electronic aids. By the 2008 season, all cars were compelled to use the same standard ECU. The 23-year-old Williams FW15C retains a strong claim to being the most technologically sophisticated Formula One car ever built. Computers aren’t confined to supercars or racing cars. The July issue of Consumer Reports ranked cars’ infotainment systems, with Cadillac’s being among the worst. Owners reported taking months, even years, to master its user interface. “This car REALLY needs a co-pilot with an IT degree,” one despairing owner told the magazine. And this past May, USA Today reported that consumer complaints about vehicle software problems filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) jumped 22 percent in 2015 compared with 2014. Recalls blamed on software rose 45 percent. I’m not against computers in cars. Rather, I worry that their encroachment will become so complete that consumers like me will be deprived of the choice to buy a car that lacks such fripperies as a remote vehicle starter system, rear vision camera, head-up display, driver seat memory, lane departure warning system, and so on. I worry, too, that even as the NHTSA records more software problems, it’s also considering whether to mandate computer-controlled safety features.	coat of arms;computation;computer control company;diesel;download;engine control unit;head-up display;human computer;lookup table;microprocessor;potentiometer;power supply;second life;sensor;traction teampage;user interface;wheels;williams tube;xbox live vision	Charles Day	2016	Computing in Science and Engineering	10.1109/MCSE.2016.84	computational science;simulation;computer science;computation;algorithm	Mobile	-58.20508407494275	-26.0881502602142	132479

When purchasing a game, people want to be entertained. When purchasing a graphical modeling package, people want to be able to create shapes. It seems simple, but all too often designers get caught up in the details and lose track of the primary purpose of the product. Good CHI design always keeps the end result of the product in mind. In particular, the first time someone uses a product is a very delicate time, when most users experience some level of apprehension. Novice computer users are often concerned about their ability to understand how a new product works. Advanced users may be doubtful of the product’s ability to perform the task at hand, or have preconceived notions from using similar products. In any case, the sooner users can achieve goals, or at least see some part of a goal tangibly fulfilled, the better. Time is an incredibly important factor in these early stages. Many people become frustrated if the product requires too much learning, preparation, or reading before results can be achieved. Any early frustration with a product can easily lead to the user abandoning the product. Instant gratification is a great way of providing the user with an timely sense of accomplishment. For instance, in our 3-D modeling About Play, Inc. Play Incorporated’s goal is to democratize the medium of television by creating tools that allow anyone to create and distribute broadcast television-quality video productions. As an example, Play recently launched PlayTV.com, an Internet-only television station that broadcasts worldwide 12 hours of original programming every weekday.

Focusing on the Francophone ergonomic tradition and especially the German studies of work and working conditions, both based on in-depth field studies in ordinary work settings, the paper attempts to situate these traditions vis-à-vis the research program of CSCW. It is not a historical accident that ethnographic and other in-depth forms of workplace studies play a dominant role in ECSCW and have come to play an important role in CSCW and HCI at large. Ethnographic studies of cooperative work settings have a central role in CSCW for the simple reason that it is of critical importance for the development of appropriate (and appropriately flexible) coordination technologies to develop a systematic conception of the logics of coordinative practices. And in this regard, the overwhelming challenge is to cope with the enormous variety of work practices. Thus, in the history of CSCW research, a major issue has been to overcome theoretically derived, ideologically postulated, or otherwise preconceived notions about the research phenomenon: cooperative work. This has involved, first of all, questioning many notions about work, derived from popular management literature, such as the putative advantages of ‘group work’ or ‘team work’ and the desirability of more ‘cooperation’ in the workS.

b606d127c4338b912da5d1ff81228f64a161c9ed	news track		ROBOT RUN A team of roboticists are using the lessons of 1930s physiologist Nikolai Bernstein to build the world’s fastest walking robot. BBC News reports Runbot, a self-learning, dynamic robot, is helping scientists unravel the mystery of walking. The small, bipod robot can move at speeds of more than three leg lengths per second, slightly slower than the fastest walking human. Bernstein claimed that animal movement was not under total control of the brain but rather “local circuits” did most of the command and control work. The brain gets involved in the process only when the understood parameters change, such as on uneven surfaces. Following this theory, a team of scientists from a variety of European labs built Runbot’s walking steps to be controlled by peripheral sensors on its joints and feet, as well as an accelerometer that monitors pitch. As the robot takes each step, control circuits ensure that joints are not overstretched and that the next step begins. Florentin Woegoetter, a professor at the University of Gottingen in Germany, explains the human gait cycle requires little brain input as we typically just fall forward. “We are propelling ourselves over and over again—like releasing a spring. In a robot, the difficulty lies in releasing the springlike movement at the right moment in time— calculated in milliseconds—so that the robot does not fall forward and crash.”	crash (computing);fastest;mobile robot;peripheral;phil bernstein;robotics;sensor	CACM Staff	2007	Commun.

290686b13ef6b902ab14b287850e12b74ec39c84	a pattern language experiment. lego mindstorms robots		June 2003 and the eighth European Pattern Languages of Programming conference may yet prove to be the most historic. On the Friday there emerged the first activity of an extremely ambitious experiment which, it is hoped, will run over twelve months and more. If the experiment is successful it may reshape the thinking of the Patterns Movement. The aim of the experiment is to validate the feasibility of a truly generative pattern language (in the Alexanderian sense) for computing intensive systems. The difficulty of such an experiment is the explosion of design variables that emerge in any non-trivial constructed system, and therefore the size of any pattern language that could accompany it. Christopher Alexander, let it be remembered, considered patterns to be rules for making structures that were in some sense ‘living’. A pattern is both the thing and the process for making that thing. The trick is to organize all the appropriate patterns to make all the ‘things’ in your system in such a way that the ‘whole’ they construct and the different elements that make up that whole exist in harmonious relationship with each other. This implies that the pattern language constitutes more or less the whole of the overarching process by which a system is created. Or to be more precise, it is by applying a sequence of patterns, each one being applied to the system and thus changing the context ready for the next to be applied, that the system is constructed.	lego mindstorms;plop;pattern language	Alan O'Callaghan;Maria Kavanagh	2003			robot;computer engineering;computer science;pattern language	AI	-56.10871419494337	-25.11838365699195	134946

The reason for this is the software development process, which typically approaches the complexity of the design process via abstraction. In John Carroll's book, however, he shows how using scenarios can transform information systems design into something that is easier to learn and use. Instead of treating designs as though putting pieces of a puzzle together, a scenario is a concrete story about use. A good example of a scenario can be found in the following: """" a person turned on a computer; the screen displayed a button labeled Start; the person used the mouse to select the button. """" In other words, scenarios are useful in coordinating the central task of system development; this includes understanding people's needs, envisioning new activities and technologies, designing effective systems and software, and drawing general lessons from systems as they are developed and used.

What happens when the way those bonds are formed is radically changed over the course of a single generation? This is the case with the rise of online dating, which is now the second most common way for people to meet a romantic partner. Despite existing research exploring issues such as mate selection, self-presentation, and impressions, we still do not know how online dating systems affect people’s perceptions—about technology, relationships, romantic partners, and themselves—and how these perceptions affect behavior. In this paper, we introduce and explicate the Source Multiplicity, Attribution, Recognition, and Transformation (SMART) Model of Online Dating.

It is especially valuable at situations in which challenges are complex and ambiguous. Design thinking includes two distinct approaches: diverging and converging. It requires both a flexible way of understanding, to come with various ideas, and know-how to make informed decisions. These opposing activities are poured into an explanatory model. However, a rigorous design thinking process might be considered as a limitation on creative thinking. Also, the promise of a straightforward all-in-one solution for complex problems seems rather unrealistic [1]. Futures studies exceed design thinking on the aspect of the acceptance of plausible options by freeing the apparent certainties [2]. This is primarily useful at the early phase of a design thinking practice when the problem should be explored. Whether a focus on the future context of a designed product could be recognized as added value, must still be inquired. This is a reflective paper on a two-day workshop developed for User Experience students in China that applied techniques from futures studies combined with design thinking and narrative techniques. In particular, the participants were design thinking newbies used to operate in an educational context with focus on traditional lecture-based pedagogy [3].	ambiguous grammar;complexity;futures studies;interaction;multi-function printer;newbie;software design;usability;user experience	Wentao Wang	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-91803-7		HCI	-62.59318064271071	-34.693941192548515	135516
cbda2140d7c65937351849a211a79e07b51af037	controversy revisited: the mythseeker project		The June, 1994 issue of the Journal of Systems and Sofmare struck a bell. In the “Controversy Corner,” McCagie Brooks Rogers describes the Mythseeker Project as a framework for computerizing traditional religious experience. The bell that was struck sounded to me less like the gong of the boxing ring calling us to “come out fighting” than like the peal of an ancient church bell that gathers human energies around a project that radiates awe and respect for the sublime. The Yale computer scientist David Gelernter, author of Mirror Worlds and The Muse and the Machine, describes the contemporary phase of software engineering as analogous to the early phase of building the great cathedrals in Europe. We are embarking on something monumental that will forever leave its mark on the future. The systems we put up today will gradually coalesce into ever grander networks. Gelernter describes the complexity of the future networks in terms of great software cities. The concepts of the Mythseeker Project described in JSS are the first explicit outlines of that collaboration between software engineering and religious aspiration. Another evolution also emerges in Rogers’ Mythseeker. The hardware and software industries are currently gearing up for the next stage of evolution, in which we will enjoy vast networking and communications capabilities throughout the globe. Call it the “information superhighway” or the Internet running Mosaic through the home cable lines. That evolutionary step-like the one from command-line< interfaces to GUIs-will require new powers of data visualization. “Virtual reality” offers a teleological omega-point for that more intuitive grasp of data. And Rogers’ Mythseeker places the goal or telos at the apex of human culture: the exploration of the human spirit through myth, symbol, and all the “depth systems” that history and cultural traditions can afford. As I point out in my book The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality, our engineering community has for years found nourishment and ideas in science fiction, from Star Trek to Heinlein, Clarke, and Gibson. We are now reaching a point where those fictions are beginning to erupt into realities. What better way to acknowledge the idealism and splendor of software engineering than to publish the description of McCagie Rogers’ Mythseeker System?	apex (geometry);chaitin's constant;command-line interface;computer scientist;data visualization;edmund m. clarke;information superhighway;javascript style sheets;mirror world;null (sql);object type (object-oriented programming);software engineering;star trek;sublime text;the machine;virtual reality	Michael Heim	1995	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/0164-1212(94)00112-Z	management	SE	-57.37351928276363	-26.96900801042125	135591

Pillows used on replica furniture in the exhibit were used as interaction points. Each pillow consisted of one or more touch activated audible clips that were tied to electro luminescent wire or LED's. Each pillow used an open source set of components that could be adjusted and tailored to changes in the exhibit so that curators could change audio files and sequencing. Each pillow would be controlled by one Arduino, one audio trigger, and one set of electro luminescent wire sequencers. These components were packaged into a small box along with batteries and placed inside the pillows. Each kit was designed to allow for expansion and use inside any pillow.	arduino;computer;interactivity;open-source software	Justin Taylor	2012	2012 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Environments	10.1109/IE.2012.69	simulation;engineering;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	-52.33758781706051	-29.95486978785263	135709

The development of embedded user models (EUMs) draws on research in cognitive science and systems engineering and should be of interest to designers of user interfaces and researchers in human-computer interaction. This paper consolidates ideas about EUMs formed in the course of four projects funded under the British Government's Alvey Programme on advanced information technology. It discusses the relationship between user models, knowledge representation, human inference and instructional strategies, and presents views about the current state of the art in precompetitive research systems, its limitations and possible future directions for work.	embedded system	Rod Rivers	1989	Interacting with Computers	10.1016/0953-5438(89)90004-0	user interface design;user;user experience design;user modeling;computer user satisfaction;interactive systems engineering;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;user requirements document;software engineering;multimedia;user interface;world wide web	Theory	-54.7529287046124	-35.054463922019096	135761

58c687ae3b16cad143307d395059177cb144accf	information retrieval and ocr: from converting content to grasping meaning	cmu;image formation;information retrieval;indexing and retrieval	"""IR and OCR have largely developed independent standards and metrics, with OCR focused on literal accuracy, and IR focused on essential """"content/meaning"""". With more and more media not only paper, but in multiple image formats, the opportunities and challenges for OCR on new formats -- video and still images -- are enormous. While OCR is assessed in metrics that emphasize words and characters, IR has learned to apply end-to-end metrics that ask whether the needs of the users can be met by existing systems. The same considerations apply also to the problem of providing permanent worldwide access to millions of pages of legacy print documents, representing the shared human record as it existed until just a few years ago.The International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) has held a series of Document Recognition and Retrieval (DRR) conferences. The tenth, DRR X will be held in January 2003, in Santa Clara California. In 2001, Dan LoPresti of Bell Labs decided that the area would benefit from more intense collaboration between those who specialize in finding the words on a page image, and those researchers who know how to find the right documents, given the words. He invited Paul Kantor (Rutgers) to join the DRR Chairs, and together they invited Dave Lewis (Consultant) to give a keynote address at DRR VIII. Dan then stepped down. Paul chaired DRR IX (2002) and then handed the reins to Tapas Kanungo (IBM, Almaden) and together they invited Jamie Callan (CMU), David Grossman (IIT) and Alex Hauptmann (CMU) to join the conference committee for DRR X.To improve communication between SIGIR and DRR, this group proposed a SIGIR workshop on this area. The workshop on """"Information Retrieval and OCR: From Converting Content to Grasping Meaning"""" was intended to stimulate cross-fertilization between OCR and IR, in hopes that better use of IR will enable the OCR community to avoid expensive hand processing, and to demonstrate that the combination of present static and dynamic image processing and present state-of-the-art robust information retrieval can generate substantial advances in both extraction of messages from image streams and conversion of existing paper variants. It solicited papers dealing with future applications, such as the indexing and retrieval of text embedded in static or video graphic images, with problems of skew, distortion, and obscuration, as well as state-of-the-art discussions of the storage and retrieval of handwritten or print legacy materials.The workshop was held on August 15, 2002 in Tampere, Finland, immediately following the SIGIR 2002 conference. Although the workshop was intended to appeal to a wide range of IR and OCR researchers (and indeed was proposed at the request of colleagues from the OCR community), it primarily drew people with a background in IR. About a dozen people participated. The small size allowed a very interactive, seminar-style format and very vigorous discussion between and during presentations. Most presentations ran 30% to 50% longer than planned, and our impression is that most of the participants found it very productive."""	ct scan;clara.io;dave grossman (game developer);deficit round robin;distortion;embedded system;end-to-end principle;image file formats;image processing;information retrieval;integrated information theory;literal (mathematical logic);optical character recognition	James P.

In contrast to traditional pictures of television use, our evidence suggests that rhythms across households play an important role in shaping television watching. Further, we found a flexibility and openness within the patterns of television viewing that we refer to as “plasticity.” Our data suggest that plasticity and rhythms co-exist and together compose the qualitative experience of domestic television time; an understanding of both aspects of temporality suggests an approach for the design of future television technologies.	ecology;field research;image;large-screen television technology;noise shaping;openness;the simpsons	Lilly Irani;Robin Jeffries;Andrea Knight	2009	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-009-0280-1	simulation;video;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;ethnography	HCI	-54.84972900291073	-37.21972258224218	136415
0a99556957c3553f8fcc2fcc88c674b17a27a0ba	to predictability and beyond: 20 years of color printing at cic		Color printing has been a key topic at CIC since its kick-off in 1993 and is still well represented today. This invited talk will provide an overview of the variety of print-related work presented at this conference over the last 19 years and will give some thought to future direction. The material shown in print here is only a brief summary of the talk and the interested reader is advised to look for a copy of the slides after the conference at the following address: http://www.slideshare.net/jmorovic/ Color printing at the CIC Of the 1240 papers that will have been presented at the CIC by the end of this year’s conference, 313 are print–related (Figure 1), which represents between a third and a fifth of papers presented in any one year. Figure 1. Print–related papers as a proportion of all CIC papers. Beyond looking just at how much of the CIC’s attention has been aimed at printing, let us also take a closer look at what aspects of it were presented and discussed during the first 20 CICs (Figure 2). Figure 2. Topics addressed by print–related papers. About a quarter of all print-related papers were concerned with predicting color or spectral properties of print colorant overprints and/or their halftoned patterns, which is at the basis of using printers in color reproduction, of keeping printers calibrated and of making choices when designing printing systems. In essence all the effort in this area aims to provide predictability of printed color without the need to print and measure. Since the interactions among colorants and with a substrate (which can range from traditional paper-like ones to plastics, textiles and even ceramics) are so complex and dependent on the specifics of the materials involved, were are still not in a position where an arbitrary printing systems could be easily and accurately characterized. Another quarter of papers was concerned with what I call ‘workflows,’ which encompasses such topics as color management, color reproduction, spectral reproduction and the enabling of specialists applications (e.g., print verification, encryption of data in print, etc.). This topic was the most dominant one during the early years of CIC, but has maintained good representation throughout the last 19 years. As other parts of the color and imaging ecosystem change, so too do its interactions with print and so does the challenge of re-targeting and repurposing content meant for one medium for another. The next most popular aspect of dealing with print has been that of adjusting original/source color content to fit the range of colors that print is capable of generating – i.e., color gamut mapping. This topic has been particularly strong during the first 10 years of CIC, but has had peaks more recently too. One of the reasons for its popularity and recent resurgence is that no universally successful solution exists for this problem and that whenever progress is made elsewhere (e.g., image difference prediction, print quality evaluation), attempts are made to roll it back here. The last of the larger areas of focus is that of evaluating print – either by itself and as a function of its constituent materials or in the context of it being the reproduction of other color content. This is a topic that has seen particular growth in recent years and I believe has strong potential to keep our attention in the coming years. The better our understanding of what a given print’s properties are, the better a chance we have to adjust them to an optimal state. The remaining 20 per cent of papers have addressed various color processing algorithms relevant to print (e.g., more efficient, accurate or faster interpolation algorithms), have presented solutions to color halftoning, have introduced new printing hardware and materials or have been about tools that could be used to better understand print attributes or the workflows that have lead to them. During the talk I will pick out my favorite print-related papers from the last 19 CICs and try to give a flavor of how things have 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 19 93 19 94 19 95 19 96 19 97 19 98 19 99 20 00 20 01 20 02 20 03 20 04 20 05 20 06 20 07 20 08 20 09 20 10 20 11 20 12 P ap er s Year Print–related papers (313 total) 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 19 93 19 94 19 95 19 96 19 97 19 98 19 99 20 00 20 01 20 02 20 03 20 04 20 05 20 06 20 07 20 08 20 09 20 10 20 11 20 12 P rin t-r el at ed p ap er s	algorithm;color management;customer information control system (cics);encryption;independence day: resurgence;interaction;interpolation;printing;relative intensity noise	Ján Morovic	2012			color printing;computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science;predictability	Visualization	-55.21530604293194	-29.03917858893977	136857

My dad and I built a Tesla coil, and I got a few 20,000-volt shocks, but my parents weren’t afraid because we were Christian Scientists, and didn’t believe that God would allow us to get hurt as long as we had a positive attitude and safety goggles. At university, I considered studying genetics or neuroscience, but I couldn’t handle dissections or vivisections. Instead, I became a researcher at the computer–human interface, working on problems such as artificial touch and computer vision at places including Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and Adobe Systems in Seattle, Washington. Then I created my own companies, combining interactive art with business.	computer vision;goggles;interactive art;tesla coil;user interface	Jascha Hoffman	2012	Nature	10.1038/485172a	multimedia;software;sonar;wonder;art;new media;biophilia hypothesis	HCI	-54.627125157447935	-26.014281462522266	137101

Reasons for this include: ergonomics information is not presented in a readily assimilated form to designers during their design education and later design activities; design decisions relating to ergonomics issues are not addressed and discussed systematically by all members of the design team during concept design; the user centred approach that ergonomics encourages in design is not always included as part of the education of future designers. With computers being used more widely in design and design education, they could be used to deliver ergonomics information and help structure discussion of ergonomics issues amongst the design team from the earliest stages of design. This paper describes findings relating to the use of ergonomics in automotive design, and proposes two tools which could enhance the use of ergonomics in design education and in current and future design practice.	computer;human factors and ergonomics	Andrée Woodcock;Margaret Galer Flyte	1997	Digital Creativity	10.1080/09579139708567087	visual arts;user experience design;participatory ergonomics;design research;strategic design;human–computer interaction;experience design;computer science;knowledge management;environmental graphic design;design review;management science;design education;product design;design technology;management;concept art;cognitive ergonomics;design brief	HCI	-61.94193373978601	-37.6072554270833	137291

This activity served as a """"take away"""" product used as a tool for reflection and representation of their experiences. Together, students in design teams documented the week's activities using an iPod touch, generating the media they then included in comic books created using the software, Comic Life. Most studies of comics for learning examine the benefits of comic consumption. By contrast, we aim to understand the possible value of comic production. We found that youth vividly depicted themselves, their teammates, and their group work. Humor and joking dominated comics and our analysis indicated that the comic form was expressive, with depictions of self and others made possible by the ease of the technology and the comic form. The comics also generated excitement and a desire among students to share their experiences with friends and family."""	book;experience;reflection (computer programming);ipod	Shelley Goldman;Molly Bullock	2013		10.1145/2485760.2485835	humanities;art;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-58.29898522057285	-35.36066392248595	137515

To support face-to-face contact and social interaction, we position users around a shared multi-touch table, which very much resembles the social setting of traditional tabletop board games. To our knowledge, the Interactive Storyteller is the first AI-based interactive storytelling system that combines an emergent narrative approach with the social aspects of traditional tabletop board games. We carried out user experiments to investigate to what extent our system supports social interaction. By analysing the interactions of pairs of children with the Interactive Storyteller, we determined which system aspects triggered cooperation and highly social behaviour and which aspects caused players to behave less socially. We also tried to find out whether the use of tangible playing pieces offered any advantages over touch-only interaction, but we did not find any differences between the two.

"""" If [the images] lead to further and more quantitative inquiry on the part of the viewer, the tools and literature are there to help. """" Early exploration Heller first combined graphics, art, and science while working at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he was a staff scientist from 1982 to 1984. """" They took graphics seriously, """" he explained, """" and they still do. """" While at Los Alamos, Heller made the first in a series of significant discoveries while creating images purely for aesthetic reasons. By using the graphical tools as Los Alamos, Heller discovered the phenomena of """" scarring """" waves, something that had eluded other investigators before him. The discovery was purely a graphical one, later backed up with theory he worked out that explained why the scars had to be there. The image and the theory, having to do with unstable periodic orbits in a sea of chaotic nonperiodic orbits, were published in """" These unstable orbits have no 'weight' in classical physics, """" Heller elaborates, """" but exert their disproportionate effect on the quantum states, many of which are 'scarred' along the periodic orbits. """" Figure 1 shows a modern version of those early images: Double Diamond, which is a scarred wave function. Nowadays, Heller sets up shop in the Departments of Physics and Chemistry at Harvard University, where he got his PhD in chemical physics in 1973. Many times while tinkering away and studying something like collisions in physics, for example, he winds up discovering ways to manipulate the algorithm to produce art.

By creating interesting and well authored personalities, these characters are able to interact with each other and create appealing non-scripted stories. As with any other story, we may want to re-tell it or create a summary of the essential parts. Our goal was to create comic-like summaries of these stories. This paper presents a system that analyses story logs, looks at the characters' emotional information to understand their actions and their importance in the story, selects the most important events and creates comic strips. Forty users evaluated the system and the results show that the summaries driven by the characters' emotional information are effective when compared with showing the stories as they unfold.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;interactive storytelling;strips	Tiago Alves;Ana Simões;Rui Figueiredo;Marco Vala;Ana Paiva;Ruth Aylett	2008		10.1145/1402821.1402848	multimedia	HCI	-48.42230725101836	-35.532022137226676	138864

For some, these questions have lost their relevance. Not only are computers more available than ever before, information about them is easy to find. Mall bookstores and those on college campuses are filled with titles about personal computer software and hardware. Computers have become a commodity technology partly because of this mass of documentation, for the goal of much of it is to make the private, coded discourse of technical professionals accessible to those with no formal training in computers. Not even the advent of the automobile, which marked the previous popular revolution in technology, called forth so much explication of technical matters. Of particular relevance to educators in higher education is the fact that more and more students are exposed to computers before they get to college. According to Snyder and Hoffman (1992, p. 432), the percentage of public schools using microcomputers jumped from 18.2 in 1981 to 97.2 in 1990. This huge growth in under ten years reflects the (banal, but inescapable) impression most of us share: computers are everywhere.

The computer, in one ofits many possible impersonations, will provide the additional processing power needed to support these extensions. But material instruments will have to be matched, on the human individual's side, by the acquisition ofnew competencies. Hardware is not really an issue: what is needed is the crafting of a new culture (in the standard sense of 'and integrated set of tools, skills, and traditions'). Thus, we are not thinking as much of a """"bionic prothesis"""" as of a computational literacy culture as naturally integrated with one's person as other acquired cultural habits such as living in a home, playing a violin, or reading a book.The design of a culture is no doubt a delicate engineering task; one that involves both humans and computers will be doubly demanding.

Human-computer interaction (HCI) specialists have addressed complex interaction issues for many years in the context of research or usability investigations, very often using observational data. HCI specialists usually have been trained in a specific discipline, giving them an intellectual heritage that often constrains the questions they ask, the kind of observational data they collect, the methods of analysis they use, and very often the answers they find as well. However, with its rich behav-ioral, cognitive, and social characteristics, human-computer interaction usually demands questions, data, and methods that defy a single-discipline approach and yield most easily to an exploratory approach that cuts across disciplinary boundaries. Exploratory, interdisciplinary approaches to analyzing observational data are open-ended and risky. How can we lay some paths across this new territory? Human-computer interactions are usually sustained episodes that unfold over time. As long as data collection is adequately supported through logging and audiovisual recording, observational methods let us preserve the sequence of events. In some cases, the sequential information is not used; for example, we may collate video clips of users' misunderstandings or count the number of times erroneous actions take place. In other cases, the sequential information is used; for example, we may look for repeated sequences of keystrokes that suggest poor design, or in a collaborative work setting we may ask whether one person's actions depend upon another's actions in a cause-and-effect manner.

Virtual Communities develop and grow in electronic space. or ‘cyberspace’. Authors such as Benedikt Meyrowitz and Mitchell have theorised about the nature of electronic space whilst Lefebvre. Popper, Hakim Bey (aka Lamborn Wilson) and Kuhn have theorised more generally about the nature of space. Extending this tradition and the works of these authors, this paper presents a language based perspective on the nature of electronic spaces. Behaviour in cyberspace is based on and regulated by hardware, software tools and interfaces. A definition of electronic space cannot be given beyond its linguistic characteristics, which underlie and sustain it. The author believes that the more users and developers understand the relationship between language and cyberspace, the more they will be able to use specific metaphors for dwelling and inhabiting it. In particular, MUDs/MOOs and the Web are interesting places for testing and observing social behaviours and dynamics.	cyberspace;mud;mitchell corporation;virtual community;while;world wide web	Anna Cicognani	1998	Virtual Reality	10.1007/BF01409794	social behavior;computer science;artificial intelligence;mechanical engineering	Visualization	-59.74853977916861	-31.818601174521906	140344

Arguably, playground games are the universal, cross-cultural venue in which people learn about and explore coordination between one another, and between the worlds of articulated rules and the worlds of experience and action. They can therefore (1) teach us about the processes inherent in human coordination, (2) provide a model of desirable coordinative possibilities, and (3) act as a design framework from which to explore the relationship between game and game play---or, to put it in terms of an inherent tension in human-computer interaction, between plans and situated actions. When brought together with a computer language for coordination that helps us pare down coordinative complexity to essential components, we can create systems that have highly distributed control structures. In this paper, we present the design of four such student-created collaborative, distributed, interactive systems for face-to-face use. These take their inspiration from playground games with respect to who can play (plurality), how (appropriability) and to what ends (acompetitiveness). As it happens, our sample systems are themselves games; however, taking playground games as our model helps us create systems that support game play featuring not enforcement of plans but emergence of rules, roles, and turn taking.	computer language;control flow;distributed control system;emergence;human–computer interaction;point of view (computer hardware company);situated;venue (sound system)	Deborah G.

a971bef51154ad8e4c17aa580d7bf7da9d9117b3	the meaningful integration of interactive media in architecture		Current media architecture practice demonstrates the rich potential of interactive media in our built environment for various economic, social and cultural purposes. However, the meaningful integration of interactive media with(in) architecture remains challenging, as architects typically expect that media-specific qualities amplify the architectural intentions and experience of the built environment. This paper demonstrates how this challenge can be tackled by grounding the design rationale of an interactive media architecture manifestation on fundamental architectural motives, such as the intended physical, experiential and communicative characteristics. More specifically, we discuss the design rationale of a permanent, sound-based media façade that will consist of the dynamic mechanical actuation of multiple wooden window frames. By explicitly articulating the design rationale in an architectural framework, this paper aims to inform emerging HCI research on human-building interaction (HBI) from a 'building' perspective.	design rationale;enterprise architecture framework;host-based intrusion detection system;human–computer interaction;interactive media	Maarten Houben;Benjamin Denef;Matthias Mattelaer;Sandy Claes;Andrew Vande Moere	2017		10.1145/3064857.3079143	multimedia;enterprise architecture framework;engineering;interactive media;human–computer interaction;reference architecture;built environment;design rationale;architecture;architecture framework;solution architecture	HCI	-59.82557399003403	-37.366180126189164	141594

From the Hulk to dinosaurs, this work requires physiologically accurate, yet flexible, robust, and efficient muscle simulation techniques. Older methods often used an elaborate and expensive jiggle deformation systems that required a high amount of maintenance and post corrective work. However, on Jurassic World and Avengers: Age of Ultron, we sought to exhibit the anatomical connective network of tissue matrices. Our methods of tangential and volumetric tensegrity simulations enabled us to achieve a high resolution of simulated results, down to striations and veins of the muscle, previously unachievable.	avengers: age of ultron;image resolution;logical connective;simulation	Sean Comer;Jacob Buck;Brice Criswell	2015		10.1145/2775280.2792584	computer vision;simulation;artificial intelligence;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-49.09585111699366	-31.599677323122815	141737

We begin by exploring what constitutes the narrative mode, drawing principally on four characteristics identified by Bruner and considering how these characteristics manifest themselves in the activities of mathematicians. Using these characteristics, we then analyse a number of examples from our work with expressive technologies; we seek to identify the narrative in the interactions of the learners with different computational microworlds. By reflecting on the learners’ stories, we highlight how particular features, common across the microworlds—motion, colour, sound and the like—provided the basis for both the physical and psychological grounding of the behaviour of the mathematically constrained computational objects. In this way, students constructed and used narratives that involved situating mathematical activities in familiar contexts, whilst simultaneously expressing these activities in ways which—at least potentially—transcend the particularities of the story told.

Sixteenthand seventeenth-century English designed landscapes were artificially organised to optimise the ‘prospect’ whilst reflecting the landowners’ individual perspectives. However, little analysis has been attempted into determining the extent and characteristics of ‘prospect’ and ‘perspective’ at specific sites. The destruction and modernisation of estate landscapes has hindered their analysis and reshaped perceptions of their appearance and development. In this paper, I will therefore demonstrate how 3D-GIS has the capabilities to change this. For my ongoing PhD research, I am introducing 3D-GIS as a new computational tool for producing 3D representations of estate landscapes but also to subsequently provide the geographical and historical context to analyse the visual experience within them. This methodology will contribute to not only the study of designed landscapes but of historic landscapes generally.	geographic information system;while	Elizabeth Eleanor Rose Stewart	2017			sight;forestry;geography;recreation	HCI	-59.604187629717266	-30.719772635079906	141916

In this paper we describe our design process and early evaluation of a prototype that sensed children's social interactions (i.e., physical proximity) in the playground, and attempted to encourage pro-social behaviors through motivational feedback on a public display. We illustrate how we came to realize the potentially detrimental effect of gamification on children's intrinsic motivation and depth of reflection, and how we attempted to circumvent this through encouraging empathic understanding on children regarding the consequences of their behaviors on others.	gamification;interaction;prototype	Vítor Belim;Olga Lyra;Pedro Teixeira;Ana Karina Caraban;Maria José Ferreira;Rúben Gouveia;Andrés Lucero;Evangelos Karapanos	2014		10.1145/2663806.2663828	psychology;simulation;multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-59.87603778380589	-36.962379437284774	142469
daff348a5ae52046da22f18b9e0a3a108c90d5bb	welcome: hci is everywhere	user interfaces;user/machine systems	It cannot be stressed enough: HCI is everywhere. It is everywhere in the sense that interactive technology is influencing all aspects of everyday life. It is also everywhere in the sense that HCI research is engaging all corners of our globe. In this issue we have two signs of that: a cover story about the Internet of Things and a special topic on HCI in Asia. In the cover story, TU Delft professor Elisa Giaccardi states that we are living in what she calls the connected everyday. She argues that our field has to seriously engage with the challenge of “how we can facilitate meaningful opportunities for communication and interaction.” For Giaccardi, this is not a question of how digital technologies can make our lives more effective; instead, “it is a fundamental design question about the kind of life we want to live.” Articulating her vision about how to approach this challenge, she writes, “In order to design digital networks that integrate meaningfully into our everyday lives, we need to learn how to design for commensurability. That is, we need to make our ability to connect to people and things across networks commensurate with our practices in the physical world.” We hope this vision of our field will promote lively discussion and debate among readers. It is exciting to be able to present the special topic “Interactions in Asia” as members of our field are preparing to visit Korea in April for CHI 2015. The growth of HCI in Asia is extraordinary. In the introduction to the special topic, Tek-Jin Nam from KAIST points out that despite this growth, the Asian HCI community is still a minority in the global HCI community, but he closes on a hopeful note: “Now is the time to share aspirations, challenges, and experiences. I hope these articles will trigger exchange and collaboration between the Asian HCI community and the rest of the global HCI community.” If you plan to go to Korea for CHI, this special topic is a great introduction.

However I was introduced to such a tool for which I was able to develop a new and useful way of creating compelling and interactive prototypes. Excel was first presented to me as a software prototyping tool while I was working at PeopleSoft as a senior interaction designer in the User Experience group. I was assigned to an ongoing project that was already well into the early stages of design. While getting up to speed, I was given some printouts of prototypes of the current state of the design to review. In graphically representing the PeopleSoft user interface, the look of the prototypes was clean and accurate, even if they were a bit rough around the edges. But keeping in mind that this was the early stage of the design process, the prototypes fulfilled their purpose. While reviewing them I could not figure out what program they had been built in. When I asked for the original prototypes, I was sent an Excel file. This caught me off guard; I had always thought of Excel as the preferred program of accountants and managers working on budgets, not a program from which to build prototypes. I did not know how to use Excel very well and had no time to learn with the accelerated development schedule for this project. I was left to review the prototypes made by the lead developer, penciling in recommendations to the group. I did notice that no matter how quickly the changes were sent in, new corrected prototypes were quickly turned around and delivered to me. I have always prided myself on being able to quickly turn around changes, so I was impressed with the agility and speed with which these prototypes were generated. I made a mental note to find out more about prototyping in Excel when I had the chance. The early iterative design phase of the project was nearing its end, where most of the pages had been sketched out. It then became my …	interaction design;iterative design;iterative method;lead programmer;software prototyping;user experience;user interface	Nevin Berger	2006	Interactions	10.1145/1109069.1109084	multimedia;human–computer interaction;engineering	HCI	-61.21668969208187	-27.973240753281196	142595

In the context of game art and media art it uses the material of the JAMMA hardware interface to explore the boundaries of interfacing with the complete arcade machine through remote digital means, providing a meditation on the physicality of hardware both in its form and situated environment, alongside the representational experience of these aspects through software. As an experimental prototype, the VR SuperGun attempts to bridge the gap in-between the authenticity and tangibility of experiencing arcade gameplay through original arcade cabinet hardware, and the ease and convenience of network enabled arcade emulation.	bridging (networking);emulator;hardware interface design;japan amusement machine and marketing association;meditation therapy;prototype;representation (action);situated;supergun;virtual reality	Kieran Nolan	2018	2018 IEEE Games, Entertainment, Media Conference (GEM)	10.1109/GEM.2018.8516455	situated;virtualization;human–computer interaction;concept art;cabinet (file format);bridging (networking);interfacing;software;emulation;computer science	Visualization	-51.94551845191856	-33.57125252815474	142674

Therefore, we envision that research must address the need for a change in existing prototyping techniques as well as focus on novel prototyping approaches and frameworks that would support not only the interaction design process but also the whole development process of mobile app development. In the footsteps of the first workshop, PID-MAD 2014 provides a platform to the interested communities for discussing issues and will bring together researchers and practitioners for sharing their knowledge and experience in order to tackle the upcoming challenges.	desktop computer;desktop metaphor;interaction design;mad;mobile app;multi-touch;pid;programming paradigm;prototype;sensor	Shah Rukh Humayoun;Steffen Hess;Achim Ebert;Yael Dubinsky	2014		10.1145/2628363.2634256		HCI	-53.17365003122143	-37.55383234566912	142997

Furthermore, an analysis of Russell's characterization of the concept of agency may be useful for acquiring insight into the sense of presence itself and the variables affecting it. Empirical evidence from cognitive developmental research and the positive results of attempts to develop symbolic understanding in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in virtual environments suggest that presence may be more about experiencing agency than either pretending to be there or constructing and reconstructing mental models in real time. This analysis is used to shed some light on the current issues of presence research and to open up new philosophical and psychological aspects, in relation to both presence and ASD.	anomalous experiences;mental model;virtual reality	Gerardo Herrera;Rita Jordan;Lucí Vera	2006	PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments	10.1162/pres.15.5.539	empirical evidence;computer science;virtual machine;artificial intelligence;operating system	Visualization	-59.635767725658106	-34.07990577069672	143369

Digital Interactive Storytelling, while nearly two decades old as a field of research, has yet to produce a tool capable of producing masses of narratively interesting and engaging pieces for the end user. Although the various prototypes available produce several different story genres, they stem from the same classic narrative form. With this paper, we aim to introduce narrative techniques that have successfully been used in cinema, literature and the gaming world, and show how they can be adapted to DIS. We believe that by presenting these techniques authors can gain a better understanding of how to use existing systems. SZILAS, Nicolas, AXELRAD, Monica, RICHLE, Urs Michael.

This brings up new requirements and challenges for HMI design and industrial labor. Social sciences can contribute to such engineering projects with their perspectives, concepts and knowledge. Hence, we claim that, in addition to following their own intellectual curiosities, the social sciences can and should contribute to such projects in terms of an ‘applied’ science, helping to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and providing toolkits and devices for what we call ‘interdisciplinary diplomacy’. We illustrate the benefits of such an approach, support them with selected examples of our involvement in such an engineering project and propose using methods as diplomatic devices and concepts as social theory plug-ins. The article ends with an outlook and reflection on the remaining issue of whether and in how far such ‘applied’ and critical social science can or should be integrated. 1 Social Science in Engineering Projects The transition from traditional to smart industries is indicated by the implementation of (digital) automation tools and the integration of cyber-physical systems, e.g. sensory interfaces, informed models and (self-learning) algorithms. This refurbishment of factory (infra)structure is affecting HMI design decisions and the ways that such smartified plants are operated [Pos15]. Industrial smartification thus involves dense entanglements of business, organization, technology and labor-routine issues, all of which are of genuine interest to disciplines like sociology and “Science & Technology Studies” (STS). In the context of a deep involvement in an engineering project on smart factories and industrial automation, we as STS researchers have composed a qualitative methods toolbox to help understand the effects of a transition from traditional to smart production.

In the evaluated prototype the avatar responds to the user's music listening by changing its appearance by gaining new clothing and accessories to parts of the avatar. The gained items and parts match to the listened songs. The parts can be played as playlists and be sent to other users as visual recommendations. In a user study with 22 participants, the concept was found fun, interesting and said to provide new music listening experiences. Users were highly interested in the evolving avatar and seeing/listening to others' avatars. Users had several different avatar creation strategies that are very interesting for new music discovery. Users also listened to new types of music broadly using the avatars. Based on the results, the paper proposes design implications for using avatars in music discovery services.	adaptive grammar;avatar (computing);experience;prototype;usability testing	Arto Lehtiniemi;Jarno Ojala	2014		10.1145/2663806.2663820	art;music visualization;multimedia;communication;world wide web	HCI	-49.19001143745055	-36.62443687677897	144730

This technology will become the basis for a new video medium, which will relate to the current television in the way that television now relates to film. Many techniques and particular devices will be shared between the old and new video. At the same time, producers will discover styles and techniques better suited to new potentials (and limitations). Out of these discoveries will evolve a unique body of practice and critical theory.	display device;emergence;image resolution;video production	Jim Bizzocchi	2003		10.1145/958720.958721	computer vision;art;aesthetics;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-51.87418793103886	-30.4377321613532	144781

Farnham, Ashgate, 2013) explored the notion of an e-mediated tourist gaze. This paper builds on this idea, in order to evaluate the context within which images are recorded, manipulated and distributed. Google Earth is selected as the medium for this because its geo-spatial format links tourist photographs to the site where the image was captured. The research adopts a primarily qualitative inductive study to identify sociological perspectives on the collection, publication and sharing of images online, using members of Google Earth forums as the sample, and asking further questions around travel planning to tie the research back to the relationship between online image and travel from a production perspective. The research identifies strong links with memory, emotion and choreography and proposes that digital images have created new areas for research into electronic visual media. Whilst Urry and Larsen (The tourist gaze 3.0. Sage, London, 2011) note that these images potentially lead an unprotected and uncontrolled afterlife, it is argued that they also serve a purpose for a future-self as a mediator of nostalgia. The research develops hypotheses for future research around the emotional relationships bound up in the creation and collection of tourism images and the role of the e-mediated gaze.	digital photography	Peter Robinson	2014	J. of IT & Tourism	10.1007/s40558-014-0008-6	social media;emotion;computer science;photography;marketing;multimedia;advertising;memory;web 2.0;social psychology;tourism;world wide web	NLP	-60.70731356880948	-31.945355790582926	144886

The inspiration for the work reaches back to 3000 years ago, when Chinese artists first began creating Shanshui ink paintings. The emphasis in traditional Chinese ink paintings is on atmosphere, specifically the fluid atmosphere of moving water. The ancient artists' representation was limited by traditional techniques; once painted, the ink would not move. Viewers could only imagine the movement being depicted. Ink Fall experiments with bringing the concept of fluidity to a new reality through modern digital techniques, allowing viewers to perceive atmospheric changes over time.	experiment	Haozhe Li	2016		10.1145/3004257.3004484	computer graphics (images)	HCI	-54.06204592740104	-27.81995836116592	145338

4d1621921ecfe5b2284a5e548b8e47944a253d11	how do sketching and non-sketching actions convey design intent?		Sketches are much more than marks on paper; they play a key role for designers both in ideation and problem-solving as well as in communication with other designers. Thus, the act of sketching is often enriched with annotations, references, and physical actions, such as gestures or speech---all of which constitute meta-data about the designer's reasoning. Conventional paper-based design notebooks cannot capture this rich meta-data, but digital design notebooks can. To understand what data to capture, we conducted an observational study of design practitioners where they individually explore design solutions for a set of problems. We identified sketching and non-sketching actions that reflect their exploration of the design space. We then categorized the captured meta-data and mapped observed physical actions to design intent. These findings inform the creation of future digital design notebooks that can better capture designers' reasoning during sketching.	categorization;item unique identification;logic synthesis;problem solving	Senthil K.

We review home technologies in a historical context in which the home is a personal habitat that provides services to inhabi‐ tants, and draw lessons from the profusion of new services that were made possible by the introduction of electricity in the home during the 20th century. We examine possible metaphors for smart homes, including the smart home as an inside-out autonomous robot, and the smart home as an ecosystem of smart objects providing services. We propose a taxonomy for smart home services and discuss examples for each class of service. We conclude with a discussion of required system qualities and potential show-stoppers.	ambient intelligence;autonomous robot;class of service;ecosystem;habitat;home automation;smart objects;taxonomy (general)	Boris E.

I will through some example of work show how worlds, real and virtual are as much made as found, and how they can be used to challenged each other into new forms of experiences and expressions, of both physical and virtual spaces. Where the virtual space transformed into maps & instructions can challenge the physical with qualities that is very hard to achieve in the physical world itself, and in that conflict new insights and expressions can revealed. Today Hybrid creations have become a method for working with cultural production not only with different elements of form, but as blending identities of the creators as well, wander lost support that process. We show how we from the virtual settings of the city of Traora we have extracted a series of walks as instructions and invited different co-creators to explore these algorithmical walks in their everyday surrounding in order to be surprised by rediscovery, using a digital camera/smart phone to capture and later communicate their findings. Allowing the unfamiliar to co-exist with the comfortably familiar. To create a process where digital worlds challenge and inspire digital expressions, tools and models with physical play and exploration. Supporting our long-term aim with research in new media is to set up design methods that can be used in a creative and collaborative process. We show how these findings played a crucial role designing the virtual city Traora. The Traora Flaneur kit turns everyday walks into discoveries of both urban contexts as well as ideas for possible virtual worlds.	alpha compositing;digital camera;experience;map;new media;population;smartphone;virtual reality;virtual world	Michael Johansson	2014	2014 International Conference on Cyberworlds	10.1109/CW.2014.61		HCI	-58.650602818285435	-31.80442771000884	148081

A more nomadic life style makes the traditional spectating venues unavailable. Designing a sports spectator experience using mobile devices poses design and technological challenges in order to achieve a good experience at an acceptable cost. Combining animations, which have higher understandability and lower cost, with video, which has a higher emotional value, might provide that experience. The authors used a combination of a formal experiment with a focus group study to evaluate and refine successive design sketches. The result was a design proposal that will be implemented as a commercial product.	focus group;mobile device	Greger Wikstrand;Staffan Eriksson;Frida Östberg	2003			simulation;mobile telephony;human–computer interaction;experience design;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;focus group;mobile device;multimedia	HCI	-60.30090957659093	-37.788422930330405	148556

In this article, our aim is to explain how this concept of multi-layer interface could facilitate the transition toward a critical operational interactive system. We will explain how the division in several layers could increase the application acceptance and smooth out the learning phase. The goal is to conduct a homogeneous population to change its working methods. Furthermore, we will present how we implement this concept in the project ASTER in order to facilitate the acceptance of the tool by the air traffic controllers.	bibliothèque de l'école des chartes;crash reporter;forte 4gl;interactivity;layer (electronics);linear algebra;milieu intérieur;population;programming paradigm;reactions to the november 2015 paris attacks;universal usability	Bruno Merlin;Raïlane Benhacène;Vincent Kapp	2007		10.1145/1541436.1541473	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;systems engineering	HCI	-50.47060854786005	-33.01669452781846	148566

The aim of this paper is to provide an holistic and practical view on the design of a real home automation system. This overview is based on a practical experience gained by creating a real wireless home automation system. Our discussion is focused on two main issues: the actual communicating devices and the user interface. The first part of the paper provides a brief analysis on main issues in existing home automation systems. To this aim, we propose a solution based on XBee and show how XBee modules can be exploited to build up a scalable and fully customizable home automation system. The second part of the paper discusses how the user interface in home automation has been addressed in existing approaches with a focus on mobile devices.

0632d53b130beded128df0c7011f8df6d1078349	relying on failures in design research	design research	"""Sitting next to the automatic door between train coaches in Switzerland provides a fantastic opportunity to observe the range of behaviors when people interact with a very basic instance of ubiquitous computing. Interestingly, most Swiss trains have sensors located in the upper part of the doorway. Experienced travelers know they have to wait for their presence to be detected, while nervous commuters wave their hand at the sensor to open the door. However, a longer period of observation reveals plenty of less-than-fluid usage: Elderly travelers try to find an (absent) handle; some people in a rush bang their head against the door because the sensor did not have time to detect them; angry knowledge workers (who know how the sensor works) wave their arm, but the door fails to open because of some momentary flaw with the sensor. Meanwhile, kids, luggage, or even the combination of both lead to even more complex situations. Observing frustration with the automatic door is an example of how the investigation of accidents within a larger process can be inspiring from a design viewpoint. Surfacing people's problematic reactions when confronted with invisible pieces of technologies highlights their mental model and eventually has implications for design. In the case of an automatic door opening , these observations show that previous encounters with non-automatic doors shape our expectations of what a door is and how it should work. Noticing these problems can also lead to understanding how the sensor calibration should be tuned or that the presence of the sensors should be made apparent in a more visible way. From Observing Failures to Provoking them I am interested in how users appropriate technology, especially product failures and prototype flops. As a user experience researcher, failures of all sorts intrigue me. User mistakes , errors, and accidents (as in the example above) are pertinent because of their design implications. Curiously, as pointed out by various authors [1, 2], there is little field research about design flops and failures. This is surprising, given that design has a long-time interest in avoiding or fixing failures, as in Herbert Simon's famous quote: """" Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones """" [3]. To some extent, we can consider that preferring one solution over another is a matter of preventing accidents and mistakes. Furthermore, the idea that design can be inspired and fueled by …"""	bang file;flops;failure;field research;flaw hypothesis methodology;mental model;prototype;relevance;sensor;software design;switzerland;ubiquitous computing;user experience	Nicolas Nova	2010	Interactions	10.1145/1836216.1836234	design research;computer science	HCI	-61.75567475856286	-28.013547106795823	148958
2c00a8490182e20389d047d0d582a7e7c4c43da8	surfing the net for software engineering notes		The convergence of GPS, ubiquitous networking, mobile computing, and advanced geodesy has really opened the door for all sorts of new and innovative geospatial applications. When we covered this topic several years ago, we were pretty much limited to geospatial display technology and Google mashups. Now there are all sorts of useful applications for smartphones, tablets, and automotive platforms that have been deployed worldwide. Geospatial software engineering encompasses more than just a pretty user interface. The technology includes cartography, remote sensing, geography, topology, photography, and more in addition to software engineering. Geospatial application development can present many challenges for the software engineer. The data processing algorithms can be CPU intensive as can the CPU load needed to render geographic visualizations. Some applications integrate many different data types which must then be associated with geographic locations. These factors not only make geospatial applications challenging from a design and programming standpoint, but can also offer some unique testing issues. Given the complexity and diversity of the environment, it can be hard to define meaningful test cases for a geospatial application. It can also be hard to find geographic test datasets that can be used to provide deterministic results when testing a new app. Perhaps the biggest change in geospatial software is the addition of geographically-tagged imagery to map displays to produce the Google “Street View” types of applications. While many of us think that the Google Street View technology is relatively new, the technique actually dates back to a DARPA funded project at MIT in the late 1970’s. Students Peter Clay, Bob Mohl, and Michael Naimark filmed the hallways of MIT with a camera mounted on a cart. Later, the Aspen Movie Map was filmed using a stabilized 16mm camera mounted atop a car. The film was transferred to laserdisc and overlaid on a street map with a geographic database to provide location data. The late Senator William Proxmire presented one of his Golden Fleece awards to the project as an example of wasteful government spending. Given the current popularity of the capability I would say that the Senator may have lacked a degree of vision with respect to the utility of the Aspen Movie Map project. There are ample web resources available to help you get started in geospatial application development. There are several open source software packages with geospatial applications and utilities to give you a leg up on programming. But the main focus of this month’s surfing expedition is on the other information and resources related to geospatial software engineering. Sites that fall into this category include GPS and navigation information, geographic and topographic standards, seminar and conference sites, and other similar sites containing general information.	algorithm;aspen movie map;cartography;central processing unit;display device;global positioning system;google street view;mashup (web application hybrid);mobile computing;open-source software;smartphone;software engineering notes;software engineer;spatial database;tablet computer;test case;topography;ubiquitous computing;user interface;web resource	Mark Doernhoefer	2013	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/2492248.2492250		SE	-49.232673545888055	-30.519703661390185	149180

Conversation will largely be centered upon a discussion of objects produced through a research through design process. Bringing together researchers as well as their physical work is a means of gaining insight into the practices and outcomes of research through design. If research through design is to continue to develop as a research practice for generating knowledge within HCI, this requires developing ways of attending to its made, material outcomes. The premise of this workshop is simple: We need additional spaces for interacting with and reflecting upon material design outcomes at CHI. The goal of this workshop is to experiment with such a space, and to initially do so without a strong theoretical or conceptual framing.	chi;framing (world wide web);human–computer interaction;material design;venue (sound system)	Tom Jenkins;Kristina Andersen;William W.

There are numerous techniques and tools to conceptualize the appearance of a user interface but few solutions for rapidly creating and evaluating interaction ideas. To solve this problem, we propose a concept which enables designers to quickly create simple transitions that are controlled using continuous gestures. As proof of concept we implemented Tiquid, a multi-touch tool designed for sketching interactions during the very early stages of interface development.	imperative programming;interaction;look and feel;multi-touch;user interface	Georg Freitag;Michael Wegner;Michael Tränkner;Markus Wacker	2014		10.1145/2639189.2639208	look and feel;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;transition;prototype;gesture	HCI	-51.608784861967564	-37.561670514138875	149492

BACKGROUND Adaptive systems are those that can appropriately modify their behavior to fit the current context. This concept is appealing because it offers the possibility of creating computer assistants that behave like good human assistants who can provide what is needed without being asked. However, the majority of adaptive systems have been experimental rather than practical because of the technical challenges in accurately perceiving and interpreting users' current cognitive state; integrating cognitive state, environment, and task information; and using it to predict users' current needs. The authors anticipate that recent developments in neurological and physiological sensors to identify users' cognitive state will increase interest in adaptive systems research and practice over the next few years.   METHOD To inform future efforts in adaptive systems, this work provides an organizing framework for characterizing adaptive systems, identifying considerations and implications, and suggesting future research issues.   RESULTS A two-part framework is presented that (a) categorizes ways in which adaptive systems can modify their behavior and (b) characterizes trigger mechanisms through which adaptive systems can sense the current situation and decide how to adapt.   CONCLUSION The framework provided in this article provides a tool for organizing and informing past, present, and future research and development efforts in adaptive systems.	adaptive system;computer scientist;emoticon;human interface device;norm (social);objective-c;organizing (structure);reporting;sensor;systems theory	Karen M.

This paper reports on a Research through Design (RtD) based visual analysis of seven CI research prototypes. The analysis includes an annotated portfolio, annotated mappings and redesign sketches. Through comparisons the visual analyses, identifies qualities, similarities and differences of CI, and connect these to properties of the design. Through its capacity to point out and articulate CI qualities, the visual analysis contributes to the repertoire of RtD approaches, by framing discussions relevant for understanding the characteristics of design prototypes extending beyond the written language.	framing (world wide web)	Marianne Graves Petersen;Majken Kirkegård Rasmussen;Peter Gall Krogh	2017		10.1145/3152771.3152779	computer science;interaction model;human–computer interaction;repertoire;multimedia;written language;portfolio	HCI	-58.84771559415482	-35.65195601781624	149751

I had been working for Jim Randall, who was composing his piece Mudgett: Monologues of a Mass Murderer during the spring for a concert in the summer. Computer music as we now know it existed then only at Bell Telephone Laboratories, and Jim’s way of working on this piece was to compute a section of it at Princeton and drive a computer tape up to Bell Labs at Murray Hill, New Jersey, where he would convert it to sound, record it on a reel-to-reel tape, and take it back to Princeton, where he could listen to it carefully and splice it into the larger composition, or throw it out and redo that portion. The limitations of the data-storage system at that time were such that he had a maximum of about two minutes of music that could be converted on a single reel. In the fall of that year, I became a graduate student, and in collaboration with Godfrey Winham, we undertook the task of exporting the music programming language that Max Mathews had developed—Music IV—to Princeton. It was at that time that I began to realize the comprehensive nature of the vision he had developed for computer music, one that has undergirded much of the work that has been going ever since. Godfrey, Jim, and I still would visit Bell Labs to convert our files to sound, but it was not too long after that Bell Labs donated the system they had been using to Princeton, while they implemented a better system. That meant that we could do most of our work at Princeton, only going to Bell Labs for our final copies. (The converter at Princeton was limited to a 10-kHz sampling rate, monaural, whereas at Bell Labs they then had 20 kHz, stereo.) We continued to meet Max, although much of our immediate contact was with other people. In later years, I met and got to know Jean-Claude Risset, and I also saw the early GROOVE system developed by Dick Moore but used mostly by Emmanuel Ghent.

This artwork incorporates original research and technological innovation in an adaptation of veterans' testimonies detailing US military interrogations in Iraq during the American counter-insurgency campaign in the early 2000s. It uses VR technology to immerse participants in the minds of people who experienced torture and interrogation during the war to understand its current social and psychological consequences. The powerful content of this artwork focuses on the impact of war and trauma on veterans, and utilizes the power of VR as a medium to evoke empathy, understanding and awareness. This work was developed at the Electronic Visualization Lab in Chicago through a unique cross-disciplinary international collaboration between artists, scientists, and researchers from five different Universities.

Without such higher cognitive functions, we might be disinclined to bestow creativity onto such software. We generalise previous work on collage generation, which attempted to blur the line between the intentionality of the programmer and that of the software in the visual arts. Firstly, we embed the collage generation process into a computational creativity collective, which contains processes and mashups of processes, designed so that the output of one generative system becomes the input of another. Secondly, we analyse the previous approach to collage generation to determine where intentionality arose, leading to experimentation where we test whether augmented keyword searches can enable the software to exert more intentional control.	cognition;computational creativity;generative systems;intentionality;mashup (web application hybrid);programmer	Michael Cook;Simon Colton	2011			multimedia;computer science	SE	-56.746363519411645	-31.223242681523946	150312

After the most optimistic prophets had lived to see that their “in twenty-five years” predictions of an intelligent computer had failed to appear, the few remaining are cleverly dating their forecasts several hundred years into the future. In addition there is also a change of content in their predictions of computer intelligence. Many have now moderated their statements, now mentioning “applications that would have needed intelligence if humans were doing the job.” But that is something quite different. The Vikings, for example, navigated by using the sun, moon, stars, and wind directions. Even bird flight and floating seaweed may have aided an intelligent or creative navigator. Today, we also use stars for navigating, but artificial stars, satellites, which send a radio beacon that is used by any GPS system to pinpoint the position on the surface of the earth with an accuracy of a few meters. It does a better navigating job than the Vikings just by computing a simple function, but no intelligence is needed.		Kai A.

3f0b6a89ff895c64cec65507b3384fa33518e05c	guest editorial: use of virtual environments in training and rehabilitation: international perspectives	virtual environment	group of commentaries (Broeren; Butler; Scott; Stein; Weiss) that discuss, and elaborate, aspects of the use of virtual environments in this applied area. The commentators also highlight the need for neuroimaging studies to investigate the effects of virtual reality environment (VRE) interventions to enhance understanding of the underlying motor control systems. The next series of papers considers the usefulness of virtual environments in clinical psychotherapy applications and the process of therapeutic change. Riva’s review of this area focuses upon the present and future role of VR in psychotherapy and identifies that it plays an important role as a form of supportive technique. Both Riva’s review, and the commentaries (Andrews; Baños; Botella; Emmelkamp; Gamberini & Spagnolli; Rothbaum) that follow, while remaining positive about the use of virtual environments in psychotherapy, also address issues relating to the lack of standardization of the VR technologies employed and the differing protocols used by clinicians. Rehabilitation of brain injury forms the focus of the third set of papers. The review by Rose, Brooks, and Rizzo discusses studies that have utilized VR in the cognitive assessment and rehabilitation of specific impairments that result from acquired brain injury. They conclude by pointing out that, although the use of virtual environments in brain damage rehabilitation is currently relatively unexploited, its future use within the repertoire of rehabilitation therapeutic interventions seems assured. This latter point is one that is shared by many of the commentators (Foreman & Stirk; Jayawardena; Johnson; Morris; Potter; TEN YEARS AGO, Durlach and Mavor1 observed that, for those working with virtual reality (VR) applications, there was an “extremely high ‘talkto-work’ or ‘excitement-to-accomplishment’ ratio.” Their observation was based on the hype associated with VR and its potential possibilities, which had not yet become realities. However, during the last decade, researchers and practitioners working with VR technology have achieved tremendous progress. The aim of this special issue of CyberPsychology & Behavior is to provide an overview of achievements within the broad theme of the use of VR technology for rehabilitation. This issue is organized around papers on four themes: the use of virtual environments in motor rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and rehabilitation following brain damage, and training of people with intellectual disabilities. Each of these themes are organized such that a substantive review article is followed by invited commentaries from people, including clinicians, occupational therapists, and psychologists, who are experts working within the area. Each of the commentators used the relevant article as a starting point to provide observations on the advantages and potential limitations of the use of virtual environments in that therapeutic arena. The first series of papers evaluates the usefulness of VR for the rehabilitation of motor impairments. The target review, by Holden, provides an overview and discussion of both the equipment options and scientific rationale for the use of VR technology in motor rehabilitation. She follows this with a review of the clinical studies that have been carried out.

148ba114598560f6103523c0ad183dfa7e9bc670	needs profile: sensitising approach for user experience research		Basic human needs are a valuable source for creating meaningful products. Hence, designing for a positive User Experience requires an extensive understanding of those. Instead of just analysing abstract data, designers should also gather implicit information based on their own perception to gain holistic insights on the users' emotional perspectives. Inevitably there exists an influence of the designers' individual perspective on the accumulated insights during user research activities. However, if the designers are aware of their own and multiple other perspectives on needs, there is a good chance that they value relevant observations in user research.  The NEEDS PROFILE (NP) is an approach to sensitise for diverse human needs and their characteristics. As designers often tend to find basic needs abstract, the NP enables them to explore basic needs as vivid personifications and encourages them to engage in a creative and playful manner first. Then these insights are confronted in guided discussions in order to enable sustainable learning. Evaluation results are positive, but further investigation needs to be done on long-term effects.	holism;user research;user experience	Anne Elisabeth Krüger;Sebastian Kurowski;Kathrin Pollmann;Nora Fronemann;Matthias Peissner	2017		10.1145/3152771.3152776	human–computer interaction;knowledge management;fundamental human needs;computer science;maslow's hierarchy of needs;user experience design;user research;basic needs	HCI	-60.937307465548905	-36.36322376663538	150626

We argue that accessibility education in computing science presents a set of unique and challenging characteristics for those engaged in accessibility capacity building. Significant moves are being made to embed accessibility within academic curricula and professional domains. However, through a qualitative thematic review of the accessibility pedagogic literature, we find that the field lacks the pedagogic culture necessary to support widespread excellence in teaching and learning. Nonetheless, our review identifies aspects of this small but important literature that indicate how a pedagogic culture for accessibility can be stimulated through research, debate and discussion, to promote a more pedagogically-grounded approach to the field as a whole.	accessibility;computer science	Sarah Lewthwaite;David Sloan	2016		10.1145/2899475.2899490	engineering;knowledge management;web accessibility;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-62.75016508203387	-35.16435081194205	150823

The arts have been mostly overlooked in this process, apart from a few exceptional works in the last 10 years. With the rapid emergence of digitisation in the arts, however, the arts domain is becoming increasingly receptive to digital image processing methods and the importance of paying attention to this therefore increases. In this paper we discuss a range of mathematical methods for digital image restoration and digital visualisation for illuminated manuscripts. The latter provide an interesting opportunity for digital manipulation because they traditionally remain physically untouched. At the same time they also serve as an example for the possibilities mathematics and digital restoration offer as a generic and objective toolkit for the arts.	circuit restoration;digital image processing;emergence;image restoration;medical imaging;arts	Luca Calatroni;Marie d'Autume;Rob Hocking;Stella Panayotova;Simone Parisotto;Paola Ricciardi;Carola-Bibiane Schoenlieb	2018	CoRR			HCI	-50.134567541467746	-26.85341997523986	151030

Is our current knowledge sufficient to produce working computational models for such sensations? Has our perspective for the conceptual structure of such models changed and why is this important? This work attempts to provide brief answers to these questions, focusing on a recent comprehensive model of binaural listening which is directed towards engineering applications in audio and acoustics [1]. It is also discussed how such model can formally approach the concepts of quality and fidelity in sounds and how it may be employed to demystify experienced listener and audiophile perception. A brief discussion of the conceptual and philosophical implications of such a model is also given.	binaural beats;computational model	John Mourjopoulos	2014			psychology;acoustics;communication;social psychology	ML	-58.03499314806903	-37.92522883178335	151241

They may be male, over 35, making $65,000-plus a year, etc. You might even extend your picture further and say they drive midsize cars, have 2.3 children, and drink coffee at least twice a day. After you go through that process, what you basically end up with is a """" segment """" or a """" demographic """" of the population that should readily identify with your design and, you hope, purchase your product. Those of us who perform this mystical task of market segmentation know that customers will generally align themselves into categories of interest. These purchasing habits make it easier to understand toward what type of products they will gravitate. However, it's not really as mystical as you may think. There's just as much science to conducting accurate market seg-mentation as there is to conducting product usability tests. It's in the best interest of every product designer to train themselves in describing the market that will likely be addressed by their designs. And, equally important, which markets will not be addressed. Late in the '80s and into the early '90s, mar-keters began talking about the Soccer Mom phenomenon: the recognition of an easy-to-identify market segment consisting of suburban, middle-class to upper-middle-class, minivan-driving mothers who wielded a great amount of purchasing power. Many advertisements came out to appeal to this crowd, including ones for minivans that spoke of """" time-saving, """" """" safety, """" and """" comfort away from your busy day. """" That marketing push continues to the present day, in the form of materials from companies like Microsoft ("""" Why a Soccer Mom needs a Tablet PC, """" www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/ tabletpc/getstarted/oneal_03december08.mspx). I highlight this segment not because it's the most powerful for technology products, but because it's one of the most common and well-recognized segments in the marketing field. If you were not familiar with it before, you'll be amazed to see it used in many print, TV, and radio advertising campaigns. When I was young, my grandmother came to live with us, and I gained a new appreciation for products designed for the elderly. We had several telephones scattered around the house, and when my grandmother attempted to use any of them, she would often misdial numbers or get frustrated by the small buttons. …"""	align (company);energy (psychological);mind;purchasing;tablet computer;usability	Brian Frank	2006	Interactions	10.1145/1125864.1125878	segmentation-based object categorization;scale-space segmentation	ECom	-58.372633060011275	-27.120955706053596	151602

The paper is a revised work based on the author's previous papers about computer-aided creativity (Savolainen, 1988; 1989). The research is still in the idea-definition phase, but there is already some evidence deduced from existing phenomena and early CAC experiments that a special CAC viewpoint to interface design might be appropriate. The reason for early publishing is the need for interdisciplinary discussion and development of ideas in the rather new area of CAC.

However, there is very little guidance for software designers on how to select, implement and evaluate interface metaphors. This paper, which is based upon extensive work in developing metaphors for telecommunications systems, provides a framework for software designers who wish to exploit the use of interface metaphors. The paper proposes a set of six design steps, to provide designers with a practical approach to the application of metaphor in the design of interactive systems. An explanation of the activities required in each step is given and justi®ed from experience gained in developing a number of interface metaphors. A pragmatic model of the use of metaphor in human centred system design is introduced, and a technique for eliciting metaphor characteristics is developed from ethnomethodology. The approach has been discussed with software designers at two workshops, and the ®nal content has been in ̄uenced by their input. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

It facilitates scenes of enormous scale, exquisite varieties of detail, and impressive efficiency. However, artists who are fluent in procedural techniques are still rare, and many studios miss out on the possibilities that this exciting field offers. This course explores how to create procedural shaders without programming, using Pixar's industry standard renderer, RenderMan, and its Autodesk Maya-based front-end, RenderMan Studio.  The first section of the course is an overview of RenderMan, its history, use in the industry, important features, and how it works. Topics include the Reyes pipeline and how it has helped to create some of the most impressive visuals in computer graphics, and proceduralism: its pros and cons, both in general and as it applies to shading.  The second section is a live demonstration of how to create a procedural animated shader for an orange that ages over time, from unripe to fresh to old and dusty. The demo begins with a sphere in Maya, then shows how to create all the detail using a shading network in RenderMan Studio. No textures are used. The look is created entirely with noise, splines, displacement, and more! Finally, the course presents examples of how the techniques used in shading the orange apply in industry and beyond.	autodesk maya;computer graphics;displacement mapping;geek;image noise;renderman interface specification;reyes rendering;shader;shading;spline (mathematics);technical standard;texture mapping	Paul Kanyuk	2010		10.1145/1900520.1900530	computer vision;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;front and back ends;multimedia;reyes rendering;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-48.89437710103687	-29.247265392658775	152625

Hence, the challenge is not only to make information available to people at any time, at any place, and in any form, but specifically to say the right thing at the right time in the right way. On the other hand, the proliferation of sensor technology is facilitating the scaffolding and customization of smart learning environments. This manuscript presents an ecology of resources comprising NFC, BLE and Arduino technology, orchestrated in the context of a learning environment to provide smoothly integrated feedback via ambient displays. This ecology is proposed as a suitable solution for self-regulated learning, providing support for setting goals, setting aside time to learn, tracking study time and monitoring the progress. Hereby, the ecology is described and intriguing research questions are introduced.	arduino;ecology;human–computer interaction;near field communication;smoothing	Bernardo Tabuenca;Dirk Börner;Marco Kalz;Marcus Specht	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24258-3_54	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;multimedia	HCI	-55.880426023773914	-37.7123843862678	152777

As digital systems and information become meaningfully parts of people's everyday and social relationships, it is essential to develop new insights about how technology intersects with legacy and inheritance practices. We designed three interactive systems to investigate how digital materials might be passed down in the future. We conducted in-home interviews with ten parents using the systems to provoke discussion about how technology might support or complicate their existing practices. Sessions revealed parents desired to treat their digital information in ways not fully supported by technology. Findings are interpreted to describe design considerations for future work in this emerging space.	digital artifact;digital data;digital electronics	Rebecca Gulotta;William Odom;Jodi Forlizzi;Haakon Faste	2013		10.1145/2470654.2466240	design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-59.965077176628206	-36.40946718296882	153086

In this paper, we report how this framework was used to guide the development of an approach to researching the richness of a particular experience - serendipity. Three themes were identified; life as lived and felt, the whole person, and dialogical sense making. These were used to help understand the key qualities of the strategy, tools and techniques that were required in the empirical study of the experience of serendipity. The paper explains this process and illustrates the depth of understanding that our choice of tools afforded. After describing the case study we offer some guidance on how to choose appropriate tools and methods for researching other types of experience.	user experience	Tuck Wah Leong;Peter C.

bf1eda7cbbc20b06ba55e91f2c6b4e1a487266f3	interactivity in multimedia documents and systems		Definition: Multimedia interactivity describes the set of possible actions a user can do to change the state of a multimedia system, e. g., the course of a multimedia document's playback. The rapid growth of network capabilities in the last decade has fostered the diffusion of a wide set of interactive multimedia documents and systems, ranging from multimedia portals and distributed e-learning applications to interactive games and systems for multimedia data retrieval. These applications usually allow users to actively interact with the system rather than being passive recipients of information. The problem of describing, supporting and helping user interaction has been largely investigated in literature. Multimedia systems usually allow two types of navigation facilities to control a presentation [3]: to adjust the current time reference in a presentation playback or to follow a hyperlink. In the first case, the user interaction is similar to the VCR functionalities for videocassettes: the user can start, stop, pause, fast-forward or rewind a presentation playback. In the second case, the user may jump to a completely different section of the document. This second situation is more difficult to achieve and support, since the interaction may affect and change the overall structure of the presentation. Moreover, multimedia applications contain both static objects, like text pages and images, and continuous media items, like video and audio files. A hyperlink can be easily inserted into a static object, as an example, the user easily recognizes the presence of an anchor in an underlined word in a text page, whereas in multimedia system, the association of links with e within components is considerably complex for continuous media, for which a common way of defining anchor is not already available. Consider, for example, the problem of inserting a hyperlink inside an audio file. A proposed solution is the use of hotspots, i. e. an icon which remains on the user screen for a determined time interval, on which the user may click to follow the link. Despite many efforts, this problem has not already found a suitable solution, and the discovery of hyperlinks inside continuous media is often still hard for the user. From the synchronization point of view, a multimedia application may have different behavior when a user follows a link, since multimedia systems do not clearly define a notion of how much information the reader leaves: the link can bring the user to a new document, which completely …	data retrieval;fast forward;goto;hotspot (wi-fi);hyperlink;interactivity;media controls;portals;synchronization (computer science);video;videocassette recorder		2008		10.1007/978-0-387-78414-4_30	human–computer interaction;multimedia;interactivity;world wide web	Web+IR	-48.92421145800323	-36.93422394017469	153613

Music history on its own goes back till much earlier, and has been present in every known culture.

In this paper we address the relevance and the support to access music in versions and movies along time, and introduce As Music Goes By, an interactive web application being designed and developed to contribute to this purpose, aiming at increased richness and flexibility, the chance to find unexpected meaningful information, and the support to create and experience music and movies that keep touching us.	relevance;web application	Acácio Moreira;Teresa Chambel	2018		10.1145/3210825.3213567	multimedia;visualization;hyperlink;web application;popularity;computer science;music history	ML	-49.27362954974684	-36.501521172937075	153762

Its existence suggests that the special places that host rare species can be anywhere, but then begs the question of where rare species are found most often. There are salient laws about diversity, beyond those that Wallace described. First, most species have small ranges. Only a few species have large geographical ranges, but they are by far the most familiar to us. I’ve watched common kingfishers (Alcedo atthis) on British streams and on lakes in Japanese cities. To see other species in the same genus, however, I had to travel to Madagascar and Bali, and would need to travel to different islands in the Philippines to see two more. Second, species with small ranges tend to be concentrated in special places — such as coastal Brazil or the eastern Himalayas. Most are tropical. Moreover, these areas are generally not where the greatest numbers of species are found in one place. So Dinerstein doesn’t dwell on the Amazon: it has many species in any given location, but most have large ranges. I sense that the Amazon disappointed Wallace too. It provided species, but not the unique ones his patrons craved. Darwin had no better luck in Patagonia, where the Beagle spent most of its famous voyage. When Wallace finally tripped over species with small, idiosyncratic ranges in the islands of Southeast Asia, and Darwin stopped briefly in the Galapagos on the way home, species rarity changed science forever. Neither Darwin nor Wallace visited Hawaii, where Dinerstein’s most poignant chapter is set. Different Hawaiian islands once had different “closely allied species”. Dinerstein marvels at birds with strange names — the ’akiapola’au, for example — and even stranger beaks, and at lovely lobelias with flowers that fit other strange beaks. He sees a few of these in the wild; but most are extinct, just specimens in museums. Those that remain hang on in low numbers in the face of numerous threats such as habitat loss. When species such as these disappear forever, they take into oblivion all that we might learn about rarity and all that it tells us about the natural world. ■	beagle;chris wallace (computer scientist);darwin;genus (mathematics);http 303;ti-92 series;wallace tree	David L.

Hence, there has been growing interest in the development of new approaches and technologies for bridging the human–computer barrier. The ultimate aim is to bring HCI to a regime where interactions with computers will be as natural as an interaction between humans, and to this end, incorporating gestures in HCI is an important research area. Gestures have long been considered as an interaction technique that can potentially deliver more natural, creative and intuitive methods for communicating with our computers. This paper provides an analysis of comparative surveys done in this area. The use of hand gestures as a natural interface serves as a motivating force for research in gesture taxonomies, its representations and recognition techniques, software platforms and frameworks which is discussed briefly in this paper. It focuses on the three main phases of hand gesture recognition i.e. detection, tracking and recognition. Different application which employs hand gestures for efficient interaction has been discussed under core and advanced application domains. This paper also provides an analysis of existing literature related to gesture recognition systems for human computer interaction by categorizing it under different key parameters. It further discusses the advances that are needed to further improvise the present hand gesture recognition systems for future perspective that can be widely used for efficient human computer interaction. The main goal of this survey is to provide researchers in the field of gesture based HCI with a summary of progress achieved to date and to help identify areas where further research is needed.	application domain;bridging (networking);categorization;gesture recognition;human computer;human–computer interaction;interaction technique;pervasive informatics;taxonomy (general)	Siddharth S.

c1cd917a9d445745a7895aa1f47b79c37203892c	a formalism to define, assess and evaluate player behaviour in mobile device based serious games		The chapter provides introductory background information on all relevant fields (Games-based learning, Mobile devices, Mobile entertainment, Mobile education, Behavioural psychology) and showcases a small number of mobile devices based serious games and applications to support the claim that such games can be implemented for this device type. It then introduces formal propositional logic and suggests the use of a formal language to express statements about games and events in games. The next section is referencing to established guidelines from the field of behavioural psychology and provides an formalism (based on the content of the previous section) that allows the unambiguous definition and evaluation of behaviour in the context of a game. The chapter is targeting the large stretch of vagueness (definition of the behaviour under investigation, design of a game to evaluate such behaviour, collection of data/profiling and finally the interpretation of this data) that is found in almost all existing work concerned with human game playing behaviour. The contribution of the chapter is the introduction of a formalism which removes the vagueness and ambiguity from parts of this stretch. Ideally the only subjective part of the evaluation of human game playing behaviour is to be found in the final interpretation of the data, and the formalism allows for this reduction of vagueness (given that it is well constructed and tailored to the investigation at hand).	mobile device;semantics (computer science)	Hanno Hildmann;Jule Hildmann	2011		10.1007/978-1-4471-2161-9_6	simulation;computer science;management science;multimedia	HCI	-59.14408038161627	-33.19587769517896	154332

Through these techniques engineering teams collect the knowledge they need to design products that fit their users well. However, going from customer data to design is not trivial; designers have to know how to look at the data and how to see implications for design out of it. The difference between a small tweak to an existing system and the invention of a whole new approach to a problem domain often lies in how good the designers were at recognizing what their customer data was telling them.	problem domain	Karen Holtzblatt;Hugh R.

But, the software produced for education has invariably been a dull approximation of the existing school system. Educational software meant drill and practice software for much of the early years in computing. Now it means taking dull educational materials and putting them on a Web page. Interac-tivity has meant clicking to see what you want presented to you at a particular time. Computers won't begin to have a real impact on education until they are seen as the message rather than the medium. Computers ought not be a new means of producing a slide show. They have the power to alter the very nature of education, to transform what is taught and how it is taught. Today, most university courses are lecture courses. Lectures are evidence of the inertia that exists in education that still reflects ancient educational considerations. When the ancient Jews wanted to educate the masses, they read to them every Saturday from the sacred scrolls. This made sense because most people couldn't read and there were very few scrolls. Today everyone can read and there are a lot of scrolls. Why hasn't the method of instruction changed? Because we somehow have gotten it into our heads that the means of instruction available in 1500 B.C. was right. It isn't and we need to get over it. In the next years, computers will have their real effect on education. My company, Cognitive Arts, has made an arrangement with Columbia University to build online courses for them in their School of Arts and Sciences. The interesting part of this deal is not that Cognitive Arts is going to build online courses, everyone and his brother is doing that. The agreement with Columbia allows Cognitive Arts to build learn-by-doing courses that will change the very nature of what is taught. One can learn to run a business by running it rather than by reading or hearing about how to do it. One can learn psychology by practicing it rather than by writing a paper about what one has read. The difference here is a difference based on what Alan Perlis used to call looking at the world from inside the computer as opposed to looking at the computer from the outside.

722020ab8de0f80f5d55fc48ced7de6c3e2b810e	pervasive virtuality in digital entertainment applications and its quality requirements		Abstract There is a growing trend of entertainment applications where players wear non-see-through HMD devices (i.e. they see only virtual contents) and move freely in a physical environment, being able to touch physical objects and walls, feel hot air stream on their faces, and interact with other real people, while fully immersed in the simulation. Current definitions of mixed reality situations cannot cope adequately with this new class of experience. In this paper we name this new situation as “pervasive virtuality”, which we define as being a virtual environment that is extended by incorporating physical elements as proxy objects, integrating contextual information, and resolving conflicts with the dominance of a particular sense (usually vision). This new mixed reality paradigm is not well understood by both industry and academia. Therefore, we propose an extension to the well-known Milgram and Colquhoun’s taxonomy to cope with this new mixed reality situation. Furthermore, we propose Pervasive Virtuality characteristics that represent quality requirements, which help us to understand and design this new type of virtual environment. This paper also presents a brief case study using these characteristics.	head-mounted display;milgram experiment;mixed reality;pervasive informatics;programming paradigm;reflow soldering;requirement;simulation;virtual reality;virtuality (gaming);whole earth 'lectronic link	Luís Valente;Bruno Feijó;Alexandre Ribeiro Silva;Esteban Walter Gonzalez Clua	2018	Entertainment Computing	10.1016/j.entcom.2018.02.006	multimedia;entertainment;mixed reality;virtual machine;milgram experiment;computer science;virtuality (gaming)	HCI	-50.274472497470285	-36.83209638446625	154916

Blending the key ideas of classic and contemporary thinkers, the author explores the aspirations of those who strive for the heavens of artifice and those who find the whole enterprise a fool’s errand. This is the most engaging, readable work on the great debates in technology criticism now available and a solid contribution to that crucial yet unsettling tradition.	alpha compositing;human-readable medium	Katina Michael	2017	IEEE Technology and Society Magazine	10.1109/MTS.2017.2703180	public relations;emerging technologies;social science;great debates;criticism;law;sociology	Visualization	-59.66290754645517	-28.36619377845846	154951

b1ef4ff19aced29b555e58894bb9d135f2634875	prospecting a new physical artifact of interaction for idtv: results of participatory practices		A literature review has indicated that the remote control, the main physical artifact of interaction with the television system, in its current form is not adequate to the interaction between users and applications of Interactive Digital Television (iDTV), especially in a scenario of diverse user profiles as found in Brazil. This paper describes participatory practices carried out with the intention of defining a new physical artifact of interaction for iDTV. Based on the results of these participatory practices and previous research results, we provide a definition of an artifact that can be adapted to diverse contexts of use.

b81fe42a20c80e613fdc4ef90d1d6f388ac32636	a proposed payment model in e-learning based on learner knowledge		An electronic system that provides multimedia product presentations in real-time, by combining locally-stored data and data received from a remote server. Large volumes of data, representing product information such as motion images and sound, are stored locally on the systemu0027s data storing unit for fast data access. Small volumes of product time-variable data are received over a network from a remote server, which also has a transaction management function. The purchasing system combines the local and received data in order to provide both real-time and up-to-date product information to customers. Two versions of the purchasing system are provided. The first one is a multimedia public purchasing kiosk for use in malls and shopping centers. The second one is a PC-based purchasing system, equipped with multimedia capabilities. It uses a purchasing application which is distributed beside the large volumes of product-related data on a portable support such as a CD-ROM and which is intended for personal use, at home, on the customeru0027s PC.

With the advent of new technologies, video games now have the potential to create dynamically robust cinematic gameplay experiences; in turn, the adoption of real-time software has led to more artistically-driven asset creation and faster iteration cycles in film production. These convergences underlie significant paradigm shifts not only in how content is delivered and presented in film and games, but also in terms of the perspectives on how research and technology will be further developed to aid production workflow.  This panel aims to provide an open dialogue on the relevant convergences in film and game production processes and technologies. Consisting of leading minds from both industries, the panelists will debate the current state of artistically-driven production tools and resources in the context of their unique perspectives as pioneers in the field. They will provide their thoughts on what the key confluence points are, whether there are definitive differences that disallow one-to-one production convergence, and what challenges and implications there may be that are divergent from traditional mindset for both industries. Finally, the panel will look at emerging trends in the field in a lively discussion that will hopefully hone ideas and technologies both industries may invest in moving forward.	degree confluence project;iteration;lively kernel;one-to-one (data model);programming paradigm;real-time computing;real-time transcription	Juan Miguel de Joya;Alasdair Coull;Kim Davidson;Kim Libreri;Rick Stringfellow;Colin Penty;Bill Polson;Frank Vitz	2015		10.1145/2786601.2789975	distribution;supercomputer;simulation;projection;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-57.682257710056525	-29.576938136915587	155178
8c28a9253d71907be760d28affbc8071a2eaf520	let's talk about race: identity, chatbots, and ai		Why is it so hard for chatbots to talk about race? This work explores how the biased contents of databases, the syntactic focus of natural language processing, and the opaque nature of deep learning algorithms cause chatbots difficulty in handling race-talk. In each of these areas, the tensions between race and chatbots create new opportunities for people and machines. By making the abstract and disparate qualities of this problem space tangible, we can develop chatbots that are more capable of handling race-talk in its many forms. Our goal is to provide the HCI community with ways to begin addressing the question, how can chatbots handle race-talk in new and improved ways?		Ari Schlesinger;Kenton P. O'Hara;Alex S.

Our aim with this study is to scrutinize professional mathematicians’ search behavior. With this understanding we want to be able to reason why mathematicians use which tool for what search problem in what phase of the search process. To gain these insights we conducted 24 repertory grid interviews with mathematically inclined people (ranging from senior professional mathematicians to non-mathematicians). From the interview data we elicited patterns for the user group “mathematicians” that can be applied when understanding design issues or creating new designs for mathematical search interfaces.	repertory grid;search problem	Andrea Kohlhase	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08434-3_12	human–computer interaction;computer science	HCI	-61.24542086491712	-32.820101308764336	155340
