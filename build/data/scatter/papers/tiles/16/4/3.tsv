It is also being used by online disease-focused communities to organize their own experience base and to harness their own talent and insight in service to the cause of achieving better health outcomes. We describe how news of a possible effect of lithium on the course of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) was acquired by and diffused through an on-line community and led to participation in a patient-driven observational study of lithium and ALS. Our discussion suggests how the social web drives demand for patient-centered health informatics.	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;clinical informatics;community;diffusion;health outcomes;informatics (discipline);internet;intrinsic drive;lateral thinking;lithium;online and offline;patients	Jeana Frost;Michael Massagli;Paul Wicks;James Heywood	2008	AMIA ...

727be45c1bfaa544e3110ade39fae9aa2e862ef8	shakers and maracas: action-based categorisation choices in triads are influenced by task instructions		The forced-choice triad task has become increasingly popular in use over recent years. While it is seen as being a categorisation task (Lin & Murphy, 2001) variation in task instructions often leads to different results. Shipp, Vallée-Tourangeau, and Anthony (2014) used the triad task to show that when participants are asked to choose an option that ‘goes best with the target’, they are more likely to select the choice that shares an action relation when it also shares taxonomic information. However using the instruction to select the item that “goes best” is vague and might encourage a strategy other than a categorical decision. The present experiment used the same triads as in Shipp et al. to test whether participants would match items based on shared actions or shared taxonomic relations when given specific categorisation instructions. The task instructions were manipulated so that participants either selected the item that “goes best”, “goes best to form a category” or is “most similar” to the target. The results found instances where the instructions of “goes best to form a category” led to a higher probability that participants would select the action choices over the instructions of “goes best”. However when participants were encouraged to use similarity overall action choices were lower. Therefore the triad task does encourage a natural categorisation strategy and differences in task instructions across research are a result of the stimuli used.	categorization;local interconnect network;vagueness;window function	Nicholas Shipp;Frédéric Vallée-Tourangeau;Susan Anthony	2016			cognitive psychology;social psychology;psychology	NLP	-50.64879576991482	-56.51167470549446	88509

Despite an increasing number of patients they often lack skilled health workers as well as basic medical equipment. This paper focuses on the development of an affordable and sustainable system for medical device regulations to provide safe, effective and quality healthcare products for Africa. Furthermore, it is determined whether Open Source Medical Devices are an effective alternative for medical device regulations to increase innovations in Africa.	medical devices;regulation;solutions	Alexandra Lissel;Florian Ottenberg;Boris R.

A simulator that aids the training of this procedure may contribute to the learning of the technique and the improvement of its implementation in real patients. This article presents a systematic review conducted in order to assess the state of the art of the simulation of the palpation procedure, providing a categorization of techniques and approaches used in systems with haptic feedback. The results indicate that there are existing gaps concerning the accessibility of the haptic devices, innovative methods to calculate force feedback and deformation caused by haptic devices, and user experience improvement, since most of the studies consider only one point of contact, which can limit the simulation realism.	accessibility;algorithm;categorization;code reuse;finite element method;haptic technology;human factors and ergonomics;imaging phantom;linear algebra;mobile device;parallel computing;requirement;simulation;systematic review;under the skin;user experience	Mateus L.

The design of patient-facing views of clinical information is, however, a relatively recent line of inquiry. Research is needed to further understand guidelines for communicating specific types of information to hospital patients. In this work, we focus on cardiology patients' information needs related to their hospital medications. We assessed these needs to inform the design of interactive, electronic views of medication information for cardiology inpatients. We present results of in-situ interviews with 11 inpatients and 6 nurses in a cardiology step-down unit. Our findings suggest that cohesive trends in medication information needs exist across cardiology inpatients. We discuss interview results and their implications for the design of inpatient-facing information technology. We also discuss key ways in which electronic medication information, formatted for inpatient use, differs from that formatted for outpatient or transitional medication-management use.	cardiology discipline;information sciences;information needs;patient visit;patients;inpatient	Lauren Wilcox;Steven K.

Many organizations have introduced ICT-based processes to reduce the use of paper as primary documentation. Nevertheless, paper documents are still being used in healthcare.   PURPOSE To better understand this situation, we have studied the use of paper-based patient lists in two wards in a Norwegian hospital that has 'gone digital'. We seek to answer the question: """"Why is it that paper-based patient lists are maintained in the ward of a hospital going digital?""""

A checklist approach aims to provide clear steps and rationale for procedures, standardized processes for clinical skills and to assist nursing schools and clinical practice partners in teaching clinical skills, and keeping procedural practice current. The format is logical, organized and focused on patient safety, and will provide information retrieval opportunities at the point of care to support decisions and plan patient care. This poster discusses the development of this resource, the framework used, and the process from conception to distribution.	best practice;design rationale;information retrieval;quality of health care;school;schools, nursing	Glynda Doyle;Jodie McCutcheon	2016	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-658-3-979	knowledge management;safer;medicine	HCI	-57.402574888183516	-62.254108375429084	89020

Mobile device adoption into practice is a recent trend that has increased dramatically and formal studies are needed to investigate consequent benefits and challenges. The objective of this study is to evaluate practitioner perceptions of improvements in productivity, provider-patient communications, care provision, technology usability and other outcomes following the adoption and use of a tablet computer connected to electronic health information resources.   METHODS A pilot program was initiated in June 2013 to evaluate the effect of mobile tablet computers at one health provider organization in the southeast United States. Providers were asked to volunteer for the evaluation and were each given a mobile tablet computer. A total of 42 inpatient and outpatient providers were interviewed in 2015 using a survey style questionnaire that utilized yes/no, Likert-style, and open ended questions. Each had previously used an electronic health record (EHR) system a minimum of one year outside of residency, and were regular users of personal mobile devices. Each used a mobile tablet computer in the context of their practice connected to the health system EHR.   RESULTS The survey results indicate that more than half of providers perceive the use of the tablet device as having a positive effect on patient communications, patient education, patient's perception of the provider, time spent interacting with patients, provider productivity, process of care, satisfaction with EHR when used together with the device, and care provision. Providers also reported feeling comfortable using the device (82.9%), would recommend the device to colleagues (69.2%), did not experience increased information security and privacy concerns (95%), and noted significant reductions in EHR login times (64.1%). Less than 25% of participants reported negative impacts on any of these areas as well as on time spent on order submission, note completion time, overall workload, patient satisfaction with care experience and patient outcomes. Gender, number of years in practice, practice type (general practitioner vs. specialist), and service type (inpatient/outpatient) were found to have a significant effect on perceptions of patient satisfaction, care process, and provider productivity.   CONCLUSIONS Providers found positive gains from utilizing mobile devices in overall productivity, improved communications with their patients, the process of care, and technology efficiencies when used in combination with EHR and other health information resources. Demographic and health care work environment play a role in how mobile technologies are integrated into practice by providers.	ccir system a;computers;diagnosing provider:addr:pt:provider:nom;electronic health records;health care;information resources;information security;interaction;investments;login;mobile device;mobile phone;objective-c;one health initiative;patients;radiology information systems;regulatory submission;tablet dosage form;tablet computer;usability;yes or no response;benefit;inpatient	Benjamin L.

We conducted a depiction task to instruct participants in drawing what they thought when they read fictive motion sentences and non-fictive motion sentences in Mandarin Chinese. After the drawing task, three participants that did not join the drawing task judged whether the trajectory was lengthened or not in the pictures according to their intuition. The experimental results show that trajectories depicted for the fictive motion sentences were judged significantly more lengthened than those for the non-fictive motion sentences. The findings of our study suggest even though there is no explicit movement involving in the meanings of fictive motions in Mandarin, people automatically simulate the movement and the trajectories. This study has practical implication for computational linguistics in analyzing subtle semantic meanings among motion verbs.	computational linguistics;conceptual system;simulation;super robot monkey team hyperforce go!;the forest	Shu-Ping Gong;Zhao-Ying Huang	2016	2016 International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP)	10.1109/IALP.2016.7875955	dynamics;speech recognition;concrete;painting;trajectory;semantics;linguistics;pragmatics	HCI	-50.824829310602524	-52.91789052848789	89244

We describe a computer based system for generating reminder letters to patients who may have missed their indicated screening tests because they do not visit a provider regularly or missed their tests despite the fact that they do visit a provider. We started with national recommendations and generated a local consensus for test indications. We then used this set of indications and our electronic record to determine test deficiencies in our pilot pool of 3073 patients. The computer generated customized reminder letters targeting several tests. Physicians chose any patients who should not receive letters. The response rate for fecal occult blood (FOB) testing was 33% compared with an 18% historical compliance rate within the same community. FOB reminders generated improved test compliance. Test execution must be considered when commencing a program of screening test reminders.	blood substitute;choose (action);occult blood screen;patients;test case;cellular targeting	D. J.

Lack of human resources for caregiving has led to designing robots to assist people in need. Assistive robotics are meant to help people cope with Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Most ADL are heavily affected by issues related to ambulation [1], so much effort in assistive robots has focused on robotic wheelchairs, rollators, walkers and even canes. These devices typically provide monitorization, physical support and help to cope with hazardous and/or complex situations. However, it is of key importance to provide just the right amount of help to people with disabilities. According to clinicians, an excess of assistance may lead to frustration and/or loss of residual skills. Lack of assistance, however, may lead to unacceptable risks and/or failure to accomplish the desired task. Hence, help must be adapted to each specific user.	rehabilitation robotics;robot	Cristina Urdiales	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-19222-2_52	simulation	Robotics	-56.60984530855775	-55.81132850800094	89330

This manuscript presents a 2nd generation MIDG replacing the Globus Toolkit with a new system architecture that implements the IHE XDS-i integration profile. Implementation and evaluation were conducted using a 3-site interdisciplinary test-bed at the University of Southern California. The 2nd generation MIDG design architecture replaces the initial design’s Globus Toolkit with dedicated web services and XML-based messaging for dedicated management and delivery of multi-modality DICOM imaging datasets. The Cross-enterprise Document Sharing for Imaging (XDS-i) integration profile from the field of enterprise radiology informatics was adopted into the MIDG design because streamlined image registration, management, and distribution dataflow are likewise needed in preclinical imaging informatics systems as in enterprise PACS application. Implementation of the MIDG is demonstrated at the University of Southern California Molecular Imaging Center (MIC) and two other sites with specified hardware, software, and network bandwidth. Evaluation of the MIDG involves data upload, download, and fault-tolerance testing scenarios using multi-modality animal imaging datasets collected at the USC Molecular Imaging Center. The upload, download, and fault-tolerance tests of the MIDG were performed multiple times using 12 collected animal study datasets. Upload and download times demonstrated reproducibility and improved real-world performance. Fault-tolerance tests showed that automated failover between Grid Node Servers has minimal impact on normal download times. Building upon the 1st generation concepts and experiences, the 2nd generation MIDG system improves accessibility of disparate animal-model molecular imaging datasets to users outside a molecular imaging facility’s LAN using a new architecture, dataflow, and dedicated DICOM-based management web services. Productivity and efficiency of preclinical research for translational sciences investigators has been further streamlined for multi-center study data registration, management, and distribution.	accessibility;archive;cross enterprise document sharing;dicom;dna integration;dataflow;download;entity name part qualifier - adopted;experience;failover;fault tolerance;genetic translation process;globus hystericus;image registration;imaging informatics;informatics (discipline);local area networks;manuscripts;medical imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);molecular imaging;numerous;organizing (structure);picture archiving and communication system;preclinical imaging;radiology;science;systems architecture;testbed;upload;web service;xml;registration - actclass	Jasper Lee;Jianguo Zhang;Ryan Park;Grant Dagliyan;Brent J.

0167f058a083f4f7c3f3cba18a4152eb967b539d	enhancing general practitioners participation in a virtual community of practice for continuing medical education: an exploratory study	continuing medical education;design considerations;general practitioners;virtual communities of practice	As sources of medical information grow online, Virtual Communities of Practice (VCoPs) have evolved into a potential tool that allows General Practitioners (GPs) to interact through the sharing of their experience and knowledge. However, literature reports that GPs are reluctant to participate in VCoPs especially for their continuing medical education (CME). Currently, no study has explored the design and structural aspects of VCoPs that may lead to enhancing GPs' participation in such online communities. Hence, this paper explores how GPs envisage the use of a VCoP for their CME and how to enhance their participation by conducting an exploratory qualitative study of two focus groups with 10 GPs in each group, accompanied by a specialist and a nurse. Our empirical findings identified two key contributions: i) seven themes that need to be incorporated in the VCoP to enable and support GP's CME through the use of a VCoP; ii) three recommendations to take into consideration for researchers when evaluating VCoPs for CME.	behavior;education, medical;education, medical, continuing;exploratory testing;focus group;online community;virtual community	Abdulaziz Murad;Reeva Lederman;Rachelle Bosua;Shanton Chang;John Dennis Wark	2017	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-783-2-97	exploratory research;continuing medical education;virtual community of practice;family medicine;nursing;medicine	HCI	-62.3575734796799	-59.54781750975782	89411
0f1f17dfdc8879bda1ba4b377feba01614d72dce	the adoption of mobile health management services: an empirical study	healthcare;technology acceptance model tam;mobile health management service	As their populations age, many countries are facing the increasing economic pressure of providing healthcare to their people. In Taiwan, this problem is exacerbated by an increasing rate of obesity and obesity-related conditions. Encouraging the adoption of personal health management services is one way to maintain current levels of personal health and to efficiently manage the distribution of healthcare resources. This study introduces Mobile Health Management Services (MHMS) and employs the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to explore the intention of students in Executive Master of Business Management programs to adopt mobile health management technology. Partial least squares (PLS) was used to analyze the collected data, and the results revealed that “perceived usefulness” and “attitude” significantly affected the behavioral intention of adopting MHMS. Both “perceived ease of use” and “perceived usefulness,” significantly affected “attitude,” and “perceived ease of use” significantly affected “perceived usefulness” as well. The results also show that the determinants of intention toward MHMS differed with age; young adults had higher intention to adopt MHMS to manage their personal health. Therefore, relevant governmental agencies may profitably promote the management of personal health among this population. Successful promotion of personal health management will contribute to increases in both the level of general health and the efficient management of healthcare resources.	epilepsies, partial;ibm tivoli access manager;mobile health;obesity;papillon-lefevre disease;partial least squares regression;population;usability	Ming-Chien Hung;Wen-Yuan Jen	2010	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-010-9600-2	knowledge management;nursing;health care	HCI	-62.75088461943523	-63.64996352860031	89522

BACKGROUND A widespread and persistent memory error that people commit on a daily basis is the postcompletion error (PCE), that is, forgetting to complete the final step of a procedural task in which the final step occurs after completion of the task goal. PCEs occur in the railroad industry when a locomotive conductor changes the direction of a rail switch but fails to report this change. This particular error could contribute to unsafe conditions as another train traveling on the same track could derail. Although training can help reduce some of the factors leading to unsafe conditions on the rail, research has demonstrated that PCEs are different from other errors of omission in that they cannot be eliminated through training, which makes them a difficult problem to address.   METHOD Twenty-eight undergraduates completed train yard tasks within a mid-fidelity simulator used in commercial rail operations for training. Each participant received the behavioral intervention in one block and no intervention in another. Specifically, participants were required to perform an additional task designed to remind participants of the postcompletion step.   RESULTS Our intervention significantly reduced PCE rates in the context of train yard operations, on average by 65%.   CONCLUSION We discuss implications of the effectiveness of our intervention at reducing train yard accidents and how this outcome can contribute to the literature on the cause of PCEs.   APPLICATION In cases such as the railroad industry, where redesigning technology is prohibitive, our behavioral intervention is an effective alternative for significantly reducing PCEs.	behavior therapy;critical system;error message;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;inborn errors of metabolism;persistent memory;ram parity;simulation;simulators;travel	Joseph D.

Our aim was to investigate the patient perspective on receiving telemedicine with weekly submission of readings and regular video consultations (Net-COPD) as an alternative to visits in the respiratory outpatient clinic and investigating the role of telemedicine in management of severe COPD.   DESIGN Descriptive design and the method is qualitative based on semistructured interviews.   METHODS Fourteen intervention patients participated from the Danish randomized clinical trial Net-COPD project. The transcribed interviews were analysed using manifest and latent content analysis.   FINDINGS Participants reported that Net-COPD brought enhanced wellbeing and a sense of security in knowing that nurses kept an eye on them and initiated appropriate interventions in case of changes in the patient's condition. This was experienced as a lifeline to the respiratory outpatient clinic, which could be contacted when needed. Through monitoring, moreover, patients developed increased awareness and better self-management of their disease. Patients also experienced more focused and less stressful meetings via video consultations, than in respiratory outpatient visits. Nevertheless it was important that it was the same health staff patient met in the video consultations.   CONCLUSION Participation in telemedicine increased the patient empowerment primarily by the sharing of data with a permanent staff of nurses. This knowledge was used to keep control of the disease in the form of extra readings and the systematic use of learned initiatives. This gave patients and relatives a sense of security.

A total of 314 road runners participated in the study, and a regression model was formulated to measure the relationships among variables in the conceptual model. The results revealed that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and health anxiety had a significant impact on attitude toward use. To increase individuals’ intention to use smart wearable devices, it is critical to encourage a positive attitude toward using the devices to acquire health knowledge. Emphasizing devising effective means to communicate the health utility of the devices to customers should be the highest priority for industry producers.	usability;wearable computer;wearable technology	Fen-Fen Huang	2015	IJWA		wearable technology;anxiety;physical therapy;psychology	HCI	-59.89098723555565	-52.17028266540412	89754
1b7325fa4d36cc474c8dfb85c51ff4f8a9dae01d	the impact of the environment on the experience of hospitalized stroke patients - an exploratory study		The aim of this study is to understand neurology patients, family and caregivers experiences of in-patient care environments and to investigate the aspects of the healing process that can be supported by the environment. Our goal is to identify the role the environment plays during the process of being treated for and recovering from a stroke. The stroke patient's description of ex- periences during hospitalization will help researchers, medical professionals and architects in adjusting the environment according to their specific needs. A set of research methods was used to capture the experience, changing the role of researcher as an observer to a participatory approach, integrating the caregivers as creators of the research data (1), (2). These methods included: shadowing, observation and interviewing, allowing nurses to describe their experiences and to obtain a voice in decision making. We built insights from healing environ- ment literature combined with own field studies. Specific environmental needs identified include: dosing stimulus load, having social support, having access to single patient rooms, balancing clinical and personal environments, having a clear structure of the day, undisturbed sleeping and the need for information.	exploratory testing	Elke Daemen;Evert van Loenen;Roel Cuppen	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-14112-1_10	human–computer interaction	HCI	-60.62365727115466	-58.070626717779696	89902

In neuropsychology it is possible to rehabilitate this disorder with cognitive exercises that provide for the recovery of memory, attention and impaired abilities of executive functions. In general, even if physically navigating in space and reasoning on it can be considered as conceptually linked, cognitive and motor rehabilitation treatments are often provided separately. Contrariwise, introducing an embodied cognition approach, this study aims to investigate the role of motor rehabilitation in the recovery of cognitive spatial ability. We present a single case study of a single male patient admitted with a diagnosis of chronic stroke. In the study he was rehabilitated with Lokomat technology for walking while his cognitive ability in topographical orientation was evaluated before and after the physical training with a standard neuropsychology battery. Moreover, ongoing evaluations in virtual reality spatial tasks were conducted during the rehabilitation period. Data shows an improvement in cognitive performances both in standard tests and virtual ones. The patient, more than a physiotherapy improvement, shows a gradual recovery of its spatial skills. Those data gives insight about the efficacy of embodied approach to rehabilitation by showing how exclusively by rehabilitating the body, with the help of robotic technology, we can expect an improvement in terms of cognitive functioning.	embodied cognition;performance;robot;topography;virtual reality	Francesca Morganti;Paola Sabattini;Roberto Casale	2016		10.1145/3051488.3051503	psychology;cognitive psychology;developmental psychology;physical medicine and rehabilitation;computer science;physical therapy;virtual reality	HCI	-55.92272881597249	-53.66875508147178	89983

We describe design case studies which address the needs and scenarios in this application: a hybrid and rich media tool which supports mobile one-on-one consultations; a remote guidance tool which allows an expert to remotely guide a nurse or junior clinician to perform clinical procedures; an integrated collaboration platform which supports remote consultations in a group meeting environment by enabling shared interaction with patient records and mobile interaction with large displays. These tools have been evaluated in usability studies in which the usefulness and potential value have been demonstrated. By presenting these case studies, we highlight the trend of incorporating emerging collaboration technologies and the need of integrated and multi-model interaction systems in a broader telehealth context.	collaborative software;interactive media;mobile interaction;numerous;patients;remote consultation;telemedicine;usability	Jane Li;Weidong Huang	2018	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-880-8-245	emergency medicine;health care;medicine	HCI	-59.80437755007714	-59.05305816616789	90026

In the past, most data mining efforts ensured confidentiality by the dubious policy of withholding their raw data from colleagues and the public. A cursory review of medical informatics literature in the past decade reveals that much of what we have """"learned"""" consists of assertions derived from confidential datasets unavailable for anyone's review. Without access to the original data, it is impossible to validate or improve upon a researcher's conclusions. Without access to research data, we are asked to accept findings as an act of faith, rather than as a scientific conclusion. This special issue of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine is devoted to medical data mining. The medical data miner has an obligation to conduct valid research in a way that protects human subjects. Today, data miners have the technical tools to merge large data collections and to distribute queries over disparate databases. In order to include patient-related data in shared databases, data miners will need methods to anonymize and deidentify data. This article reviews the human subject risks associated with medical data mining. This article also describes some of the innovative computational remedies that will permit researchers to conduct research AND share their data without risk to patient or institution."""	asea irb;accidental falls;artificial intelligence;collections (publication);confidentiality;data mining;database;databases;hospital information systems;informatics (discipline);information system;patients;review [publication type];verification and validation;deidentify	Jules J.

To lessen the prohibitive costs of conducting these studies and support evidence-based medicine, results emanating from these studies need to be shared and compared to one another. Current approaches for clinical study management have limitations that prohibit the effective sharing of clinical research data.   METHODS The objective of this paper is to present a proposal for a clinical study architecture to not only facilitate the communication of clinical study data but also its context so that the data that is being communicated can be unambiguously understood at the receiving end. Our approach is two-fold. First we outline our methodology to map clinical data from Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium Operational Data Model (ODM) to the Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resource (FHIR) and outline the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Next, we propose two FHIR-based models, to capture the metadata and data from the clinical study, that not only facilitate the syntactic but also semantic interoperability of clinical study data.   CONCLUSIONS This work shows that our proposed FHIR resources provide a good fit to semantically enrich the ODM data. By exploiting the rich information model in FHIR, we can organise clinical data in a manner that preserves its organisation but captures its context. Our implementations demonstrate that FHIR can natively manage clinical data. Furthermore, by providing links at several levels, it improves the traversal and querying of the data. The intended benefits of this approach is more efficient and effective data exchange that ultimately will allow clinicians to switch their focus back to decision-making and evidence-based medicines.	behavior;clinical data;clinical research;consortium;crew resource management, healthcare;data model;decision making;fast healthcare interoperability resources;fold (higher-order function);information model;oracle data mining;patients;resource description framework;semantic interoperability;tree traversal;weakness;benefit;standards characteristics	Hugo Leroux;Alejandro Metke-Jimenez;Michael Lawley	2017		10.1186/s13326-017-0148-7	data science;computer science;data mining;semantic interoperability;system integration;interoperability;observational study;semantics;health care;health informatics	HCI	-52.29450177196148	-66.14138968855887	90208
39103c8ed9f6dde28a2f3c172bb28ee0c3210ca7	digital touchscreen kiosks for patient-centered cancer education		Breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening have been shown to significantly increase early detection rates and reduce preventable cancer mortality. Yet Latinos in the U.S. have disproportionately lower cancer screening rates and significantly higher latestage cancer detection, and correspondingly higher cancer mortality rates. HealthPoint Communications developed digital touchscreen kiosks to deliver cancer education and screening promotion interventions to medically underserved Latinos. These kiosk interventions leverage digital video and touchscreen technologies to create an interactive, multimedia patient-education platform to overcome cognitive, cultural and linguistic barriers that impede cancer screening among Latinos. These cancer education kiosks provide a vivid and compelling interactive, multimedia experience that engages learners in a self-paced exploration of cancer risk factors, risk reduction strategies, screening options and recommendations, and related topics presented in readily accessible learning modules. Patients literally have cancer education information at their fingertips though an intuitive, user-friendly navigation interface. They do not need to be computer literate nor have keyboard or mouse skills. The kiosks provide cancer education modules for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer that address major obstacles to screening and deliver culturally and linguistically appropriate education messages to lowincome, low literacy Latino patients. The cancer education modules depict realistic, culturally familiar settings and use social models with whom low-income Latinos can identify. The education interventions were designed to increase self-efficacy and empower patients to make informed decisions about cancer risk reduction and screening behaviors. The efficacy of these cancer education interventions was examined through randomized clinical trials for breast cancer (N=1200), cervical cancer (N=900) and colorectal cancer (N=700). These studies found that the breast and cervical cancer kiosk-based patient education interventions significantly increased knowledge, improved attitudes, increased self-efficacy and promoted screening behavior. The colorectal cancer intervention significantly increased screening behavior. Notably, these studies found intervention effect sizes of 51%, 50% and 53%, respectively.	computer keyboard;computer mouse;digital video;randomized algorithm;touchscreen;usability	Armando Valdez	2011			breast cancer;computer science;machine learning;randomized controlled trial;physical therapy;artificial intelligence;cancer;interactive kiosk;cervical cancer;patient education;psychological intervention;colorectal cancer	HCI	-62.14304358647994	-55.69934036453767	90407
2a956121cba2cfefc5f68caaef8b5d13949fa048	videolaryngoscopy simulator: new technology leads to new training challenges		A videolaryngoscope is a more advanced tool than a traditional laryngoscope that eases endotracheal intubation by visualizing the vocal cords with a camera on the tip of the blade. However, using a videolaryngoscope can present difficulty in passing the tube into the glottic opening in some patients. This study developed a training protocol for intubation with videolaryngoscope and trained 22 anesthesia residents. A Parametrically Adjustable Airway Mannequin (PAAM) was set to provide easy and difficult configurations. Motion data of the videolaryngoscope, stylet, mannequin head, and hyoid bone were captured with 6 axis magnetic position sensors, along with the video image. The time to complete the various components of the task were recorded and used as an indication of competence along with observation by experts. The validity of the mannequin was supported by data that showed that the difficult configuration of PAAM took longer to intubate than the easy configuration (66 vs. 39 seconds during pre-test). The effectiveness of the training protocol was supported by improvement in trainee performance. At the beginning of the training, intubation with the difficult configuration took an average of 66 seconds, immediately after training it averaged 23 seconds, and in retention tests over a month after the training the average duration was 33 seconds.

42bfcc43c69bd8b4175c111bd0af2e3304074d39	development and testing of an observational method for detecting medication administration errors using information technology	information technology	One-third of medication errors that cause patient harm arise from medication administration errors (MAEs). Research regarding rates of MAEs is limited and has predominantly relied upon voluntary incident reports or observational studies. Traditionally, observational studies have used paper-based data collection. This is time intensive and creates distraction from actual observation, limits the amount of information recorded and requires transcription of data. Incorporating the use of handheld computers for data collection in MAE studies provides an opportunity to overcome some of these limitations. Our objective was to develop and test an observational method which incorporated the use of data collection software on a personal digital assistant (PDA, a handheld computer) for use in observational studies to monitor MAEs within hospitals.	computer;computers;computers, handheld;data collection;distraction - pain management method;mav protocol;mobile device;personal digital assistant;sensor;transcription (software)	Johanna I.

Greater accessibility resulted in more usage and reported increases in effectiveness. Physical distance to a terminal affects the associations of other aspects of accessibility with usage and has a greater influence on these associations earlier in one's adoption process. Differences in job type showed statistically significant associations with usage, independent of the influence of accessibility. Computer-monitored and reported usage measures were only moderately correlated and were differentially associated with the access measures and with the two outcomes. The article ends by discussing implications for implementation and evaluation of computer-based communication systems, theories of media characteristics and information value, and methodological issues in using computer-monitored usage data.	accessibility;inter-process communication;norm (social);physical symbol system;theory;usage data	Ronald E.

Playing such games repeatedly could generate self-efficacy, and consequently lead to behavioural intentions to take precautions. This study examines the effects of repetitive-play of an earthquake preparedness game on behavioural intentions, and the role of self-efficacy in mediating these positive outcomes. An experimental study was conducted, where repetitive-play was manipulated in a laboratory setting. An online self-administered survey was used to measure self-efficacy and behavioural intentions. Results showed that those in the repetitive-play condition had significant intentions to take precautions compared only to those in the no-play condition. The gradual increase in intentions from no-play to single-play to repetitive-play was not significant. Earthquake preparedness self-efficacy mediated the relationship between repetitive-play and behavioural intentions. Results of this study ...

BACKGROUND Subjective workload and conditions of the performance environment are oftentimes examined via cross-sectional designs without distinguishing within-from between-person effects. Given the dynamic nature of performance phenomena, multilevel designs coupled with manipulations of task demand shifts are needed to better model the dynamic relationships between state and trait components of subjective workload and performance.   METHOD With a sample of 75 college students and a computer game representing a complex decision-making environment, increases and decreases in task demand were counterbalanced and subjective workload and performance were measured concurrently in regular intervals within performance episodes. Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling.   RESULTS Both between- and especially within-person effects were dynamic. Nevertheless, at both levels of analysis, higher subjective workload reflected performance problems, especially more downstream from increases in task demand.   CONCLUSION As a function of cognitive-energetic processes, shifts in task demand are associated with changes in how subjective workload is related to performance over a given period of activity. Multilevel, longitudinal approaches are useful for distinguishing and examining the dynamic relationships between state and trait components of subjective workload and performance.   APPLICATION The findings of this research help to improve the understanding of how a sequence of demands can exceed a performer's capability to respond to further demands.	cross-sectional data;decision making;downstream (software development);multilevel model;objective-c;pc game	Derek L.

The aim of this study was to build a model of the post-stroke rehabilitation process. The model, implemented in the Unified Modeling Language, was grounded on international guidelines and refined following the clinical pathway adopted at local level by a specialized rehabilitation centre. The model describes the organisation of the rehabilitation delivery and it facilitates the monitoring of recovery during the process. Indeed, a system software was developed and tested to support clinicians in the digital administration of clinical scales.

fb8704210358d0cbf5113c97e1f9f9f03f67e6fc	a review of content-based image retrieval systems in medical applications-clinical benefits and future directions.	content based search;medical image retrieval;pacs;visual information retrieval;computer vision;multimedia data;medical application;content based image retrieval	Content-based visual information retrieval (CBVIR) or content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been one on the most vivid research areas in the field of computer vision over the last 10 years. The availability of large and steadily growing amounts of visual and multimedia data, and the development of the Internet underline the need to create thematic access methods that offer more than simple text-based queries or requests based on matching exact database fields. Many programs and tools have been developed to formulate and execute queries based on the visual or audio content and to help browsing large multimedia repositories. Still, no general breakthrough has been achieved with respect to large varied databases with documents of differing sorts and with varying characteristics. Answers to many questions with respect to speed, semantic descriptors or objective image interpretations are still unanswered. In the medical field, images, and especially digital images, are produced in ever-increasing quantities and used for diagnostics and therapy. The Radiology Department of the University Hospital of Geneva alone produced more than 12,000 images a day in 2002. The cardiology is currently the second largest producer of digital images, especially with videos of cardiac catheterization ( approximately 1800 exams per year containing almost 2000 images each). The total amount of cardiologic image data produced in the Geneva University Hospital was around 1 TB in 2002. Endoscopic videos can equally produce enormous amounts of data. With digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM), a standard for image communication has been set and patient information can be stored with the actual image(s), although still a few problems prevail with respect to the standardization. In several articles, content-based access to medical images for supporting clinical decision-making has been proposed that would ease the management of clinical data and scenarios for the integration of content-based access methods into picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) have been created. This article gives an overview of available literature in the field of content-based access to medical image data and on the technologies used in the field. Section 1 gives an introduction into generic content-based image retrieval and the technologies used. Section 2 explains the propositions for the use of image retrieval in medical practice and the various approaches. Example systems and application areas are described. Section 3 describes the techniques used in the implemented systems, their datasets and evaluations. Section 4 identifies possible clinical benefits of image retrieval systems in clinical practice as well as in research and education. New research directions are being defined that can prove to be useful. This article also identifies explanations to some of the outlined problems in the field as it looks like many propositions for systems are made from the medical domain and research prototypes are developed in computer science departments using medical datasets. Still, there are very few systems that seem to be used in clinical practice. It needs to be stated as well that the goal is not, in general, to replace text-based retrieval methods as they exist at the moment but to complement them with visual search tools.	accident and emergency department;archive;audio media;cardiology discipline;clinical data;complement system proteins;computer vision;content-based image retrieval;dicom;database;decision making;digital imaging and communications in medicine (dicom);digital image;evaluation;generic drugs;interpretation process;multimedia;picture archiving and communication systems;picture archiving and communication system;quantity;radiology;repository;semantic data model;simpletext;terabyte;text-based (computing);benefit;computer science;explanation	Henning Müller;Nicolas Michoux;David Bandon;Antoine Geissbühler	2004	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2003.11.024	medicine;image retrieval;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;multimedia;picture archiving and communication system;automatic image annotation;information retrieval	Vision	-49.35507378699177	-65.68970120825423	91737

Recent reports of suboptimal alert system design and implementation highlight the need for better evaluation to inform future designs. The authors present a comprehensive framework for evaluating the clinical appropriateness of synchronous, interruptive medication safety alerts.   METHODS Through literature review and iterative testing, metrics were developed that describe successes, justifiable overrides, provider non-adherence, and unintended adverse consequences of clinical decision support alerts. The framework was validated by applying it to a medication alerting system for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).   RESULTS Through expert review, the framework assesses each alert episode for appropriateness of the alert display and the necessity and urgency of a clinical response. Primary outcomes of the framework include the false positive alert rate, alert override rate, provider non-adherence rate, and rate of provider response appropriateness. Application of the framework to evaluate an existing AKI medication alerting system provided a more complete understanding of the process outcomes measured in the AKI medication alerting system. The authors confirmed that previous alerts and provider responses were most often appropriate.   CONCLUSION The new evaluation model offers a potentially effective method for assessing the clinical appropriateness of synchronous interruptive medication alerts prior to evaluating patient outcomes in a comparative trial. More work can determine the generalizability of the framework for use in other settings and other alert types.	alert brand of caffeine;alert:type:point in time:^patient:nominal;blighia sapida;clinical decision support system;decision support systems, clinical;effective method;electronic health records;evaluation;how true feel alert right now;information sciences;iterative method;kidney failure, acute;method overriding;norm (social);patients;systems design;kidney injury	Allison B.

A multitude of new systems for personal health management are being developed and it will be critical that these systems are responsive to the unique and specific needs of all people and perhaps more importantly those who are the most at-risk. As an initial step toward identifying core system requirements, interviews with care managers and administrators of a personal health information system (PHIS) for use with migrant farm workers was conducted providing preliminary recommendations toward the development of a framework for effective use of PHIS within diverse and underserved populations. Initial findings indicate that PHIS within these types of communities will exist not so much as an isolated tool for health management, but moreover an artifact for bridging health information communication between patients and their healthcare providers.	blue gene;bridging (networking);cynthia solomon;entity–relationship model;information system;overlapping markup;population;requirement;system requirements;systems design	Nathan Botts;Thomas A.

Because patients may simply forget to take an inhaler dose or take the wrong inhaler medication. Inconsistent and mistaken inhaler medications may cause problems for diseases control. The system contains a main website for medical experts and caregivers to manage patients’ health information from clinics. It also provides an off-site APP that allows patients to download the program to their mobile phones to monitor the inhaler dose they should be using. The APP connects to a smart inhaler device that has been patented in Taiwan. In this study, we implemented it as a cap for the metered dose in the medicine cylinder for the first experimental stage. We randomly selected 16 patients with asthma for the prototype face-to-face usage interview. Feedback from users was significantly positive.

b546f2a3adb3d311fe511452b6b942c822742117	improving robot transparency: real-time visualisation of robot ai substantially improves understanding in naive observers		Deciphering the behaviour of intelligent others is a fundamental characteristic of our own intelligence. As we interact with complex intelligent artefacts, humans inevitably construct mental models to understand and predict their behaviour. If these models are incorrect or inadequate, we run the risk of self deception or even harm. Here we demonstrate that providing even a simple, abstracted real-time visualisation of a robotu0027s AI can radically improve the transparency of machine cognition. Findings from both an online experiment using a video recording of a robot, and from direct observation of a robot show substantial improvements in observersu0027 understanding of the robotu0027s behaviour. Unexpectedly, this improved understanding was correlated in one condition with an increased perception that the robot was ‘thinking’, but in no conditions was the robotu0027s assessed intelligence impacted. In addition to our results, we describe our approach, tools used, implications, and potential future research directions.		Robert H.

METHODS We compared hospitals with online access to UpToDate with other acute care hospitals included in the Thomson 100 Top Hospitals Database (Thomson database). Metrics used in the Thomson database differentiate hospitals on a variety of performance dimensions such as quality and efficiency. Prespecified outcomes were risk-adjusted mortality, complications, the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality Patient Safety Indicators, and hospital length of stay among Medicare beneficiaries. Linear regression models were developed that included adjustment for hospital region, teaching status, and discharge volume.   RESULTS Hospitals with access to UpToDate (n=424) were associated with significantly better performance than other hospitals in the Thomson database (n=3091) on risk-adjusted measures of patient safety (P=0.0163) and complications (P=0.0012) and had significantly shorter length of stay (by on average 0.167 days per discharge, 95% confidence interval 0.081-0.252 days, P<0.0001). All of these associations correlated significantly with how much UpToDate was used at each hospital. Mortality was not significantly different between UpToDate and non-UpToDate hospitals.   LIMITATIONS The study was retrospective and observational and could not fully account for additional features at the included hospitals that may also have been associated with better health outcomes.   CONCLUSIONS An electronic clinical knowledge support system (UpToDate was associated with improved health outcomes and shorter length of stay among Medicare beneficiaries in acute care hospitals in the United States. Additional studies are needed to clarify whether use of UpToDate is a marker for the better performance, an independent cause of it, or a synergistic part of other quality improvement characteristics at better-performing hospitals.	cns disorder;confidence intervals;discharger;health outcomes;medicare;mental association;quantity;support system;synergy	Peter A.

The challenge is to support a good quality service under the constraints faced by recent shortage of nursing and care services professionals without redesigning the work flow operated in the existing elderly health care industries. the existing elderly health care industries.   METHODS    RESULTS The Total QoS measure based on Finite Capacity Queuing Model is a reliable method and an effective measurement for Quality of services. The value is good for measuring the staffing level and offers a measurement for efficiency enhancement when incorporate new technologies like ICT. The implemented system has improved the Quality of Service by more than 14% and the extra released manpower resource will allow clinical care provider to offer further value added services without actually increasing head count.   CONCLUSIONS We have developed a novel Quality of Service measurement for Clinical Care services based on multi-queue using finite capacity queue model M/M/c/K/n and the measurement is useful for estimating the shortage of staff resource in a caring institution. It is essential for future integration with the existing widely used assessment model to develop reliable measuring limits which allow an effective measurement of public fund used in health care industries.

0a636d73dc67be4b5742918932dedd4a8afbf52a	smart homes and health telematics, designing a better future: urban assisted living		Older people with dementia often depend on caregivers to manage their medications. The complexity of medication regimens in this population can impede medication adherence (i.e., taking medications as prescribed), which may compromise the effectiveness of treatment and increase the cost and burden of illness. Different technological devices have been used to improve medication adherence, however, these devices are often not evidence-based or designed with end-user involvement, thereby affecting their acceptability by people living with dementia and their caregivers. This in turn, can influence the effectiveness and uptake of such devices. This study aims to explore the challenges of medication adherence for both older people with dementia and their caregivers to guide the development of future technological solutions that can be effective, practical and sustainable.	telematics	Mounir Mokhtari;Bessam Abdulrazak Hamdi Aloulou	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94523-1		HCI	-60.00618380892751	-56.76616111207078	92638

Usually, a paper tag is attached to each patient containing their classification and the results of an initial, quick diagnosis. Several projects have aimed to electronically augment the process by using ubiquitous computing components. In this paper we present drawbacks of introducing technology to the process, which have not been discussed elsewhere, based on an extensive set of expert workshops discussing the employment of technology in triage with the aid of technology probes. Our main finding is that the common set of functionalities of electronic triage systems involves unwanted reconfiguration of triage processes. By presenting a set of implications for the design of these mobile technologies, we show how potential negative effects can be mitigated.	sorting;ubiquitous computing	Marc Jentsch;Leonardo Ramirez;Lisa Delano-Wood;Erion Elmasllari	2013		10.1145/2493190.2493212	simulation;computer security	HCI	-56.655146965457426	-61.42525826580378	92969

Insight is the only available informatics platform for accessing and analyzing integrated data from multiple epilepsy self-management research studies with several new data management features and user-friendly functionalities. The features of Insight include, (1) use of Common Data Elements defined by members of the research community and an epilepsy domain ontology for data integration and querying, (2) visualization tools to support real time exploration of data distribution across research studies, and (3) an interactive visual query interface for provenance-enabled research cohort identification. The Insight platform contains data from five completed epilepsy self-management research studies covering various categories of data, including depression, quality of life, seizure frequency, and socioeconomic information. The data represents over 400 participants with 7552 data points. The Insight data exploration and cohort identification query interface has been developed using Ruby on Rails Web technology and open source Web Ontology Language Application Programming Interface to support ontology-based reasoning. We have developed an efficient ontology management module that automatically updates the ontology mappings each time a new version of the Epilepsy and Seizure Ontology is released. The Insight platform features a Role-based Access Control module to authenticate and effectively manage user access to different research studies. User access to Insight is managed by the Managing Epilepsy Well Network database steering committee consisting of representatives of all current collaborating centers of the Managing Epilepsy Well Network. New research studies are being continuously added to the Insight database and the size as well as the unique coverage of the dataset allows investigators to conduct aggregate data analysis that will inform the next generation of epilepsy self-management studies.	aggregate data;application programming interface;authentication;automated reasoning;categories;committee, drug;data point;depressive disorder;epilepsy;informatics (discipline);interface device component;next-generation network;ontology (information science);open-source software;question (inquiry);role-based access control;ruby on rails;seizures;self-management (computer science);silo (dataset);usability;web ontology language	Satya S.

Although optimal multisensory processing is thought to decline with ageing, inefficient integration is particularly associated with falls in older adults. We investigated whether improved balance control, following a novel balance training intervention, was associated with more efficient multisensory integration in older adults, particularly those who have fallen in the past. Specifically, 76 healthy and fall-prone older adults were allocated to either a balance training programme conducted over 5 weeks or to a passive control condition. Balance training involved a VR display in which the on-screen position of a target object was controlled by shifts in postural balance on a Wii balance board. Susceptibility to the sound-induced flash illusion, before and after the intervention (or control condition), was used as a measure of multisensory function. Whilst balance and postural control improved for all participants assigned to the Intervention group, improved functional balance was correlated with more efficient multisensory processing in the fall-prone older adults only. Our findings add to growing evidence suggesting important links between balance control and multisensory interactions in the ageing brain and have implications for the development of interventions designed to reduce the risk of falls. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a scenario that has not been explored with STPA before but is the status quo in most healthcare systems. In an intensive care unit, the process of providing care to patients is comprised of many processes including drug delivery, lab draws, radiological imaging, bedside procedures, physical therapy, and far more. The interactions of these procedures support patient care but also increase risk in healthcare delivery in ways that need to be considered.	interaction;medical imaging;radiology	Aubrey Samost	2014			intensive care medicine	ML	-59.50590021417212	-61.272780993296145	93909

The aim is to review clinical trials in the field of 3DP, an area of research which has grown dramatically in recent years. We surveyed clinical trials registered in 15 primary registries worldwide, including ClinicalTrials.gov. All trials which utilized 3DP in a clinical setting were included in this review. Our search was performed on December 15, 2017. Data regarding the purpose of the study, inclusion criteria, number of patients enrolled, primary outcomes, centers, start and estimated completion dates were extracted. A total of 92 clinical trials with $${N}=6$$ N=6 252 patients matched the criteria and were included in the study. A total of 42 (45.65%) studies cited China as their location. Only 10 trials were multicenter and 2 were registered as international. The discipline that most commonly utilized 3DP was Orthopedic Surgery, with 25 (27.17%) registered trials. At the time of data extraction, 17 (18.48%) clinical trials were complete. After several years of case reports, feasibility studies and technical reports in the field, larger-scale studies are beginning to emerge. There are almost no international register entries. Although there are new emerging areas of study in disciplines that may benefit from 3DP, it is likely to remain limited to very specific applications.	3d printing;emergentism;extraction;large;orthopedics;patients;registration	Jan Witowski;Mateusz Sitkowski;Tomasz Zuzak;Jasamine Coles-Black;Jason Chuen;Piotr Major;Michal Pedziwiatr	2018		10.1007/s11548-018-1793-8	biomedical engineering;radiology;3d printing;clinical trial;medicine	HCI	-60.09671839925451	-64.86672525228661	94005

METHODS A qualitative study of the daily use of a CPOMR at an internal medicine hospital ward over a period of 3 months, during which 66 patients were treated based on clinical information recorded in the CPOMR though back up by a paper-based record was available. The study is based on participant observation and interviews with the clinicians who had the most profound and extensive experience in the use of the CPOMR. Before and during the test-period the author attended project planning meetings, a training workshop in the use of the CPOMR for nurses and physicians and local coordination meetings. After the test, one focus-group discussion with physicians and nurses (6 participants; duration 11/2h) was conducted as well as 13 open-ended interviews (5 nurses, 2 social and health assistants, 4 physicians, 2 IT-people; duration: 16-42 min; average of 29 min). The interviewees formed the core group using the CPOMR.   RESULTS Use of the CPOMR led to more time spent documenting clinical work, fragmentation of patient situation into separate problems, and lack of an overview.   CONCLUSION The problem-oriented method for structuring a computerized medical record may provide a description of how physicians think or ought to think, but does not adequately support complex clinical work. While the CPOMR can be used for patients with few, simple problems who are admitted for only a short time, it is not useful for patients with a complex set of problems or for patients admitted for longer periods of time. This is in accordance with criticism of the paper-based POMR, the problematic points of which do not seem to be alleviated through computerization. The problem-oriented way of ordering information should be accompanied by a source- and time-oriented approach.	backup;documented;focus group;fork (software development);health care;hospital departments;hospital admission;internal medicine specialty;maxima and minima;medical records;medical records, problem-oriented;nonlinear gameplay;patients;software documentation;meeting	Claus Bossen	2007	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2006.04.007	family medicine;medicine;qualitative research;nursing;medical record;health care	HCI	-60.380746092942445	-65.47654439056492	94219

The focus of the study is on patient self-reporting systems, and patient centrism. For that purpose, this scoping review examines studies that summarize the current position of patient self-reporting in health care. Scopus, PubMed including MEDLINE, and Cochrane retrievals, and hand search revealed in 50 articles for further analysis. The results showed that patient-reported incidents are still ifrequently researched.

988881cec10d16fa212a3a99a08148802205fe34	the effect of acute physical activity on children's memory for language		Research on the relationship between acute physical activity and cognition in children has often found beneficial effects of exercise on a variety of cognitive abilities. One domain that remains underexplored, however, is the relationship between exercise and long-term memory in children, and in particular whether the general-domain effects observed in previous studies could translate to a school-based learning activity, such as vocabulary learning. To address this issue, this study focused on the possible effects that a bout of moderate, aerobic physical activity could have on the immediate and delayed recall of newly acquired word forms and formmeaning connections of children in a school setting. In line with previous research, the results show a positive effect of exercise, but only for word form recall. This study expands our understanding of the differential effects of exercise on memory, while raising questions regarding the possible moderating influence of gender and memory consolidation.	cognition;semiconductor consolidation;vocabulary	Carla Pastorino Campos;John Williams	2017			psychology;cognitive psychology	HCI	-58.46744768876839	-52.990039620605884	94518

67a291f5812b8cac00e2b2401d5f6e316ca6e543	using your digital phenotype to improve your mental health		We’ve all heard about the potential for using ‘‘big data’’ to connect behaviors to outcomes, thereby improving people’s health. But how close are we to this becoming a reality, and how can this improve people’s mental health? First, it involves using bioinformatics, which can be defined as ‘‘the science of integrating, managing, mining and interpreting information from biological data.’’ Although there are a large number of life science data sets available for use, most of this information has yet to be tapped because these data sets include complex data types that are incompatible and widely distributed. Even to this day, there is an enormous amount of relevant information that remains hidden in the potential connection of unrelated files. ‘‘People are increasingly leaving a footprint of their health status through technology, including social media, forums, online communities, wearable technologies, and mobile devices . This information all has clinical value to a physician. The challenge is being aware of it and knowing how to access and interpret it.’’ This trail of the health data you leave behind through your interaction with technology has been dubbed your ‘‘digital phenotype.’’ One growing data set that contributes to your digital phenotype includes data from Fitbit and similar devices; Facebook, tweets, and other social media postings; and data from smartphones about how and how often people text and use their apps. This latter has formed the basis of ginger.io’s research, which contends that changes in people’s smartphone usage behavior can predict changes in a mental health condition such as depression. Ginger.io makes a smartphone app to collect data from users’ phones such as call and texting patterns and movements throughout the day. In addition, users can record information about how they are feeling each day. Third, the app can automatically notify the user’s family or physician, for example, if it senses that something is amiss. UCSF, McLean Hospital, and UC Davis are using ginger.io with mental health patients. UCSF uses digital-only interventions with hundreds of patients with depression. McLean aims to reduce readmissions of patients with schizophrenia. UC Davis works with teens with psychotic illness. Ginger.io’s approach is based on evidence-based research. For example, one meta-analysis directly compared studies of guided Internet-delivered cognitive–behavior therapy (CBT) to face-to-face CBT. The analysis included 13 studies with a total N of 1,053—‘‘three studies on social anxiety disorder, three on panic disorder, two on depressive symptoms, two on body dissatisfaction, one on tinnitus, one on male sexual dysfunction, and one on spider phobia.’’ Results indicate that the two treatments are equivalent when analyzed in the aggregate, at least for these disorders. How soon will the barriers to mobile health (mHealth) data integration and interoperability be surmounted? In the European Union, the eHealth Action Plan 2012–20 includes a mandate ‘‘to address the unknown mechanisms necessary to develop data integration and the interoperability of mHealth within large volumes of existing patient data in national electronic health records (EHRs).’’ The United States has set 2017 as its EHR interoperability goal. When these barriers fall away, you will reap the significant benefits of being able to use your digital phenotype to improve both your mental and physical health.	aggregate data;angela mclean (biologist);anxiety disorders;behavior;big data;bioinformatics;biological science disciplines;brown recluse spider;certified broadcast technologist;cognition disorders;departure - action;depressive disorder;dissatisfaction;electronic health records;esthesia;european union;individual physical condition;interoperability;mhealth;mental disorders;mobile health;mobile app;mobile device;movement;online community;panic disorder;patients;phobia, social;phobic anxiety disorder;physiological sexual disorders;schizophrenia;shared paranoid disorder;smartphone;social media;spiders;text messaging;uc browser;wearable computer;benefit;mental health;notification	Brenda K.

Participants included public, private, and community healthcare organizations/providers in Eastern Ontario (Canada). One hundred and nineteen service providers and 39 brain injury survivors registered over 6 months. Fifty-eight percent received English and 42% received bilingual services (English-French). Public health providers contacted the regional service coordinator more than private providers (52% urban centres, 26% rural service providers, and 22% both areas). Thirty-five percent of contacts were for technical difficulties, 32% registration inquiries, 21% forms and processes, 6% resources, and 6% education. Seventeen technical enquiries required action by technical support personnel: 41% digital certificates, 29% web forms, and 12% log-in. This web-based approach to clinical information sharing provided access to relevant data as clients moved through or re-entered the health system. Improvements include automated digital certificate management, institutional health records system integration, and more referral tracking tools. More sensitive test data could be accessed on-line with increasing consumer/clinician confidence. In addition to a strong technical infrastructure, human resource issues are a major information security component and require continuing attention to ensure a viable on-line information environment.

9688b1ae17cf760681cd4be749f9ae4068f49f63	la-vie: a serious game for cardiopulmonary resuscitation		Every year a number of people involved in a cardiac arrest (a condition in which the heart of a person stops working) die before the arrival of paramedics. Therefore, a timely cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a necessary act to save somebody's life. Now a days gamming has become a common trend in both children and adults, so it should be used as a key to learning. In this paper, we discuss the use of a purposely made serious game to make a layman learn basics of CPR i.e. Chest Compressions and Mouth to Mouth Ventilation. In addition, the game also resembles the daily routine of a person and consists of a proper storyline to make it attractive to play. Evaluation results of LA-VIE game show that it's an effective tool to train general people about CPR.	die (integrated circuit);la abadía del crimen	Muhammad Hamza Latif;Muhammad Ajmal;Farooq Ahmad;Junaid Alam;Asma Saleem	2017	2017 IEEE 5th International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health (SeGAH)	10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939297	cardiopulmonary resuscitation;medical emergency;medicine	Robotics	-57.55347669646733	-54.68380189561661	95235

We hypothesized that using high-fidelity VR systems to display realistic 3D sport environments could trigger anxiety, allowing resilience-training systems to prepare athletes for real-world, high-pressure situations. In this work we investigated the feasibility and usefulness of using VR for sport psychology training. We developed a virtual soccer goalkeeping application for the Virginia Tech Visionarium VisCube (a CAVE-like display system), in which users defend against simulated penalty kicks using their own bodies. Using the application, we ran a controlled, within-subjects experiment with three independent variables: known anxiety triggers, field of regard, and simulation fidelity. The results demonstrate that a VR sport-oriented system can induce increased anxiety (physiological and subjective measures) compared to a baseline condition. There were a number of main effects and interaction effects for all three independent variables in terms of the subjective measures of anxiety. Both known anxiety triggers and simulation fidelity had a direct relationship to anxiety, while field of regard had an inverse relationship. Overall, the results demonstrate great potential for VR sport psychology training systems; however, further research is needed to determine if training in a VR environment can lead to long-term reduction in sport-induced anxiety.	anxiety disorders;baseline (configuration management);codependency (psychology);field of regard;precipitating factors;psychology, sports;simulation;vr - veterans rand health survey;virtual reality;visual effects;benefit	Cheryl Stinson;Doug A.

Through patient interviews and a focus group, we explored the changing need for technological support for diabetes self-management over the course of the disease, with a particular focus on insulin users. We propose a design for supportive technology aimed at the stabilization and progression stages of diabetes, which focuses on the creation of an individualized database of how new experiences with food, physical activities and travel affect one's glucose levels. Our design supports feedback and improvement for future similar experiences, while avoiding the burden of intensive tracking. We propose a mechanism to suggest insulin doses adapted to the user, and sharing data with peers according to individual privacy wishes. Future research could allow this innovative approach to benefit non-insulin users.		Katherine S. Blondon;Predrag V.

The main goals of the study were to understand how the technology impacted the workflow of the nurses and to assess the acceptability of the use of video during patient encounters. The study was based on interviews of the midwives, observation of patient visits, and an analysis of logs from the mobile devices. The overall results were positive; the midwives accepted use of mobile video as part of the workflow for postnatal care examinations. Using video changed the process of patient education, in some cases making it a more focused activity. The use of video also led to midwife multitasking, which was enabled by the technology. The study suggests that the midwives felt that their authority was enhanced by the use of video.	computer multitasking;mobile device;mobile phone	Brittany Fiore-Silfvast;Carl Hartung;Kirti Iyengar;Sharad D Iyengar;Kiersten Israel-Ballard;Noah Perin;Richard J.

After a first implementation including two oneterabyte optical libraries, the system is expanded to integrate all the imaging modalities of the hospital. The new storage requirement is 10 terabytes to cover three year archive. A large distributed image archive has been designed including new archive servers for long-term storage and display servers for medium-term storage. The acquisition, archive and distribution cycles are performed using separated networks combining Fast Ethernet and Ethernet. Image files are distributed to the wide-hospital using a prefetching strategy or an Intranet server, RADIOLAB. The first mode takes advantage of the fully integrated hospital information system DIOGENE 2 to allow the automatic retrieval of studies in advance. The second mode provides a convivial study selection from any conventional WWW (World Wide Web) browser. Image files are then transmitted to the user's display station using HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and handled by OSIRIS software, which acts as a helper or viewer. Such a system is expected to meet the time requirement, which is less than three seconds per image.

While health information technology (HIT) may be designed to support specific tasks the integrated nature of healthcare delivery often requires HIT to play various coordination roles. While studies have shown that coordination issues with HIT can cause adverse impacts there is little research that has looked at the specific types of coordination that HIT need to support. This paper uses a longitudinal study of a perioperative information system to identify and discuss different categories of HIT coordination. The findings can help the design and evaluation of HIT to support the coordination needs of healthcare delivery.		Craig E.

However, there remain concerns about adverse effects CPOE systems may have on the medication order process and workflow processes. This study explores the perception of nurses regarding the CPOE support on nurse physician communication in the medication order process.   METHODS A survey was developed measuring perceptions of CPOE features on workflow and nurse physician communication on a Likert scale.   RESULTS The majority of nurses felt that CPOE features supported the medication order process and perceived proper nurse physician communication.   CONCLUSIONS CPOE characteristics supported medication order processes and nurse physician communication although nurses reported additional work was required for follow up of physicians. Additional studies utilising in depth methods are recommended to fully understand medication order processes with further CPOE implementation.	computerized physician order entry system;formal methods;benefit	Basema Saddik;Shaha Al-Mansour	2014	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-427-5-149	nursing;medicine	HCI	-61.02382807837404	-62.96231281327411	96747

b8230276ad6eeb8d0037706fb3164d470dbcd703	medical and nursing staff perspectives on an electronic health record implementation in hospital outpatient departments - a qualitative study in four english hospital trusts		Objective: The authors sought to investigate the attitude of the staff using computers in outpatient departments and whether their perceptions altered as a result of the NHS Care Record Service (CRS) implementation. Design: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and observations. Participants: A total of 70 interviews were undertaken representing a broad range of staff involved in the outpatient department including doctors, nurses, managers, medical records staff, clerks and IT staff. In addition, 361 hours of observations were carried out in the outpatient departments over a six week period. Setting: UK Results: This study highlighted the dependence that outpatient department staff placed on IT and the complexity of issues surrounding their use of computer systems. All outpatient staff used a computer to some degree in their work and were relatively computer literate but recognised that there were problems with the technology such as the length of time it took to get information from the system, the number of times it crashed and the lack of interoperability between different systems. The implementation of the NHS in one trust created additional problems for the outpatient staff, especially during the rather protracted bedding-in time. As the software was more complex than the previous system, it required a greater number of clicks to find the information needed. The added scale and complexity of the NHS CRS was perceived to have resulted in an overall slower system, with problems finding relevant patient information on the screen. The clinic booking system configuration created difficulties with double or triple booking of clinics or clinics cancelled. During this process, staff did not feel that senior managers were listening to their concerns. Conclusions: The outpatient department has different and unique requirements which must be considered during the development stage of any new electronic health record system. IT development processes must acknowledge that new software systems require a degree of maturity and undergo testing in the different departments prior to the implementation process. Staff need to feel part of the software implementation process and their problems addressed to reduce stress and anxiety. The software design flaws described decreased the acceptance of the NHS CRS by staff but it is important to recognise that staff opinions and views may change over time as the system becomes embedded and matures.	capability maturity model;computer;embedded system;interoperability;requirement;semiconductor industry;software design;software release life cycle;software system;system configuration	Kate Marsden;Tony Avery;Sarah Patricia Slight;Nicholas Barber	2013				HCI	-61.31813191917874	-64.21525010919858	97093

Using higher fidelity clinical simulations to elicit clinicians' confidence 'calibration' (i.e. overconfidence or underconfidence) in more realistic settings is a promising but underutilized tactic. In this study we examine nurses' calibration of confidence with judgment accuracy for critical event risk assessment judgments in a high fidelity simulated clinical environment. The study also explores the effects of clinical experience, task difficulty and time pressure on the relationship between confidence and accuracy.   METHODS 63 student and 34 experienced nurses made dichotomous risk assessments on 25 scenarios simulated in a high fidelity clinical environment. Each nurse also assigned a score (0-100) reflecting the level of confidence in their judgments. Scenarios were derived from real patient cases and classified as easy or difficult judgment tasks. Nurses made half of their judgments under time pressure. Confidence calibration statistics were calculated and calibration curves generated.   RESULTS Nurse students were underconfident (mean over/underconfidence score -1.05) and experienced nurses overconfident (mean over/underconfidence score 6.56), P = 0.01. No significant differences in calibration and resolution were found between the two groups (P = 0.80 and P = 0.51, respectively). There was a significant interaction between time pressure and task difficulty on confidence (P = 0.008); time pressure increased confidence in easy cases but reduced confidence in difficult cases. Time pressure had no effect on confidence or accuracy. Judgment task difficulty impacted significantly on nurses' judgmental accuracy and confidence. A 'hard-easy' effect was observed: nurses were overconfident in difficult judgments and underconfident in easy judgments.   CONCLUSION Nurses were poorly calibrated when making risk assessment judgments in a high fidelity simulated setting. Nurses with more experience tended toward overconfidence. Whilst time pressure had little effect on calibration, nurses' over/underconfidence varied significantly with the degree of task difficulty. More research is required to identify strategies to minimize such cognitive biases.	calibration;classification;cognition disorders;evaluation procedure;health care;impacted tooth;judgment;patients;personnameuse - assigned;risk assessment;simulation;while	Huiqin Yang;Carl Thompson;Martin Bland	2012		10.1186/1472-6947-12-113	self-efficacy;health informatics;risk assessment;judgment;medicine;young adult;nursing	HCI	-56.58316858238123	-54.054027485036045	97180

The advancing field of robotics can provide an effective solution to this problem. This study aimed to develop a set of user requirements for a personal home health care robot. To generate these requirements, we conducted nine interviews with robotics professionals and three different focus groups with current and future caregivers and the elderly. Using this data we identified prominent and desired functionalities of robots, as well as what may influence their acceptance into the home setting. Our findings indicate that monitoring robots have the biggest acceptance potential among elderly and caregivers.	focus group;requirement;robot;robotics;user requirements document	Kevin Malehorn;Wan Liu;Hosung Im;Conrad Bzura;Taskin Padir;Bengisu Tulu	2012			family medicine;intensive care medicine;nursing	HCI	-59.795973276510864	-56.64431372347869	97238
dd3380d41dcf6b1858469c643fe4ae3dbfeb3bf2	2nd international workshop on mental health and well-being: sensing and intervention		Mental health issues affect a significant portion of the world's population and can result in debilitating and life-threatening outcomes. To address this increasingly pressing healthcare challenge, there is a need to research novel approaches for early detection and prevention. In particular, ubiquitous systems can play a central role in revealing and tracking clinically relevant behaviors, contexts, and symptoms. Further, such systems can passively detect relapse onset and enable the opportune delivery of effective intervention strategies. However, despite their clear potential, the uptake of ubiquitous technologies into clinical mental healthcare is rare, and a number of challenges still face the overall efficacy of such technology-based solutions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in identifying, articulating, and addressing such issues and opportunities. Following the success of last year's inaugural workshop, we aim to continue facilitating the UbiComp community in developing a holistic approach for sensing and intervention in the context of mental health.	holism;onset (audio);population;ubiquitous computing	Saeed Abdullah;Mirco Musolesi;Tanzeem Choudhury;Elizabeth L.

The Institute of Medicine report suggests medical errors account for up to 98,000 patient deaths each year. Therefore, the US healthcare system is looking to information technology applications as one means of making patient care safer. This paper compares the psychometric properties of the Electronic Health Record Nurse Satisfaction instrument (based on the Health Information Technology Research-based Evaluation Framework) to our study that employed the same instrument but measured clinical physicians' opinions of an EHR to determine if the instrument could be used across domains of users. Our results found the factor analysis and the clustering of the sub-scale items were different. We propose a two-factorial instrument that identifies the following dimensions: System Features/Performance and Data Quality/Accuracy. Another important contribution of this study is that patient safety was identified as a more salient indicator for physicians.		Cherie Noteboom;Kathryn Dempsey;Ann L.

To enhance adherence to fall prevention interventions, end users need to be engaged from the early phases of the development process. This paper reports the focus group evaluation of five scenarios related to fall risk assessment and fall prevention. There were four focus groups with older adults in both Finland and Spain; 58 participants in all. The most interesting features for the interviewees were usage of intelligent gym equipment, the possibility of peer support and multi-factorial fall risk assessment. The scenario with intelligent gym equipment rose above the others among Finnish participants, while the scenarios were ranked more evenly by Spanish correspondents. The analysis showed that a personal history of falls and a connection to current habits and routines affected the reception of the proposed solutions.

Patient data from EMRs could be linked with other data sources, such as a postal code linkage with Census data, to obtain additional information on environmental determinants of health. While promising, successful linkages between primary care EMRs with geographic measures is limited due to ethics review board concerns. This study tested the feasibility of extracting full postal code from primary care EMRs and linking this with area-level measures of the environment to demonstrate how such a linkage could be used to examine the determinants of disease. The association between obesity and area-level deprivation was used as an example to illustrate inequalities of obesity in adults.   METHODS The analysis included EMRs of 7153 patients aged 20 years and older who visited a single, primary care site in 2011. Extracted patient information included demographics (date of birth, sex, postal code) and weight status (height, weight). Information extraction and management procedures were designed to mitigate the risk of individual re-identification when extracting full postal code from source EMRs. Based on patients' postal codes, area-based deprivation indexes were created using the smallest area unit used in Canadian censuses. Descriptive statistics and socioeconomic disparity summary measures of linked census and adult patients were calculated.   RESULTS The data extraction of full postal code met technological requirements for rendering health information extracted from local EMRs into anonymized data. The prevalence of obesity was 31.6 %. There was variation of obesity between deprivation quintiles; adults in the most deprived areas were 35 % more likely to be obese compared with adults in the least deprived areas (Chi-Square = 20.24(1), p < 0.0001). Maps depicting spatial representation of regional deprivation and obesity were created to highlight high risk areas.   CONCLUSIONS An area based socio-economic measure was linked with EMR-derived objective measures of height and weight to show a positive association between area-level deprivation and obesity. The linked dataset demonstrates a promising model for assessing health disparities and ecological factors associated with the development of chronic diseases with far reaching implications for informing public health and primary health care interventions and services.	binocular disparity;chi;cartography;censuses;chronic disease;demography;description;ecology;electronic health records;electronics, medical;excalibur: morgana's revenge;index;information extraction;linkage (software);obesity;patients;postal code;primary health care;reducing diet;reporting;requirement;review board;silo (dataset);unit of area;anonymized;genetic linkage	Suzanne Biro;Tyler Williamson;Jannet Ann Leggett;David Barber;Rachael Morkem;Kieran Moore;Paul Belanger;Brian Mosley;Ian Janssen	2016		10.1186/s12911-016-0272-9	health informatics;family medicine;medicine;environmental health;nursing	HCI	-62.06207303485953	-65.74628820589257	98021

Healthcare records are in principle made up of statements about the patient's health and activities performed, organized within attested transactions or messages. Various mechanisms have been developed to optimally represent details of statements in a record system, creating de facto three subdivisions: (1) """"containers"""" of clinical information, i.e., section headings, data elements in local records; segments and data fields in messages; (2) their """"contents,"""" i.e., coding systems and terminologies; and (3) """"transaction context,"""" i.e., circumstances related to document production and message exchange, typically represented in their headers. Details rely on a common semantic background and should, therefore, be seen in a continuum; nevertheless, design methodologies and tools for the three subdivisions evolved independently and assignment of details to subdivisions is not predetermined by principles, but depends on implementation issues. Recent developments within the European Committee for Standardization (CEN/TC251/WG II) and in the European Project GALEN-IN-USE provide a new insight on semantics in healthcare. In order to guide harmonization of semantic aspects in the different series of standards-in information models, messages, document markup, terminology systems-we present a comparison of the various mechanisms they use to enforce semantic coherence on clinical information."""	cen/xfs;cache coherence;containers;information model;interoperability;markup language;medical records;nomenclature;patients;telematics;triune continuum paradigm;contents - htmllinktype;cyclophosphamide/etoposide/mitoxantrone;message;standards characteristics	Angelo Rossi Mori;Fabrizio Consorti	1998	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/4233.737579	nomenclature;medicine;design methods;information model;computer science;data mining;database;open system;world wide web;information retrieval;standardization;health care	Visualization	-51.47044724653962	-64.26044256320623	98062

Among the capabilities needed to implement patient lists in an IDR are: capture of patient identifiers from a query and feedback of these into the IDR; the existence of a permanent internal identifier in the IDR that is mappable to external identifiers; the ability to add queryable attributes to the IDR; the ability to merge data from multiple queries; and suitable control over user access and de-identification of results. We implemented patient lists in a custom IDR of our own design. We reviewed capabilities of other published IDRs for focusing on sets of patients.

Variation in nurses' attitudes to risk has been identified as a possible explanatory factor. This study was undertaken to explore the effect of nurses' attitudes to risk on the decisions they make when using CDSS. The setting was NHS 24 which is a nationwide telephone assessment service in Scotland in which nurses assess health problems, mainly on behalf of out-of-hours general practice, and triage calls to self care, a service at a later date, or immediate contact with a service.   METHODS All NHS 24 nurses were asked to complete a questionnaire about their background and attitudes to risk. Routine data on the decisions made by these nurses was obtained for a six month period in 2005. Multilevel modelling was used to measure the effect of nurses' risk attitudes on the proportion of calls they sent to self care rather than to services.   RESULTS The response rate to the questionnaire was 57% (265/464). 231,112 calls were matched to 211 of these nurses. 16% (36,342/231,112) of calls were sent to self care, varying three fold between the top and bottom deciles of nurses. Fifteen risk attitude variables were tested, including items on attitudes to risk in clinical decision-making. Attitudes to risk varied greatly between nurses, for example 27% (71/262) of nurses strongly agreed that an NHS 24 nurse """"must not take any risks with physical illness"""" while 17% (45/262) disagreed. After case-mix adjustment, there was some evidence that nurses' attitudes to risk affected decisions but this was inconsistent and unconvincing.   CONCLUSION Much of the variation in decision-making by nurses using CDSS remained unexplained. There was no convincing evidence that nurses' attitudes to risk affected the decisions made. This may have been due to the limitations of the instrument used to measure risk attitude."""	age of empires ii: the conquerors;attitude;clinical decision support system;decision making;digital history;josamycin;manuscripts;nance-horan syndrome;risk aversion;self-care interventions;triage;citation;explanation;general practice (field);interest	Alicia O'Cathain;James B.

Nine surgical teams (34 trainees) participated in a pre-training simulation, followed by an interactive workshop on briefing and checklists, and then a post-training simulation. Both technical and non-technical skills were assessed via observation during simulations by expert trainers who provided feedback on performances at the end of simulation. Trainees also reported their attitudes to briefings and evaluated the training. Pre-training attitudes to briefing were positive, some of which improved post-training and trainees’ evaluation of the training was positive. Surgeons’ technical skill improved significantly post-training, but their decision-making skill was rated lower than other non-technical skills, compared to other trainees. The training did not appear to greatly improve non-technical skill performance. Training surgical teams in simulation is feasible but much more work is needed on measurement development and training strategy to confirm its efficacy and utility.	performance;simulation;virtual reality	Maria Koutantji;Peter McCulloch;Shabnam Undre;Sanjay Gautama;Simon Cunniffe;Nick Sevdalis;Rachel Davis;Piers Thomas;Charles Vincent;Ara Darzi	2007	Cognition, Technology & Work	10.1007/s10111-007-0089-5	simulation;medicine;knowledge management;operations research;mechanical engineering	Robotics	-56.336043693740045	-55.29523467282403	99107

Since most knowledge workers operate in digital work environments, there is a need to elaborate the study of work ergonomics particularly with respect to information ergonomics in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). The paper introduces the concept of information ergonomics (IE) and operationalizes it by specifying measures to use in studying knowledge work in the field. The empirical data were gathered from 35 participants, including application log data of PC use and heart rate variability data. Based on the empirical findings, the paper also reflects theoretical propositions for the development of IE research. The study contributes to the methodological development of IE research by operationalizing and validating measurement of IE and presents a practical assessment method.	categorization;computer multitasking;digital environment;experience;heart rate variability;human factors and ergonomics;human–computer interaction	Jussi Okkonen;Tomi Heimonen;Laura Bordi	2017		10.1145/3131085.3131093	organizational ergonomics;human factors and ergonomics;cognitive ergonomics;operationalization;knowledge management;cognition;engineering	HCI	-62.33771922404552	-52.607085799296414	99280

6f0d97547cac0dd8075fffd192bd02fde2a36bbc	improving healthcare team collaboration in hospital transfers through cloud-based mobile systems		It is a clinical fact that better patient flow management in and between hospitals improves quality of care, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. As the number of patients in hospitals constantly grows, the need for hospital transfers is directly affected. Interhospital transfers can be required for several reasons but they are most commonly made when the diagnostic and therapeutic facilities required for a patient are not available locally. Transferring a critical patient between hospitals is commonly associated with risk of death and complications. This raises the question: How can we improve healthcare team collaboration in hospital transfers through the use of emerging information technology and communication services? This paper presents a cloud-based mobile system for supporting team collaboration and decision-making in the transportation of patients in critical condition. The Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) scale was used as an outcome variable, being a useful scale to assess the risk profile of critical patients requiring transfers between hospitals. This helps medical staff to adopt proper risk-prevention measures when handling a transfer and to react on time if any complications arise in transit.		H. Andrés Neyem;Marie J.

This paper seeks to identify the impact of admission and discharge timing on hospital occupancy with reference to the peak in daily admissions and discharges. Patient admissions data from 23 Queensland public hospitals was classified into categories based on the relative timing of daily admission and discharge curves. We found statistically significant differences in mean and peak occupancy and patient length of stay between categories (one-way univariate ANOVA p<0.0001). The results support early patient discharge initiatives to reduce hospital occupancy rates.	bedwetting;body fluid discharge;categories;classification;discharger;hospital admission;hospitals, public;one-way function;patients	Sankalp Khanna;Justin Boyle;Norm Good;James Lind	2011	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-791-8-82	intensive care medicine;medicine;operations management;medical emergency	HCI	-61.13382077429094	-65.97435623609543	99754

7fd1a2c152f92315318b9816a1bc1f7cbfb8c9af	an iot-aware architecture for collecting and managing data related to elderly behavior		The world population will be made up of a growing number of elderly people in the near future. Aged people are characterized by some physical and cognitive diseases, likemild cognitive impairment (MCI) and frailty, that, if not timely diagnosed, could turn into more severe diseases, like Alzheimer disease, thus implying high costs for treatments and cares. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) can be adopted to create frameworks for monitoring elderly behavior which, alongside normal clinical procedures, can help geriatricians to early detect behavioral changes related to such pathologies and to provide customized interventions. As part of the City4Age project, this work describes a novel approach for collecting and managing data about elderly behavior during their normal activities.Thedata capturing layer is an unobtrusive and low-cost sensing infrastructure abstracting the heterogeneity of physical devices, while the data management layer easily manages the huge quantity of sensed data, giving them semantic meaning and fostering data shareability. This work provides a functional validation of the proposed architecture and introduces how the data it manages can be used by the whole City4Age platform to early identify risks related to MCI/frailty and promptly intervene.

Within this framework we focused on spatio-structural representation of anatomical entities related to craniofacial development and malformation, such as craniosynostosis and midface hypoplasia. Animal models are used to support human studies and so we built multi-species ontologies that would allow for cross-species correlation of anatomical information. For this purpose we first developed and enhanced the craniofacial component of the human musculoskeletal system in the Foundational Model of Anatomy Ontology (FMA)[2], and then imported this component, which we call the Craniofacial Human Ontology (CHO), into the OCDM. The CHO was then used as a template to create the anatomy for the mouse, the Craniofacial Mouse Ontology (CMO) as well as for the zebrafish, the Craniofacial Zebrafish Ontology (CZO).	anatomic structures;animal model;cns disorder;chronic multifocal osteomyelitis;clinical use template;congenital abnormality;craniofacial abnormalities;craniosynostosis;entity;foundational model of anatomy ontology;mii;musculoskeletal system;numerous;ontology (information science);organizing (structure);phenotype;pulmonary hypoplasia;web ontology language	José L.

However, current research on the design and use of the EMR primarily focuses on clinical users such as physicians and nurses. While it is important to understand EMR use by clinicians, there is also a need to understand how non-clinicians use these systems because of the important role they play in the patient-care process. In this note, we present results of an ethnographic field study on the use and perceptions of EMR systems by non-clinicians in an emergency department. We then discuss design implications that can improve the system usability and strengthen the empowerment of these non-clinicians.	excalibur: morgana's revenge;field research;usability	Alison R.

377eea1bcb928088a0de454ed9d12223b0461421	investigating the relationship between believability and presence during a collaborative cognitive task with a socially interactive robot		The use of socially interactive robots in peopleu0027s homes and workplaces will continue to grow. To test such systems before deployment, most human-robot interaction experiments are usually conducted in a research laboratory or require the physical presence of the robot. These experiments are usually time-consuming, costly, and, in most cases, require an experimenter to be present. To address this problem, we have developed a web-based research platform in which participants can remotely interact with a socially interactive robot shown via video based on a behavior profile programmed via a Wizard-of-Oz framework. To help us validate the believability when using this platform, we compared participantu0027s responses to a physical presence robot with that to a remote presence robot during a problem-solving scenario. Participants were asked to complete a series of cognitive tasks with the help of the robot. We analyzed participantu0027s tendency to take the robotu0027s advice, their feelings before and after the experiment, and a quantitative assessment about believability. The experimental results indicate that there was a high degree of agreement between participantsu0027 behaviors in the two conditions and only minor changes in feelings before and after the experiment. The survey responses found no significant difference in their overall rating for believability, suggesting the equivalency of believability between the two conditions.	advice (programming);experiment;human–robot interaction;interactivity;problem solving;robot;software deployment;web application	Jin Xu;Ayanna M.

ICPC has been shown to have reliability in coding internationally. ICPC is too small to be useful for clinical care, and ICD-10 too complex. ENCODEFMC)[1] was especially designed to record diagnoses and reasons for encounter at the point of service in primary care electronic records. It maps to ICPC and ICD-10 for data aggregation. It is the Ministry of Health of Ontario standard for use in the Community Health Centres in the province, and was developed for use in the College of Family Physicians of Canada national database. Although the specific term chosen is important to the clinician who chooses it, reliability of CLASSIFICATION is critical if the electronic record is going to be able to give accurate information about patterns and trends in health care. In this study, ENCODE-FM was tested to detennine the reliability of ICPC classification of clinical reasons for encounter. Reliability of ICD-10 will be a future analysis. METHODS One hundred randomly selected encounter forms from our family practice teaching unit listed 106 health problems. A sample of 5 physicians each coded all terms to ENCODE (automatically giving them ICPC and ICD10 maps); indicated if the ENCODE term was clinically useful; and stated the acceptability of the match between the encounter form term and the ENCODE term.	acm international collegiate programming contest	Robert M.

Mini-Shogi is a Japanese chess-like game that uses a small board. In our cognitive experiment, the group of stronger Mini-Shogi players the stronger group’s total thinking time shortened and their total number of eye movements decreased. However, our investigation of search depth revealed different results from those of past research. The results of our fMRI experiment revealed that after learning, activity in the caudate nucleus increased among stronger players. The results of our experiments suggested that intuitive ability and the capacity for careful consideration are not independent.	cognition;experiment	Takeshi Ito;Daisuke Takano;Xiaohong Wan;Keiji Tanaka	2012			cognitive psychology;brain activity and meditation;cognitive science;psychology;japanese chess;chunking (psychology);brain mapping;memorization;functional magnetic resonance imaging;eye movement;cognition	AI	-50.45921502419315	-53.138249184941586	101066

However, few studies have measured the direct medical benefit of those reminders, especially for low-literate populations in the developing world. This paper describes the use of automated voice calls to promote adherence to iron supplements among pregnant women in urban India. Unlike prior studies, we assess impact via a direct measurement of hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the blood. We enrolled 130 pregnant women from a low-income area of Mumbai, India and randomly assigned them to control and treatment groups. Both groups received a counseling session and a free supply of medication. The treatment group also received short audio messages, three times per week for a period of three months, encouraging them to take iron supplements. Results suggest that automated calls positively impacted Hb levels. However, because we could only recover 79 women for follow-up, and the effect size was small, our results lack statistical power (average change in Hb = 0.43 g/dL, 95% CI = -0.13 0.98 g/dL, p=0.13). We conclude that automated calls deserve further consideration for reducing maternal anemia, and we share our lessons learned for the benefit of future interventions.	mobile phone;population;randomness	Niranjan Pai;Pradnya Supe;Shailesh Kore;Y.

Recent research tries to adapt service oriented concepts to the field of medical devices in order to achieve an easier and better integration. However, no generalized framework for this kind of integration exists. The purpose of this paper is to identify the characteristics (the nature) of medical device services. The results were achieved by conducting a multiple-case study with three cases on two university hospitals. As a result, we identified twelve specific integration issues of medical devices and deduced eight characteristics. This paper contributes to the design of a generalized framework for the service oriented integration of medical devices. The identified characteristics can be interpreted as requirements to such a framework.	best practice;design pattern;requirement;service-oriented architecture	Christian Mauro;Helmut Krcmar;Jan Marco Leimeister	2011			computer science;emergency medicine;biological engineering;medical emergency	HCI	-55.67300290350189	-61.61419664608754	101558

The objective of this study was to assess unintended errors related to technologies in the medication use process.   METHODS Medication incidents reported from 2006 to 2010 in a main tertiary care hospital were analysed by a pharmacist and technology-related errors were identified. Technology-related errors were further classified as socio-technical errors and device errors. This analysis was conducted using data from medication incident reports which may represent only a small proportion of medication errors that actually takes place in a hospital. Hence, interpretation of results must be tentative.   RESULTS 1538 medication incidents were reported. 17.1% of all incidents were technology-related, of which only 1.9% were device errors, whereas most were socio-technical errors (98.1%). Of these, 61.2% were linked to computerised prescription order entry, 23.2% to bar-coded patient identification labels, 7.2% to infusion pumps, 6.8% to computer-aided dispensing label generation and 1.5% to other technologies. The immediate causes for technology-related errors included, poor interface between user and computer (68.1%), improper procedures or rule violations (22.1%), poor interface between user and infusion pump (4.9%), technical defects (1.9%) and others (3.0%). In 11.4% of the technology-related incidents, the error was detected after the drug had been administered.   CONCLUSIONS A considerable proportion of all incidents were technology-related. Most errors were due to socio-technical issues. Unintended and unanticipated errors may happen when using technologies. Therefore, when using technologies, system improvement, awareness, training and monitoring are needed to minimise medication errors.	classification;dispense;inborn errors of metabolism;infusion pump;interface device component;order management system;simpson's rule;sociotechnical system;tertiary care centers;tertiary healthcare;pump (device)	N.

6ed2c78d7ba1d15eda0d6e9ad6bfb614770fdcbd	supporting situation awareness of dementia patients in outdoor environments		Engagement in cognitively stimulating activities is today among the most effective measures against the decline of cognitive abilities due to dementing disorders. Outdoor and social activities are cognitively demanding and provide emotional support at the same time. Alzheimer's disease as the most frequent cause of the dementia syndrome, however, early effects skills for spatial orientation while it simultaneously impedes planning and error compensation abilities. These abilities are necessary to overcome disorientation in unfamiliar environments. People with dementia progressively limit their life-space and diversity of activities in reaction to growing security concerns. It is desirable to provide appropriate guidance in disoriented situations to avoid dangers, while not, in addition, complicating normal mobility in order to maintain a person's life-space, activity spectrum and cognitive health. Such guidance system has to be situation-aware and adaptive. Consequently, the mobility behavior of a patient must be modeled. In addition, the system must be able to learn and detect states of disorientation. In this paper we describe a pilot study to collect mobility data from dementia patients. Furthermore, we examine the collected data's quality and investigate how to detect states of disorientation within the data.	cognition;guidance system	Philipp Koldrack;Ron Henkel;Frank Krüger;Stefan J.

METHODS To compare the characteristics of clinicians who did and did not use novel EHR functionality, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the intervention arm of a randomized trial of new EHR-based tobacco treatment functionality.   RESULTS The novel functionality was used by 103 of 207 (50%) clinicians. Staff physicians were more likely than trainees to use the functionality (64% vs 37%; p<0.001). Clinicians who graduated more than 10 years previously were more likely to use the functionality than those who graduated less than 10 years previously (64% vs 42%; p<0.01). Clinicians with higher patient volumes were more likely to use the functionality (lowest quartile of number of patient visits, 25%; 2nd quartile, 38%; 3rd quartile, 65%; highest quartile, 71%; p<0.001). Clinicians who saw patients with more documented problems were more likely to use the functionality (lowest tertile of documented patient problems, 38%; 2nd tertile, 58%; highest tertile, 54%; p=0.04). In multivariable modeling, independent predictors of use were the number of patient visits (OR 1.2 per 100 additional patients; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) and number of documented problems (OR 2.9 per average additional problem; 95% CI 1.4 to 6.1).   CONCLUSIONS Contrary to conventional wisdom, clinically busier physicians seeing patients with more documented problems were more likely to use novel EHR functionality.	document completion status - documented;electronic health records;patient visit;patients;primary health care;randomized algorithm;surround sound;windows 95	Jeffrey A.

f718b7d0ddd7c70083f414b5a4de8a876f53e185	efficient norm emergence through experiential dynamic punishment		Peer punishment has been an effective means to ensure that norms are complied with in a population of self-interested agents. However, current approaches to establishing norms have only considered static punishments, which do not vary with the magnitude or frequency of norm violation. Such static punishments are difficult to apply because it is difficult to identify an appropriate fixed penalty: one that is not too weak to disincentivise norm violations and not too strong to lead to significant deleterious effects on the system as a whole (such as those incurred by losing the benefits of a member of the population). This paper addresses this concern by developing an adaptive punishment technique that tailors penalty to norm violation. An experimental evaluation of the approach demonstrates its value compared to static punishment. In particular, the results show that our dynamic punishment technique is capable of achieving norm emergence, even when starting with an amount of punishment that is too low to achieve emergence in the traditional static approach.	emergence;experiment;interaction;peer-to-peer;simulation	Samhar Mahmoud;Nathan Griffiths;Jeroen Keppens;Michael Luck	2012		10.3233/978-1-61499-098-7-576	psychology;developmental psychology;psychotherapist;social psychology	AI	-52.18506187699927	-56.380660998946574	102109

This paper introduces DEA as a tool to profile and evaluate practice patterns of primary care physicians. To illustrate these ideas, the practice behavior of 326 primary care physicians in a large Health Maintenance Organization were studied for one year. When two DEA models were compared, a cone ratio DEA model projected the excess utilization of more hospital days and fewer office visits than a DEA model without defined preferred practice regions. The application demonstrates how a cone ratio DEA model can incorporate strategic thinking and executive accountability when establishing clinical benchmarks.		Jon A. Chilingerian;H.

However, patients are often under-informed about even basic aspects of their care. In this work, we hypothesize that mobile devices - which are increasingly available to patients - can be used as real-time information conduits to improve patient awareness and consequently improve patient care. To better understand the unique affordances that mobile devices offer in the hospital setting, we provided twenty-five patients with mobile phones that presented a dynamic, interactive report on their progress, care plan, and care team throughout their emergency department stay. Through interviews with these patients, their visitors, and hospital staff, we explore the benefits and challenges of using the mobile phone as an information display, finding overall that this is a promising approach to improving patient awareness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that only a small number of technology challenges remain before such a system could be deployed without researcher intervention.	astah*;display device;mobile device;mobile phone;real-time computing;real-time data	Laura Pfeifer Vardoulakis;Amy K.

The extent to which hospitals experience unintended consequences of CPOE, which include more than errors, has not been quantified in prior research.   OBJECTIVE To discover the extent and importance of unintended adverse consequences related to CPOE implementation in U.S. hospitals.   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Building on a prior qualitative study involving fieldwork at five hospitals, we developed and then administered a telephone survey concerning the extent and importance of CPOE-related unintended adverse consequences to representatives from 176 hospitals in the U.S. that have CPOE.   MEASUREMENTS Self report by key informants of the extent and level of importance to the overall function of the hospital of eight types of unintended adverse consequences experienced by sites with inpatient CPOE. RESULTS We found that hospitals experienced all eight types of unintended adverse consequences, although respondents identified several they considered more important than others. Those related to new work/more work, workflow, system demands, communication, emotions, and dependence on the technology were ranked as most severe, with at least 72% of respondents ranking them as moderately to very important. Hospital representatives are less sure about shifts in the power structure and CPOE as a new source of errors. There is no relation between kinds of unintended consequences and number of years CPOE has been used. Despite the relatively short length of time most hospitals have had CPOE (median five years), it is highly infused, or embedded, within work practice at most of these sites.   CONCLUSIONS The unintended consequences of CPOE are widespread and important to those knowledgeable about CPOE in hospitals. They can be positive, negative, or both, depending on one's perspective, and they continue to exist over the duration of use. Aggressive detection and management of adverse unintended consequences is vital for CPOE success.	cns disorder;computerized physician order entry system;embedded system;field research;medical records systems, computerized;moderate response;objective-c;order management system;quality of health care;unintended consequences;inpatient	Joan S.

In the last couple of years, several Grid projects have been funded on health related issues at national and European levels. A crucial issue is to maximize their cross fertilization in the context of an environment where data of medical interest can be stored and made easily available to the different actors in health care, physicians, health care centres and administrations, and of course the citizens. The Healthgrid initiative, represented by the Healthgrid association, was initiated to bring the necessary long term continuity, to reinforce and promote awareness of the possibilities and advantages linked to the deployment of Grid technologies in health. Technologies to address the specific requirements for medical applications are under development. Results from the DataGrid and other projects are given as examples of early applications.	egi;generalized environmental modeling system for surfacewaters;requirement;scott continuity;software deployment	Vincent Breton;Tony Solomonides;Richard McClatchey	2004	IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid, 2004.

7446f2cd8ae4538eb12e9ff13690776cc2440b30	resolving conflicting privacy policies in m-health based on prioritization		Mobile health has recently gained a lot of attention. Biological, environmental and behavioral data collected from mobile devices can be analyzed and transmitted directly to the person, family or health professionals for immediate and individualized care. However, due to multiplicity of mobile applications and the heterogeneity of actors involved in patient’s care, conflicts among the privacy policies defined by the different actors can take place. Thus, we present in this paper an approach to resolve the problem of conflicting privacy policies in e-health/m-health environments using AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) prioritization technique. Conflicts detection and resolution are facilitated by the adoption of S4P formal privacy policy language used as a standardized language. Finally, a case study is suggested to illustrate how our solution can be applied to resolve such conflicts.	adobe flash player;cloud computing;formal language;formal verification;image resolution;mhealth;mobile app;mobile device;privacy policy;touchstone file;verification and validation	Souad Sadki;Hanan El Bakkali	2016	Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience		privacy by design;knowledge management;political science;data mining;management science	SE	-61.021358360457796	-57.11963212906052	103216
10da87a6ae8e6b481804e443e26f4d67de601baa	an approach towards information quality management of electronic health records		Electronic Health Records (EHR) management systems, have gained attention in many countries as public organizations working in health domain (such as hospitals and municipalities) use them to lift the quality of health care. EHRs are considered as the basis for establishing Health Information Service (HIS) systems. In spite of remarkable advantages of EHRs, the lack of quality metrics can reduce the efficiency of high level systems that are based on them. Particularly, it is smart to design a mechanism to assure the quality of data generated by sensors. In this paper, we propose an architecture in which EHRs are enriched with metadata to provide the information quality. Our architecture emphasizes on the quality of EHRs since we believe that the quality aspect of health records has not been contemplated in many commercial systems. We utilize some quality dimensions to produce the total quality metric. Moreover, we show that this architecture can provide quality-based systems with more appropriate inputs.	central processing unit;centralized computing;computation;high-level programming language;informatics;information quality;ontology (information science);relational database;semantic web;sensor;server (computing);smartphone;surround sound	Mohammad Mahdi Mahdavi Amjad;Kamyar Rasta;Martin Gerdes;Rune Werner Fensli	2014		10.5220/0004752402700275	architecture;information quality;total quality management;computer science;data mining;management system;quality policy;information quality management;spite;data quality	AI	-55.87611856581541	-61.85253916513719	103265

The use of persuasive technologies is one way to prevent or reduce this stress. The present study developed a mood tracking application and tested its effect on stress reduction of employees. Twenty-six employees of a petrochemical company were divided into equally-sized groups of married and single participants. Employeesu0027 accommodations are different based on their marital status. Other variables effecting stress were same for both groups. An OSI-R questionnaire was used to collect data before and after four weeks of application use. In present pilot study, data analysis shows that this kind of persuasive technology can have a significant positive effect on single employees and help them to decrease and manage their stress; however, no meaningful results were recorded for the married group because they did not use the application as much as participants in the single group.	persuasive technology	Sanaz Alavian Ghavanini;Elaheh Homayounvala;Ali Rezaeian	2018	IJMLO	10.1504/IJMLO.2018.10010749	self-monitoring;knowledge management;mood;occupational stress;job performance;computer science;applied psychology;stress management;marital status;persuasive technology	HCI	-59.18539366369323	-53.370898563443575	103796

Specialized registries can facilitate public health surveillance, however only 4% of hospitals in the United States actively engage in electronic reporting to these registries. We leveraged electronic claims and clinical data from a health information exchange to create a statewide TBI/SCI/Stroke registry to facilitate the study of long-term outcomes and health services utilization. The registry contains 109,943 TBI patients, 9,027 SCI patients and 117,084 stroke patients with a mean of 3 years of follow-up data after injury. Additionally, the registry contains data on individual patient encounters, prescriptions and clinical variables. The high-dimensional data with large sample sizes may present a valuable informatics resource for injury research as well as public health surveillance.	brain injuries;cerebrovascular accident;health information exchange;health information systems;hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy;informatics (discipline);instruction unit;medicine, east asian traditional;patients;public health surveillance;registries;sample size;spinal cord injuries;spinal cord neoplasms;traumatic brain injury	Saurabh Rahurkar;Timothy D.

bda2dd0acaaf08c6fd2fde990b3b614e4146162a	evaluating acceptance and user experience of a guideline-based clinical decision support system execution platform		This study aims to determine what the initial disposition of physicians towards the use of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) based on Computerised Clinical Guidelines and Protocols (CCGP) is; and whether their prolonged utilisation has a positive effect on their intention to adopt them in the future. For a period of 3 months, 8 volunteer paediatricians monitored each up to 10 asthmatic patients using two CCGPs deployed in thee-GuidesMed CDSS. A Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire was supplied to them before and after using the system. Results from both questionnaires are analysed searching for significant improvements in opinion between them. An additional survey was performed to analyse the usability of the system. It was found that initial disposition of physicians towards e-Guidesmed is good. Improvement between the pre and post iterationsof the TAM questionnaire has been found to be statistically significant. Nonetheless, slightly lower values in the Compatibility and Habit variables show that participants perceive possible difficulties to integrate e-GuidesMed into their daily routine. The variable Facilitators shows the highest correlation with the Intention to Use. Usabilityof the system has also been rated very high and, in this regard, no fundamental flaw has been detected. Initial views towards e-GuidesMed are positive, and become reinforced after continued utilisation of the system. In order to achieve an effective implementation, it becomes essential to facilitate conditions to integrate the system intothe physician’s daily routine.	asthma;cns disorder;clinical decision support system;contain (action);data assimilation;deploy;disposal;financial cost;flaw hypothesis methodology;ibm tivoli access manager;patients;providing (action);usability;user experience	David Buenestado;Javier Elorz;Eduardo G.

The basic tool needed is an episode of care classification. Although hospital care has routinely been registered in computerized databases for decades, primary care has only recently been able to provide comparable patient data in an easily accessible form. We have designed a simple disease category system, which is easy to apply in routine registration in primary care, and which can be used in order to classify episodes of care. We have tested the feasibility of the approach by analysing one year of data in a data warehouse covering all health service utilization by citizens in the city of Helsinki, a total of over 4 million encounters. Results displayed, representing a small number of reports produced, include the treatment costs and volumes of the care episodes as classified in disease categories across health districts, and detailed analysis of ‘gross consumers’ (patients with an annual treatment cost in excess of EUR 20,000), and patients treated in hospitals or long-term institutions.	database;offset binary;population;seamless3d	Outi Elonheimo;Miika Linna;Mats Brommels	2003	Health Informatics Journal	10.1177/1460458203009002005	point of care;medicine;computer science;nursing;data warehouse;data mining;emergency medicine;ambulatory care;medical emergency	ML	-56.41253943554408	-62.95878666342108	104338

However, more attention should be given to the manner in which user movements are recognized and categorized. This paper aims to evaluate the efficacy of using a clinically-related gesture recognition tool, based on the international biomechanical standards (ISB) for the reporting of human joint motion, for the development of an interactive augmented reality (AR) rehabilitation system -mirrARbilitation.   METHODS This work presents an AR rehabilitation system based on ISB standards, which enables the system to interact and to be configured according to therapeutic needs. The Kinect(TM) skeleton tracking technology was exploited and a new movement recognition method was developed to recognize and classify biomechanical movements. Further, our mirrARbilitation system provides exercise instructions while simultaneously motivating the patient. The system was evaluated on a cohort of 33 patients, physiotherapists, and software developers when performing shoulder abduction therapy exercises. Tests were performed in three moments: (i) users performed the exercise until they feel tired without the help of the system, (ii) the same however using the mirrARbilitation for motivation and guidance, and (iii) users performed the exercise again without the system. Users performing the movement without the help of the system worked as baseline reference.   RESULTS We demonstrated that the percentage of correct exercises, measured by the movement analysis method we developed, improved from 69.02% to 93.73% when users interacted with the mirrARbilitation. The number of exercise repetitions also improved from 34.06 to 66.09 signifying that our system increased motivation of the users. The system also prevented the users from performing the exercises in a completely wrong manner. Finally, with the help of our system the users' worst result was performing 73.68% of the rehabilitation movements correctly. Besides the engagement, these results suggest that the use of biomechanical standards to recognize movements is valuable in guiding users during rehabilitation exercises.   CONCLUSION The proposed system proved to be efficient by improving the user engagement and exercise performance outcomes. The results also suggest that the use of biomechanical standards to recognize movements is valuable in guiding users during rehabilitation exercises.	augmented reality;baseline (configuration management);categorization;gesture recognition;kinect;movement;patients;perseveration;physical therapy exercises;software developer;standards characteristics	Alana Da Gama;Thiago Menezes Chaves;Lucas Silva Figueiredo;Adriana Baltar;Meng Ma;Nassir Navab;Veronica Teichrieb;Pascal Fallavollita	2016	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.07.014	augmented reality;interaction;simulation;computer science;biomechanics;multimedia	HCI	-49.67165127670193	-54.78902640308533	104799

1caee19118e7b335772cdaba99de500a2af4c0a9	moving towards a comprehensive medication dispensing service for patients in transition from hospital to primary care		In primary health care it is often challenging to obtain a supply of drugs when a patient is discharged to their home or to a nursing institution. Both access to updated information about the (new) medication, and the practical organization per se, present obstacles. The need for early information in the receiving units is in conflict with the hospitals` need to make decisions regarding treatment up until the point of discharge. The practical handling is affected by e.g. distance to the local pharmacy and the accessibility of certified health care workers. We aim to design and implement a medication dispensing service to ensure that the patients who are discharged to primary health care (home care services or nursing homes) are supplied with medication in the transition period, until regular supply is (re)established. In this paper we describe the complexity of the area, impacting factors to be considered and outline a stepwise approach to design a comprehensive service for enhanced patient safety.	accessibility;discharger;stepwise regression	Liv Johanne Wekre;Ingvild Klevan;Tor Åm	2015			family medicine;emergency medicine;medicine	HCI	-58.750874578863055	-63.821191850271774	105588

We investigate how children balance the quality of informants’ knowledge with the number of endorsements when deciding which of two boxes contains the better option. When group numbers are equal, children choose boxes endorsed by informants with visual access over informants with hearsay (Experiment 1), but are at chance when group size conflicts with quality of knowledge (Experiments 2 and 3). This suggests that children tend to conform to a majority opinion, compared to adults (Experiment 4) and a normative computational model. These studies suggest that preschoolers consider the testimony of multiple informants and evaluate their knowledge sources, but may assume that informants are more individually informative than they are.	computation;computational model;experiment;information	Jane C.

We followed up patients undergoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease telemonitoring for 4 months. We studied changes in the telemonitored data in the week prior to admission or to community chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. A total of 183 patients were studied. In all, 30 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-related hospital admissions and 68 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease community exacerbations were recorded. Changes in telehealth parameters occurred in 80 per cent (24/30) of admissions and 82 per cent (56/68) of community exacerbations. Although changes in telehealth data occurred in the majority of exacerbations, most individual symptoms was present in less than half the exacerbations and almost 20 per cent of exacerbations were not preceded by any change in telemonitoring data. Cough created significantly more alerts by those treated in the community (p = 0.008), whereas a drop in oxygen saturation created significantly more alerts pre-hospitalisation (p = 0.049). We conclude that further work is required to develop methods of identifying impending chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with greater sensitivity and specificity.	chronic obstructive airway disease;conflict (psychology);coughing;early diagnosis;eighty;hospital admission;hospitalization;how true feel alert right now;lung diseases, obstructive;lung diseases;machine learning;oxygen saturation test result;patients;prospective search;sensitivity and specificity;steroids;telemedicine;algorithm;interest	Ghassan A.

However, information foraging environments may differ in key ways from food foraging environments, and these differences may impact search behavior. We investigated the effect of patch distribution (depleting or non-depleting) and ability to return to previously searched patches on participants’ decision to switch from one patch to another while searching. Whether or not a participant could return after leaving a patch led to fewer samples and fewer relevant items found. Whether or not the patches depleted and whether it was possible to return to a patch influenced stopping rules, indicating that these factors may alter the size of the increment applied through the Incremental Rule.	information foraging	Amber Bloomfield;J.

However, the quality of monitored clinical data may vary due to performance variations of technological resources inside a deployed telemedicine system. This paper discusses models to compute quality of clinical data affected by quality of service provided by technological resources along the data processing and delivery chain between the point of monitoring and point of decision. We discuss prospective effects of quality of clinical data degradation on outpatient treatment with medical practitioners, and implement these effects in the clinical decision-making process during design time. Consequently, the designed telemedicine system is technological context and quality-aware and preserves patient's safety and treatment efficacy.	computational model;data degradation;elegant degradation;prospective search;quality of service	Nekane Larburu;Richard Bults;Ing Widya;Hermie Hermens	2014	2014 IEEE 16th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom)	10.1109/HealthCom.2014.7001870	medicine;data mining;management science;biological engineering	Visualization	-61.80382881394665	-61.52826934992836	106699
fb12e34c3a178ebbe7b398503fa7bb7d73550d04	investigating design implications towards a social robot as a memory trainer		Most currently existing tools for cognitive memory therapy require physical interaction or at least the presence of another person. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether a social robot might be an acceptable solution for a more inclusive therapy for people with memory disorder and severe physical limitations. Applying a user-centered design approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five healthcare professionals; four medical doctors and a psychologist, in three iterations followed by a focus group activity. An analysis of the collected data suggests several implications for design with an emphasis on embodiment, social skills, interaction, and memory training exercises.	focus group;human–computer interaction;iteration;semiconductor industry;social robot;user-centered design	Linda Hirsch;Anton Björsell;Mikael Laaksoharju;Mohammad Obaid	2017		10.1145/3125739.3125755	social psychology;focus group;social robot;simulation;memory disorder;social skills;health care;trainer;user-centered design;cognition;psychology	HCI	-57.137893963111985	-52.82559826010982	106768

The framework describes how informational asymmetries in combination with rational, motivational and heuristic factors explain human reliance behavior. To test hypotheses derived from the framework, 79 participants performed an uncertain pattern learning and prediction task. They received advice from a decision aid either before or after they expressed their own prediction, and received feedback about performance. When their prediction conflicted with that of the decision aid, participants had to choose to rely on their own prediction or on that of the decision aid. We measured reliance behavior, perceived and actual reliability of self and decision aid, responsibility felt for task outcomes, understandability of one’s own reasoning and of the decision aid, and attribution of errors. We found evidence that 1) reliance decisions are based on relative trust, but only when advice is presented after people have formed their own prediction; 2) when people rely as much on themselves as on the decision aid, they still perceive the decision aid to be more reliable than themselves; 3) the less people perceive the decision aid’s reasoning to be cognitively available and understandable, the less people rely on the decision aid; 4) the more people feel responsible for the task outcome, the more they rely on the decision aid; 5) when feedback about performance is provided, people underestimate both one’s own reliability and that of the decision aid; 6) underestimation of the reliability of the decision aid is more prevalent and more persistent than underestimation of one’s own reliability; 7) unreliability of the decision aid is less attributed to temporary and uncontrollable (but not external) causes than one’s own unreliability. These seven findings are potentially applicable for the improved design of decision aids and training procedures.	heuristic	Kees van Dongen;Peter-Paul van Maanen	2013	Int. J. Hum.-Comput.

METHOD Nurses have an obligation to support and ensure continuity of patient care and to prevent an information gap when patients are transferred from one organizational of health care delivery to another organizational level, for example, from hospital to home health care. In an ongoing prospective study, nurses' pre-electronic nursing discharge note and their assessment of the information it was necessary to exchange at the same time was audited and analyzed. The results show variation in the completeness and content of the nursing discharge note. Nurses' understanding of the scope and content of information to be transmitted varies widely according to the context and the organizational health care level they work within. The implementation of an electronic nursing discharge note creates the opportunity to identify the accurate information elements that must be documented and exchanged between the nurses to ensure patient safety and inter-organizational continuity of care.	accessibility;delivery of health care;discharger;home care services;home health care specialty;information needs;note (document);patients;prospective search;scott continuity;benefit;disease transmission	Ragnhild Hellesø;Margarethe Lorensen;Lena Sorensen	2004	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2004.04.009	prospective cohort study;family medicine;self care;medicine;self-information;nursing;district nurse;emergency medicine;ambulatory care;critical care nursing;health care;statistics;primary nursing	HCI	-59.158609287906145	-63.07176971002632	106831
1dc044dc5d1406ff437e4507996299ed66ee23f7	a qualitative framework to assess hospital / medical websites	quality metrics;medical service;medical hospital websites	Nowadays, there are many peoples who access to the internet to search for a proper hospital with their desired medical services. Hence, the website quality of hospitals or medical centers is very important to help patients/users. However, to design high qualitative medical websites, we should first know the medical quality metrics. Then, we should try to find a way to assess different medical websites based on the quality metrics. In fact, medical websites may have a significant role to increase the society’s knowledge about people health, provided services for patients etc. Thus, it is necessary to design a framework to evaluate the quality of these websites. Even though there are many medical websites, unfortunately, there are a few studies about quality analysis of medical/hospital websites. In this paper, we propose a qualitative framework to assess different medical websites. The proposed framework consists of 7 main categories, each having different metrics. Finally, to show how these metrics can help designers to assess the websites quality, we have considered 3 different hospitals as case studies. We asked different people including doctors, website designers, and usual peoples to evaluate our defined metrics on each case study. At the end, the results are shown through different charts.	angular defect;categories;categorization;chart;cyberspace;fda quality metrics terminology;partial template specialization;patients;web site;web search engine	Vahid Rafe;Maryam Monfaredzadeh	2011	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-011-9771-5	medicine;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-57.933038316364126	-58.06125955945744	106843

However the majority of these systems do not comply with any standard for codification, storage and transference of medical data, thus making difficult the interchange of data between different health institutions. This paper describes the development of a user-friendly report editor that produces documents compliant to the DICOM Structured Report-DICOM SR-standard. The strategy chosen to develop the editor was to combine a documentation template editor with a report instance editor that allows the use of previously built templates to ease the process of creating reports. The developed template editor helps the user though building report structures by indicating which information items are needed in order to document a particular type of examination and suggesting values for the information items. The report instance editor represents reports in an easily understandable graphical visualization, and allows the user to create and edit structured reports permitting the use of templates as start-points. It also contains mechanisms to let the user set other document's information required to make it compliant to the DICOM SR standard. The editor is integrated into a DICOM server/client environment and can also be used as a client to other DICOM-SR compliant PACS systems. The report editor developed was already presented to the clinical staff of a community hospital in southern Brazil, where it is intended to be installed, used, and evaluated by the medical staff.	dicom;documentation;graphical user interface;picture archiving and communication system;server (computing);usability	Mariana Kessler Bortoluzzi;Aldo von Wangenheim;Kerstin Maximini	2003	16th IEEE Symposium Computer-Based Medical Systems, 2003.

This article poses the question of how the Facebook use as the most popular SNS, may impact cancer survivors’ psychological well-being. To answer this question a comprehensive literature review of studies conducted in information systems and health disciplines has been undertaken and a theoretical model is proposed. This study is expected to contribute to the existing knowledge base through the development of a new theoretical model which introduces and explains the ways that SNS use may impact cancer survivors’ psychological well-being. It provides important information on the health-related SNSs use and is envisioned to assist health care organizations and cancer survivors to use SNS as an e-health application.	information system;knowledge base;online community;social network;theory	Seyedezahra Shadi Erfani;Babak Abedin;Farhad Daneshgar	2013			psychology;public relations;socioeconomics;social psychology	HCI	-62.10783620119901	-59.20366490501326	107423

We present several characteristics of flexible systems that support medical multimedia. We illustrate how these characteristics can be applied within diverse medical research and clinical therapy environments through two in-depth case studies. Within these examples, we describe how specific emerging technologies, including the semantic web and publish and subscribe networking, can enhance the flexibility of medical multimedia architectures.	bioinformatics;database;medical imaging;next-generation network;publish and subscribe (mac os);semantic web	Michael W.

For many older adults, anticipating home modifications and the related effects on their goals and lifestyles presents issues. The health industry seeks to raise compliance rates and successful uptake of recommendations. However, the inability to effectively visually communicate modifications can generate non-compliancy with interventions and safety problems. Augmented reality allows occupational therapists to enhance design communication and empower older clients in a novel manner. This qualitative research explores the industry side of fall prevention and design communication through the experiences of eleven specialist health professionals. Interviews with these experts are conducted and an augmented reality home modification design prototype is presented and evaluated, focusing on service goals and the goals of their older clients. Results show that the health industry welcomes augmented reality; new technologies permit greater person-centeredness by facilitating two-way design communication.	augmented reality;experience;prototype;web design	Michael Lo Bianco;Sonja Pedell;Gianni Renda	2016		10.1145/2996267.2996268	simulation;medicine;physical medicine and rehabilitation;physical therapy	HCI	-59.9154739287514	-57.91890902336902	107868

This study reports initial findings from implementation of the Clinician Report (CR)-a patient and caregiver status report tool accessible by the oncology clinic team.   DESIGN The CR tracks and communicates essential information from cancer patients and caregivers to the oncology team. The CR conveys patient symptoms, emotional strain, and key concerns.   MEASUREMENTS Authors used a model developed to explain acceptance, implementation, and sustainability of Interactive Health Communication Systems (IHCS) to evaluate implementation of the new CR system. The study carried out qualitative analyses of interviews with clinicians regarding their experience utilizing the Clinician Report.   RESULTS Primary CR benefits included enhancement of patients' clinic visit experiences, greater caregiver involvement, and facilitation of earlier interventions. Challenges included CR functional issues, users' desire for greater depth of information, user privacy concerns, and limited patient use. These findings are discussed using parameters of the implementation model. Limitations of this study include its small clinician sample size, which represented only a portion of existing organizational settings in which CR systems might be implemented.   CONCLUSION Though in its early implementation stages, the CR demonstrates the potential to positively impact care delivery in the cancer clinic setting, particularly by facilitating earlier interventions and improving patient-caregiver-clinician communication both during and between clinic visits.	addison disease;cumulative trauma disorders;experience;information exchange;neoplasms;patients;track (course);benefit;facilitation	Lori L.

3cb88948670ecc4937c1b97a6b760f3e85d45bcf	broadband multimedia sensor networks in healthcare applications	sensor network	Since the first special issue on “Telemedicine and Applications” was published in April 2000, advances in broadband network communication technology both wired and wirelesses have expanded telemedicine to a pressing need of high speed networks in medicine and public health care. Recent achievements in these fields have helped to better understanding of computing and communication infrastructure associated with various applications. With appropriately developed advanced infrastructures in network technology the future medicine should provide the increasingly aging world with great benefits for public health care. Such applications are expected to improve future healthcare practices, especially in the areas of telemedicine, sensor network-integrated health care, electronic health records, chronic disease monitoring. It is believed that the wireless broadband network will eventually merge with the wired broadband network to offer both reliability and mobility in the future telemedicine and health care applications. Keeping this goal in mind this special issue is devoted to the theme on “Broadband Multimedia Sensor Networks in Healthcare Applications” in addressing and focusing on the issues of wired and wireless networks in the state-of-art medicine and health care on applications of high speed networks to medicine and healthcare as well as mutual understanding between the network technology and medicine and health care applications. A total of seven papers are selected, each of which is briefly described as follows. The first paper on “International Internet2 Connectivity and Performance in Medical Imaging Applications” by B.J. Liu, Z. Zhou, M.A. Gutierrez, J. Documet, L. Chan and H.K. Huang describes a methodology of connecting international Internet2 among three different internationally linked sites located in University of Southern California in USA, Hong Kong Polytechnic University in Hong Kong and University of Sao Paulo in Brazil respectively. The Internet2, also known as Next Generation Internet (NGI) is an advanced high speed computer network which has been widely used for medical image communication for teleradiology. Its connectivity and security issues were previously investigated via a local site case study in the special issue on Telemedicine and Application, April 2000 (Journal of High Speed Networks, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 3–13, April 2000). This paper further explores the utility of the Internet2 in connecting three international sites with applications in clinical environments. The second paper on “The Role of a Data Grid in Worldwide Imaging-Based Clinical Trials” by Z. Zhou, M. Gutierrez, J. Documet, L. Chan, H.K. Huang and B. Liu develops a data grid architecture for worldwide imaging-based clinical trials where the data testbed for study is set up among three international sites described in the first paper, University of Southern California in USA, Hong Kong Polytechnic University in Hong Kong and University of Sao Paulo in Brazil which are connected by Internet2 via the Hong Kong Academic and Research Network (HARNET) and Brazilian National Research and Education Network (RNP2). The clinical trials considered in this paper are image-based experiments where medical images provide a unique and fast diagnosis with visual assessment. The third paper on “Sensor-Based Pervasive Healthcare System: Design and Implementation” by H.Y. Kung, C.Y. Hsu and M.-H. Lin proposes a Sensor-based Pervasive Healthcare (SPH) system which can effectively reduce health labor cost and provide a streamlined, convenient and low healthcare cost platform for patients and professional medical staff. In order to accomplish its goal, the SPH is developed by integrating three systems, Home Healthcare End (H2E) system, e-healthcare Service Provider (ESP) and e-healthcare Control Center (EC2).

Prior work has investigated improvements on toothbrushing with sensing technologies. But existing toothbrushing support focuses mostly on estimating brushing coverage. Users thus only have indirect information about how well their toothbrushing removes dental plaque. We present LumiO, a toothbrush that offers users continuous feedback on the amount of plaque on teeth. Lumio uses a well-known method for plaque detection, called Quantitative Light-induced Fluorescence (QLF). QLF exploits a red fluorescence property that bacterium in the plaque demonstrates when a blue-violet ray is cast. Blue-violet light excites this fluorescence property, and a camera with an optical filter can capture plaque in pink. We incorporate this technology into an electric toothbrush to achieve improvements in performance on plaque removal in daily dental care. This paper first discusses related work in sensing for oral activities and interaction as well as dental care with technologies. We then describe the principles of QLF, the hardware design of LumiO, and our vision-based plaque detection method. Our evaluations show that the vision-based plaque detection method with three machine learning techniques can achieve F-measures of 0.68 -- 0.92 under user-dependent training. Qualitative evidence also suggests that study participants were able to have improved awareness of plaque and build confidence on their toothbrushing.	algorithm;brushing and linking;excited state;feedback;machine learning;prototype;query level feature;smartphone;smartwatch;user experience	Takuma Yoshitani;Masa Ogata;Koji Yatani	2016		10.1145/2971648.2971704	human–computer interaction;preventive dentistry;dental plaque;plaque removal;dental care;computer science;toothbrush	HCI	-58.37341421269045	-53.81660585208046	108195
b902fa05817d94975bd4d11bff376b783502ad5c	biases and benefits of number lines and pie charts in proportion representation		In two experiments, we investigate how adults think about proportion across different symbolic and spatial representations in a comparison task (Experiment 1) and a translation task (Experiment 2). Both experiments show response patterns suggesting that decimal notation provides a symbolic advantage in precision when representing numerical magnitude, whereas fraction notation does not. In addition, pie charts may show some advantages above number lines when translating between representations. Lastly, our findings suggest that the translation between number lines and fractions may be particularly error-prone. We discuss what these performance patterns suggest in terms of how adults represent proportional information across these different formats and some potential avenues through which these advantages and disadvantages may arise, suggesting new questions for future work.	chart;cognitive dimensions of notations;experiment;numerical analysis	Michelle A Hurst;Charlotta Relander;Sara Cordes	2016			social psychology;psychology;pie chart	SE	-50.48011323282701	-54.30231839066972	108316

A convenience sample of clinical staff was surveyed using a variety of assessment tools. The environmental assessment determined there was no interference between the wireless devices and the biomedical equipment on the patient care units. Survey results indicated a high level of acceptance for the wireless technology related to perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, impact, adoption, advantage and future need. Results indicated a strong, significant relationship between adoption and perceived usefulness (r(s)=.71 p<.01; r(2)(s)=.50).		Charlotte A. Seckman;Carol Romano;Sue Marden	2001	Proceedings.

The application aims at improving the efficiency of hospital units. By using appropriate software, digital maps are created. The technical and financial data of the respirators and ultrasound systems are displayed on the maps. The respirators are installed in the Intensive Care Units (ICU) of public hospitals in Peloponnese. The ultrasound scan systems are also installed in the Radiology Departments of the same units. The user is enabled to create interactive maps and visualize a large amount of real-time information. The overarching aim is to develop an integrated surveillance system of medical equipment. This process will promote the loss-making machinery replacement. Furthermore, the efficient management of revenue and expenditure operations of hospital units will be promoted. The reliable decision-making by the Ministry of Health or the Health and Social Welfare Departments will also be enhanced.	decision making;geographic information systems;geographic information system;geotagging;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;hospital units;hospitals, public;map;mechanical ventilator;medical devices;medical ultrasound;radiology;real-time data;social welfare;ultrasonography;intensive care unit	Dimitrios Zarakovitis;Dimitrios Tsoromokos;Nikolaos Tsaloukidis;Athina Lazakidou	2018	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-880-8-171	medical equipment;medical physics;ultrasound scan;respirator;financial management;medicine	HCI	-55.44803014708254	-63.43467723873087	108609

It is a priority therefore to identify the most effective rehabilitation strategies and/or pharmacotherapies. Motor learning, the essential process underpinning rehabilitation, can be assessed more quickly and robustly than outcomes from rehabilitation. In this paper we describe a proof of concept system that utilises a bespoke video game to measure the critical components of motor learning. We demonstrate that it is sensitive enough to detect how simple changes in therapist instruction significantly change motor performance and learning. Although video games have been shown to aid in rehabilitation, this is the first time video games have been used to derive early response markers, based on the measurement of performance and motor learning, for use in the evaluation of the efficacy of a rehabilitation strategy.	bespoke;limited availability	S.

But the successful integration of user participation depends on the way it is carried out, that is, when and how are the users involved in the process, how are the users’ needs and requirements transferred to the technologists, and how is it verified that these requirements have been satisfied in the developed prototypes? These questions can be summarized as, how can one make the users’ voice heard across the development of complex ubiquitous healthcare services? Finding adequate answers to these questions normally is complex due to the challenges that arise when using new and untested technology, as is the case of ubiquitous healthcare services. This paper will present answers to such questions from experience gathered during European projects in the AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) area, in which qualified specialists collaborate to provide a pool of competences that are vital in guaranteeing the success of ubiquitous healthcare services.	atm adaptation layer;requirement	J.

ef3b2c5e829648c96eb3cd0f93328c13f1f645eb	it integration and patient safety: the case of a software tool		Information Technology (IT) in the healthcare system bring great benefits to patients and healthcare providers, and hospitals. However, IT systems have their own health safety risks for patients and possibly users. These risks need to be investigated. At North York General Hospital, Toronto, Canada, a software tool that measures the patients’ risk of readmission has been implemented. In this paper we describe the software implementation decisions and analyze the data entry challenges. Our Analysis uncovered data entry errors that would impact patients’ safety and well-being. Implementation strategies and integration of different eHealth solutions in a healthcare organization is still a challenge. There is a need to assess the risks eHealth solution have on patients’ safety and to develop processes in the workplace that ensures that eHealth tools are assessed upon implementation. © 2016 El Morr C., Ginsburg L., Nam V.

The objective of this article is to review current research on palliative care service users' experience of using weblogs. A search was conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed from 2002 to 2012 focusing on weblogs in palliative care. After extensive searches and assessment, six articles were included in the review. Results show that palliative care bloggers find blogging therapeutic and beneficial. Weblogs empowered individuals leading to health behaviour change while also giving them access to social support thus fostering well-being. However, there is lack of robust evidence showing the benefits of blogging using clinical measures or other scientific methods. Given the growth of these weblogs by palliative care patients, research is required to strengthen evidence for their benefit and to evaluate their effectiveness.	blog;medline;palliative care service;patients;psycinfo;pubmed;social support;systematic review;benefit	Nothando B.

Previous research has investigated users' perception of the acceptability of various forms of authentication in non-healthcare domains, but not patients' preferences. First, we developed an interactive prototype to test three authentication methods: passwords, pattern, and voice. Our results indicate that younger patients prefer passwords by a significant margin. Older patients indicated more mixed preferences. In addition, we evaluated the level of security patients desired for protection of health information compared to financial information. We found no difference based on age: both groups felt financial security is more important than health data security. The findings of this research can be used to improve and enhance usability of future PHRs and overall PHR usage by patients. While this study is specific to cardiology patients we believe the results are generalizable to all patients with chronic conditions.	data security;health insurance portability and accountability act;hoc (programming language);multi-factor authentication;password;prototype;requirement;text simplification;usability	Ann L.

789251b225a90ca0ec99201dc2092e63d5f1d67e	interoperability assessment in health systems based on process mining and mcda methods		Healthcare processes are complex and require a high-level of interdisciplinary cooperation among the different specialists and sectors involved in their delivery. Information flows among organizational entities, sectors, areas and employees represent possible risks of low process interoperability as well as of non-compliance between business rules and actual process deliveries. In addition to this complexity, the Brazilian healthcare area has well-known problems in its public and private health care systems. These problems are of structural, organizational and financial natures, reflecting the low value attributed to quality and to the actual services provided evidenced in recent surveys of Instituto Data Folha and the Brazilian Ministry of Health (Ministerio da Saude). The extraction of process data logs, and the use of process mining, enables extraction of qualitative and quantitative indicators for hospital processes. On top of these, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools can be used for analysis and decision making in support to process diagnosis. This paper aims to propose the joint use of process data mining and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods in analysing and identifying organizational performance levels in a particular hospital process. In order to accomplish this, a case study was carried out through the use of treatment data logs of venous chemotherapy patients at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital, located in Curitiba – PR, Brazil, a local reference in cancer treatments.	interoperability	Gustavo Riz;Eduardo Alves Portela Santos;Eduardo De Freitas Rocha Loures	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-56535-4_44	reliability engineering;engineering;knowledge management;data mining	HCI	-55.92679112404576	-62.95717064908048	109774

In the treatment group, doctor office spending and laboratory spending fell in the period after the service became available, relative to the control group (p < 0.05). A rough estimate is that average doctor office spending per treatment group member per month fell $1.71 after availability of the service, and laboratory spending fell roughly $0.12. Spending associated with use of the electronic service was $0.29 per member per month. We conclude that use of structured electronic visits can reduce health care spending.	health care;patients;radiology information systems;women's health services	Laurence Baker;Jeffrey Rideout;Paul Gertler;Kristiana Raube	2005	Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA	10.1197/jamia.M1778	family medicine;medicine;law;information technology;health care;scientific control	HCI	-59.709090454504704	-65.43175380416038	110526

BRAINS provide sharing and archiving of detailed normal human brain imaging and relevant phenotypic data already collected in studies of healthy volunteers across the life-course. It particularly focusses on the extremes of age (currently older age, and in future perinatal) where variability is largest, and which are under-represented in existing databanks. BRAINS is a living imagebank where new data will be added when available. Currently BRAINS contains data from 808 healthy volunteers, from 15 to 81years of age, from 7 projects in 3 centres. Additional completed and ongoing studies of normal individuals from 1st to 10th decades are in preparation and will be included as they become available. BRAINS holds several MRI structural sequences, including T1, T2, T2* and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), available in DICOM (http://dicom.nema.org/); in future Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) will be added where available. Images are linked to a wide range of 'textual data', such as age, medical history, physiological measures (e.g. blood pressure), medication use, cognitive ability, and perinatal information for pre/post-natal subjects. The imagebank can be searched to include or exclude ranges of these variables to create better estimates of 'what is normal' at different ages.	archive;cognition;dicom;diffusion tensor imaging;estimated;flair (product);fluid attenuated inversion recovery;heart rate variability;imaging of brain;text corpus	Dominic Edward Job;David Alexander Dickie;David Rodriguez Gonzalez;Andrew Robson;Samuel Danso;Cyril R.

The software tools include a website and a number of client/server applications developed by the authors at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for patient voice data entry, storage, retrieval, reporting, reuse and sharing on the web in de-identified form. The website software is integrated with existing commercial clinical software to support multi-institutional research collaboration. Design of the client/server applications includes automatic reuse of standard MGH outpatient and surgical schedules. An additional application has been developed to facilitate the remote retrieval and review of recorded clinical endoscopic examinations based on the reuse of commercial viewer software and database. A new general model is suggested for web-based sharing and mining of research data processed by means of a specific desktop computer program.	client–server model;computer program;database;desktop computer;monumenta germaniae historica;server (computing);web application	Anatoly D.

An even more challenging task is to mix these packages to form pipelines that meet specific needs seamlessly, because each piece of software usually has its own input/output formats, parameter sets, and so on. To address these issues, we are building WHIPPET (Washington Heterogeneous Image Processing Pipeline EnvironmenT), a collaborative platform for integrating image analysis tools from different sources. The central idea is to develop a set of Python scripts which glue the different packages together and make it possible to connect them in processing pipelines. To achieve this, an analysis is carried out for each candidate package for WHIPPET, describing input/output formats, parameters, ROI description methods, scripting and extensibility and classifying its compatibility with other WHIPPET components as image file level, scripting level, function extension level, or source code level. We then identify components that can be connected in a pipeline directly via image format conversion. We set up a TWiki server for web-based collaboration so that component analysis and task request can be performed online, as well as project tracking, knowledge base management, and technical support. Currently WHIPPET includes the FSL, MIPAV, FreeSurfer, BrainSuite, Measure, DTIQuery, and 3D Slicer software packages, and is expanding. Users have identified several needed task modules and we report on their implementation.© (2007) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Participants were 2,114 students (1,204 male and 910 female) who were recruited to complete the Chen Internet Addiction Scale and Frustration Discomfort scale. Females had higher scores on the subscale of entitlement and emotional intolerance and the total scale of the frustration intolerance. There was a significant gender difference on the association between Internet addiction and frustration intolerance. The association was higher in male adolescents. Regression analysis revealed male adolescents with Internet addiction had higher intolerance to frustration of entitlement and emotional discomfort, and female adolescents with it had higher intolerance to emotional discomfort and lower tolerance to frustration of achievement. Frustration intolerance should be evaluated for adolescents with Internet addiction, especially for males. Rational emotive behavior therapy focusing on different irrational beliefs should be provided to male and female adolescents with Internet addiction.	addictive behavior;adolescent (age group);entity–relationship model;internet addiction disorder;malaise;munchausen syndrome;rem sleep behavior disorder;sex characteristics	Chih-Hung Ko;Ju-Yu Yen;Cheng-Fang Yen;Chung-Sheng Chen;Shing-Yaw Wang	2008	Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	10.1089/cpb.2007.0095	psychology;developmental psychology;medicine;computer science;psychotherapist;social psychology	Web+IR	-55.305824774393656	-52.59226620172984	111507
848980dfbd44cecb217e6aadde3216fbbd836752	augmenting clinical performance in combat casualty care: telemedicine to automation		Emerging efforts in information science offer the possibility for clinicians to better utilize computer technology to decrease cognitive load, enhance decision making, and, improve patient outcomes. Recent natural disasters and mass casualty events across the United States and abroad spotlight the challenges of delivering healthcare in austere contexts. Austerity is a situation defined by limited resources of some or all of the following: equipment, medicines, diagnostics, personnel, knowledge, training, skills, and expertise. It is in this context that the military is focusing efforts to develop new telemedical, autonomous, and robotic systems to support local caregivers. Military human-computer models that support telemedicine and autonomous care in austere environments may help shape similar civilian healthcare solutions in similarly austere contexts of remoteness, natural disaster, and mass casualty. This paper will discuss the clinical challenges and capability gaps of providing comprehensive medical support in this context and some of the tools the military is developing to address them.	automation	Jeremy C.

Work in this domain has shown that the standard XML is one of solid supports for the specification of the structure and of the semantic of clinical information, especially XML also ensures publishing medical records through Web. However, evolutions in time of XML schema of these records as well as interpenetration of temporal aspects in medical information are not sufficiently handled. In this paper, we address the problem of modeling, managing and implementing temporal medical data. We define efficient mechanisms for the management of multi-version medical records. For each structure evolution, our approach for schema versioning of XML medical records consists in creating a new schema version and in preserving old ones and their corresponding data. We present an algorithm to generate and to maintain schema versions of documents. We show the feasibility of our approach by the development of an application based on service oriented tools to publish services of versioned electronic medical records through the web.	algorithm;database schema;information system;internet;requirement;software versioning;web service;xml database;xml schema;xquery	Afef Samet Ellouze;Rafik Bouaziz;Ahmed Jmal	2010	2010 Second International Conference on Advances in Databases, Knowledge, and Data Applications	10.1109/DBKDA.2010.20	web service;xml validation;data modeling;software architecture;the internet;xml;computer science;technology management;document structure description;service-oriented architecture;data mining;xml schema;database;publishing;world wide web;xml schema editor;medical record;efficient xml interchange	DB	-53.84882511795603	-62.64591772998179	111721

Because of diabetes nature, medical care and lifestyle can both prevent the complications of this illness, so self-managing is very crucial for these patients. Therefore, each effective factor of controlling diabetes and increasing patients' knowledge including: suitable diet and monitoring blood glucose level, is assigned to be an agent which works independently whilst coordinates and cooperates with other agents. The proposed architecture of this multi agent system organizes all the various agents of this system in a way that not only each of them can accomplish their responsibility, but also they can have effective interaction with other agents. This designed system has the ability to develop a model that can be easily used by patients suffering from type 2 diabetes.	knowledge base;multi-agent system;nsa product types;self-management (computer science);systems architecture;while	Z.

This study present a review of type 2 diabetes risk estimation mobile applications focusing on their functionality and availability of information on the underlying risk calculators. Only 9 out of 31 reviewed mobile applications, featured in three major mobile application stores, disclosed the name of risk calculator used for assessing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Even more concerning, none of the reviewed applications mentioned that they are collecting the data from users to improve the performance of their risk estimation calculators or offer users the descriptive statistics of the results from users that already used the application. For that purpose the questionnaires used for calculation of risk should be upgraded by including the information on the most recent blood sugar level measurements from users. Although mobile applications represent a great future potential for health applications, developers still do not put enough emphasis on informing the user of the underlying methods used to estimate the risk for a specific clinical condition.	android;brain–computer interface;central diabetes insipidus;crew resource management, healthcare;description;diabetes mellitus;diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent;endocrine system diseases;graphical user interface;it risk;mhealth;microsoft windows;mobile applications;mobile app;mobile device;nsa product types;next-generation network;numerical analysis;population;reporting;risk assessment;systematic review;the australian;usability;user interface device component;user interface design;windows phone;format;ios	Nino Fijacko;Petra Povalej Brzan;Gregor Stiglic	2015	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-015-0319-y	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;data mining;android	HCI	-57.243396051218085	-59.46242790546349	112464
d9a740001700ff9609ffd902820f4379d50a12bd	probing memory and executive functions with virtual reality	executive function;virtual reality	"""The technology of virtual reality (VR) has been used to develop interactive programs that simulate everyday life environments, where healthy subjects and patients with central ner¬ vous system dysfunctions are asked to carry out tasks that probe incidental memory and ex¬ ecutive functions. The results of three studies support previous claims that VR-based tests overcome several limitations of traditional paper-and-pencil tests, are at least as sensitive to target cognitive impairments, while providing a richer range of opportunities for measuring behavior. Preliminary analyses also suggest that results of VR-based memory tests are replic¬ able across laboratories and subjects samples and that the technology is well-accepted and tolerated by both healthy and impaired subjects. The use of virtual reality (VR) to develop new diagnostic tools for psychology and neuropsychology has been proposed and dis¬ cussed by many research groups1""""4 since the early 1990s. Basically, VR is suggested as a means of assessing aspects of behavior that are normally inaccessible during traditional formal psychometric testing. In fact, VR-based tests are thought to be more representative of every¬ day life situations than paper-and-pencil (p&p) tests, and are potentially as precise and reliable as the latter. A primary necessity is, therefore, the demonstration that VR adds value to al¬ ready existing neuropsychometric tools. This would imply, for example, that new tools are better in terms of sensitivity to specific cogni^cientific Institute S.

To some extent, therefore, new products need to be compared with older but reliable and validated tools. A straightforward approach would be to test the same subjects on both traditional and VR-based tools and compare the results. This, however, is complicated by the fact that VR—and espe¬ cially immersive VR—changes substantially the cognitive requests of a given test. For ex¬ ample, the amplification of spatial, motor and time-related aspects of a task that unavoidably takes place in a virtual reality, may change in an unpredictable way the response values and their distribution, even though the strategic as¬ pects are kept constant. It has been, therefore, anticipated that VR-based tests will evolve as a new class of diagnostic tools5 with psycho¬ metric characteristics substantially different from their p&p analogs.

BACKGROUND Information has been gathered during the past 15 years from studies of Chilean miners.   METHOD This article is based on a compilation of information of 700 workplaces where physical, mental, environmental, and organizational loads were evaluated with a systemic approach.   RESULTS The results of the Chilean experience reveal that it is important to overcome the concept of """"static"""" ergonomics focused on workplaces that may be valid for offices and machine operation but not for a significant number of miners who will be moving around workstations located in systems of different complexity. The consequence of these complex and dynamic work situations is that more than 50% of absenteeism for health reasons is attributed to musculoskeletal disorders, and there are no standard recommendations that universally apply. The results showed that these problems can be tackled by implementing participatory programs.   CONCLUSION The main conclusion of the Chilean experience is that there is a need to continue advancing from diagnostic studies to participatory interventions. At the same time, it is imperative that all new investments in plants, small or large, include considerations of relevant ergonomic concepts from the early planning stages. It is also important to increase ergonomic training within companies, including not only the managers who make major decisions but also the workers who are directly affected by the lack of ergonomics.   APPLICATION It is expected that this description of the Chilean experience may be useful for other countries where mining is also a source of income and employment."""

Learning health systems (LHS) that continuously analyze their data to generate evidence and to enable informed decisions have been proposed as a possible solution. This paper investigates the involvement of laboratory medicine in LHS and evaluates relevant systems according to their scope, enabling technologies, architecture for evidence generation, data-action latency, and social aspects. While laboratory medicine provides a central source of information in many large-scale LHS, there are also systems with a particular focus on laboratories. For example, external quality assessments are performed by sending samples with known quantities to laboratories worldwide to verify their analytical methods. This data are also analyzed for other purposes, such as post-market surveillance of devices. These schemes have operated successfully over several decades. Newer, innovative tools harvest the possibilities of wearable devices and increased connectivity. LHS in laboratory medicine need to be recognized and incorporated into systems of systems to generate better evidence. Further research on the roles of other stakeholders will identify opportunities and obstacles for building and maintaining successful LHS.	evaluation procedure;information source;laboratory;quantity;star catalogue;system of systems;wearable technology	Andreas Bietenbeck;Fabian Prasser	2018	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-896-9-104	medical laboratory;medical education;medicine	HCI	-57.81087785869272	-60.73301830585918	113479

The cohort was to be drawn from eight geographically dispersed regions of Eng-land, covering in total one-sixth of the entire population. In order to meet the current and future requirements we needed to build a secure distributed system, which not only could support remote data collection, but could also be integrated with other data sets, applications, and workflows for statistical analysis. We concluded that a service-oriented architecture was required and that the implementation technology should be Web services. In this article we present the design, deployment and operation of the PsyGrid data collection system as a case study in applying Web services to health informatics. The major problems we faced were related to the deployment of Web services into an existing network infrastructure, but overall found Web services to be the most suitable middleware technology.	distributed computing;informatics;information system;middleware;pac-land;requirement;service-oriented architecture;software deployment;web service	John D.

The Center for SUDEP Research (CSR) is an NINDS-funded Center Without Wall's initiative aimed at prospectively creating a comprehensive clinical research resource for SUDEP. This resource consists of a growing set of data and biological samples of a statistically significant cohort of patients at an elevated risk, best represented by the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) patient population. The Informatics and Data Analytics Core (IDAC) of CSR has developed a state-of-the- art informatics infrastructure, to integrate patient data captured in multiple EMU's at a greatly accelerated pace. Data quality assurance is a priority of IDAC. This paper reports our approach, Ontology-guided Data Curation for Multisite Clinical Research Data Integration (ODaCCI), to address the challenging task of centralized data curation while new data is continuously generated and integrated from distributed sites. ODaCCI leverages the Epilepsy and Seizure Ontology not only for upstream data capture, but also for supporting a range of quality assurance tasks such as data quality monitoring, data update, and data reports. Between October 2014 and February 2016, ODaCCI has integrated phenotypic and electroencephalogram signal data of 629 patients from 7 clinical sites, while supporting continuous and asynchronous data quality enhancement overtime.	centralized computing;data curation;data quality;digital curation;electroencephalography;epilepsy;informatics (discipline);myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile;national institute of neurological disorders and stroke;patients;seizures	Licong Cui;Yan Huang;Shiqiang Tao;Samden D.

The technique has been used in health care since the mid-1970s, and has just recently become more common in clinical informatics research. As informatics develops as a specialty, it is logical to consider information technology solutions to research as well as clinical practice problems. The overall purpose of this methodology presentation is to compare a mailed vs. Internet application of the Delphi technique for clinical informatics research. Specifically, this presentation will provide: 1) an overview of the Delphi technique, and 2) a methodological comparison of two research applications of the Delphi technique. Results of the studies will be presented elsewhere.		Rita Snyder-Halpern;Cheryl Bagley Thompson;Judith Schaffer	2000	Proceedings.

Current challenges in database design include data heterogeneity and context-dependent interconnections between data entities. These challenges drove the development of unified data interfaces and specialized databases. The curation of specialized databases is an ever-growing challenge due to the introduction of new data sources and the emergence of new relational connections between established datasets. Here, an open-source framework for the curation of specialized databases is proposed. The framework supports user-designed models of data encapsulation, objects persistency and structured interfaces to local and external data sources such as MalaCards, Biomodels and the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. The proposed framework was implemented using Java as the development environment, EclipseLink as the data persistency agent and Apache Derby as the database manager. Syntactic analysis was based on J3D, jsoup, Apache Commons and w3c.dom open libraries. Finally, a construction of a specialized database for aneurysms associated vascular diseases is demonstrated. This database contains 3-dimensional geometries of aneurysms, patient’s clinical information, articles, biological models, related diseases and our recently published model of aneurysms’ risk of rapture.

Although self-management and monitoring are critical for general control of the disease and for preventing diabetes-related complications, most patients fail to adhere to self-management regimens. We study what type of external intervention will amplify the self-monitoring frequency of Type-2 diabetes (T2d) patients. We conducted a randomized field experiment on a mobile health application with more than 500 T2d patients, and tested two well-known mechanisms for behavior change: social norms, and implementation intentions. Further, we combined social norms and implementation intentions and tested whether these two mechanisms can complement each other. Our results show that individuals who receive a message containing both social norms and implementation intentions perform the best in regard to self-monitoring. Our research paves the way to further investigate how different mechanisms may be combined to help users’ form healthy habits.	norm (social)	Che-Wei Liu;Weiguang Wang;Guodong Gao;Ritu Agarwal	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67964-8_1	global health;disease;behavior change;field experiment;social psychology;norm (social);business	HCI	-61.94049752963509	-57.65472218658789	114545

One segment of the community that continues to suffer from issues pertaining to poor access and low quality is the American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) population. Such a situation is clearly untenable, especially given the plethora of tools, techniques, technologies and tactics afforded by today's knowledge economy. In this paper, we proffer a model incorporating a system of systems approach in order to provide better healthcare delivery to native American patients. We first discuss the role of collaborative technologies in healthcare system of systems. Then we describe the role of healthcare system of systems and collaborative technologies in healthcare delivery to native American patients.	system of systems	Nilmini Wickramasinghe;Suresh Chalasani;Sridevi Koritala	2012	2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2012.582	medical imaging;system of systems;knowledge economy;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;health care	EDA	-57.77478781176017	-61.25007108220307	114760
7818cb57afd3f6aef32d0a90e4d842c7ff11952a	introduction to theme issue on technologies for patient-defined and patient-generated data		Health reform initiatives around the world require active participation of individuals in their own health and in the health care process. Technologies designed to support engagement in health and health care provide the foundation for active participation of patients and engender a new vision of health services. This vision is grounded in a twoway exchange of information between patients and clinicians. Information, preferences, knowledge, and responsibility are shared to achieve the outcomes of the cooperative health efforts. Health and illness management both require more than the traditional, clinically derived signs and symptoms. They also require patient-generated data, including self-monitoring, tracking, and observations made in everyday living—the unique observations and insights that bring the everyday life of the person into the clinical encounter. Personal and ubiquitous technologies present opportunities to go beyond the traditional observation of signs and symptoms to include a complementary set of patient-generated data that include observations and activities that are centered in the patient’s worldview, but sometimes defined in consultation with a clinician. In summary, we characterize three types of health data as (1) clinically defined and generated, (2) clinically defined patient-generated and (3) patient-defined and generated which we call observations of daily living or ODLs. This theme issues focuses on these last two data types, and the majority of papers address the third—data that are both patient-defined and generated. We advance these distinctions to foster a more comprehensive view of a person and their health concerns and their health services. Unpacking these different data types facilitates a more complete view of a person and their health experiences. Patient-defined and patient-generated data may serve as the first point of awareness and stimuli for health action. When the data are relevant and important to the patient, but not to a clinician, the patient has the opportunity—and responsibility—to impute meaning on them. As the realization takes hold that health occurs always and everywhere, not just during a clinic visit or a hospital stay, and as patient-generated data assume a more central role in understanding and capturing an individual patient’s health state, the limits of the electronic medical record as an information platform for health emerge, and the need for newer, highly distributed nimble-but-robust information architectures becomes clearer. Achieving the goals of health for all requires full engagement in health of everyone, every day, everywhere, and this engagement, in turn, must be facilitated by knowledge and technology. The language of health care is changing, expanding to include words that reflect health-related information that enables patients to take healthy action and provides clinicians with a window into a patient’s world. Tools must be created to better support the ephemeral, idiosyncratic nature of patient-defined and patient-generated data and their episodic integration into clinical care. The challenge is twofold: (1) build tools that capture and return to the patient informative data displays, and (2) represent, package, and send these data to the clinician. Robust, powerful visualization and display strategies must be developed to accommodate the many users and uses of G. R.

According to recent surveys this “population aging” phenomenon will contribute to reach the record number of 1 billion people over 60 years on earth by the year 2020. Due to a variety of reasons such as convenience or a need for security and privacy these elderly people generally prefer to avail healthcare facilities at their home. This is time to break through the physical boundaries of hospitals and bring healthcare facilities to the homes. Wireless and internet-based healthcare devices can play a vital role in this regard given that reliable, individualized systems with user-friendly interfaces are developed to enable elderly people feel comfortable with making use of novel technology. This paper presents a remote home monitoring application called Living Assistant that could be utilized to continuously monitor and control a wide range of electronic appliances and ambient parameters. Basically it has been designed to function as a healthcare aide for elderly patients suffering from restricted mobility or other chronic diseases. The advanced ways of user interfaces presented in this paper are simple, generic and universally applicable. With little customization the application can be used to accommodate other user groups as well.	color gradient;ian cullimore;internet;multimodal interaction;privacy;prototype;row (database);sensor;shawn carpenter;ubiquitous computing;usability;user interface	Rezwan Islam;Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed;Chowdhury Sharif Hasan;Mohammad Tanviruzzaman	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02710-9_22	simulation;medicine;biological engineering;computer security	HCI	-59.322460209568625	-57.163028265954004	115294

This would give the surgeons direct access to their patients’ scan data without compromising their sterile working field and without needing to rely on other clinicians to interpret display instructions. Our approach involved interviewing surgeons and observing them in the operating theatre. We included evidence from earlier publications in this field and we used a grounded theory approach to analyse our data. Our findings address diversity across the surgical specialties, preoperative versus intraoperative use of the data, preferences for simple natural gestures, the role of another person controlling the display, broad system constraints and the willingness of surgeons to collaborate with their time and effort in this research.	natural user interface	Duncan Stevenson;Henry J.

This case report describes a HIS in a hospital where the paper-based medical records are scanned and eliminated. To evaluate the HIS comprehensively, the perspectives of medical secretaries and nurses are described as well as that of physicians.   METHODS We have used questionnaires and interviews to assess and compare frequency of use of the HIS for essential tasks, task performance and user satisfaction among medical secretaries, nurses and physicians.   RESULTS The medical secretaries use the HIS much more than the nurses and the physicians, and they consider that the electronic HIS greatly has simplified their work. The work of nurses and physicians has also become simplified, but they find less satisfaction with the system, particularly with the use of scanned document images.   CONCLUSIONS Although the basis for reference is limited, the results support the assertion that replacing the paper-based medical record primarily benefits the medical secretaries, and to a lesser degree the nurses and the physicians. The varying results in the different employee groups emphasize the need for a multidisciplinary approach when evaluating a HIS.	anisotropic filtering;attitude;electronic health records;electronics, medical;health care;hodgkin disease;horseland;hospital information systems;information system;manuscripts;medical records;mike lesser;scanning;thylacodes sp. aust. mus. c203213;benefit;interest	Hallvard Lærum;Tom H.

As an example it is the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In the ICU the patients are in critically ill conditions and there aren’t available time to make experiences or to develop incomplete systems. With the objective to improve the implementation process, the same should be accompanied in order to understand the environment and user behaviour. In this case and with the goal to evaluate the implementation process, an assessment model was applied to a real system called INTCare. INTCare is a Pervasive Intelligent Decision Support System (PIDSS). It was deployed in the ICU of Centro Hospitalar do Porto and was evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM). This assessment was made using the four constructs proposed by the TAM and a questionnaire-based approach guided by the Delphi Methodology. The results obtained so far show that although the users are satisfied with the offered information recognizing this importance, they demand for a faster system. This work present the main results achieved and suggest one way to follow when some technology is deployed in an environment like is ICU.	embarcadero delphi;ibm tivoli access manager;intelligent decision support system;international components for unicode	Filipe Portela;Jorge Aguiar;Manuel Filipe Santos;António Abelha;José Machado;Álvaro M.

Health websites are unique from other websites because they require a more acute awareness of ethical issues due to potential life threatening risks from misuse of information. We propose and give a high-level description of a Health Content Management System (HCMS) that addresses these issues and other functional needs found in most health websites. In addition, we suggest unique features that are not available in most existing health websites. Surveys of existing health websites and content management systems demonstrate the need for the proposed system. Moreover, the novelty of the proposed HCMS is appraised and asserted in comparison with similar health framework concepts. Our contributions include survey results of more than 50 health websites, a taxonomy of health websites' characteristics, and a blueprint for typical and novel features for health websites.	blueprint;content management system;high- and low-level;internet;taxonomy (general)	Hamman W.

DESIGN Combined mail and telephone survey of 964 randomly selected hospitals, contrasting 2002 data and results of a survey conducted in 1997.   MEASUREMENTS    AVAILABILITY computerized order entry has been installed and is available for use by physicians; inducement: the degree to which use of computers to enter orders is required of physicians; participation: the proportion of physicians at an institution who enter orders by computer; and saturation: the proportion of total orders at an institution entered by a physician using a computer.   RESULTS The response rate was 65%. Computerized order entry was not available to physicians at 524 (83.7%) of 626 hospitals responding, whereas 60 (9.6%) reported complete availability and 41 (6.5%) reported partial availability. Of 91 hospitals providing data about inducement/requirement to use the system, it was optional at 31 (34.1%), encouraged at 18 (19.8%), and required at 42 (46.2%). At 36 hospitals (45.6%), more than 90% of physicians on staff use the system, whereas six (7.6%) reported 51-90% participation and 37 (46.8%) reported participation by fewer than half of physicians. Saturation was bimodal, with 25 (35%) hospitals reporting that more than 90% of all orders are entered by physicians using a computer and 20 (28.2%) reporting that less than 10% of all orders are entered this way.   CONCLUSION Despite increasing consensus about the desirability of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) use, these data indicate that only 9.6% of U.S. hospitals presently have CPOE completely available. In those hospitals that have CPOE, its use is frequently required. In approximately half of those hospitals, more than 90% of physicians use CPOE; in one-third of them, more than 90% of orders are entered via CPOE.	computer;computerized physician order entry system;order management system;randomness;inpatient;orders - hl7publishingdomain	Joan S.

We present the agent-based GAP-DRG model, which allows a comparison of reimbursement schemes in outpatient care. It models patients and medical providers as agents. In the simulation patients develop medical problems (i.e., diseases) and a need for medical services. This leads to utilization of medical providers. The reimbursement system receives information on the patients' visits via its generic interface, which facilitates an easy replacement. We describe the assumptions of the model in detail and show how it makes extensive use of available Austrian routine care data for its parameterization. The model design is optimized for utilizing as much of these data as possible. However, many assumptions have to be simplifications. Further work and detailed comparisons with health care data will provide insight on which assumptions are valid descriptions of the real process.	agent-based model;digital raster graphic;simulation	Patrick Einzinger;Nikolas Popper;Felix Breitenecker;Nina Pfeffer;Reinhard Jung;Gottfried Endel	2013	2013 Winter Simulations Conference (WSC)		computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;health care	ML	-52.31299414291278	-62.10961677980915	117332

b0073cb4e58d3fa832c646003631dca13452094b	predicting workout quality to help coaches support sportspeople		The support of a qualified coach is crucial to keep the motivation of sportspeople high and help them pursuing an active lifestyle. In this paper, we discuss the scenario inwhich a coach follows sportspeople remotely by means of an eHealth platform, named u4fit. Having to deal with several users at the same time, with no direct human contact, means that it is hard for coaches to quickly spot who, among the people she follows, needs a more timely support. To this end, in this paper we present an automated approach that analyzes the adherence of sportspeople to their planned workout routines. The approach is able to suggest to the coach the sportspeople who need earlier support due to a poor performance. Experiments on real data, evaluated through classic accuracy metrics, show the effectiveness of our approach.

Here, we retrospectively analyzed actual cases of statin prescription for hyperlipidemia at Tohoku University Hospital between Apr 1, 2004 and Mar 31, 2008. Twelve physicians (6 cardiologists, 3 nephrologist, and 3 diabetologist) made decisions on whether to prescribe statins to 187 patients in 788 visits. As expected, cardiologists started prescribing statins at significantly lower serum total cholesterol levels than other specialists (221.7mg/dL vs. 244.7mg/dL, P<0.05). Interestingly, the total cholesterol levels that triggered prescribing differed significantly among cardiologists (p<0.05). These results suggested that prescription decisions differed not only among specialties but also among individuals.	cholesterol;decision theory;hyperlipidemia;patients;simvastatin	Akiko Shibuya;Masaharu Nakayama;Ryusuke Inoue;Yutaka Imai;Yoshiaki Kondo	2009	AMIA ...

Social contextual stimuli that might trigger impulsive responses can be carefully controlled in virtual environments (VE), and yet manipulations of risk might be implausible to participants if they do not feel sufficiently immersed in the environment. The current study examined whether individuals can display adequate evidence of presence in a VE that involved potential interpersonally-induced risk: meeting a potential dating partner. Results offered some evidence for the potential of VR for the study of such interpersonal risk situations. Participants’ reaction to the scenario and risk-associated responses to the situation suggested that the embodied nature of virtual reality override the reality of the risk’s impossibility, allowing participants to experience adequate situational embedding, or presence.	anomalous experiences;cognition disorders;drug allergy;embedding;interaction;override;perception;rem sleep behavior disorder;vr - veterans rand health survey;virtual reality	David B.

Based on the data collected from a smartphone and wearable sensor, our service models an activity pattern of the specific user and predicts the upcoming activity changes of the user by using the individual's lifestyle model. In addition, we continually observe changes in daily activity to determine appropriate preferred activities for each user, and recommend optimal activities to promote wellness by tracking changes in contextual information and user feedback. It can be confirmed that the use of the proposed service contributes to the improvement of the user's wellness by performing a clinical experiment on the actual subjects.	activity recognition;experiment;smartphone;wearable computer	Chae-Gyun Lim;Zae Myung Kim;Ho-Jin Choi	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)	10.1109/BIGCOMP.2017.7881748	simulation;user modeling;computer user satisfaction;engineering;multimedia;world wide web	Mobile	-59.40020169947889	-55.04846347187006	118315

Addressing this research gap is important considering that a substantial number of adverse hospital events stem from communication failures. Furthermore, effective communication is a major driver of patient satisfaction in hospitals. Using a structure-process-outcome (SPO) framework and guided by the strategic role of It literature, we develop a model that includes “structure,” operationalized as organizational characteristics and two different categories of It; “process,” two different communication-based processes; and “outcomes,” quantified as case-mix adjusted mortality, patient loyalty, and patient 258 ANgSt, DEVArAj, AND D’ArCy ratings. Specifically, we hypothesize that a subset of clinical It (cardiology It) will affect technical protocols of patient care, which in turn affects mortality, while administrative It will affect interpersonal patient care, which relates to patient loyalty and ratings. thus, It can serve as a double-edged sword affecting both technical and interpersonal processes of care, but possibly independently and differentially. We test our hypotheses on 2,179 hospitals using data collected and matched from three different sources. Our findings suggest that different types of It differentially affect hospital processes and these same processes influence performance metrics such as mortality and patient satisfaction. For example, cardiology It has a greater effect on objective patient health status through improvements in the technical protocols of care. Surprisingly, administrative It was shown to adversely affect interpersonal care processes. It could be true that the It is intrusive and interferes in the doctor–patient relationship; however, a post hoc analysis suggests the possibility of curvilinear impacts. thus, managers should recognize that overand underinvestment in It can potentially have negative effects on performance and these results vary by It type. Both technical and interpersonal processes yielded significant relationships to their respective outcomes and some cross-outcome effects were found, further suggesting that the mediating role of processes is an important link between It and value. Key worDs AnD phrAses: business value of It, health information technology, operational It, strategic It, structure-process-outcome. If information is the lifeblood of healthcare, then communication is the heart that pumps it. —toussaint and Coiera [103, p. 779] the MAjority of inforMAtion trAnsACtions within A hospitAl are communications between patients, doctors, nurses, and the staff [30], yet little research has addressed the role that information technology (It) can play in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of these communication-based transactions and the processes that must incorporate them. gaining a better understanding of the potential of It to improve communication in hospitals is important because many adverse hospital events, such as medical errors, patients missed on rounds, and incorrect patient documentation, have been linked to communication failures [93, 110]. Communication transactions take many forms in hospitals, ranging from complex directives given by clinicians orchestrating what procedures to undertake in emergency situations, to simple patient requests for medication or creature comforts, to interactions between clinicians and automated decision support systems. Beyond the internally focused aspects of communication within hospitals, patients and their families are also key informants when it comes to spreading information about the quality of care they receive during an in-patient stay. So while hospital executives have to consider the effect that It has on employees with respect to providing communication tools to increase productivity, efficiency, and quality, they also must consider the impact of these tools on patients, DUAL rOLE OF It-ASSIStED COMMUNICAtION IN PAtIENt CArE 259 which will potentially be very different. For example, the use of a computer in an exam room may offer doctors a more efficient means of documentation but could be viewed by patients as highly intrusive to the doctor–patient relationship [75, 92]. It is our contention that the intent of the adopter or context under which the It was adopted determines what “success” really is. Although hospital administrators are surely interested in curtailing costs while growing revenues, their primary interest is in providing the best patient care possible with the resources they have [77]. With respect to the acquisition of It, our paper builds on the premise that while financial viability is a key attribute of performance for hospitals, an even more important criterion for decision makers is how It affects quality of patient care. thus, the intent of It adoption for decision makers is to successfully provide excellent quality relative to the context and objectives. In this paper, we investigate the link between It, processes, and context-specific value. As noted, we examine the role that It plays in a communication process in a collaborative work environment through multiple pathways and test the impact these processes have on important outcomes such as mortality and patient loyalty and ratings. As others have suggested [114], hospitals are settings for shared cognition that involve the coordination between individuals, artifacts, and the environment. A characteristic of shared cognition settings is that cognitive processes are distributed across the members of a social group [59]. In hospitals, many work activities are distributed across individuals and their environment and carried out jointly by people with their tools. We view It as a tool that facilitates shared cognition for these collaborative activities by improving communication processes. In particular, using the structure-process-outcome (SPO) framework [38] and guided by the literature in the strategic It domain [115], we develop a model that includes organizational characteristics, different categories of It, two different communication-based processes, and several outcomes. Several challenges remain with respect to linking It to value in the health-care sector, yet the importance of resolving this link cannot be overstated. In most It-value studies, the left side of this model consists of variables that in some way represent “It”—whether it be a count, investment, utilization, or another quantity-based measure. On the right side, researchers typically employ an outcome measure (or a set of outcomes) that is theorized to co-vary with the variables on the left-hand side. the challenging part for researchers is deciding which variables (and their operationalizations) are the most representative of reality [64]. the dependent variables in health care are particularly troublesome because many believe that “outcomes” are too far removed from the structure and operation of the organization to be linked or actionable. For example, while it would be beneficial for society if a direct statistical link between It adoption and mortality existed, the reality is that this relationship is highly complex, and it is difficult to account for all the personand environmental-level variables that affect mortality. So what can be done to overcome this limitation in the right-hand side of the model? One suggestion originates from the seminal work of Avedis Donabedian, dating back to the 1960s. his work attempts to resolve the debate surrounding the question, “What is ‘quality’ in medical care?” he insightfully notes that quality is one of the key objectives in 260 ANgSt, DEVArAj, AND D’ArCy hospitals, irrespective of whether it is conceptualized as a process or an outcome. he then introduces a model that incorporates elements of both. In this paper, we draw from Donabedian’s [38] model for evaluating quality using a process and outcome framework and extend beyond his model by positioning this within the context of a communication-based environment. While studies of business value and It use abound, extant research examining the influence of It on processes and processes on outcomes is limited. From a theoretical perspective, our work extends the It-value literature by incorporating intermediate communication-based, process-related steps that might offer insight into the link between It and outcomes. More specific to the health-care domain, we investigate the differential effects resulting from adoption of administrative and clinical It (specifically, cardiology It) in the communication-based hospital environment. In doing so, we examine the important intermediary role of processes of care. the findings from this study hold important practical implications for health-care management. Investigation of the business value of It in the health-care industry is sparse and business leaders are increasingly being called upon to demonstrate return on investment. At the same time, there is tremendous pressure from external entities to implement more It as a means of improving care and reducing cost. results from this study can be used to more fully elaborate the important mechanisms for achieving superior hospital performance. In subsequent sections of this paper we draw from the SPO framework to examine the It-value question in health care, specifically at the hospital level of analysis but focusing on the role that the highly consequential cardiology department plays in affecting communication-based processes, which in turn affect hospital outcomes. We chose to focus on cardiology because: • heart failure is the most common noncancer primary admission diagnosis and the number one discharge diagnosis [25]; • heart failure is the primary re	cognition;decision support system;discharger;documentation;entity;growth and underinvestment;hoc (programming language);interaction;pareto efficiency;sparse matrix;theory	Corey M.

The objectives included a review of the research evidence, to identify the factors that affect the successful operation of such communities. The review findings informed the appraisal framework used to assess whether the specialist areas (the Virtual Branch Libraries, in particular) of the National electronic Library for Health portal were evolving as evidence indicated they should. Appraisal findings indicated that most of the Virtual Branch Libraries had successfully evolved beyond the initial stages of community of practice development but that the more sophisticated stages of community of practice existence would require, for example, development of collaborative work tasks. The appraisal framework was successful in identifying some possible barriers to further development, as well as the opportunities for exploiting tacit knowledge within the NHS more costeffectively than has been possible up till now.	library (computing);virtual community	Patty Kostkova;Jane Mani-Saada;Julius R.

23b9751c98df4b89e32946e33561cb0623c45c69	analysis of medication therapy discontinuation orders in new electronic prescriptions and opportunities for implementing cancelrx		Objective To illustrate the need for wider implementation of the CancelRx message by quantifying and characterizing the inappropriate usage of new electronic prescription (NewRx) messages for communicating discontinuation instructions to pharmacies.   Materials and Methods A retrospective analysis on a nationally representative random sample of 1 400 000 NewRx messages transmitted over 7 days to identify e-prescriptions containing medication discontinuation instructions in NewRx text fields. A vocabulary of search terms signifying cancellation instructions was formulated and then iteratively refined. True-positives were subsequently identified programmatically and through manual reviews. Two independent reviewers identified incidences in which these instructions were associated with high-alert or look-alike-sound-like (LASA) medications.   Results We identified 9735 (0.7% of the total) NewRx messages containing prescription cancellation instructions with 78.5% observed in the Notes field; 35.3% of identified NewRxs were associated with high-alert or LASA medications. The most prevalent cancellation instruction types were medication strength or dosage changes (39.3%) and alternative therapy replacement orders (39.0%).   Discussion While the incidence of prescribers using the NewRx to transmit cancellation instructions was low, their transmission in NewRx fields not intended to accommodate such information can produce significant potential patient safety concerns, such as duplicate or inaccurate therapies. These findings reveal the need for wider industry adoption of the CancelRx message by electronic health record (EHR) and pharmacy systems, along with clearer guidance and improved end-user training, particularly as states increasingly mandate electronic prescribing of controlled substances.   Conclusion Encouraging the use of CancelRx and reducing the misuse of NewRx fields would reduce workflow disruptions and unnecessary risks to patient safety.	alert:type:point in time:^patient:nominal;electronic health records;pharmacotherapy discontinuation;pharmacy facility;random sampling;review [publication type];vocabulary;controlled substance;disease transmission;lipid-associated sialic acid;message;orders - hl7publishingdomain	Yuze Yang;Stacy Ward-Charlerie;Nitu Kashyap;Richelle DeMayo;Thomas Agresta;James Green	2018	Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA	10.1093/jamia/ocy100	discontinuation;electronic prescriptions;knowledge management;medical emergency;medicine	HCI	-59.49511704385241	-65.68158652783457	118673

Because the potential benefits of ICT are significant, it is critical that new nurses have the knowledge and skills in informatics to provide safe and effective care. Despite the prevalence of technology in our day to day lives, and the potential significant benefits to patients, new nurses may not be prepared to work in this evolving reality. An important step in addressing this need for ICT preparation is to ensure that new graduates are entering the work force ready for technology-enabled care environments. In this paper, we describe the process and outcomes of developing informatics entry-to-practice competencies for adoption by Canadian Schools of Nursing.		Lynn M.

To synthesize the animated 3D avatars to convey highly believable facial expressions, a 3D scanned facial model was mapped with high-fidelity motion-capture data of three native US subjects as they spoke designated English sentences with specified emotions. Simple animations in conjunction with actual footage of the subjects speaking during the facial motion-capture sessions were shown several times to both native US and international students in similar settings. After a familiarization process, we showed the students randomly arranged talking avatars without voices and asked them to identify the corresponding identities and emotional types of the subjects whose facial expressions were utilized in the creation of the avatars, and to rate their confidence in their selections. We found that the US group had higher success rates in subject identification, although the related difference in confidence ratings between two groups was not significant. The differences in the success rates and confidence ratings on the perception of emotion between the two groups were not significant either. The results of our study provide interesting insights into avatar-based interaction where the national and/or cultural background of a person impacts the perception of identity while having little effect on the perception of emotion. However, we observed that dynamics (e.g., head motion) could offset the disadvantage of cultural unfamiliarity in subject identification. We observed that both groups performed at a nearly identical level in subject identification and emotion perception when they were shown the avatar animation with heightened expression and dynamic intensities. In addition, we observed that the confidence ratings were correlated to accuracy in identifying the subject but not to accuracy in perceiving emotion.	avatar (computing);confidentiality;embedded system;emotion recognition;facial motion capture;facial recognition system;randomness	Chang Yun;Zhigang Deng;Merrill Hiscock	2009	Computers in Entertainment	10.1145/1541895.1541901	motion capture;computer science;multimedia;facial expression;satisfiability	HCI	-53.98106260784078	-52.13662938194423	119126

Several studies have shown that falls account for over sixty percent of injuries in adults older than 65. These falls can leave permanent scars and limit the everyday lives of those people. Since people that fall are instructed not to move, it is crucial to provide them with a means to call for help. Systems like LifeAlert© have provided means for their clients to call for assistance by pressing a button they wear around their neck. However, if a person who has fallen is rendered unconscious, they are unable to do anything to obtain the assistance they need. This project focuses on developing a mobile application and related algorithms to allow mobile devices to determine if a person has fallen. The algorithms developed in this project takes in real-time data from a smartphone's accelerator and determines whether the sequential readings satisfy the three stages of falling (the free fall stage, collision with the floor stage, and remaining at rest stage). The results of the experiments demonstrate promising hands-free responses to the smartphone user falling. By using a smartphone or similar device, it is possible to autonomously call for assistance without the user having to manually press a button.	algorithm;experiment;mobile app;mobile device;real-time data;scar (physics);smartphone	Melissa Katherine Mulcahy	2015		10.1145/2676723.2693636	embedded system;simulation;computer science;operating system;computer security;accelerometer;android	HCI	-53.47926186919467	-56.135380174754864	119275

We surveyed all of 60 employees in health centers and tuberculosis center in such area in Iran about feasibility (organizational, technical, human and environmental readiness) of implementing teleconsultation and its barriers. We found that human readiness was moderate and other aspects were weak. Furthermore, the main obstacles were the shortage of computer equipment (40%), technical infrastructure (35%), lack of funds (33.3%), lack of awareness (33.3%), and employee resistance (33.3%). Implementing teleconsultation for tuberculosis patients is not completely feasible in this area and requires improvement in organizational, technical and environmental factors.

To promote usability testing as part of electronic health record (EHR) certification, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health Information Technology requires that vendors test specific capabilities of EHRs with clinical end-users and report their usability testing process - including the test scenarios used - along with the results. The ONC outlines basic expectations for usability testing, but there is little guidance in usability texts or scientific literature on how to develop usability scenarios for healthcare applications. The objective of this article is to outline key factors to consider when developing usability scenarios and tasks to evaluate computer-interface based health information technologies. To achieve this goal, we draw upon a decade of our experience conducting usability tests with a variety of healthcare applications and a wide range of end-users, to include healthcare professionals as well as patients. We discuss 10 key factors that influence scenario development: objectives of usability testing; roles of end-user(s); target performance goals; evaluation time constraints; clinical focus; fidelity; scenario-related bias and confounders; embedded probes; minimize risks to end-users; and healthcare related outcome measures. For each factor, we present an illustrative example. This article is intended to aid usability researchers and practitioners in their efforts to advance health information technologies. The article provides broad guidance on usability scenario development and can be applied to a wide range of clinical information systems and applications.	behavior;certification;crew resource management, healthcare;electronic health records;embedded system;embedding;information sciences;information systems;information system;interface device component;open network computing remote procedure call;outlines (document);patients;scientific literature;usability testing	Alissa L.

a25c8592ccf46ae890fbd505e1f8b190beca9224	facilitating ehealth for all through connecting nurses and the women observatory for ehealth		Nurses are at the forefront of health care delivery and are key to health improvements across populations worldwide. They play vital role in the treatment of communicable diseases and in maintaining optimal quality of life for those living with long-term conditions. A number of factors such as an ageing population, a shrinking nursing workforce, inequity and variable access to health services naturally point towards technology-focused solutions. However the uptake of eHealth tools and techniques by nurses and their integration with nursing practice remain patchy, not least because of nurses simply 'not knowing' that good solutions exist. The purpose of this panel is to describe initiatives that seek to identify and showcase good practice in the use of eHealth in nursing.	aging;communicable diseases;delivery of health care;health services;microsoft forefront;population;solutions	Veronique Ines Thouvenot;Nicholas R.

A large, shared skin cancer image database on the Internet will be quite valuable to the medical professionals and consumers. In this paper, a skin cancer image database is created using a three-tier system: a client application implemented in Java applets, a web server, and a backend database server. JDBC-ODBC is used for the web server to communicate with the database server. Various browsing and content-based retrieval methods are supported for the skin cancer image database through web-based graphic user interfaces. A data mining algorithm for finding association rules between different features of the skin cancer images is also implemented.	algorithm;association rule learning;client (computing);data mining;database server;internet;jdbc;java applet;multitier architecture;open database connectivity;server (computing);user interface;web application;web server	Soon Myoung Chung;Qing Wang	2001		10.1109/ITCC.2001.918864	database server;database tuning;image retrieval;computer science;database;view;world wide web;information retrieval;database testing;database design	DB	-50.121836843195624	-60.79860769201485	121086

The system was technically oriented based on the thinclient technology in terms of security enhancement and cost reduction. Formerly a small portion of the patient healthcare information was provided for the counterpart, whereas, by introducing the system, all the electronically formatted information stored in the systems was shared with the professionals so that reduction of duplicated health examinations and improvement of healthcare service in both hospitals were anticipated. The regional medical association with the system would form an ideal model in next generation to achieve virtual full-functioned hospitals providing the best quality of medical services.	epr paradox;excalibur: morgana's revenge;next-generation network;thin client	Shigeki Kuwata;Koji Toda;Kei Teramoto;Hiroshi Kondoh;Hiroshige Nakamura;Hirohiko Murata;Noriaki Tamura;Masahide Ikeguchi	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15515-4_9	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;computer security	HPC	-56.27943136414313	-61.686750110523704	121109
e405527b5642fca8d230b0faeb1d14e9daa8d942	towards a blockchain based fall prediction model for aged care		Falls are one of the major health concerns for the elderly people. These falls often result in severe injuries which lead into huge medical expenses. Over the recent years, many ICT based fall detection and fall prevention solutions emerged to address the risk factors associated with falls. However, despite of these research studies, predicting the likelihood of falls still remains as a huge challenge in both medical and IT research domains. Data related to these risk factors being scattered among different healthcare providers can be attributed as a main reason for this challenge. This is further amplified by healthcare providers being reluctant to disseminate the data beyond their entities due to the security and privacy concerns. However, in recent years, blockchain has been proven as a promising technology to address the security and privacy challenges in healthcare data exchange as it provides a shared, immutable, and transparent audit trail for accessing data. Therefore, in this paper, we are going to propose a conceptual blockchain based fall prediction model leveraging smart contracts and FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard to identify the elderly people who are at a higher risk of falling.

The emergency department (ED) of a hospital in a large US city is used to study how information systems and other coordinating mechanisms affect how physicians choose to perform their work and how such choices can impact the ED’s overall operational performance. The study used direct observation of the work performed in the ED, interviews of physicians, nurses and other ED staff members, and the analysis of historical performance data. The key findings were that the existing coordination mechanisms are a mix of fixed and mobile, computer and paper-based information systems, and other artifacts. The workstyles adopted by physicians were shaped by incidental characteristics of these coordination mechanisms. Some workstyles appear to have adverse, albeit unintended, effects on aspects of the department’s operational performance.	information system;mobile computing	David Tilson;Vera Tilson;Vicken Y.

ff75bf336543e22d8bc6a8c946164f58166712a1	patient-specific computerized outpatient reminders to improve physician compliance with clinical guidelines	bioinformatics;biomedical research	Methods Using existing well-accepted evidence-based national clinical guidelines, a multidisciplinary team created 16 specific reminders within 4 clinical categories: (1) diabetes care (eye exams, HbA1C and cholesterol studies, nursing education visits); (2) therapeutic recommendations (ACE-inhibitor (ACEI) use in diabetic hypertensives; aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin use in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)); (3) expensive medication substitution suggestions (for patients on expensive NSAIDs, H2blockers, statins, ACEIs); and (4) health maintenance (Pap smear, mammogram, cholesterol, Pneumovax). Primary care providers (PCPs) participated in the study if they were active PCPs at our tertiary care institution for the entire 1-year study period (9/989/99). For reminder categories (1)-(3) the PCPs were randomized into control and intervention groups; control groups did not get reminders. For category (4) all PCPs received reminders. Patients were included in the study if they were members of any study PCP's panel for the entire study period. Reminders were generated just prior to office visits and were printed on face-sheets (summaries of patient clinical information) that PCPs receive at the time of patient office visits. The reminders were based on data from our clinical information system and ambulatory electronic medical record, including patient age, gender, problem list, medication list, laboratory data, radiology reports, and visit details. For reminders in categories (1)-(3), we compared, using generalized estimating equations, how often patients received the recommended care items after office visits with intervention versus control PCPs. For reminders in category (4) we compared, using ttests, the percentage of patients in compliance with guidelines at the beginning versus the end of the study.	ace;computer-aided design;information system;pcp theorem;printing;radiology;randomized algorithm;smear campaign	Andrew S.

c03a483fa07cad84885ac5886788a0880cb5ab7c	inferring human behavior using mobile and wearable devices		Mobile, wearable, and ambient sensing is making possible the inference of activities and behavioral patterns of individuals and populations. This data-driven approach to discovery can help determine how these behaviors affect our health, as well as to assist in interventions aimed at promoting the adoption of healthier habits. I describe recent progress in this area, as well as some of the open issues that need to be addressed, and which provide opportunities for future research. These issues include the development and deployment of sensing platforms; identifying activities and behaviors that are relevant to healthcare and that can be inferred with sufficient precision using existing sensors; creating and curating large datasets and associated analysis methods from which strong evidence can be derived; and envisioning novel application scenarios that make use of the behaviors monitored. Several examples are provided to illustrate recent advances and open issues, including the use of pervasive videogames to assess frailty; using wearable devices to detect anxiety in caregivers of people who suffer from dementia; and using crowdsourcing to monitor and modify eating behaviors. Finally, I propose a new frontier in mobile sensing for healthcare, namely, inferring how individuals perceive themselves with respect to others in order to change these perceptions and improve their wellbeing.	algorithm;behavioral pattern;computer science;crowdsourcing;data mining;human–computer interaction;pervasive informatics;population;sensor;smartphone;software deployment;ubiquitous computing;wearable computer;wearable technology	Jesús Favela	2017		10.1145/3126858.3133311	management science;software deployment;data mining;wearable technology;wearable computer;simulation;psychological intervention;computer science;crowdsourcing;behavioral pattern	HCI	-60.95577914435471	-54.57495167045553	121822

This study sought to establish the factors that acted as barriers to the success of an electronic pharmacovigilance reporting system in Kenya 3 years after its implementation.   Materials and Methods Factors that could act as barriers to using electronic reporting systems were identified in a review of literature and then used to develop a survey questionnaire that was administered to pharmacists working in government hospitals in 6 counties in Kenya.   Results The survey was completed by 103 out of the 115 targeted pharmacists (89.5%) and included free-text comments. The key factors identified as barriers were: unavailable, unreliable, or expensive Internet access; challenges associated with a hybrid system of paper and electronic reporting tools; and system usability issues. Coordination challenges at the national pharmacovigilance center and changes in the structure of health management in the country also had an impact on the success of the electronic reporting system.   Discussion Different personal, organizational, infrastructural, and reporting system factors affect the success of electronic reporting systems in different ways, depending on the context. Context-specific formative evaluations are useful in establishing the performance of electronic reporting systems to identify problems and ensure that they achieve the desired objectives.   Conclusion While several factors hindered the optimal use of the electronic pharmacovigilance reporting system in Kenya, all were considered modifiable. Effort should be directed toward tackling the identified issues in order to facilitate use and improve pharmacovigilance reporting rates.		Oscar O. Agoro;Sarah W. Kibira;Jenny V. Freeman;Hamish S. F.

80fa9abf743577871e1824ff6cb95d42054f6e63	introduction to minitrack: pdas, handheld devices, and wireless healthcare environments		Healthcare personnel are a highly mobile population, so the need for portable tools is essential. The continuous proliferation of medical information and research discoveries contribute to the healthcare practitioner’s complex work environment. Immediate access to reference sources that can assist in the decision making process at the point of care is vital. Researchers have shown that when information resources are available, they will be used in decisionmaking. Connectivity to the Internet has been facilitated by the proliferation of wireless networks. These wireless networks and network access modules in PDAs and handheld devices provide an environment for rapid, convenient access to information where it’s needed. The goal of this minitrack is to offer a forum for exploring the many research projects, devices, and applications of PDAs and the use of wireless networks in healthcare. We solicited papers across a wide range of topics, including decision support tools, evaluation studies, innovative applications, evidence-based medicine, and patient to provider communications. This year, the first for this minitrack, four papers are presented.. The first paper, “A Multi-Interface, Multi-Profiling System for Chronic Disease Management Learning,” by Jim Warren, et al., develops a system to facilitate partnerships between patients and providers for the management of diabetes. Handheld devices are used for decision support, data capture and notification of patient concerns in consultation. The system’s architecture implements an approach to patientprovider partnership and integration across platforms, users, and devices. Consultation data integrates with Web-based learning environments for podiatry students and patients. The authors discuss upcoming field trials that will evaluated the system’s usefulness. The second paper, “Development of EvidenceBased Medicine Resources: Bridging Clinical Research to Medical Practice,” by Paul Fontelo, Michael Ackerman and George Kim, reports on a project to provide continuous and ubiquitous access to National Library of Medicine (NLM) information sources (MEDLINE, PubMed, and Clinical Trials) for the mobile physician and healthcare provider to support of the practice of evidence-based medicine. The system consists of wireless networks (802.11b, Infrared, Bluetooth) and applications to search the NLM databases. The authors present their yearlong experience and evaluation of handheld devices; wireless access capabilities and analysis of log access data from servers. They also discuss users’ feedback about the system. The third paper, “Triage of Acute Abdominal Pain in Childhood: Clinical Use of a Palm Handheld in Emergency Department,” by Wojtek Michalowski, et. al, also discusses the use of mobile technologies for evidence-based medicine. The authors develop computerized protocol for the early triage of the abdominal pain patient and implement the protocol as a component of a mobile clinical triage support system called MET (Mobile Emergency Triage). The MET system employs a client-server architecture, with mobile clients running on Palm handhelds. The system provides triage recommendation “on demand”, irrespective of the completeness of the clinical information and allows for data capture and interaction with the hospital’s patients’ database. The fourth paper, “Design and Implementation of a Wireless Prescription System,” by Sherali Zeadally and J. Pan, presents the design and implementation of a J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) architecture for a wireless prescription system. The system provides wireless services to physicians and Webbased services to pharmacies and administrators. The authors present a performance evaluation of the implemented wireless prescription system using latency as the performance metric. They investigated the overheads associated with different components of the underlying J2EE architecture, which includes the Session Bean, Entity Bean and the database.

This system includes a component that is monitoring the rehabilitation training and automatically controls the target load for the exercise on the basis of his or her vital data. The system also detects potentially critical health states and communicates alarms to external users. The component interacts with a personal electronic health record (PHR) that provides additional health related information for the decision making process, as feedback to the user and as an opportunity for physicians to optimize the users exercise plan. The PHR uses current medical informatics standards to store and transmit training data to health care professionals and to provide a maximum of interoperability with their information systems. We have integrated these components in a service oriented platform design that is located in the home environment of the user.	ct pulmonary angiogram;informatics;information system;interoperability;prototype;the quality of life	Axel Helmer;Bianying Song;Wolfram Ludwig;Mareike Schulze;Marco Eichelberg;Andreas Hein;Uwe Tegtbur;R.

This fear often restricts normal daily activities and lowers the quality of life. For elderly people, fear of crime has a practical effect on their activities. Thus, the study of the fear of crime has been one of the important subjects in the victimization study. However, since there was no common agreement on the definition of the fear of crime among researchers, the methodological issues of measuring the fear of crime have been debated for decades. The methods that are most frequently used in measuring fear of rime are victimization surveys and interviews. These methods have inherent limitations of measuring fear of crime particularly with elderly people. This paper explores a new way of measuring fear of crime using a virtual environment from the behavioural aspects. The case study shows the research experiments with the elderly people who make a choice of routes in the virtual environment that replicates the Vancouver Chinatown. The experimental results suggest that this new method of measuring fear of crime using a virtual environment has many benefits particularly when it is used with elderly people. The limitations of this method and the future research are discussed.	experiment;input device;kinect;microsoft windows;motion detector;remote control;the quality of life;virtual reality;wii remote plus	Andrew J.

4196ca4e578c3bc96e87d202367d281f0b56292f	effect of motivation and physical fitness on cyber tasks		Today, and especially in the future, soldiers have to be able to operate and maintain a large variety of devices connected to the cyber domain in whatever environment they are operating in. This places a high demand on soldiers’ cognitive abilities and mechanisms that humans use to process and store information. In this paper we study how motivation, gained by understanding the purpose of tasks connected to the cyber domain and level of physical conditioning affect cognitive abilities. A cognitive test designed for this study contains tasks that are similar to real cyber operations or incidents. The test was conducted three times during a two-week long military exercise where sleep and nutrition were highly reduced and physical activity significantly increased.

Their failure lies on the system design's inability to motivate the patients to voluntarily conduct different activities that could stretch the impaired arm to its limit and help improve its condition. This paper presents the development of a robotic arm which allows the stroke patients' active involvement in their rehabilitation through real-time biofeedback. It also evaluates the condition of the patients based on their performance and sends this feedback so therapists or doctors can monitor patients' improvements. This project espoused a recommended strategy on patient motivation, that is, to embed therapy within the framework that provides patients with monitoring and interaction with therapists. Initiated for the needs of Filipino stroke patients, this paper presents its acceptability in the light of Filipino values.	robotic arm	Matthew Ang;Luke Limkaichong;Winston Perez;Lyka Sayson;Nikka Tampo;Nilo Bugtai;Eppie Estanislao-Clark	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17248-9_42	simulation;medicine;physical medicine and rehabilitation;physical therapy	NLP	-56.76771635796885	-55.64294271895679	122989
c8e33c6b44ce7c93b44366c8a3907fe0745d63a2	archetype development process: a case study of support interoperability among electronic health record in the state of minas gerais, brazil		The interoperability among electronic medical records requires a standard that guarantees the semantic persistency of information. The study proposes an archetypes development process to support the Electronic Health Record (EHR) in the State of Minas Gerais (MG), Brazil. It was case study with a qualitative analysis of applied nature with methodological exploratory purposes. For this, there was a literature review on archetypes development processes. The selected studies had their processes compared. Then, an own archetypes development process was proposed, also considering the legislation of Unified Health System in Brazil (SUS). The process was tested in a proof of concept, a practical test on a theoretical proposal. The proposed governance model was considered adequate for the organization of EHR at SUS in MG. It is expected that with its effective implementation, the proposed process support the interoperability among clinical data arising from different levels of health care services.	interoperability	Thais Abreu Maia;Cristiana Fernandes De Muylder;Zilma Silveira Nogueira Reis	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-77703-0_45	computer security;knowledge management;proof of concept;interoperability;medical record;health care;archetype;medicine;corporate governance;legislation	HCI	-55.83754506098266	-62.79389538916897	123028
9b0b2b3d2d860726a20d0c43325de56b90813f3d	exploring biofeedback with a tangible interface designed for relaxation		Anxiety is a common health issue that can occur throughout one’s existence. In this pilot study we explore an alternative technique to regulate it: biofeedback. The long-term objective is to offer an ecological device that could help people cope with anxiety, by exposing their inner state in a comprehensive manner. We propose a first iteration of this device, “Inner Flower”, that uses heart rate to adapt a breathing guide to the user; and we investigate its efficiency and usability. Traditionally, such device requires user’s full attention. We propose an ambient modality during which the device operates in the peripheral vision. Beside comparing “Ambient” and “Focus” conditions, we also compare the biofeedback with a sham feedback (fixed breathing guide). We found that the Focus group demonstrated higher relaxation and performance on a cognitive task (N-back). However, there was no noticeable effect of the Ambient feedback, and the biofeedback condition did not yield any significant difference when compared to the sham feedback. These results, while promising, highlight the pitfalls of any research related to biofeedback, where it is difficult to fully comprehend the underlying mechanisms of such technique.	focus group;iteration;kohn–sham equations;linear programming relaxation;modality (human–computer interaction);peripheral vision;tangible user interface;usability	Morgane Hamon;Rémy Ramadour;Jérémy Frey	2018		10.5220/0006961200540063	computer science;focus group;human–computer interaction;biofeedback;anxiety;usability;cognition;peripheral vision	HCI	-58.303059058806916	-53.85401670894745	123131

In this letter, we present the response of a group of researchers in the mHealth community to the recent calls for evidence issued by global health and funding agencies. We support our conclusions through a summary of the numerous ongoing mHealth studies listed in the US federal clinical trial registry.   METHODS We conducted a search on the US federal clinicaltrials.gov database using the keywords """"mHealth"""", """"mobile"""" or """"cell AND phone"""" to obtain 1678 results of studies. We manually inspected each result to check if it fit the purview of an mHealth study. Studies that were terminated or withdrawn prior to submission were excluded.   RESULTS We identified 215 unique mHealth studies that were registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database, of which 8.4% (n=18) were observational in nature while the remaining 91.6% (n=197) were interventional. Of the 215 studies, 81.8% (n=176) studies used a classical randomized trial design and 40 new studies were added to the database between May and November 2012 alone. Based on these results, we posit that the field is entering a new 'era' where a body of rigorous evaluation of mHealth strategies is rapidly accumulating.   CONCLUSIONS The transition into an era of evidence-based mHealth supports our position that innovation in this domain can be evaluated with the same rigor as other public health strategies, attenuating some of the hype previously associated with mHealth."""	exclusion;ficd gene;global health;mhealth;randomized algorithm;registration;registries;regulatory submission;rigor - temperature-associated observation	Alain Bernard Labrique;Lavanya Vasudevan;Larry William Chang;Garrett Livingston Mehl	2013	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2012.11.016	biomedical technology;medicine;environmental health;evaluation	SE	-60.073324942882415	-64.3216822167516	123348

At present, assessment about telecardiology application are hard to find, and sometimes can be found in review article about telemedicine, but there is a lack of review on telecardiology application literature. So we reviewed studies regarding telemedicine applications on cardiology specialty.Sixty-one articles were selected, searching the PubMed database for all years the database were available. All considered articles were published on peer reviewed telemedicine and biomedical journals, from 1992 to 2004. We defined an evaluation grid for the articles in our research result set. Each article was reviewed and catalogued, identifying: 1) Article identification, 2) Content description, 3) Telemedicine manifesto classification, 4) Telemedicine system paradigm, 5) Involved actors.Most of the analysed literature referred only to feasibility studies, pilot projects and to short-term outcomes, for example only 21 cases reported a project duration greater than one year.

The purpose of the current study was to conduct a review of published articles that describe the development process of mHealth interventions for patients' cancer care self-management. The review search yielded 11 interventions, reported by 14 manuscripts. The following trends emerged: importance of stakeholder engagement during the development process, addressing the unique needs and experiences of cancer patients and care providers, ensuring user satisfaction with the system, and identifying perceived benefits and limitations of the system. This review provides practical suggestions for mHealth intervention development. Assessments of user perceptions should be both qualitative and quantitative, and researchers should follow an established framework when developing a randomized controlled trial employing mHealth.	apache continuum;cancer patient;computer user satisfaction;development testing;experience;genetic translation process;health behavior;human factors and ergonomics;mobile health;mobile phone;neoplasms;numerous;patients;protocols documentation;randomized algorithm;scientific publication;self care outcome;self-care interventions;self-management (computer science);translational medical research;universities;user-centered design;benefit	Susan Darlow;Kuang-Yi Wen	2016	Health informatics journal	10.1177/1460458215577994	user-centered design;medicine;computer science;knowledge management;nursing;management science	HCI	-59.99048029474082	-62.41013195845984	123366

While the impact of these constructs has been validated using a multitude of methods, there is little work which considers their dynamic interplay in determining behaviour. To this end, an auction setting where participants have shown differences in the first construct (arousal) due to auction dynamics is employed. We test whether the second construct (workload) is also observed under different auction complexities (dynamics and value uncertainty). By means of an experiment, we assess (i) frontal brain activity using EEG for workload, (ii) skin conductance response and heart rate for arousal, and (iii) bidders’ perceptions of workload and arousal using questionnaires. The first results show that high uncertainty and the introduction of a time pressure element leads to higher bids and higher deviations from Risk Neutral Nash Equilibrium (RNNE) strategy. In addition, subjects perceive higher workload under higher complexity, and this (concurs) with their workload index measured through EEG data. Further work will examine the interplay of arousal and workload, and whether only one construct plays a dominant role at a given point, or both act simultaneously.	auction algorithm;conductance (graph);electroencephalography;experiment;nash equilibrium;user interface	Anuja Hariharan;Marc Thomas Philipp Adam;Kai Fuong	2014			financial economics;economics;microeconomics;commerce	HCI	-50.46289690925058	-52.38562085732492	123546

However, little is known about the actual information needs of dentists during treatment sessions. The purpose of this study is to identify general dentists' information needs and the information sources they use to meet those needs in clinical settings so as to inform the design of dental information systems.   METHODS A semi-structured interview was conducted with a convenience sample of 18 general dentists in the Pittsburgh area during clinical hours. One hundred and five patient cases were reported by these dentists. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using thematic analysis with a constant comparative method to identify categories and themes regarding information needs and information source use patterns.   RESULTS Two top-level categories of information needs were identified: foreground and background information needs. To meet these needs, dentists used four types of information sources: clinical information/tasks, administrative tasks, patient education and professional development. Major themes of dentists' unmet information needs include: (1) timely access to information on various subjects; (2) better visual representations of dental problems; (3) access to patient-specific evidence-based information; and (4) accurate, complete and consistent documentation of patient records. Resource use patterns include: (1) dentists' information needs matched information source use; (2) little use of electronic sources took place during treatment; (3) source use depended on the nature and complexity of the dental problems; and (4) dentists routinely practiced cross-referencing to verify patient information.   CONCLUSIONS Dentists have various information needs at the point of care. Among them, the needs for better visual representation and patient-specific evidence-based information are mostly unmet. While patient records and support staff remain the most used information sources, electronic sources other than electronic dental records (EDR) are rarely utilized during patient visits. For future development of dental information or clinical decision-support systems, developers should consider integrating high-quality, up-to-date clinical evidence into comprehensive and easily accessible EDRs as well as supporting dentists' resource use patterns as identified in the study.	bluetooth;categories;convenience sampling;cross-reference;dental records;documentation;edrophonium;freedom of information laws by country;information systems;information needs;information source;information system;occur (action);patient visit;patients;semiconductor industry;support system;transcript	Mei Song;Heiko Spallek;Deborah E Polk;Titus K Schleyer;Teena Wali	2010		10.1186/1472-6947-10-7	health informatics;information needs;clinical decision support system;medicine;knowledge management;qualitative research;nursing;management science;information system	HCI	-59.04246632103799	-64.30665197338254	123637

Problematic smartphone use is a newer manifestation of addictive behaviors. People with anxiety severity (such as PTSD) may be at risk for problematic smartphone use as a means of coping with their symptoms. Unique to our knowledge, we assessed relations between PTSD symptom clusters and problematic smartphone use. Participants (N = 347), recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), completed measures of PTSD and smartphone addiction. Results of the Wald tests of parameter constraints indicated that problematic smartphone use was more related to PTSD's negative alterations in cognitions and mood (NACM) than to PTSD's avoidance factor, Wald χ2(1, N = 347) = 12.51, p = 0.0004; and more to PTSD's arousal compared to PTSD's avoidance factor, Wald χ2(1, N = 347) = 14.89, p = 0.0001. Results indicate that problematic smartphone use is most associated with negative affect and arousal among trauma-exposed individuals. Implications include the need to clinically assess problematic smartphone use among trauma-exposed individuals presenting with higher NACM and arousal severity; and targeting NACM and arousal symptoms to mitigate the effects of problematic smartphone use.	addictive behavior;amazon mechanical turk;amazona;anxiety disorders;arousal;cognition;coping behavior;drug dependence;population parameter;post-traumatic stress disorder;smartphone;stress disorders, traumatic;stress testing;syndrome;the turk;wounds and injuries;mental health	Ateka A.

In the multitasking world of the IA, any one tool cannot be permitted to greedily consume cognitive resources. This situation requires a new approach to usability assessment; one that profiles the moment-by-moment demands placed on embodied cognition by a given software tool during task performance. The approach we have taken relies on families of cognitive models that interleave cognition, perception, and action at the 1/3 to 3 sec timescale. This is the level of analysis where embodied cognition forms interactive routines that adapt to the cost-benefit structure of the software tool. Our proof-of-concept is a model that performs a task that the IAs find challenging. From the trace of the model, we derive a cognitive metrics profile that pinpoints dynamic changes in workload demands on human cognitive, perceptual, or action systems.	cognitive architecture;cognitive model;computer multitasking;embodied cognition;greedy algorithm;programming tool;usability	Wayne D.

The proposed system aims at improving chronic disease management and diabetes in particular using a combination of existing patients' medical sensors, PDAs and PDAs-related Bluetooth technology. This offers a relatively low-cost solution compared to equivalent customized health data acquisition systems. At the patient end, the health data is acquired serially from the medical sensors and sent to the mobile devices using Bluetooth connectivity. The acquired data are then transmitted to a remote health hub using core IP network. Design and implementation of the Wireless Data Acquisition Module WDAM, wireless connectivity protocols, and architecture of the remote health hub applications are presented in this paper. The distributed nature of the proposed system allows for continuous acquisition and monitoring of patients' data anytime, anywhere and by anyone with modest technological background. Likewise, the patient's health providers can continuously monitor the acquired data of their patients for better disease management. Performance of the developed data acquisition system is assessed experimentally and seamless data acquisition and monitoring have been demonstrated.	emergent	Majid A. Al-Taee;Suhail N.

With this it also becomes increasingly important that these systems do not disrupt or delay the working practices of the departments where they are taken into use. Usability evaluations should therefore be employed as part of developing and implementing these systems. We report on a subset of the results from a larger usability study of a electronic whiteboard and find that there are inefficiencies, which could be mitigated by a relatively simple redesign and thus improve the usability of the system.	evaluation;goms;information systems;information system;interactive whiteboard;large;patients;subgroup;surgical replantation;usability testing	Rasmus Rasmussen;André Kushniruk	2013	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-203-5-174	knowledge management;computer engineering;simulation;usability;whiteboard;workflow;medicine	HCI	-60.32446753634784	-63.570909927867284	124497

Instead, their effects are contingent on how the clinical work system, whether computerized or not, shapes health care providers’ performance of cognitive work processes. An application of the human factors paradigm to interview data from two hospitals in the Midwest United States yielded numerous examples of the performance-altering effects of electronic medical records, electronic clinical documentation, and computerized provider order entry. Findings describe both improvements and decrements in the ease and quality of cognitive performance, both for interviewed clinicians and for their colleagues and patients. Changes in cognitive performance appear to have desirable and undesirable implications for patient safety as well as for quality of care and other important outcomes. Cognitive performance can also be traced to interactions between work system elements, including new technology, allowing for the discovery of problems with “fit” to be addressed through design interventions.	contingency (philosophy);documentation;electronic health records;electronics, medical;excalibur: morgana's revenge;health care;human factors and ergonomics;interaction;order management system;patients;programming paradigm;systems design;word lists by frequency;work systems	Richard J.

This is perceived as undesirable for injured people, health care professionals and claims managers, and costly to the health care system, compensation system, workplaces and society. Introducing an Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) decision tool in the workers' compensation system could provide a partial solution, by reducing uncertainty about effective treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate attitudes of health care professionals (HCP) to the potential implementation of an EBM tool in the workers' compensation setting.   METHODS The study has a mixed methods design. The quantitative study consisted of an online questionnaire asking about self-reported knowledge, attitudes and behaviour to EBM in general. The qualitative study consisted of interviews about an EBM tool being applied in the workers' compensation process. Participants were health care practitioners from different clinical specialties. They were recruited through the investigators' clinical networks and the workers' compensation government regulator's website.   RESULTS Participants completing the questionnaire (n = 231) indicated they were knowledgeable about the evidence-base in their field, but perceived some difficulties when applying EBM. General practitioners reported having the greatest obstacles to applying EBM. Participants who were interviewed (n = 15) perceived that an EBM tool in the workers' compensation setting could potentially have some advantages, such as reducing inappropriate treatment, or over-servicing, and providing guidance for clinicians. However, participants expressed substantial concerns that the EBM tool would not adequately reflect the impact of psychosocial factors on recovery. They also highlighted a lack of timeliness in decision making and proper assessment, particularly in pain management.   CONCLUSIONS Overall, HCP are supportive of EBM, but have strong concerns about implementation of EBM based decision making in the workers' compensation setting. The participants felt that an EBM tool should not be applied rigidly and should take into account clinical judgement and patient variability and preferences. In general, the treatment approval process in the workers' compensation insurance system is a sensitive area, in which the interaction between HCP and claims managers can be improved.	attitude;decision making;evidence-based medicine;health care;heart rate variability;judgment;nervous system neoplasms;offset binary;package manager;pain management;paperwork;patients;web site;worker compensation	Nieke A.

Prolonged chronic stress leads to burnout and other negative conditions impairing health, e.g. increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease [1, 20]. Self-assessing and managing stress is not easy. While some people naturally master stress awareness and coping, others need assistance to do it well. To bridge that gap, this research combines aspects of ubiquitous computing and clinical psychology [28], e.g. smartphone sensing methods [17] and smart wearables, to evaluate a novel data collection method applicable in social sciences and mental health. We leverage widely spread personal computing capabilities of smartphones, to study the potential contributions of external observers (a.k.a. peers) to assess important emotional states, and moods of a person.	personal computer;smartphone;ubiquitous computing;wearable computer	A Berrocal;Katarzyna Wac	2018		10.1145/3267305.3267319	multimedia;human–computer interaction;well-being;in situ;computer science	HCI	-59.24578646143497	-55.22580133304971	125271

DESIGN Direct observational study of 529 acute visits with 27 experienced pediatric clinician users.   MEASUREMENTS For each 20 s interval and at each stage of the visit according to the Davis Observation Code, we recorded whether the physician was communicating with the family only, using the computer while communicating, or using the computer without communication. Regression models assessed the impact of clinician, patient and visit characteristics on overall visit length, time spent interacting with families, and time spent using the computer while interacting.   RESULTS The mean overall visit length was 11:30 (min:sec) with 9:06 spent in the exam room. Clinicians used the EMR during 27% of exam room time and at all stages of the visit (interacting, chatting, and building rapport; history taking; formulation of the diagnosis and treatment plan; and discussing prevention) except the physical exam. Communication with the family accompanied 70% of EMR use. In regression models, computer documentation outside the exam room was associated with visits that were 11% longer (p=0.001), and female clinicians spent more time using the computer while communicating (p=0.003).   LIMITATIONS The 12 study practices shared one EMR.   CONCLUSIONS Among pediatric clinicians with EMR experience, conversation accompanies most EMR use. Our results suggest that efforts to improve EMR usability and clinician EMR training should focus on use in the context of doctor-patient communication. Further study of the impact of documentation inside versus outside the exam room on productivity is warranted.	documentation;electronic health records;electronics, medical;excalibur: morgana's revenge;interaction;maxima and minima;medical records;patient visit;patients;primary health care;usability;standards characteristics	Alexander G.

Initial data suggests that at least 1 out of 5 Iraq War veterans are exhibiting symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD. Virtual Reality (VR) delivered exposure therapy for PTSD has been previously used with reports of positive outcomes. The current paper is a follow-up to a paper presented at IEEE VR2006 and will present the rationale and description of a VR PTSD therapy application (Virtual Iraq) and present the findings from its use with active duty service members since the VR2006 presentation. Virtual Iraq consists of a series of customizable virtual scenarios designed to represent relevant Middle Eastern VR contexts for exposure therapy, including a city and desert road convoy environment. User-centered design feedback needed to iteratively evolve the system was gathered from returning Iraq War veterans in the USA and from a system deployed in Iraq and tested by an Army Combat Stress Control Team. Results from an open clinical trial using Virtual Iraq at the Naval Medical Center-San Diego with 20 treatment completers indicate that 16 no longer met PTSD diagnostic criteria at post-treatment, with only one not maintaining treatment gains at 3 month follow-up.	design rationale;stress testing;user-centered design;virtual reality	Shih-Ching Yeh;Brad Newman;Matt Liewer;Jarrell Pair;Anton Treskunov;Greg Reger;Barbara O.

To improve PHR's capability and usability, we previously proposed the concept of intelligent PHR (iPHR). By introducing and extending expert system technology and Web search technology into the PHR domain, iPHR can automatically provide users with personalized healthcare information to facilitate their daily activities of living. Our iPHR system currently provides three functions: guided search for disease information, recommendation of home nursing activities, and recommendation of home medical products. This paper discusses our experience with iPHR as well as the open issues, including both enhancements to the existing functions and potential new functions. We outline some preliminary solutions, whereas a main purpose of this paper is to stimulate future research work in the area of consumer health informatics.		Gang Luo;Chunqiang Tang;Selena B.

09142692d548282363be32bb4be14ae911fb6d86	the effect of aging on visual attention shifting in collaborative document editing		Many tasks, including driving, require frequent shifts in visual attention. Some visual shifting of attention is due to distraction from a secondary task, or from non-task relevant stimuli in the environment. Older people (e.g. over 60) are generally slower to react to stimuli and less skillful in learning to use new technologies. In this paper we are interested in studying the effect of age on the ability to shift visual attention in a task that involves computer use. An experiment is reported involving 10 participants, five who were over the age of 60 and five who were in their twenties and thirties. A collaborative editing task was carried out where participants, run one at a time, had to edit a document in real-time based on comments made by three research assistants (who were not participants for purposes of data collection). In one condition participants had to constantly shift their visual attention from a desktop computer they were using to a large shared screen where the research assistants made editing suggestions and used a laser pointer to indicate which part of the document (shown on the large shared screen) they were referring to. As expected, time to perform each editing task increased in the two-screen (vs. one screen) condition. However, the amount of slowing due to the use of two screens for the task was considerably greater for the older group. The results are interpreted in terms of the use of redesigned tools and technologies to assist older workers perform more effectively.	collaborative software;desktop computer;pointer (computer programming);real-time transcription	Patricia Duangcham;Vajirasak Vanijja;Sachi Mizobuchi	2017		10.1145/3041021.3054932	collaborative editing;world wide web;data collection;computer science;distraction;emerging technologies;multimedia	HCI	-50.13085312194465	-54.74594503428496	125843

ET is a condition that is particularly troublesome during the use of computer programs that require good mouse control. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hardware and software versions of a smoothing filter labeled the Tremor Control Mouse (TCM) could provide short- and/or long-term benefits for individuals who have difficulty using a computer because of ET of the hands. A paired-samples t-test revealed significant differences (p<.05) between participants' responses to ease-of-use questions regarding traditional mouse use compared to TCM use. Subjective responses to survey items on TCM advantages, disadvantages, and helpfulness were very positive overall and reflected the participants' belief that the TCM was a useful device in enhancing mouse control and, consequently, computer use.

The protocol provides a standardized mechanism to connect hardware and software by the transfer of coordinate transforms, images, and status messages. MeVisLab is a framework for the development of image processing algorithms and visualization and interaction methods, with a focus on medical imaging.   METHODS The paper describes the integration of the OpenIGTLink network protocol for IGT with the medical prototyping platform MeVisLab. The integration of OpenIGTLink into MeVisLab has been realized by developing a software module using the C++ programming language.   RESULTS The integration was evaluated with tracker clients that are available online. Furthermore, the integration was used to connect MeVisLab to Slicer and a NDI tracking system over the network. The latency time during navigation with a real instrument was measured to show that the integration can be used clinically.   CONCLUSIONS Researchers using MeVisLab can interface their software to hardware devices that already support the OpenIGTLink protocol, such as the NDI Aurora magnetic tracking system. In addition, the OpenIGTLink module can also be used to communicate directly with Slicer, a free, open source software package for visualization and image analysis.	algorithm;aurora;clients;communications protocol;computer hardware;dna integration;image analysis;image processing;imagery;information governance;mevislab;medical imaging;open-source software;the c++ programming language;tracking system;message	Jan Egger;Junichi Tokuda;Laurent Chauvin;Bernd Freisleben;Christopher Nimsky;Tina Kapur;William M.

One recommended approach for achieving this goal is to build high quality data collection and reporting systems to facilitate evidencebased practice (EBP), which emphasizes the importance of using the solid evidence available to make optimal clinical decisions. In this project, we conducted interviews and a survey with clinicians to understand their perceptions and expectations on such data collection and reporting systems. Based on the obtained results, we created an integrated platform using mobile and web technologies for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) intervention. A usability study was conducted to evaluate the integrated platform and compared the platform to other existing data collection and reporting approaches. The study results indicated that our platform provides a better approach for supporting data collection, integration, and reporting, as well as streamlining the workflow of AAC clinical service delivery.	advanced audio coding;display resolution;itil;mhealth;usability testing;x86	Erhhsuan Wang;Leming Zhou;Bambang Parmanto;Valerie J.

b9f5db703f1e6d93492d4ae3dce3dc8d596ea75a	why clinicians use or don't use health information exchange	health information exchange	"""In the March 2011 issue of the journal, Vest et al published one of the first empirical studies of clinicians' usage of a health information exchange (HIE). 1 The setting for this study was the emergency department (ED). The ED is one important place where an HIE may have an impact on patient care because many emergency patients are unfamiliar to ED facilities and important clinical information is often missing. 2 Surprisingly, Vest et al found that HIE usage was much lower for patients who were new to an ED facility compared with familiar patients. The authors suggest that 'for the familiar patient, HIE might provide clinicians and organizations the necessary information to get and keep these patients out of the ED.' However, they do not explain why the HIE was not used as often for the new patient, which the authors call the 'poster child for justifying HIE in the ED setting.' Why would clinicians use an HIE less often for new patients? I would like to suggest an explanation: the clinicians did not find the HIE helpful. The clinicians may have only accessed the HIE when they felt they had tried everything else but the patient kept returning to the ED. This interpretation is supported by the overall usage rate: the HIE was accessed in only 2.3% of all encounters, a rate which should be considered low if information is missing in approximately 32% of ED visits, as one study found. 2 Furthermore , the authors observed a 'degradation of (HIE) usage over time,' which also suggests that some clinicians were not finding useful information and may have given up on the HIE altogether. If it is true that the ED clinicians did not generally find the HIE helpful, it would be important to understand why, which might be accomplished through qualitative means such as interviews. Findings from such a study might also be applicable to HIE usage in other care settings. As HIE is a new technology, it is important to apply both quantitative and qualitative methods to understand the factors that affect usage. Quantitative measures 'may be useful, but they need to be grounded in qualitative data so that their meaning can be understood.'

55717e0eafb2272afc5c6a2997f01019828d3aa8	physics-based modeling of crowd evacuation in the unity game engine		Crowds of people are often found in enclosed or constricted spaces. Evacuation in such situations is usually conducted calmly, but real or perceived danger may trigger panic. In panicked crowds, the interpersonal distance crowd members normally observe is often overwhelmed by the physical pressure of crowd members pushing against each other. That pressure can both slow evacuation and lead to injury or death. Models have been developed to study crowd evacuation in a range of situations. This paper describes the implementation, testing, and validation of a crowd evacuation model using Unity, a commercial computer game engine. A realistic physics-based model of crowd movement that calculates and considers the physical pressure crowd members exert on each other was implemented in Unity. The implemented model was tested under both nonpanicked and panicked scenarios; those tests exhibited known qualitative characteristics of such scenarios. The model was then quantitatively validated by comparing its results to...	game engine;unity	Walter Alan Cantrell;Mikel D. Petty;Samantha J L Knight;Whitney K.

cdd5467801a29e57da32406a6400ff7c5c81a3ce	special issue on reproducible research for biomedical informatics		Reproducible research is of significant concern for researchers, clinical practitioners, and patients globally [1,2]. To further the scientific method and improve health outcomes, practices and processes for true reproducibility extend beyond the methods section of a journal article and into the references as well as the availability of a specific time-stamped repository and databases: query code, research protocols, software code and versioning, datasets, metadata, and more [3]. Given the protected nature of much biomedical research, reproducible research in this domain is complicated, yet still necessary to treat and solve real-world health issues. Though the success of clinical care and trials is heavily dependent upon the validity and reliability of previous research [4], the practices and methods that researchers use to improve the reproducibility of their research is not well documented. The inability to replicate and reproduce research published in prestigious journals is an area of growing significance [5–8]. Given the potential translation of this research to patient bedside practices, and the need to ensure the most effective use of research funds, high-quality, thorough research methods, workflows and documentation are a necessity for all empirical, computational and analytical research [9]. Much has been published in specific domains about theoretical practices for ensuring research validity. Landis [10] outlines a core set of reporting standards of rigorous study design for preclinical research involving animal studies that cover topics such as randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling. Similarly, in the area of psychology, workflows for testing the reproducibility of research are coming to fruition [11]. Yet, the practical methods actually used within the biomedical informatics domain are not well documented or have not historically been positioned within the reproducible research framework. For example, metadata are a strong component of facilitating reproducible research, and the Journal of Biomedical Informatics has previously published on metadata, as a mechanism to facilitate interoperability [12]. Additionally, documentation of information has been covered in various articles within the Journal of Biomedical Informatics [13]. Fields also either within the scope of biomedical informatics but with other primary journals (e.g., imaging informatics [14]), as well as those with overlapping collaborations within biomedical informatics (e.g., biostatistics [15] and computational science [16]) have already published on this topic. Finally, reproducibility hinges not only on the availability of the documentation, analyses, and data, but on the ongoing accessibility and viability of the files and documents, enhanced through a process of curation. Biocuration enables information discovery and retrieval, maintains quality, adds value, and provides for re-use over time through activities including authentication, archiving, management, preservation, and representation [17]. Much published research has focused on the workflows and case studies for conducting text mining to extract data from published literature as a process of biocuration [18–20], yet this is a limited view of curation, and does not support quality information provenance. Within this context of reproducible research for biomedical informatics, we encourage you to submit articles about methods to support, improve, validate, or assess the reproducibility of biomedical informatics research.

In particular, specialized program accreditation is purported to enhance program quality. This exploratory study used a nationwide mail questionnaire to a stratified random sampling of 100 department heads of the units administering baccalaureate Computer Science programs. The purpose was to gain an understanding of how Computer Science programs and departments were related to selected indicators of faculty and program quality. Several differences and some similarities exist between the accredited and non-accredited groups. The median of the data for each indicator suggested a quality breakpoint to be used in defining two indices. It was found that for each of the two indices, the accredited group outperformed the non-accredited group by thirty percent. The implication is that Computer Science programs that follow accreditation guidelines have the potential for increasing their quality indicators.	breakpoint;computer science;monte carlo method;sql;sampling (signal processing);stratified sampling	Evelyn P.

Such knowledge provides a basis for designing systems for providing complementary health information. This article discusses how patientsu0027 conceptualizations of their health-information-related preferences, motivations, and needs are linked to the perceived role of medical records as an informational artifact. We identified seven subject positions: P1 Hypothetically positive to e-health services generally, P2 Positive to reading medical records due to implications, P3 Positive to all Internet use including medical records online, P4 Distrustful and wants to be in control of health treatment, P5 Worried about health, P6 Wants communication with health care professionals, and P7 Do not understand their medical record. These subject positions can explain the worry and enthusiasm documented in earlier literature. The diversity of subject positions implies that health care information services should be planned with different subject positions in mind rather than a simple demographic group. Special attention needs to be given to finding flexible solutions that address the opportunities and worries of the identified subject positions.	medical privacy	Isto Huvila;Åsa Cajander;Mats Daniels;Rose-Marie Åhlfeldt	2015	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23343	human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;information retrieval;technology	NLP	-60.697397932441746	-58.56218568098756	127560

However, few studies have evaluated the extent to which healthcare professionals can readily understand and interpret these data. This study explored associations between measures of graph literacy and numeracy in home care nurses from two agencies (N=195) with comprehension of quality targets presented in a graphical dashboard format. Data were collected using an online survey. Results from linear regression models indicated that nurses' levels of graph literacy and numeracy were positively associated with comprehension of quality targets. Nurses with low levels of both graph literacy and numeracy tended to have the lowest target comprehension scores compared to those who had high levels of both graph literacy and numeracy. Nurses with low graph literacy and high numeracy also had significantly lower scores for comprehension of quality targets compared to those with high graph literacy and numeracy. These findings suggest that developers of clinical dashboards that incorporate quality target information need to evaluate users' ability to understand the information displayed in graphs and tables before they release the product for general use in healthcare settings.	data table;graph - visual representation;graphical user interface;home care of patient;information needs;list comprehension;mental association;nevus sebaceous	Dawn Dowding;David Russell;Karyn Jonas;Nicole Onorato;Yolanda Barrón;Jacqueline Merrill;Robert J.

b4794034a09e0b34251be79bae80fba846be6662	evaluating the usability of a wearable social skills training technology for children with autism spectrum disorder		Affecting 1 in 68, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social skill impairments. While prognosis can be significantly improved with intervention, few evidence-based interventions exist for social skill deficits in ASD. Existing interventions are resource-intensive, their outcomes vary widely for different individuals, and they often do not generalize to new contexts. Technology-aided intervention is a motivating, low-cost, and versatile approach for social skills training in ASD. Although early studies support the feasibility of technology-aided intervention, existing approaches have been criticized for teaching social skills through human-to-computer interaction, paradoxically leading to increased social isolation. To address this gap, we propose a system to help guide human-to-human interaction called Holli, a wearable technology to serve as a social skills coach for children with ASD. The Google Glass-based application listens to conversations and prompts the user with appropriate social responses. In this paper, we describe a usability study we conducted to determine the feasibility of using wearable technology to prompt children with ASD throughout social conversations. Fifteen children with ASD (mean age = 12.92 ± 2.33, verbal intelligent quotient = 103.3 ± 18.73) used the application while engaging in a restaurant-themed interaction with a research assistant. The application was evaluated on its effectiveness (i.e., how accurately the application responds), efficiency (i.e., how quickly the user and the application respond), and user satisfaction (based on a post-session questionnaire). All users were able to successfully complete the 10-turn exchange while using Holli. The results indicated the Holli accurately detected and recognized user utterance in real time. Participants reported positive experiences of using the application. To the best of our knowledge, this system is the first technology-aided intervention for ASD that employs human-to-human social coaching, and our results demonstrate the device is a viable medium for treatment delivery.	computer user satisfaction;glass;usability testing;wearable computer;wearable technology	Ben G.

Methods Items were developed based on literature review and a preliminary study. After expert consultations and pilot testing, a 20-item scale was administered in January-June 2017 to 517 staff nurses from 19 tertiary-level general hospitals in Metro Manila, Philippines. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to evaluate construct validity. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the predictive validity of SCWS on perceived work productivity.   Results EFA results show that 15 out of 20 items loaded on five factors: communication with clinicians via call and text, communication with doctors via instant messaging, information seeking, communication with nurses via instant messaging, and communication with patients via call and text. CFA results suggest that the five factors that form SCWS have adequate fit to the data, thus supporting construct validity. SEM results suggest predictive validity since SCWS was positively associated with perceived work productivity.   Conclusions The 15-item SCWS showed satisfactory psychometric properties for use in future studies. These studies can focus on identifying factors associated with nurses' use of smartphones for work purposes.	confirmatory factor analysis;consultation;exploratory factor analysis;exploratory testing;futures studies;hospitals, general;information seeking;instant messaging;patients;smartphone;structural equation modeling;tertiary	John Robert Bautista;Sonny Rosenthal;Trisha Tsui-Chuan Lin;Yin Leng Theng	2018	Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA	10.1093/jamia/ocy044		HCI	-62.18624464034101	-63.74368146444044	128300
c41590e99bcfb3ec139b0ea341ffdb4c253b27ec	a reconfigurable wireless environment for ecg monitoring and encryption		Connected health is the convergence of medical devices, security devices, and communication technologies. It enables patients to be monitored and treated remotely from their home or primary care facility rather than attend outpatient clinics or be admitted to hospital. Patients’ data and medical records within a connected health system should be securely transmitted and saved for further analysis and diagnosis. This paper presents a reconfigurable wireless system for electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring which can be deployed in a connected health environment. Efficient field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation for the ECG encryption block has been carried out on the RC10 prototyping board using the advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm. Results presented have shown that the proposed AES implementation outperforms the existing FPGA-based systems in different key performance metrics and that ECG signals acquired using the VitalSens device can be encrypted/decrypted in real-time. A software based evaluation approach has been also performed to validate the proposed hardware implementation. The proposed solution can be deployed for electronic archiving of health records information systems and health monitoring technologies in personalized medicine.	encryption	Abbes Amira;Mazen A. R.

8ba8ed829acea146270a5def80077726a81a1966	using clinical and computer simulations to reason about the impact of context on system safety and technology-induced error		This paper describes how simulations can be used to reason about the impact of user interface design features in exploring the effect of different contexts of use on the occurrence of technology-induced errors. The paper describes our approach in several phases, using an example from the analysis of technology-induced errors in medication administration. In the initial phase a clinical simulation is conducted to gather baseline data on the occurrence of technology-induced error using the technology under study. In this phase of the study, data arising from the clinical simulation are collected and then analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess the relationship between aspects of interface design (i.e. usability problems) and rates of technology-induced error. In the next phase, the base rates for error associated with specific types of usability problems (from the initial phase) form the input into computer-based mathematical simulations. This approach links clinical simulations with computer-based simulations and demonstrates the potential impact of aspects of interface design and contextual factors upon medical error along with the implications for correcting interface design issues.

Especially, mobile devices have attracted attention due to their capability to transfer autonomy from care providers to patients to promote patients’ health improvement. This study focuses on the selffeedback that enables patients to manage their own health information, and investigates its effects on patients’ continued use of mobile personal health record (mPHR) applications using log-data of 1,727 mPHR app users. The results show that the frequent use of the self-feedback function encourages patients to use the app for a long time and be less likely to abandon the mPHR app whereas other functions do not. The results are striking since the proportion of use of the self-feedback function is just 9% of the total usage. This research suggests significant implications regarding the efficacy of self-feedback to promote health improvement.	feedback;mobile device	Hyeyon Kwon;Kyunghee Lee;Byungtae Lee	2014			public relations;simulation;multimedia	HCI	-60.10215349612295	-57.0544226290775	128498

Despite its ubiquity, there are no open, noncommercial platforms for interactive management, sharing, and analysis of these data. WaveformECG addresses this unmet need. Accessed through a browser, WaveformECG extracts ECGs from vendor files, storing them as a time series with other analysis results and annotations in an open source time-series database. It supports interactive invocation of multiple analysis algorithms on selected ECG datasets, visualization of ECG waveforms, manual annotation of time points and intervals in ECG waveforms, and automated annotation of analysis results using standard medical terminology. Integration with the I2B2 clinical data warehouse system enables bidirectional exchange of data between these two platforms.	addresses (publication format);clinical data;electrocardiography;heart diseases;imagery;nomenclature;open-source software;time series;algorithm	Raimond L.

This price tag results, in part, from advances in expensive medical technology, including new drug therapies, and the increased use of high-cost services and procedures. Many policymakers, industry experts, and medical practitioners contend that the U.S. health care system-in both the public and private sectors-is in crisis. Efforts are underway to convert all medical records from paper to electronic. This manuscript uses the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as a lens to interpret the responses of physicians completing their residency in family medicine regarding use and adoption of electronic medical record systems (EMR).	excalibur: morgana's revenge	Kenneth J.

d92c8d72bc93d4ea96ac93c000dd0e689857ac6a	attributions of morality and mind to artificial intelligence after real-world moral violations		Abstract The media has portrayed certain artificial intelligence (AI) software as committing moral violations such as the AI judge of a human beauty contest being “racist” when it selected predominately light-skinned winners. We examine peopleu0027s attributions of morality for seven such real-world events that were first publicized in the media, experimentally manipulating the occurrence of a violation and the inclusion of information about the AIu0027s algorithm. Both the presence of the moral violation and the information about the AIu0027s algorithm increase participantu0027s reporting of a moral violation occurring in the event. However, even in the violation outcome conditions only 43.5 percent of the participants reported that they were sure that a moral violation occurred. Addressing whether the AI is blamed for the moral violation we found that people attributed increased wrongness to the AI – but not to the organization, programmer, or users – after a moral violation. In addition to moral wrongness, the AI was attributed moderate levels of awareness, intentionality, justification, and responsibility for the violation outcome. Finally, the inclusion of the algorithm information marginally increased perceptions of the AI having mind, and perceived mind was positively related to attributions of intentionality and wrongness to the AI.	artificial intelligence	Daniel B.

The results showed remarkable similarities in the concerns of patients, families, users and other stakeholders. However, different terminologies across the fields highlighted the gulf between the fields, with professional 'silo-ing' of expertise occurring.

01740d0fc1a1044c1de80ce662416a3c7a3b98c6	using patient journey modelling to visualise the impact of policy change on patient flow in community care		Health policy plays a crucial role in community care, particularly within care programs such as ComPacks. ComPacks is a short-term care program administered by New South Wales (NSW) department of health which runs for up to 6-weeks and its goal is to prevent or minimise hospital readmission. Compliance to the ComPacks health policies is required in order to gain financial support from overnment bodies, however when the Government makes changes to service policies, this may potentially cause ripple effects to the workflow of the service and increase pressures on care providers, which in turn may affect the patient. Utilising a multi-layer visualisation tool can help identify whether changes made to policy are impacting patient flow in a positive or negative way. This research study investigates the use of an emerging patient journey modelling technique to better understand service design in a community care setting, whilst also determining the impact of State-level policy interventions.	health policy;layer (electronics);numerous;patients;ripple effect;while;women's health services	Rosemary Sayvong;Joanne Curry	2015	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-564-7-429	knowledge management;health policy;critical pathways;hospital readmission;service design;workflow;nursing;psychological intervention;government;medicine	HCI	-60.64340588434403	-61.935216627520006	130323
6661081cb7fca6a86061bceb9b824e5c349a70b1	"""the """"safety net"""" of community care: leveraging gis to identify geographic access barriers to texas family planning clinics"""		The Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) is developing a civilian referral system to address specialty access issues to VHA healthcare. Homeless women Veterans may not have the resources to navigate referral systems when travel to VHA Medical Centers (VAMCs) is limited, especially for family planning needs. Recent Texas legislation restricted funding to civilian, publically-funded family planning clinics, limiting comprehensive services. This study's goal was to assess geographic availability of VAMCs and family planning clinics for homeless Texan women Veterans. We identified 3,246 Texan women Veterans, age 18-44y with administrative homelessness evidence anytime between 2002-2015. Significant clusters of homeless women Veterans were near VHA facilities, yet mean travel distance was 24.1 miles (range 0-239) to nearest family planning clinic compared to 82.6 miles (range 0.8316.4) to nearest VAMC. Community clinics need ongoing civilian funding support if the VHA is to rely on their geographic availability as a safety net for vulnerable Veterans.	clinic;crew resource management, healthcare;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;geographic information systems;medical records systems, computerized;patient referral	Lori Gawron;Warren B.

According to the classic view, inferences about common ground, or mutual knowledge, are guided by beliefs about the physical, cognitive, and attentional states of one's communicative partners. Here, we provide a first test of the attention assumption for common ground, the proposal that common ground for a co-present entity-such as an object or an utterance-can only be formed if a person has evidence that his or her partner has also attended to it. In three experiments, a participant speaker and two partners learned names for novel monster pictures as a group. The speaker was then asked to describe the monsters to each partner separately in a referential communication task. The critical manipulation was the (in)attentiveness of one partner at different points in the study. Analysis of the speaker's referring expressions revealed that speakers assumed their partner shared common ground for the monster names only when that partner exhibited engaged attention as the names were learned. These findings provide key and novel support for the classic proposal that formation of common ground critically depends on assumptions about the attentional state of one's conversational partner.

At the same time new forms of reimbursement encourage greater collaboration among providers and their patients. These twin imperatives have led to the rapid development and adoption of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), a more facile approach to representing and sharing health data based on familiar, standard technologies widely used by other industries and a potential universal health app platform. This paper explains FHIR and the impact it will potentially have on patient-physician collaboration.	fast healthcare interoperability resources;sensor	Mark L.

However, since the studies that successfully used text messages for encouraging physical activity were all short term (10 days to 3 weeks) and conducted with a small sample (n≤15), we do not know if people will not be motivated by these technologies after the novelty effect dies. In this paper, we present the results from a study conducted for a longer term (3 months) with a larger sample size (n=28) to discover if text messages are effective for encouraging physical activity once the novelty effect of the technology wears off. We chose a population of young adults (age 18-24) as they are one of the heaviest users of text messages. Measures of analysis included number of steps, message ratings, level of motivation and interviews. Our findings suggest that text messages are a good way for encouraging physical activity in young adults, even after the novelty effect wears off.	exercise;large;mobile phone;mobile phone;persuasive technology;text messaging;the third manifesto;trichotillomania;young adult;message	Adity U.

Warfighters currently conduct operations such as Improvised Explosive Device (IED) interrogation, and Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) surveillance and reconnaissance with various unmanned systems. Integration of unmanned weapon systems into human Fire Teams represents the next evolution in mixed-initiative teams.  Such integration aims to improve individual and team performance; however, improved understanding and application of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) principles within combat environments is required. The research presented investigates the impact upon individual and team performance when a non-autonomous unmanned weapon system is integrated into a human Fire Team.  Studies were conducted at two U.S. Army installations involving 36, four-person Fire Teams. At the first location, participants included pre-deployed novice soldiers, and the second installment included experienced soldiers as participants. All soldiers had previous weapon experience using an M16 rifle and M240B machine gun.  Two conditions were compared: Fire Teams fully manned by human Warfighters and Fire Teams where one human Warfighter was replaced by a remotely operated weapon. Each team consisted of four members: one M240B Gunner and three M16 Rifleman. The teams completed simulated missions utilizing the Engagement Skills Trainer 2000 (EST 2000), a virtual training simulator that executes various mission scenarios. The Fire Teams completed two different scenarios, each consisting of a manned and unmanned condition. In the unmanned condition, the Gunner operated a remotely operated weapon from a separate location. Performance was primarily measured by recording the total number of targets hit by each team member during scenario execution. Paired samples t-tests revealed significant differences in individual performance from the manned to unmanned conditions. Individual Riflemen improved performance from manned to unmanned scenarios. However, the Gunners significantly decreased in performance when operating the remote weapon system during the unmanned condition. Team performance did not reveal a significant difference in performance across conditions.  This paper describes the experimental plan and methodology, followed by a discussion of experimental results and recommendations for future mixed-initiative team research.	aerial photography;autonomous robot;human–robot interaction;robotics;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle;unmanned spacecraft	Eric Ortiz;Stephanie J.

This system is an example of privacy-aware design that addresses specific risks based on gerontology literature and confirmed by focus groups with representations of the target group. The design emphasizes data transparency, minimizes data collection and storage, and balances elder control with elder risks. By being event-driven, this monitor enables a caregiver to react more efficiently than with passive monitoring technologies such as traditional security cameras. By reducing cognitive load, the system empowers caregivers, and allows them to provide a higher quality of care -- thus allowing the elder to remain in their home as long as possible. We make innovative use of arguably the most pervasive communications infrastructure -- the cellular network -- to enhance elder autonomy without sacrificing their privacy.	closed-circuit television;event-driven architecture;event-driven programming;focus group;pervasive informatics;privacy	John F R Duncan;L.

For some older people, age-related declines to physical, cognitive or social wellbeing can negatively impact on their emotional wellbeing, as can the notion of growing older, the loss of a spouse, a loss of sense of purpose or general worries about coping, becoming ill and/or death. Yet, within the field of technology design for older adults to support independence, emotional wellbeing is often overlooked. In this paper we describe the design process of an application that supports older adults in monitoring their emotional wellbeing, as well as other parameters of wellbeing they consider important to their overall health. This application also provides informative and useful feedback to support the older person in managing their wellbeing, as well as clinically-based interventions if it is determined that some action or behaviour change is required on the part of the older person. We outline findings from a series of focus groups with older adults that have contributed to the design of the YourWellness application.	focus group;information	Julie Doyle;Brian O'Mullane;Shauna McGee;R.

f0aa1146536c140d257d4e544ec9ebb1cad033a5	developing an approach for aggregating information from a ehr into a fully structured patient summary		BACKGROUND Providing healthcare professionals with adequate access to well-filled electronic patient records and health-related information contributes to an improvement of the treatment process. Compared to conventional Electronic Medical Records these EHR systems commonly contain more medical artifacts due to their cross institutional, multipurpose use cases. Physicians and health professionals are therefore concerned about information overflow.   OBJECTIVES Goal of this paper is to elaborate new concepts for the automated aggregation of a fully-structured patient summary document based on information extracted from documents which are published in large-scale EHRs.   METHODS The first step was the conduction of semi-structured group interviews with experts and customers. This was followed by a qualitative literature analysis. Consequently technical and medical standards in the field of interoperability were screened.   RESULTS The result of this paper is the elaboration of an architectural approach to integrate an automatic patient summary creation into well established workflows of large ehealth projects based on standard IHE XDS infrastructures, taking the Austrian ELGA as an example.	elga;extraction;fill;information overload;interoperability;medical records systems, computerized;morphologic artifacts;patients;projection screen;scientific publication;semiconductor industry;standards characteristics	Patrick Mangesius;Samrend Saboor;Thomas Schabetsberger	2016	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-645-3-113	system integration;knowledge management;ehealth;medical record;health care;interoperability;health information exchange;workflow;medicine;use case	HCI	-53.6709857065832	-64.88584669303836	131501

They could support senior citizens with reminders, thus promoting their independent living and quality of life, especially in the presence of several chronic diseases (multimorbidity). In this context, this article proposes a service model for personalised medical support that is able to provide adequate healthcare service by means of a hybrid robot-cloud approach. This service was quantitatively and qualitatively tested to assess the technical feasibility and user acceptability level of the service. The service was tested with 23 older people (65–86 years) in the DomoCasa Lab (Italy). This study demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed hybrid cloud solution and the usability and acceptability were positively evaluated thus confirming the ability to utilise these innovative technologies for active and healthy ageing.

c038a9eb5968ccefe7353d21f58f4f5be70132fc	defining dimensions of patient satisfaction with telemedicine: an analysis of existing measurement instruments		As telemedicine usage continues to grow there is a need to ensure the means are available to evaluate their success. Patient satisfaction can play a key role in determining the success of telemedicine projects. However, satisfaction remains loosely defined and there are no commonly accepted views on what it consists of. A lack of well-defined dimensions for measuring telemedicine satisfaction can make it difficult to interpret and compare results. By using a grounded theory approach for the analysis of existing patient satisfaction instruments, this research has identified several dimensions for describing patient satisfaction with telemedicine. In an effort to define these dimensions, this research examines their relationship to the existing telemedicine, information systems, and healthcare literature. In total 18 first level constructs, and 4 second order constructs were created for describing these dimensions and are defined in this research.	information system	Robert Garcia;Olayele Adelakun;Wencui Han	2017			user experience design;computer user satisfaction;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;information system	SE	-61.4654763068809	-61.3195483429317	131709

Effective fertility treatment requires continuous monitoring of a wide range of health indicators through self-tracking. The process of collecting and interpreting data and information about fertility is complex, and much of the burden falls on women. In this study, we analyzed patient-generated content in a popular online health community dedicated to fertility issues. The objective was to understand the process in which women engage in tracking relevant information, and the challenges they face. Leveraging the Personal Informatics Model, we describe women's self-tracking experiences during their fertility cycles. We discuss how a complex and highly personalized context leads to responsibility, pressure, and emotional burden on women performing self-tracking activities, as well as the role of collaboration in creating individualized solutions. Finally, we provide implications for technologies aiming to support women with fertility care needs.	cab direct (database);informatics;personalization;spatial variability;tracking system	Mayara Costa Figueiredo;Clara Caldeira;Tera L.

An example of these difficulties relates to choosing an appropriate medical specialty and among specialists. Owing to the lack of structural healthcare services, there is the need for guidance in selecting the most appropriate diagnosis and medicine for patients with various symptoms or physical disabilities, the need to educate patients on self-treatment procedures, the need to reduce the high cost of treatment and diagnosis, the need to address boring procedures of diagnosis and treatment, the lack of adequate strategic planning due to the absence of valuable information about patients, the problems connected with unnecessary traffic congestion, and many more. Together, these problems create a great opportunity for the expert analysts to ameliorate the healthcare system in these countries by applying new methods, such as using web-based programs and data mining DM. This article focuses on the use of software, healthcare data warehouse and the application of DM to generate models for solving the aforementioned problems.

The crucial question of what makes these tasks so difficult, however remains unanswered. Various hypotheses include inefficiency in sharing information leading to decisions based on incomplete information or cognitive inefficiencies in processing and storing information arriving in a piecemeal fashion. The present study attacks this problem from two directions. Human experiments are used to compare decisions between groups manipulated to receive and share information in raw and aggregated forms and mixed groups comprised of humans and software agents. To shed light on cognitive limitations that may affect performance, an ACT-R cognitive model of group members was constructed and its results compared to human data.	act-r;cognitive model;experiment;human-based computation;sensemaking;software agent	Yuqing Tang;Christian Lebiere;Katia P.

These warehouses contain heterogeneous information from all medical specialties that offer patient care services. It is increasingly difficult to manage large volumes of data in a specific clinical context such as quality coding of medical services. The document-based Not Only SQL (NO-SQL) model can provide an accessible, extensive and robust coding data management framework while maintaining certain flexibility. This paper focus on the design and implementation of a big data-coding warehouse, it also defines the rules to convert a conceptual model of coding into a document-oriented logical model. Using that model, we implemented, analyzed a big data-coding warehouse via the Mongodb database, and evaluated it using data research mono- and multi-criteria and then calculated the precision of our model.	adobe streamline;big data;data management;genetic heterogeneity;information system;medical information systems;medical records systems, computerized;medical specialities;nosql;numerous;rule (guideline);sql	Joseph Noussa Yao;Didier Heudes;Patrice Degoulet	2018	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-868-6-105	data mining;big data;medical classification;computer science	DB	-54.260256266017585	-64.2154679363265	133346

To guarantee the compatible extensibility of the relative health system, standards which manage and send information from the users of PHDs have been defined recently by the Continua Alliance, IEEE Standards Association, and the IEEE-EMBS affiliated 11073 Personal Health Data Working Group. ECG device is a typically one and is widely used in the monitoring and diagnosing of heart disease. Part 10406 is a device specialization of basic ECG, 1- to 3-lead ECG, and approved by IEEE 11073 Standards Committee until September 2011 [1]. We designed a 3-lead ECG system, which might be the first ECG device based on the 11073-10406 and android platform. Such a device could increase the interconnectivity of the ECG system.		Zhuqing Q.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients who agreed to participate in the HIE program were compared to those who did not. Patient characteristics associated with HIE enrollment were examined using a multivariable logistic regression model. Variables selected for inclusion were guided by a health care utilization model adapted to explain HIE enrollment. Data about patients' sociodemographics (age, gender), comorbidity (Charlson index score), utilization (primary and specialty care visits), and access (distance to VHA medical center, insurance, VHA benefits) were obtained from VHA and HIE electronic health records.   RESULTS Among 57 072 patients, 6627 (12%) enrolled in the HIE program during its first year. The likelihood of HIE enrollment increased among patients ages 50-64, of female gender, with higher comorbidity, and with increasing utilization. Living in a rural area and being unmarried were associated with decreased likelihood of enrollment.   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Enrollment in HIE is complex, with several factors involved in a patient's decision to enroll. To broaden HIE participation, populations less likely to enroll should be targeted with tailored recruitment and educational strategies. Moreover, inclusion of special populations, such as patients with higher comorbidity or high utilizers, may help refine the definition of success with respect to HIE implementation.		Brian E.

Recently, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Saudi Arabia, implemented various IT systems in multiple clinical and administrative departments leading to major transformation in healthcare workflows and business processes. At the pharmacy department, many Healthcare-IT alignment challenges are still perceived. Information about challenges of strategic alignment were gathered using qualitative survey methods, through conducting semi-structures interviews, to collect opinions, experiences and suggestions. Findings were first validated, according to published literature and research work, then sorted into fourteen challenges categorized into four main areas and recommended solutions: 1) Improving organizational communication, 2) Enhancing organizational governance, 3) Specifying the alignment scope and building the architecture and 4) Developing organizational and human skills.	alignment;behavior;business process;categorization;electronic health records;experience;fourteen;order management system;radiology information systems;recommender system;scientific publication;semiconductor industry	Sahar Alsharif;Nabila Benslimane;Mohamed Khalifa;Colin Price	2018	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-880-8-207	business;knowledge management;health care;information technology;strategic alignment	HCI	-60.043686664189394	-63.054448054144736	133893

A cooperative response is one that not only corrects the user's mistaken belief, but also addresses the missing or mistaken user beliefs that led to it. Responding appropriately to a potentially incorrect user belief is presented as a process of 1. checking whether the advisor holds the user's belief; 2. confirming the belief as a misconception by finding an explanation for why the advisor does not hold this belief; 3. detecting the mistaken beliefs underlying the misconception by trying to explain why the user holds the incorrect belief, and 4. providing these explanations to the user. An explanation is shown to correspond to a set of advisor beliefs, and searching for an explanation to proving whether various abstract configurations of advisor beliefs hold. A taxonomy of domain-independent explanations for potential user misconceptions involving plan applicability conditions, preconditions, and effects is presented.	norm (social);precondition;race condition;sensor;taxonomy (general);user (computing)	Alex Quilici;Michael G.

Age related diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), require close monitoring and assessment. A home-based assessment tool, which collects information on people's hand and finger movements, has been developed. It is intended that movement difficulties such as bradykinesia and rigidity can be identified through the use of this tool. Remote monitoring of this home based tool has the potential to decrease the number of clinic/hospital visits a person with PD requires. Two groups of 10 people took part in an evaluation of this system. One group were persons with PD and the other were without PD. Results showed that 70% of the control group completed the tool within 30 seconds compared to only 30% in the PD group. The tool endeavours to make the assessment of PD more objective.

33e5126b8b912dd00c27198bad749238ee59b9d5	share and enjoy: anatomical models database—generating and sharing cardiovascular model data using web services		Sharing data between scientists and with clinicians in cardiac research has been facilitated significantly by the use of web technologies. The potential of this technology has meant that information sharing has been routinely promoted through databases that have encouraged stakeholder participation in communities around these services. In this paper we discuss the Anatomical Model Database (AMDB) (Gianni et al. Functional imaging and modeling of the heart. Springer, Heidelberg, 2009; Gianni et al. Phil Trans Ser A Math Phys Eng Sci 368:3039–3056, 2010) which both facilitate a database-centric approach to collaboration, and also extends this framework with new capabilities for creating new mesh data. AMDB currently stores cardiac geometric models described in Gianni et al. (Functional imaging and modelling of the heart. Springer, Heidelberg, 2009), a number of additional cardiac models describing geometry and functional properties, and most recently models generated using a web service. The functional models represent data from simulations in geometric form, such as electrophysiology or mechanics, many of which are present in AMDB as part of a benchmark study. Finally, the heartgen service has been added for producing left or bi-ventricle models derived from binary image data using the methods described in Lamata et al. (Med Image Anal 15:801–813, 2011). The results can optionally be hosted on AMDB alongside other community-provided anatomical models. AMDB is, therefore, a unique database storing geometric data (rather than abstract models or image data) combined with a powerful web service for generating new geometric models.	aerodrome mapping database;benchmark (computing);binary image;community;comstock–needham system;database-centric architecture;electronystagmography;functional imaging;heart ventricle;mechanics;models, anatomic;simulation;springer (tank);web service	Eric Kerfoot;Pablo Lamata;Steven Niederer;Rod D.

Identify data and information nurses need to be recorded in order to maintain the continuity and quality of nursing care and the efficiency of nursing performance is a research question that is moving professionals around the world. This study objective is to describe the analysis of nursing documentation in the patient records.   METHODS It is a retrospective study. The study was conducted in the ambulatory occupational health nursing; it was selected 111 patient records. Of these, in 106 we identified a total of 775 nursing records. The nursing records comprise the following dimension: identification, job history, health state, health and safety, psychological e socio- cultural, medical history, physical examination and nursing assessment.   RESULTS In the data set elements found as documented in the subjective data and objective data, there was higher frequency of data elements related to the following nursing dimensions: health state, health and safety, physical examination and nursing assessment. The dimension of job history we found that 25% of the nursing records did not documented information about the current work status of the patient. In addition, the current job activity 20.77% of the records), working day 9.03% of the records), job process 8.13% of the records), worksite exposure 8.0% of the records), environmental works 6.19% of the records), occupation 5.81% of the records), job time 4.39% of the records), before job activity 4.13 % of the records), and work location 3.23% of the records) were not also documented.   CONCLUSION In conclusion, the present study was an attempt to highlight the importance of data to be documented and organized in the existing information systems in the specific area of occupational health care. The adequate data collected can provide the right information to improve nursing care in this care setting and enhance health population.	breast feeding;care given by nurses;discipline of nursing;document completion status - documented;documentation;health care;information systems;information system;nursing assessment;nursing records;occupational health services;patients;physical examination;population;scott continuity;occupational health specialty;standards characteristics	Denise Tolfo Silveira;Heimar F.

However, despite the availability of numerous commercial products, the wider acceptance of these systems has been hampered by concerns about diagnostic performance and a perceived lack of transparency in the process of generating clinical recommendations. This resonates with the Learning Health System paradigm that promotes data-driven medicine relying on routine data capture and transformation, which also stresses the need for trust in an evidence-based system. Data provenance is a way of automatically capturing the trace of a research task and its resulting data, thereby facilitating trust and the principles of reproducible research. While computational domains have started to embrace this technology through provenance-enabled execution middlewares, traditionally non-computational disciplines, such as medical research, that do not rely on a single software platform, are still struggling with its adoption. In order to address these issues, we introduce provenance templates - abstract provenance fragments representing meaningful domain actions. Templates can be used to generate a model-driven service interface for domain software tools to routinely capture the provenance of their data and tasks. This paper specifies the requirements for a Decision Support tool based on the Learning Health System, introduces the theoretical model for provenance templates and demonstrates the resulting architecture. Our methods were tested and validated on the provenance infrastructure for a Diagnostic Decision Support System that was developed as part of the EU FP7 TRANSFoRm project.

ND is a representational tool that addresses the need for unambiguous annotation, storage, and retrieval of data associated with the treatment and study of neurological diseases. ND is being developed in compliance with the Open Biomedical Ontology Foundry principles and builds upon the paradigm established by the Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS) for the representation of entities in the domain of disease and medical practice. Initial applications of ND will include the annotation and analysis of large data sets and patient records for Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.   DESCRIPTION ND is implemented in OWL 2 and currently has more than 450 terms that refer to and describe various aspects of neurological diseases. ND directly imports the development version of OGMS, which uses BFO 2. Term development in ND has primarily extended the OGMS terms 'disease', 'diagnosis', 'disease course', and 'disorder'. We have imported and utilize over 700 classes from related ontology efforts including the Foundational Model of Anatomy, Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, and Protein Ontology. ND terms are annotated with ontology metadata such as a label (term name), term editors, textual definition, definition source, curation status, and alternative terms (synonyms). Many terms have logical definitions in addition to these annotations. Current development has focused on the establishment of the upper-level structure of the ND hierarchy, as well as on the representation of Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. The ontology is available as a version-controlled file at http://code.google.com/p/neurological-disease-ontology along with a discussion list and an issue tracker.   CONCLUSION ND seeks to provide a formal foundation for the representation of clinical and research data pertaining to neurological diseases. ND will enable its users to connect data in a robust way with related data that is annotated using other terminologies and ontologies in the biomedical domain.	alzheimer's disease;annotation;basic formal ontology;cerebrovascular accident;class;digital curation;disease ontology;disease progression;entity;foundational model of anatomy;gene ontology;hematological disease;issue tracking system;level structure;multiple sclerosis;norsk data;ontology (information science);ontology for biomedical investigations;paget's disease, mammary;patients;programming paradigm;proteomics;representation (action);strigiformes;web ontology language;nervous system disorder	Mark Jensen;Alexander P.

c6c9e083123c0e6cd9e2031d6bfae9363ce6e9fe	the role and benefits of accessing primary care patient records during unscheduled care: a systematic review		BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of accessing primary care records on unscheduled care. Unscheduled care is typically delivered in hospital Emergency Departments. Studies published to December 2014 reporting on primary care record access during unscheduled care were retrieved.   RESULTS Twenty-two articles met inclusion criteria from a pool of 192. Many shared electronic health records (SEHRs) were large in scale, servicing many millions of patients. Reported utilization rates by clinicians was variable, with rates >20% amongst health management organizations but much lower in nation-scale systems. No study reported on clinical outcomes or patient safety, and no economic studies of SEHR access during unscheduled care were available. Design factors that may affect utilization included consent and access models, SEHR content, and system usability and reliability.   CONCLUSIONS Despite their size and expense, SEHRs designed to support unscheduled care have been poorly evaluated, and it is not possible to draw conclusions about any likely benefits associated with their use. Heterogeneity across the systems and the populations they serve make generalization about system design or performance difficult. None of the reviewed studies used a theoretical model to guide evaluation. Value of Information models may be a useful theoretical approach to design evaluation metrics, facilitating comparison across systems in future studies. Well-designed SEHRs should in principle be capable of improving the efficiency, quality and safety of unscheduled care, but at present the evidence for such benefits is weak, largely because it has not been sought.	accident and emergency department;electronic health records;futures studies;generalization (psychology);information model;medical records;patients;population;primary health care;scientific publication;systematic review;systems design;theory;usability;benefit	Tom Bowden;Enrico W.

Unfortunately, it remains limited by high burdens. We examine unlock journaling as an alternative. Specifically, we build upon recent work to introduce single-slide unlock journaling gestures appropriate for health and wellness measures. We then present the first field study comparing unlock journaling with traditional diaries and notification-based reminders in self-report of health and wellness measures. We find unlock journaling is less intrusive than reminders, dramatically improves frequency of journaling, and can provide equal or better timeliness. Where appropriate to broader design needs, unlock journaling is thus an overall promising method for in situ self-report.	diaries;field research;human–computer interaction;patient self-report;sim lock;ubiquitous computing;notification	Xiaoyi Zhang;Laura R.

9acab8cca3fa65783d96df0c11929975fad4cc1a	big data in healthcare- the promises, challenges and opportunities from a research perspective: a case study with a model database		Recent advances in data collection during routine health care in the form of Electronic Health Records (EHR), medical device data (e.g., infusion pump informatics, physiological monitoring data, and insurance claims data, among others, as well as biological and experimental data, have created tremendous opportunities for biological discoveries for clinical application. However, even with all the advancement in technologies and their promises for discoveries, very few research findings have been translated to clinical knowledge, or more importantly, to clinical practice. In this paper, we identify and present the initial work addressing the relevant challenges in three broad categories: data, accessibility, and translation. These issues are discussed in the context of a widely used detailed database from an intensive care unit, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database.	accessibility;big data;categories;data collection;data mart;electronic health records;informatics (discipline);infusion pump;mimic;medical devices;monitoring, physiologic;intensive care unit	Mohammad Adibuzzaman;Poching DeLaurentis;Jennifer Hill;Brian D.

This paper reports on the main findings from sub-studies and pilots prior to the implementation of patients' access to their medical records in large-scale in the Northern Norway Region. The largest pilot included nearly 500 patients. Data for the participatory design process was collected through questionnaires and interviews. The results revealed that the service in general functioned as expected. The patients reported that they would continue to use the service, recommend it to others, and generally had no problems in understanding the content.

One common approach utilizes electronic clinical alerts to prompt clinicians when certain interventions are due for individual patients being seen. However, these alerts have not been consistently effective, particularly for less visible (though important) conditions such as hearing loss (HL) screening.   Materials and Methods We conducted hour-long cognitive task analysis interviews to explore how family medicine clinicians view, perceive, and use electronic clinical alerts, and to utilize this information to design a more effective alert using HL identification and referral as a model diagnosis.   Results Four key direct barriers were identified that impeded alert use: poor standardization and formatting, time pressures in primary care, clinic workflow variations, and mental models of the condition being prompted (in this case, HL). One indirect barrier was identified: electronic health record and institution/government regulations. We identified that clinicians' mental model of the condition being prompted was probably the major barrier, though this was often expressed as time pressure. We discuss solutions to each of the 5 identified barriers, such as addressing physicians' mental models, by focusing on physicians' expertise rather than knowledge to improve their comfort when caring for patients with the conditions being prompted.   Conclusions To unleash the potential of electronic clinical alerts, electronic health record and health care institutions need to address some key barriers. We outline these barriers and propose solutions.

The video animation was produced following recommendations from medical staff involved in the diagnosis. Images taken from the animation decorated the hospital ward, to bring the video characters to life in the children’s minds. Finally, standard diagnosis of sleep disorders was performed by means of polysomnography on two groups of children: a reference and an evaluation group. Both parents and children responded to questionnaires that measured their satisfaction and the perception of their experiences. Preliminary findings extracted from the polysomnography showed that the videos helped to relax nervous children, especially sensitive to the hospital environment, and shortened Sleep Onset Latency and Non-REM latency. Besides, the responses to the questionnaires suggested that the video also reassured the parents whose moods helped the children to accept their hospitalization.	experience;interrupt latency;onset (audio);video clip	Blanca Guinea;Mario Alaguero;Fernando Melgosa;Andrés Bustillo	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40651-0_2	psychology;simulation;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-57.277412289148174	-54.49847959001396	135453

Similarly, a post-surgical patient may be discharged from a medical facility to their house, which electronically facilitates their recuperation and promotes recovery. Smart environments are making the task of providing assistive technology in the home easier and more affordable. Near-field communication (NFC) has become popular in recent years. Increasing uptake of NFC-enabled smartphones has opened a new avenue to facilitate creation of a smart environment without the need for significant infrastructure. HTML5 is the latest version of the hypertext markup language, with unique code that enables access to advanced features on a smartphone. Proprietary apps can potentially be inconvenient and inconsistent and may even decrease uptake of the technology. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to enable NFC tags and NFC smartphones in conjunction with HTML5 backbone code, to be used for smart environments in home health care applications without the need for specific applications to be installed on the smartphone. Results show significant promise with just the built in phone software with use of NFC and HTML5 for various applications of smart environments. In many common tasks in a smart environment that increase patient safety, NFC tags can be not only informative, but an integral component of the system by triggering specific HTML5 code to provide appropriate responses - without the need to install specialized apps as long as the NFC is enabled in the mobile device.	algorithm;assistive technology;broadcast television systems;data acquisition;dynamical system;html;html5;hard coding;home automation;hypertext;information;internet backbone;markup language;mobile device;near field communication;personalization;sensor;smart environment;smartphone;stealth;tag (metadata)	Luke Russell;Rafik A.

This persuasion process is usually affected by several elements, like the ability of the speaker in formulating logical arguments, her confidence with respect to the discussed topic, and the emotional solicitation that certain arguments may cause in the audience. In this study, we compare the effect of using one of the three well-known persuasion strategies (Logos, Ethos and Pathos) in the argumentation process. These strategies are used by a moderator who influences the participants during the debates. We study which persuasion strategy is the most effective, and how they vary according to two mental metrics extracted from electroencephalograms: Engagement and workload. Results show that the right hemisphere has the highest engagement when Logos arguments are proposed to participants with Neutral opinion during the debate. We show also that the Logos strategy solicits the highest mental Workload, and the Pathos strategy is the most effective to use in argumentation and to convince the participants.		Mohamed S.

Personalized e-health services hold many promises, e.g. the improvement of health care quality or the reduction of costs. However, such services can't tap their full potential if they will not be used. That's why it is essential to understand what brings potential users to accept them. In the literature many acceptance models exist that predict the usage of innovations, but none of them specifically refers to the adoption of e-health services. Therefore we combined the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the e-health literacy concept and enhanced the resulting model with additional factors. MEDLINE® was searched; 75 studies were included for final analysis. Apart from the UTAUT variables and e-health literacy, 10 additional factors were identified: anxiety, trust, attitude toward using, computer self-efficacy, perceived system quality, search strategy, user's condition, health specific knowledge, Internet dependency and satisfaction with medical care. Future research will include the devolvement of an instrument for assessing these factors and testing the initial research model in an international context.

Regional economic, political and social integration bring new challenges in the management of these diseases, many of which are treatable. Information Communication Technology (ICT) applied through electronic health systems has the potential to strengthen healthcare service delivery and disease surveillance within these countries. This paper discusses the importance of well-defined e-Health strategies within countries and, in addition, proposes that countries within regions collaborate in planning for health information exchange across borders. It is suggested that particular attention be paid to technical and data standards enabling interoperability, and also to issues of security, patient privacy and governance.	communicable diseases;health information exchange;itil;information system;interoperability;medical privacy;radiology information systems;standards characteristics	Tungamirirai Simbini;Rosemary Foster;Paul Nesara;Carola Hullin Lucay Cossio	2010	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-588-4-401	knowledge management;information system;medicine	ML	-58.05201376333427	-61.469878871759015	136267

Clinicians are urged to keep hospital stays as short as possible, also in Obstetrics and Gynaecology Departments. At present stabilized high-risk pregnant women stay in hospital for the sole purpose of being monitored.   METHOD In this retrospective study the cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring of such high-risk pregnant women was calculated by analyzing the data of 456 episodes originating from 415 patients of the Ghent University Hospital.   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS It was determined that telemonitoring made a cost-reduction of euro 145,822 per year possible. However, variables such as educational level, psychosocial situation, time-travel distance from home to the hospital, reimbursement system and actual clinical status were not included. Furthermore, the Belgian health authorities does not provide for a specific code to allow the billing of teleinterpretation of transmitted results.	cost effectiveness;electronic billing;euro currency;gynecology;health care;patients;disease transmission	Heidi Buysse;Georges De Moor;Georges Van Maele;Erik Baert;Geert Thienpont;Marleen Temmerman	2008	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2007.08.009	information and communications technology;cost-effectiveness analysis;medicine;cost–benefit analysis;nursing;emergency medicine;medical emergency;law;health care	HCI	-59.174449107192004	-63.709011653737974	136521

Internet of things (IoTs) and the proliferation of smart devices are offering many opportunities that raise the need to standardise protocols for their interoperability and interaction languages for their management. This study proposes EUDroid, a system composed of a mobile application and an IoT device used as a pill reminder to allow the patients to correctly take their prescribed drugs. A web server stores and manages the therapies that can be defined by the end users. The web server also manages the communication between the app and the device. In order to validate the management of the therapies, a formal language has been proposed. It describes the behaviour of different components of the IoT device, such as LEDs or buzzers, and defines when, with which delay, and for how long time a given event will last, to manage technical concepts related to smart devices for supporting them in following therapies more accurately.	formal language	Paolo Buono;Fabio Cassano;Alessandra Legretto;Antonio Piccinno	2018	IET Software	10.1049/iet-sen.2017.0347	computer engineering;real-time computing;end user;interoperability;web server;computer science;formal language;internet of things	SE	-58.62876856781165	-58.56813298989294	136684

This paper reports on one function, namely the development and testing of data exchange for continuity of nursing care for oncology patients. The proof of principle was carried out using system analysis, requirements setting, system design, system development and experiment with the application of Health Level 7 version 3 Care Record electronic message. A successful testing of the Care Record message was conducted, using a case based data-subset for oncology nursing care including personal data, pain, weight and vital signs, among others.   CONCLUSION The development illustrated that the system components facilitate electronic data exchange from hospital to home care, allowing home care nurses to use received clinical data in their local system. In an incremental approach this data exchange can be enhanced to meet all data and all systems requirements.	breast feeding;discipline of nursing;health level 7;home care of patient;increment;pain;patients;personally identifiable information;requirement;scott continuity;structure of mandibular nerve;subgroup;system analysis;systems design	Mitchell Duim;Frank Boterenbrood;William T.

I argue that other emotions, such as disgust, are responsible for moral judgment, and that humans are able to make moral judgments without empathy. Autistic individuals are of interest because they are said to lack empathy, yet display some form of morality. Thus, empathy cannot be the core motivator in moral judgment.	humans;marginal model	Nalini Ramlakhan	2014			cognitive psychology;moral psychology;moral reasoning;social psychology;psychology;moral disengagement;social cognitive theory of morality;simulation theory of empathy;moral authority;empathy;moral development	HCI	-52.54325765460517	-53.31722060464069	136905

We then focus on the types of clinical data, discuss where vocabularies are employed, and consider various challenges that confront those who design and maintain controlled vocabularies, as well as those who use them. Biomedicine has a large number of partially redundant vocabularies that have evolved for different purposes, and we discuss how the National Library of Medicine's UMLS project attempts to merge these into a single resource. We introduce Extensible Markup Language (XML), provide a brief tutorial and describe pitfalls that can lead to its inappropriate use. Finally, we discuss the problems in designing and implementing biomedical standards, providing both a historical perspective as well as relating such issues to similar ones in information technology.

This study discusses the effectiveness of occupational therapy when given to dementia patients of different contexts. The results of this study showed that patients of a good condition in the first stage present a more positive attitude towards participation in the occupational therapy designed by the institution; therefore, they have a greater chance of their condition improving or remaining the same. However, patients of an average condition have a more passive attitude towards taking part in any therapy; therefore, they have a greater chance of their condition deteriorating. In conclusion, occupational therapy has an effect on all kinds of patients.

However, producing evidence of sufficient quantity and quality is hampered by the high cost and complexity of conducting research, the numbers of clinicians and patients willing to participate in clinical trials. The Learning Healthcare System initiative creates routes for knowledge transfer between different parts of the health system, thereby increasing its research and learning capacity. This effort is closely aligned with initiatives such as CDISC that are working on standards for computational clinical trial definitions. Transform project builds upon existing state-of-the-art technologies for reusing clinical information routinely captured in Electronic Health Record systems, to facilitate conduct of clinical trials in primary care. This paper presents the modeling part of the Transform method for building such a Learning Healthcare System and addressing the integration of clinical trials into the routine clinical practice, thereby reducing cost and complexity of the task.	complexity;display resolution	Sarah N.

This process needs to include an exhaustive examination of the literature to ensure that the subject has been thoroughly investigated. To conduct a thorough and unbiased systematic review, a variety of bibliographic databases must be searched. Limiting a search to one database is likely to result in overlooking studies relevant to the review. For example, an examination of eight systematic reviews found that a search of MEDLINE alone would have resulted in missing 20% of the studies included in the reviews (Whiting, Westwood, Burke, Sterne, & Glanville, 2008). Earlier research (Savoie, Helmer, Green, & Kazanjian, 2003) on the increased effectiveness of searching specialized databases in addition to MEDLINE found that “an important number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were missed by the major database search” (p.168). Stevinson and Lawlor (2004) compared the articles found by searching large, general databases to those located through searches of subject-specific databases, such as PsychInfo or SportDiscus, to evaluate the results for a systematic review in exercise therapy. They found that the benefit from searching additional databases was worth the time involved to ensure adequate coverage of the topic. Additionally, systematic reviews with a global view need to represent all countries. To achieve such global representation, searches must be conducted beyond EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database) or MEDLINE (Betrán, Say, Gülmezoglu, Allen, & Hampson, 2005).	bibliographic database;embase;medline;psycinfo;randomized algorithm;systematic review;william l. burke	Li Quankai;Guo Ming	1994		10.1007/3-540-58476-5_125	physical medicine and rehabilitation;physical therapy	DB	-60.618126562757446	-64.48688350623196	137535

However, an anecdotal barrier exists between radiologists and IT staff that can hinder the delivery of this care, either by lengthening the time required to solve problems with the IT infrastructure or not bringing critical issues to the IT staff’s attention. We first created a survey of the radiologists and IT staff in our department to investigate this barrier, and found that there was, at baseline, a significant difference in how one group viewed the other, and, at times, there were irrational expectations from either party of what their counterparts were responsible for or capable of. We then instituted a shadowing project, whereby radiologists shadowed IT staff and vice versa, in order to give each group a better understanding of the others’ daily workflows. We gave the participants a post-intervention survey to assess their experiences, which were markedly positive. In one case, an IT issue regarding pre-fetching of cardiovascular studies was, in fact, solved during the shadowing session.	baseline (configuration management);experience;file shadowing;radiology;shadowing (histology);therapeutic shadowing	Adam Kaye;Tessa S.

Little is known about how young children reason about free will, and if this reasoning is affected by the surrounding cultural context. In this study, U.S. and Chinese 4and 6-year-olds were asked if people could choose to inhibit or act against their desires. U.S. children attributed more choice to people than Chinese children for the inhibition question type but not the action question type. There was a significant age by ethnicity interaction, with ethnicity differences significant at age 6, but not at age 4. Children from both cultures did attribute more choice to other people than they did to themselves. These results suggest that folk intuitions of free will undergo change in early childhood and that this change is, at least in part, influenced by culturally variable factors.	spatial variability	Adrienne Wente;Sophie Bridgers;Alison Gopnik;Xin Zhao;Liqi Zhu;Elizabeth Seiver	2014				HCI	-53.068398330138216	-53.46183115492331	137927

We analyzed 12 videos of simulated resuscitations to characterize trauma team monitor use. To structure our observations, we adopted the feedback loop concept. Our results showed that the monitor was used frequently, especially by team leaders and anesthesiologists. We identified three patterns of monitor use: (i) periods with a low frequency of short looks (glances) to maintain overall process awareness; (ii) periods with a medium frequency of long looks (scrutiny) to monitor trends in patient status; and (iii) peaks with a high frequency of glances to maintain attention on both the patient and monitor during critical tasks. Approximately 75% of looks were 3 seconds or shorter, but many looks (25%) ranged between 3 and 26 seconds. Our results have implications for improving displays by presenting the status of the patient's physiological systems and team activities.	feedback;resident monitor	Diana S.

There is growing interest in supporting CHWs at the point-of-care through the application of mobile-health or mHealth platforms. Despite the promise of these technologies, there is a lack of substantive evidence regarding the impacts of mHealth tools on healthcare service delivery and whether these tools are adequately designed to fit with the intended healthcare service tasks, thereby enhancing CHW workflow efficiencies. To address this gap, the study aims to (i) determine a relevant set of dimensions along which to evaluate healthcare service task and mHealth tool characteristics, and (ii) use these dimensions to theorize and test a Task-Technology Fit model to predict mHealth tool use and CHW performance. Data was collected from 312 CHWs in the counties of Siaya, Nandi, and Kilifi, in Kenya using a survey instrument. Findings show that """"fit' as the covariation between healthcare service task and mHealth tool characteristics will result in increased mHealth tool use and enhanced CHW performance in the Kenyan context.

52c26edfb60cd5d5f4367bb75628a5e369ed03f2	zimbabwe's human resources for health information system (zhris) - an assessment in the context of establishing a global standard	workforce surveillance;human resources for health hrh;global public health informatics;human resources information systems hris;data standards;health workforce registry;minimum data set mds	"""INTRODUCTION There have been numerous global calls to action to utilize human resources information systems (HRIS) to improve the availability and quality of data for strengthening the regulation and deployment of health workers. However, with no normative guidance in existence, the development of HRIS has been inconsistent and lacking in standardization, hindering the availability and use of data for health workforce planning and decision making (Riley et al., 2012). CDC and WHO partnered with the Ministry of Health in several countries to conduct HRIS functional requirements analyses and establish a Minimum Data Set (MDS) of elements essential for a global standard HRIS. As a next step, CDC advanced a study to examine the alignment of one of the HRIS it supports (in Zimbabwe) against this MDS.   METHOD For this study, we created a new data collection and analysis tool to assess the extent to which Zimbabwe's CDC-supported HRIS was aligned with the WHO MDS. We performed systematic """"gap analyses"""" in order to make prioritized recommendations for addressing the gaps, with the aim of improving the availability and quality of data on Zimbabwe's health workforce.   RESULTS The majority of the data elements outlined in the WHO MDS were present in the ZHRIS databases, though they were found to be missing various applicable elements. The lack of certain elements could impede functions such as health worker credential verification or equitable in-service training allocation. While the HRIS MDS treats all elements equally, our assessment revealed that not all the elements have equal significance when it comes to data utilization. Further, some of the HRIS MDS elements exceeded the current needs of regulatory bodies and the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MOHCC) in Zimbabwe. The preliminary findings of this study helped inspire the development of a more recent HRH Registry MDS subset, which is a shorter list of priority data elements recommended as a global standard for HRIS.   CONCLUSION The field-tested assessment methodology presented here, with suggested improvements to the tool, can be used to identify absent or unaligned elements in either an HRH Registry or a full HRIS. Addressing the prioritized gaps will increase the availability of critical data in the ZHRIS and can empower the MOHCC and councils to conduct more strategic analyses, improving health workforce planning and ultimately public health outcomes in the country."""	alignment;credential;data collection;database;decision making;deploy;functional requirement;gap analysis;health manpower;human resource management system;information system;mds matrix;minimum data set;registries;subgroup;verification of theories	Keith P.

ae810d6bddbfba87e4fae86627d613512b7bd333	development and verification of an alcohol craving-induction tool using virtual reality: craving characteristics in social pressure situation	virtual reality	Alcoholism is a disease that affects parts of the brain that control emotion, decisions, and behavior. Therapy for people with alcoholism must address coping skills for facing high-risk situations. Therefore, it is important to develop tools to mimic such conditions. Cue exposure therapy (CET) provides high-risk situations during treatment, which raises the individual's ability to recognize that alcohol craving is being induced. Using CET, it is hard to simulate situations that induce alcohol craving. By contrast, virtual reality (VR) approaches can present realistic situations that cannot be experienced directly in CET. Therefore, we hypothesized that is possible to model social pressure situations using VR. We developed a VR system for inducing alcohol craving under social pressure situations and measured both the induced alcohol craving and head gaze of participants. A 2 x 2 experimental model (alcohol-related locality vs. social pressure) was designed. In situations without an avatar (no social pressure), more alcohol craving was induced if alcohol was present than if it was not. And more alcohol craving was induced in situations with an avatar (social pressure) than in situations without an avatar (no social pressure). The difference of angle between the direction of head gazing and the direction of alcohol or avatar was smaller in situations with an avatar alone (social pressure) than in situations with alcohol alone. In situations with both alcohol and an avatar, the angle between the direction of head gaze and the direction of the avatar was smaller than between the direction of head gaze and the direction of the alcohol. Considering the results, this VR system induces alcohol craving using an avatar that can express various social pressure situations.

875d2e4bbeafbae5cb47b14793079d9a319af375	improving group decision making with collaborative brain-computer interfaces		Groups are generally superior to individuals in making decisions. However, time constraints and authoritarian leaders could nullify the potential advantages provided by groups. This thesis proposes a hybrid collaborative Brain-Computer Interface (cBCI) for improving performance in group decision-making. Neural signals recorded via electroencephalography are integrated with other physiological and behavioural measures to predict the likelihood of the user being correct in a decision, i.e., decision confidence. Behavioural responses from multiple users are then weighed according to these confidence estimates to obtain group decisions. The proposed cBCI has been tested with a variety of decision-making tasks, including visual matching, visual search with traditional and realistic stimuli, face recognition from multiple viewpoints, and speech perception. Groups assisted by the cBCI were significantly superior in making decisions than both individuals and traditional equally-sized groups making decisions using the majority method. This thesis also investigates the impact that a constrained form of communication has on individual and group performance in a visual-search experiment. When decision makers are able to exchange information during the experiment, their performance dramatically decreases. However, the cBCI yields superior group decisions even in this context. The confidence estimated by the cBCI is also a more reliable predictor of correctness than the confidence reported by participants after making a decision. When group members were allowed to communicate during visual search, their reported confidence was totally unrelated to the decision correctness, while in a speech perception task reported confidences were very good predictors of correctness. On the contrary, the cBCI?s confidence estimates correlated with correctness in all experiments. When critical decisions involving substantial risks have to be made (e.g., in defence), the proposed cBCI could be a useful tool to reduce the number of erroneous group decisions, thereby saving money and lives.	brain–computer interface	Davide Valeriani	2017			visual search;machine learning;r-cast;speech perception;correctness;group decision-making;social psychology;computer science;artificial intelligence	HCI	-49.703961669918854	-56.535952776537414	138651

Information transmitted is usually sparse. For all other runs, information is made available only on arrival at the emergency department (ED). There have also been numerous limitations associated with voice transmissions.A comprehensive electronic ambulance case record was created as a pilot project in Singapore between three emergency ambulances and the busiest ED there. All information captured by the ambulance crew, including vital signs information and ECGs was entered or downloaded onto a ruggardised PC in the ambulance and this complete ambulance record was transmitted to the ED. Transmission was wireless via the public mobile data network. A 3-month analysis of this pilot run revealed the following. (1) It was possible to capture a complete ambulance case record electronically at a mean time of 94 s vs 7 min 7 s for the traditional written record. (2) Air transmission time for data was approximately 4 s unless ECG wave forms were also transmitted resulting in transmission times frequently exceeding 60 s. (3) At least 68% of data was transmissible in 75% of Hospital & Emergency Ambulance Link (HEAL) ambulances as opposed to only 25% in less than 5% of non-HEAL ambulances. (4) Paramedics' time in the ED decreased from 15 to 8 min as a result of HEAL. (5) The waiting time for critical care patients to be seen at the ED decreased from 35 to 17 min if brought by HEAL ambulances.(6) The HEAL system was able to effectively prompt paramedics in carrying out critical aspects of treatment in close to 100% of instances. (7) The pilot HEAL system was able to demonstrate a limited amount of automated audit of specific aspects of ambulance runs. Having demonstrated the feasibility of the HEAL system, it is a matter of time before enhanced features such as electronic data collection at patient site, voice activated data entry, transmission of data from site, automated ambulance audits and an enhanced level of professional care in the ambulances become common-place reality.	accident and emergency department;ambulances;care of intensive care unit patient;compile and go system;data collection;erectile dysfunction;maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;patients;pilot projects;sparse matrix;speaker recognition;disease transmission;non-t, non-b adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia	V.

However, validation of these measures is impossible without observable confirmation of behaviors. Participants have expressed discomfort during the use of ego-centric wearable cameras with first-person view. We argue that mounting the camera on different body locations with a different lens orientation, gives a device recording affordance that has the effect of reducing surveillance and social discomfort compared to ego-centric cameras. We call these types of cameras """"activity-oriented"""" because they are designed to capture a particular activity, rather than the field of view of the wearer. We conducted an experiment of three camera designs with 24 participants, collecting qualitative data on participants' experience while wearing these devices in the wild. We provide a model explaining factors that lead to an increase in social presence and social stigma, which, therefore, create social and surveillance discomfort for the wearer. Wearers' attempts to reduce this discomfort by modifying their behavior or abandoning the device threatens the validity of observations of authentic behaviors. We discuss design implications and provide recommendations to help reduce social presence and stigma in order to improve the validity of observations with cameras in the wild."""	observable;population;sensor;social presence theory;wearable computer	Rawan Alharbi;Tammy K Stump;Nilofar Vafaie;Angela Fidler Pfammatter;Bonnie Spring;Nabil Alshurafa	2018	IMWUT	10.1145/3264900	social stigma;social psychology;affordance;wearable computer;qualitative property;psychology	HCI	-54.656163853689584	-52.683678744764705	138914

Within this system groups of unobtrusive wireless sensor devices can be deployed at specific locations within a patient’s home and accessed via standardized interfaces provided through an open middleware platform. For each sensor group intelligent agents are used to learn fuzzy rules, which model the patient’s habitual behaviours in the environment. An online rule adaptation technique is applied to facilitate short-term tuning of the learnt behaviours, and long-term tracking of behaviour changes which could be due to the effects of cognitive decline caused from dementia. The proposed system reports macro level behaviour changes and micro level perception drift to care providers to enable them to make better-informed assessments of the patient’s cognitive abilities and changing care needs. We demonstrate experiments in a real pervasive computing environment, in which our intelligent agent approach can learn to model the user’s behaviours and allow online adaptation of its model to better approximate the learnt behaviours and identify long-term macro-level behaviour changes, which could be attributed to cognitive decline. We also show an example of how the user’s perceptions for thermal comfort may be captured and visualised to provide a means by which micro-level perception changes can be monitored.	color gradient;intelligent agent	Faiyaz Doctor;Rahat Iqbal;Raouf N.

From among these areas, clinical knowledge management represents a specific category that poses differentiated problems and requires specific management support. Clinical knowledge as practiced today mixes formally assessed scientific knowledge with a person-culture in which the expertise of the clinician is the key element. When considering standard Knowledge Management life cycles, this entails that the required processes of creation, assessment and dissemination of clinical knowledge assets diverge from other kind of activities in how different kinds of knowledge are handled. Further, the Information Technology support required for clinical knowledge assets is complex and multi-perspective, thus requiring schemas that integrate formally gathered evidence and subjective practical knowledge.

521aa9feb7a28998178e6095eab75b248fd105bd	health informatics: developing a masters programme in rwanda based on the imia educational recommendations and the imia knowledge base		Since 2011, the Regional e-Health Center of Excellence in Rwanda (REHCE) has run an MSc in Health Informatics programme (MSc HI). A programme review was commissioned in February 2014 after 2 cohorts of students completed the post-graduate certificate and diploma courses and most students had started preparatory activity for their master dissertation. The review developed a method for mapping course content on health informatics competences and knowledge units. Also the review identified and measured knowledge gaps and content redundancy. Using this method, we analyzed regulatory and programme documents combined with stakeholder interviews, and demonstrated that the existing MSc HI curriculum did not completely address the needs of the Rwandan health sector. Teaching strategies did not always match students' expectations. Based on a detailed Rwandan health informatics needs assessment, International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA)'s Recommendations on Education in Biomedical and Health Informatics and the IMIA Health Informatics Knowledge Base, a new curriculum was developed and provided a better competences match for the specifics of healthcare in the Central African region. The new approved curriculum will be implemented in the 2014/2015 academic year and options for regional extension of the programme to Eastern DRC (Bukavu) and Burundi (Bujumbura) are being investigated.	cns disorder;certificate (record artifact);clinical informatics;diploma;informatics (discipline);knowledge base;needs assessment;occupational health services;public key certificate;recommender system	Graham Wright;Frank Verbeke;Marc Nyssen;Helen J.

6ffd8d5d6e8fad0ec60ac7af2acc068fd8fee04f	computer-aided documentation and therapy planning in pediatric oncology		In the past 20 years considerable progress was made in pediatric oncology concerning the results of therapy in Germany. Nationwide multicentre trials provide protocols for the therapy of the children. The calculation of the chemotherapy according to the protocols is rather complex and the documentation efforts for the pediatricians are enormous. Thus, we developed as a first step an application system for Computer Aided Therapy Planning In Pediatric Oncology (CATIPO), that is in routine use in about 20 pediatric clinics in Germany. In order to support the physician comprehensively with the documentation that is necessary for the trials we currently develop a Documentation System for Pediatric Oncology (DOSPO) that comprises the functionality of chemotherapy planning according to the protocols released by the trial centres. Besides supporting the physician in clinical routine the major objective is to improve the quality of the documented data. To reach this aims DOSPO combines research aspects of decision support and clinical documentation: formal representation of general protocols, calculating of a particular therapy for a patient, data acquisition, communication interfaces for transferring the data to the trial centres. In order to support trial centres an authoring system and a central data dictionary will be developed. This will enable the trial centres to develop new modules for trial-specific data acquisition in the clinics.	clinic;data acquisition;data dictionary;decision support system;dictionary [publication type];document completion status - documented;patients;pediatric oncology specialty;protocols documentation;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma	Timm Wiedemann;Petra Knaup-Gregori;Andreas Bachert;Ursula Creutzig;Reinhold Haux;Freimut Schilling	1998	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-896-0-1306	documentation;knowledge management;pediatric oncology;computer-aided;medical physics;intensive care medicine;medicine	HCI	-55.01123421944299	-65.65897923668588	139646
90c27cbc98f11362aa6cd648584732aa490a286d	assessing measures of comorbidity and functional status for risk adjustment to compare hospital performance for colorectal cancer surgery: a retrospective data-linkage study	female;health informatics;retrospective studies;middle aged;adolescent;male;health status indicators;journal article;information systems and communication service;comorbidity;risk adjustment;adult;management of computing and information systems;outcome assessment health care;humans;young adult;information storage and retrieval;colorectal neoplasms;aged;aged 80 and over	BACKGROUND Comparing outcomes between hospitals requires consideration of patient factors that could account for any observed differences. Adjusting for comorbid conditions is common when studying outcomes following cancer surgery, and a commonly used measure is the Charlson comorbidity index. Other measures of patient health include the ECOG performance status and the ASA physical status score. This study aimed to ascertain how frequently ECOG and ASA scores are recorded in population-based administrative data collections in New South Wales, Australia and to assess the contribution each makes in addition to the Charlson comorbidity index in risk adjustment models for comparative assessment of colorectal cancer surgery outcomes between hospitals.   METHODS We used linked administrative data to identify 6964 patients receiving surgery for colorectal cancer in 2007 and 2008. We summarised the frequency of missing data for Charlson comorbidity index, ECOG and ASA scores, and compared patient characteristics between those with and without these measures. The performance of ASA and ECOG in risk adjustment models that also included Charlson index was assessed for three binary outcomes: 12-month mortality, extended length of stay and 28-day readmission. Patient outcomes were compared between hospital peer groups using multilevel logistic regression analysis.   RESULTS The Charlson comorbidity index could be derived for all patients, ASA score was recorded for 78 % of patients and ECOG performance status recorded for only 24 % of eligible patients. Including ASA or ECOG improved the predictive ability of models, but there was no consistently best combination. The addition of ASA or ECOG did not substantially change parameter estimates for hospital peer group after adjusting for Charlson comorbidity index.   CONCLUSIONS While predictive ability of regression models is maximised by inclusion of one or both of ASA score and ECOG performance status, there is little to be gained by adding ASA or ECOG to models containing the Charlson comorbidity index to address confounding. The Charlson comorbidity index has good performance and is an appropriate measure to use in risk adjustment to compare outcomes between hospitals.	asa carriage control characters;aspirin;charlson comorbidity index chart review version;collections (publication);colorectal carcinoma;diagnosis-related groups;electrocorticogram;electrocorticography;estimated;gain;index (publishing);linkage (software);logistic regression;missing data;neoplasms;patients;population parameter;performance status	Timothy A.

Thus, through data mining, these stored data can be used not only for decision support but also for hospital management. In this paper, we applied several exploratory data analysis techniques and generalized linear model to data extracted from HIS, which can be viewed as a first step to data mining for HIS. The results show several interesting results for hospital management, which suggests that the reuse of stored data will give a powerful tool to support a long-period management of a university hospital.	data mining;decision support system;generalized linear model;information system	Shusaku Tsumoto;Shoji Hirano	2008	2008 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications	10.1109/ISDA.2008.359	decision support system;computer science;data science;generalized linear model;data mining;database;data analysis;exploratory data analysis;correlation;information system;general linear model;cancer	DB	-54.40227375130278	-64.06108325919112	140499

Australia's population is already ageing and the states and territories are ageing at different rates. Our understanding of the dementias remains limited and diagnosis in primary care settings is poor. Locating where older people with dementia are and how they are coping is an emerging need in health information management. In this paper we discuss how a spatially informed health information management system could support population ageing and the disconnected systems that address ageing. We illustrate this with examples from our work to show how spatial informatics can advance our understanding of and response to the implications of population ageing.	aging;coping behavior;dementia;informatics (discipline);information management system (ims);management information systems;primary health care	Hamish Robertson;Nick Nicholas;Andrew Georgiou;Julie Johnson;Joanne Travaglia	2013	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-266-0-102	gerontology;geography;data science	HCI	-58.591406132403044	-60.22424505479061	140585

The workshop facilitated a dialogue on patients' roles and activities in daily health care by using a participatory design inspired method and pointed towards a pluralistic view on patients' participation represented by the terms 'mixed', 'social' and 'fluent participation'. The results challenge future research on Information and Communication Technology to support patient participation in health promoting activities by questioning how to embrace pluralistic opportunities for patient participation, which is especially important to GPs treating a broad group of patients.

In this paper, we propose Relational Norm Intervention (RNI) model for behavior change, which involves two individuals as a target user and a helper respectively. RNI model uses Negative Reinforcement and Other-Regarding Preferences as motivating factors for behavior change. The model features the passive participation of a helper who will undergo artificially generated discomforts (e.g., limited access to a mobile device) when a target user performs against a target behavior. Based on in-depth discussions from a two-phase design workshop, we designed and implemented BeUpright, a mobile application employing RNI model to correct sitting posture of a target user. Also, we conducted a two-week study to evaluate the effectiveness and user experience of BeUpright. The study showed that the RNI model has a potential to increase efficacy, in terms of behavior change, compared to conventional notification approaches. The most influential factor of RNI model in the changing the behavior of target users was the intention to avoid discomforting their helpers. RNI model also showed a potential to help unmotivated individuals in behavior change. We discuss the mechanism of the RNI model in relation to prior literature on behavior change and implications of exploiting discomfort in mobile behavior change services.	ability to sit question;actual discomfort;behavioral change;body position;crisis intervention;gain;mathematical model;mobile app;mobile device;negative reinforcement;osi model;poor posture;social support;two-phase locking;user experience;notification	Jaemyung Shin;Bumsoo Kang;Taiwoo Park;Jina Huh;Jinhan Kim;Junehwa Song	2016	Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems.

Consumer feedback is collected in many industries, including in healthcare where patient feedback contributes to a higher quality of care. Current collection methods include complaints, local surveys, and patient stories, but these methods yield low participation at high costs. Providers need affordable and effective ways to collect feedback, and smartphone applications present as suitable solutions. However, previous research shows that patients are hesitant to provide smartphone-based feedback in a care setting due to perceived risks and apparent futility of expecting change as a result. We will conduct a study to observe consumer behaviour using smartphones to provide service feedback in healthcare spaces versus non-healthcare spaces. We will identify addressable barriers that impact the adoption of smartphone technology to gather patient experience data in health care spaces.	feedback;mobile app;smartphone	Tina Chan;Josephine McMurray;Alaaddin Sidahmed;James R.

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a cardiac catheterization procedure that aims to provide objective measures of coronary lesion hemodynamic significance and involves the acquisition of phasic pressure and electrocardiographic waveforms. The dataset from these procedures currently remains in proprietary systems with restricted data access, inability for data exchange, and often inadequate archiving. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) includes a waveform information object definition. We describe the method of encapsulating FFR procedural information into a DICOM waveform file. We define private data elements to capture modality-specific data that is not represented by standard DICOM data elements. We propose the adoption of this semantic extension of the DICOM waveform information object for exchange and archiving of data from studies of pressure-derived indices of coronary stenoses.	archive;catheterization;coronary stenosis;coronary angiography;dicom;data access;flow cytometry;fractional flow reserve of vessel;hemodynamics;information privacy;modality (human–computer interaction);patients;silo (dataset);waveform;angiogram;functional assessment	Nikolaos Kakouros	2015	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-015-9837-x	text mining;medical research;computer science;data science;data mining;information retrieval	DB	-52.86197909768088	-64.77244569422692	141029

A systematic review of the literature on handoff evaluation studies was performed to investigate the nature, methodological, and theoretical foundations underlying the evaluation of handoff tools and their adequacy and appropriateness in achieving standardization goals.   METHOD We searched multiple databases for articles evaluating handoff tools published between 1 February 1983 and 15 June 2012. The selected articles were categorized along the following dimensions: handoff tool characteristics, standardization initiatives, methodological framework, and theoretical perspectives underlying the evaluation.   RESULTS Thirty-six articles met our inclusion criteria. Handoff evaluations were conducted primarily on electronic tools (64%), with a more recent focus on electronic medical record-integrated tools (36% since 2008). Most evaluations centered on intra-departmental tools (95%). Evaluation studies were quasi-experimental (42%) or observational (50%), with a major focus on handoff-related outcome measures (94%) using predominantly survey-based tools (70%) with user satisfaction metrics (53%). Most of the studies (81%) based their evaluation on aspects of standardization that included continuity of care and patient safety.   CONCLUSIONS The nature, methodological, and theoretical foundations of handoff tool evaluations varied significantly in terms of their quality and rigor, thereby limiting their ability to inform strategic standardization initiatives. Future research should utilize rigorous, multi-method qualitative and quantitative approaches that capture the contextual nuances of handoffs, and evaluate their effect on patient-related outcomes.	backdrop cms;categorization;cognition disorders;cognitive complexity;continuity of patient care;database;dimensions;electronic health records;evaluation;foundations;interpretation (logic);medical records;morphogenesis;norm (social);numerous;objective-c;patients;peer review;revision procedure;rigor - temperature-associated observation;scientific publication;scott continuity;standardization;systematic review;virus-like particle;windows 95;interest	Joanna Abraham;Thomas George Kannampallil;Vimla L.

These frameworks can also be applied in the design of mobile technology disease management applications. However, the utilization of these frameworks is rare and frequently overlooked in existing colorectal mobile health (mHealth) applications. The purpose of this study was to utilize a patient-centered framework to facilitate the development of a valid, appropriate, and feasible mHealth tool for pediatric patients and their caregivers. To inform application design and production, in-depth interviews were conducted with pediatric patients and their caregivers to capture management experiences, application preferences, and barriers and facilitators to application use. Patient ages ranged from 3 to 16. Six caregivers and 2 adolescent patients participated in the interviews. Patients and caregivers reported various management styles and desired an application that is not only user-friendly and customizable, but also able to facilitate communication and information sharing with other patients, caregivers, and providers. Older patients also wanted the application to give them more independence in managing their disease. Employing patient-centered frameworks is context-specific, but holds much promise at the intersection of mobile technology and healthcare. By incorporating pediatric patient experiences and viewpoints, we identified important components for inclusion in a mHealth surgical colorectal disease management application. Patients and caregivers wanted a mHealth application that was unique to their needs and easy to use. They suggested that the application include treatment tracking, note taking, and provider communication features.	behavior;colorectal neoplasms;disease management;experience;mobile health;paget disease extramammary;patients;published comment;usability	Mehul V.

To address this challenge, an online community for cancer survivorship was envisioned and designed collaboratively by cancer survivors, family members, community professionals, and informatics researchers in middle Tennessee. The vision developed by the community members serves as a foundation for medical informatics systems to build capacity in local communities to improve cancer care and social support.

""""Safety huddles"""" have been found useful in creating a sense of collective situational awareness that increases an organization's capacity to respond to safety concerns. We explored the use of safety huddles for identifying and learning about EHR-related safety concerns.   Design Data were obtained from daily safety huddle briefing notes recorded at a single midsized tertiary-care hospital in the United States over 1 year. Huddles were attended by key administrative, clinical, and information technology staff. We conducted a content analysis of huddle notes to identify what EHR-related safety concerns were discussed. We expanded a previously developed EHR-related error taxonomy to categorize types of EHR-related safety concerns recorded in the notes.   Results On review of daily huddle notes spanning 249 days, we identified 245 EHR-related safety concerns. For our analysis, we defined EHR technology to include a specific EHR functionality, an entire clinical software application, or the hardware system. Most concerns (41.6%) involved """" EHR technology working incorrectly, """" followed by 25.7% involving """" EHR technology not working at all. """" Concerns related to """"EHR technology missing or absent"""" accounted for 16.7%, whereas 15.9% were linked to """" user errors .""""   Conclusions Safety huddles promoted discussion of several technology-related issues at the organization level and can serve as a promising technique to identify and address EHR-related safety concerns. Based on our findings, we recommend that health care organizations consider huddles as a strategy to promote understanding and improvement of EHR safety."""	awareness;categorization;electronic health records;file spanning;health care;information sciences;journal of the american medical informatics association;note (document);report;safety engineering;taxonomy;united states department of veterans affairs;research grants;tertiary	Shailaja Menon;Hardeep Singh;Traber Davis;William L.

For instance, new physical health problems on back, hands and eyes are much discussed in the field of occupational health. Some diagnosis and treatment methods are getting standardized for computer-related problems. One more important issue is their effect on work processes, how interruptions and breakdowns influence on work? Computers do have crashes, updates, network breaks, memory shortages, viruses, format mismatches, network congestion, new incoming technologies to learn and compete with and many more small obstacles.	computer;network congestion	Arzu Çöltekin;Matti Vartiainen;I.

984673e22be8b30eddae971d1f9f574afbb0f60c	from autonomic nervous system evaluation to a novel paradigm for scientific research, clinical practice and economic development		In recent years, the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Evaluation Unit of the University of Bologna and the medical physicists of the School of Medicine have worked together on a project to devise a new integrated approach to investigate the cardiovascular reflexes and study the ANS. Our work stemmed from an awareness of the needs of European ANS units [1], the commercial solutions currently available and the different strategies adopted by researchers and clinicians working on this important topic. Up to now, the clinical approach to ANS evaluation has featured distinct national differences based on the needs and settings of national neurology curricula [2]. As a result, ANS laboratories lacked standardized procedures and were unable to share results with colleagues. Increasing research in the ANS field and the broad spectrum of sensory medical devices available on the market for the evaluation of biosignals have led to a wide variety of instrumentation in individual laboratories. These devices tend not to be interconnected by default thereby increasing complexity, decreasing usability and leading to isolated applications. All these factors hinder harmonization and standard clinical practice. The marketing strategies of biomedical manufacturers have been designed to build complete devices able to acquire the signals of interests with powerful algorithms and user-friendly interfaces to facilitate the use of such instrumentation both for clinical routine and research purposes. Although this approach benefits medical staff in ANS units, it has some limitations. First of all, these systems are closed and it is very difficult for the manufacturers to follow rapid research innovations which require ongoing upgrades of hardware and software. Secondly, since these devices are Bclosed^, algorithms and the procedures implemented cannot be custom-made at least for research purposes. Thirdly, the instrumentation is expensive and hence not available to all ANS laboratories worldwide. Lastly, buying these new tools inevitably means disposing of the old devices without being able to use both. For these reasons, our proposal was both Bconservative^ and Binnovative^: our idea was not to get rid of any existing instrumentation but to develop an adaptive comprehensive toolbox of data acquisition and biosignal analysis able to integrate all the existing solutions and improve them by adding new devices. Thanks to the collaboration with a small external manufacturer, the ANScovery system was built and marketed [3]. The strong points of our approach are clear. The proposed solution is open and each laboratory can personalise the experimental setup and the analysis algorithms. Customization can involve different market players so as to stimulate economic and technological partnerships among different manufacturers. This offers an interesting perspective for all small companies which do not have the strength of large multinational corporations and can find in commercial agreements the right way to grow and innovate.

ce09799003a420f68154beafc2f4f8c5a514c25c	apparatuses of knowledge delivery to patients: the role of social media in vaccine controversies		The practice of knowledge delivery to patients has long been performed by healthcare professionals, who were seen as trustable sources of healthcare knowledge. However, healthcare knowledge is now being distributed widely online and in particular on social media, by numerous individuals who are sharing a mixture of scientific/non-scientific information grounded in personal perspectives and experiences. In the shift to healthcare knowledge delivery on social media, traditional practices of knowledge delivery to patients are challenged. This study draws on material-discursive practices, known as apparatuses, to examine two notable material-discursive practices in vaccine administration. This research is expected to make two contributions to the IS literature. First, it aims to identify significant differences in the two knowledge delivery practices and their outcomes. Second, it aims to investigate the ongoing interaction and tension between traditional and new knowledge delivery approaches. We provide preliminary insights and a roadmap for further developing this research.	social media	Ghazaleh Aghili;Liette Lapointe;Emmanuelle Vaast	2015			management science	AI	-61.38504744731376	-59.755935004250475	142528

In this study, we developed a new methodology for systematically studying what are these unplanned activities and decisions. This methodology expands the traditional naturalistic decision making (NDM) frameworks by explicitly identifying the role of environmental factors in decision making. We focused on decisions made by ED physicians as they transitioned between tasks. Through ethnographic data collection, we developed a taxonomy of decision types. The empirical data provide important insight to the complexity of the ED environment by highlighting adaptive behavior in this intricate milieu. Our results show that half of decisions in the ED we studied are not planned, rather decisions are opportunistic decision (34%) or influenced by interruptions or distractions (21%). What impacts these unplanned decisions have on the quality, safety, and efficiency in the ED environment are important research topics for future investigation.	accident and emergency department;adaptive behavior;care of intensive care unit patient;chaos theory;complexity;data collection;decision support system;distributed cognition;erectile dysfunction;medical decision making;milieu intérieur;taxonomy (general)	Amy Franklin;Ying Liu;Zhe Li;Vickie Nguyen;Todd R.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and other neuroimaging techniques create an important data source for investigators to collaborate and share a larger cohort of potential SUDEP patient data. To address the challenges of sharing neuroimaging data across institutions with good semantic precision, we developed ImageSfERe, a web-based image sharing module for Epilepsy Research. Since various aspects of patient information need to be harmonized and integrated, a dedicated questionnaire consisting of 248 questions about patient background information is incorporated into ImageSfERe. Eight repositories of patient de-identified images in Digital Image and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format, over 23 GB of data, have been successfully processed and made available via ImageSfERe.

Training emergency care skills is critical for patient safety and an essential part of medical education. Increasing demands on competences of doctors and limited training budgets necessitate new and cost-effective training methods. In the last decade, serious games have been propagated to train complex skills; they are expected to facilitate active, engaging and intrinsically motivated learning. Erasmus MC has developed a serious game to train emergency care skills, as a preparation for the faceto- face training. This ‘abcdeSIM’ game provides a realistic online emergency department environment where doctors can assess and stabilize patients in a virtual emergency department.

391ae0e034eee35b145de47edb0e8b1e7fa59ad6	healthcare on social media: a longitudinal study of health-related support on twitter		Healthcare innovation has enabled patients to take a more central role in the management of their disease conditions. The innovative trend has not precluded the central role of primary care givers and experts yet. However, the increasing prominence of social media (SM), such as the Twitter microblogging platform has ensured that a parallel path has been created for people to seek for health-related assistance on SM platforms. For instance, research has shown that 70% of Canadians seek health information on the Internet, while about 33% of Internet users receive and share information via health-related blogging websites. The health information they seek is to help support and manage health conditions based on information disseminated on these networks. Three main types of social support have been discussed in previous literature; Informational support, Instrumental support and Emotional support. Emotional support provides hope, affection, and empathy to participants. Informational support is in the form of advice and the sharing of personal life experiences. Instrumental support is in the form of statements yielding actual and practical assistance to other participants about issues pertaining to daily living and well-being. These types of support can be propagated through two main channels; a peer-to-peer channel or an expert-to-peer channel. A peer-topeer channel represents a relationship between two non-expert SM users on a specific topic. An expert-topeer channel represents a relationship between an expert, such a physician, and a non-expert SM user. Research shows that users who seek for health-related information on SM mostly seek for peer-to-peer health information. Hence we focus our study on communication that occurs within a peer-to-peer channel. Such information, is vital to complementing health information patients receive from their primary care givers. In a different study, we have explored the dynamics and propagation of social support on SM by leveraging a large volume of SM posts on the Twitter microblogging platform. Specifically, we have identified how health-related support is disseminated on an SM platform and its impact on the well-being of network users. In this follow-up study, we seek to conduct a text analytics-based longitudinal analysis in order to understand the impact of health-related information on people’s health outcome over a period of time. Using an analytics methodology, our aim with this study is twofold. First, we identify and understand the types of support that is propagated on SM regarding disease management over a specified period of time. Next, we identify which of the types of support are paramount to the effective management of disease conditions on SM after a user has been exposed to relevant health information over a period of time. We believe such a study would support the efforts of professional health stakeholders in leveraging the ubiquitous SM platform to assist patients with the management of their health conditions.	advice (programming);blog;experience;internet;peer-to-peer;social media;social support;software propagation;text mining;ubiquitous computing;whole earth 'lectronic link	Daniel Asamoah	2016			knowledge management;health care;computer science;social media;public relations;longitudinal study	HCI	-62.74740875952175	-60.21014372768331	142865

The resulting data surge has created an overarching need to search these records for meaningful patterns of events. This paper reports on a two-part user study, as well as a series of early tests and interviews with clinical researchers, that informed the development of two temporal query interfaces: a basic, menu-based interface and an advanced, graphic-based interface. While the scope of temporal query is very broad, this work focuses on two particularly complex and critical facets of temporal event sequences: intervals (events with both a start time and an end time), and the absence of an event. We describe how users encounter a common set of difficulties when specifying such queries, and propose solutions to help overcome them. Finally, we report on two case studies with epidemiologists at the US Army Pharmacovigilance Center, illustrating how both query interfaces were used to study patterns of drug use.	computer data storage;graphical user interface;sensor;usability testing;visual programming language	Megan Monroe;Rongjian Lan;Juan Morales del Olmo;Ben Shneiderman;Catherine Plaisant;Jeff Millstein	2013		10.1145/2470654.2481325	query optimization;query expansion;web query classification;human–computer interaction;computer science;data science;data mining;database;world wide web;query language	HCI	-51.29508268786405	-66.13878206360245	142911

In the process, big data genomic technologies are both a risk to individual privacy and a benefit to personalized medicine. There is an opportunity to address the social and ethical demands of various stakeholders and shape the adoption of diagnostic genome technologies. We discuss ethical and practical issues associated with the networking of genomics by comparing how the European Union (EU) and North America understand and practice notions of privacy and consent in research. An overview of international policy suggests the embedding of genomics within digital networks and the Internet creates conditions that challenge the management of privacy and consent in the age of big data. The risks of re-identification, informational harms, and data security vulnerabilities are issues that need to be better addressed in the clinical setting to reconcile the unpredictable pathway of research and practice in the networked information society.	big data;data security;digital electronics;gene regulatory network;internet;personalization;privacy;vulnerability (computing)	Peter A.

A major challenge to CVD risk management is to improve adherence to long-term medications.   OBJECTIVES To elicit patients' and providers' perspectives on how to support Māori with high CVD risk and low medication adherence to achieve better adherence.   METHODS Analysis of electronic health records (EHR) of four NZ general practices identified medication adherence status of Māori patients with high CVD risk (≥15%, 5-year). A random sample of these patients participated in focus group discussions on barriers to long-term medication adherence. Their primary care providers also participated in separate focus groups on the same topic.   RESULTS A range of factors are identified influencing adherence behaviour, including patient's medication knowledge, patient-doctor communication effectiveness and cost.   CONCLUSION Analysis of barriers to medication adherence in primary care suggests opportunities for health information technology to improve adherence, including patient education, decision support, clinician training and self-service facilities.

Using eye movement data, we analyzed a perspective that indicated the type of rules that participants consider. Our experiments yielded the following results. A tendency to consider rules from the perspective that participants used for finding and confirming the initial rule was retained in the phase in which both positive and negative instances of the initial rule were given. This tendency was observed only when participants faced negative instances. We concluded that, when participants faced negative instances, they tried to change the initial rule peripherally to explain them.	experiment;eye abnormalities;eye tracking;rule (guideline)	Miki Matsumuro;Kazuhisa Miwa	2013	Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology		social psychology;wason selection task;three-click rule;eye tracking;fluent;mathematics;protocol analysis;information science	HCI	-49.98738246997382	-57.68563590839779	143344

1dd5f9edcef4cd252fa2cd88aee5f1cbb0ec8221	lhc-forms and related widgets for capturing and tuning health data		NLM’s Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHC) has developed four interrelated open source, web-based, JavaScript tools for gathering and processing clinical data: 1) LHC-Forms is a data capture widget designed in partnership with Regenstrief Institute to produce a browser executable form from a stored form description. LHC-Forms supports HL7 data types, repeating groups of questions, survey scoring, validation checks, answer lists, and default values that can be derived from answers given to preceding questions. LHC-Forms can execute any LOINC panel as a form, and generate an HL7 v2 message of the entered data. Try it: https://lhc-forms.lhc.nlm.nih.gov. 2) Clinical Table Search Service is an auto-completion tool that provides an autocomplete menu to fields that take answers from large tables. It is accessed via URLs whose parameters control what table to search, which fields to return to the choice menu grid, and which fields of the selected item to store as hidden content in the input fields. Our implementation provides preconfigured access to many clinical tables: LOINC, RxTerms, ICD-10-CM, many NCBI genomics tables, COSMIC and others. Try it: https://clin-tablesearch.lhc.nlm.nih.gov. 3) An LHC-Form building tool. Try it: https://lhc-formbuilder.lhc.nlm.nih.gov. 4) A JavaScript validator and converter for UCUM units of measure. Try it: https://ucum-validator.lhc.nlm.nih.gov. The four modules can be used together or separately in web applications. System Description: Purpose: To provide a set of sophisticated but easy to use open source web modules that can be used within existing web applications and provide pre-configured support for standard clinical vocabularies (LOINC, RxNorm, UCUM, SNOMED CT) and genomic identifiers. Developers can also configure arbitrary external tables, such as local patient and doctor registries, to work with these widgets. LHC-Forms and its sister modules are designed to work together in LHC-Forms--or separately with other applications that follow its interface specifications. LHC-Forms can produce HL7 v2 messages, and will produce FHIR clinical reports in the future. The Clinical Table Search Service supports the HL7 coded-value types: coded with exceptions (CWE) and coded with no exceptions (CNE). Both the Clinical Table Search Service’s auto-completer and LHC-Forms can be downloaded as pre-built packages for integration in a web-application, so that forms and auto-completers can be rendered with just a few lines of code. Current usage: 1) We are using LHC-Forms and the Clinical Table Search Service to model a v2 HL7 structured genetics report (see Figure 1) to enable delivery of coded genetic test result information to EHRs for decision support that fits into the v2 reporting mechanism used by most clinical laboratories. 2) The LHC-Forms design arose from collaboration with Regenstrief. Its internal structure is congruent with that of LOINC panels, and every LOINC panel can be accessed as an LHC-Form through LOINC’s desktop (https://loinc.org/relma) and web-based (http://search.loinc.org/) tools accessed by thousands of users. 3) NLM’s Common Data Elements repository also uses the LHC-Forms widget to present live versions of most of their survey instruments and panels, including those not based on LOINC (https://cde.nlm.nih.gov). This research and development effort was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health. Figure 1.

Thus we exploited the robustness of the model already designed for navigating among questionnaires and implemented additional functionalities that improved the usability of the mobile application, making it suitable for the paramedic staff and the volunteers that manage emergency cases.	administration procedure;checklist;mobile app;mobile operating system;usability	Eleonora Losiouk;Silvana Quaglini;Massimo Pesenti Campagnoni;Giordano Lanzola	2015	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-512-8-818	robustness (computer science);systems engineering;knowledge management;mobile technology;usability;medical emergency;medicine	HCI	-60.05691231812718	-59.1834761524212	143859

To achieve this, we introduce a combination of methods, in particular a perception test, and an automated body movement analysis. Film fragments from truthful and deceptive children were shown to human judges who were given the task to decide whether the recorded child was being truthful or not. Results reveal that judges are able to reliably and accurately distinguish truthful clips from lying clips. The automated movement analysis revealed a positive correlation between the amount of movement in a child and the perception of lies, i.e., the more movement the children exhibited during a clip, the higher the chance that the clip was perceived as a lie.	statistical classification	Mariana Serras Pereira;Eric O.

METHODS Colorectal Cancer Screening Decision Quality Instrument (CRC-DQI) includes knowledge items and patients' goals and concerns. Items were generated through literature review and qualitative work with patients and providers. Hypotheses relating to the acceptability, feasibility, discriminant validity and retest reliability of the survey were examined using data from three studies: (1) 2X2 randomized study of participants recruited online, (2) cross-sectional sample of patients recruited in community health clinics, and (3) cross-sectional sample of providers recruited from American Medical Association Master file.   RESULTS 338 participants were recruited online, 94 participants were recruited from community health centers, and 115 physicians were recruited. The CRC-DQI was feasible and acceptable with low missing data and high response rates for both online and paper-based administrations. The knowledge score was able to discriminate between those who had seen a decision aid or not (84% vs. 64%, p < 0.001) and between providers, online patients and clinic patients (89% vs. 74% vs. 41%, p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The knowledge score and most of the goals had adequate retest reliability. About half of the participants received a test that matched their goals (47% and 51% in online and clinic samples respectively). Many respondents who had never been screened had goals that indicated a preference for colonoscopy. A minority of respondents in the online (21%) and in clinic (2%) samples were both well informed and received a test that matched their goals.   CONCLUSIONS The CRC-DQI demonstrated good psychometric properties in diverse samples, and across different modes of administration. Few respondents made high quality decisions about colon cancer screening.	cdisc sdtm respiratory test name terminology;colon classification;colorectal carcinoma;community health centers;cross-sectional data;cyclic redundancy check;decision quality;discriminant;display resolution;eighty nine;malignant tumor of colon;missing data;non-small cell lung carcinoma;patients;projection screen;randomized algorithm;surveys;community health discipline	Karen R.

Patients with chronic diseases have a great need to personally manage their health-related behaviour, such as food consumption, and its impact on their health indicators, like blood pressure, body weight, blood sugar, cholesterol, to name a few. Current healthcare systems are unable to meet the needs of patients with chronic diseases for management, due to the need for acute care. An analysis of the needs was performed and recommendations for virtual communities were made to help patients with chronic diseases monitor and manage their health. Virtual communities have the potential to meet the need to assist with monitoring activities, education, community membership, and the sale of products and services. However, they also face risks inherent to accepting and storing any form of personal health information, and of remaining in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act of 2001.

Transferred pre-term and critically ill term babies have higher mortality rates and much higher rates of long term disability than similar babies born in hospitals with NICU facilities. This paper details the Bush Babies Broadband project that aims to significantly improve the quality of treatment for babies born in rural, remote as well as urban areas by providing the first on-demand virtual NICU architecture in Australia. Real-time data collected from medical monitors and ventilators attached to the baby, audiovisual streams and static physiological data such as X-ray images are transmitted to the consulting Neonatologist to gain a better picture of the patient’s condition than is currently available. The key contribution of this significant research is the infrastructure providing a mechanism for Neonatologists to receive information directly from a regional hospital, thereby preventing, in some cases, the immediate need to move the baby. A key benefit of this framework is that it is available to link regional hospitals with the supporting NICU Neonatologist ‘on demand’ eliminating the need to establish permanent point to point connections. This paper further describes the application of that architecture to a specific pilot connecting the Bathurst regional hospital with Neonatologists within the NICU at Nepean Hospital, Penrith Australia. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the vast majority of this data is lost since it is most often displayed once as it is recorded, perhaps replayed one or more times while it exists in the device's volatile memory. What little data that is permanently recorded is most commonly saved through hand written annotations, in paper records and in some limited samples stored on hospital clinical information systems. Meanwhile, current methods of data analysis provide opportunities to utilize this data for improved care of these same critical care patients. A major inhibitor to this becoming reality is the lack of standards for the representation, transmission and storage of physiological data. HL7, for example, does not include definitions for time series data. Research into the use of these data will soon be reaching the clinical setting and the need for such standards to be defined is becoming urgent.	archive;care-of address;health level 7;information system;time series;volatile memory	J.

239cb49030e683b896a001995fcecb99f0b14bbb	a rhythm analysis-based model to predict sedentary behaviors		Sedentary behaviors such as sitting and watching TV are ubiquitous in modern societies. Increases in sedentary time have been linked with an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. While smartphones and wearables can now detect sedentary user behaviors, few computational models exist for predicting when they will occur in future. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model to predict future sedentary behaviors, facilitating prevention rather than reactive interventions. Our models are based on the concept of rhythm analysis, an idea proposed by Lefebvre, which postulates that many human behaviors, the use of public spaces, and many phenomena all follow natural rhythms. Our work focuses on detecting the prevailing rhythms of sedentary behaviors and modeling the cyclical rhythm and linear rhythm in Lefebvre's philosophy using periodic functions (history-free) and linear functions (history-dependent) respectively. A person who lies on his couch at the same time every day is an example of a cyclical rhythm, while a person who lies down in exhaustion after vigorous exercise is an example of a linear rhythm. Our preliminary results from analyzing an existing dataset clearly show that rhythmical sedentary patterns do exist. Cyclical rhythms are more common than linear rhythms, and half-day rhythms, daily rhythms, weekly rhythms, and bi-weekly rhythms are clearly observed in a test dataset.	computation;computational model;just-in-time compilation;linear function;sbp;sensor;smartphone;television;wearable computer	Qian He;Emmanuel O.

Bhattacharyya Teleradiology, telepathology, and teleoncology are important applications of telemedicine. Recent advances in these fields include a preponderance of radiology PACS (Picture Archiving and Communications System) users, the implementation of aroundthe-clock teleradiology services at many hospitals, and the invention of the first ultrarapid whole-slide digital scanner based on the array microscope. These advances have led to the development of a new health-care-delivery clinical pathway called the ultrarapid breast care process (URBC), which has been commercialized as the UltraClinicst process. This process bundles telemammography, telepathology, and teleoncology services and has reduced the time it takes for a woman to obtain diagnostic and therapeutic breast-care planning services from several weeks to a single day. This paper describes the UltraClinics process in detail and presents the vision of a network of same-day telemedicine-enabled UltraClinics facilities, staffed by a virtual group practice of teleradiologists, telepathologists, and teleoncologists.	file archiver;gene regulatory network;picture archiving and communication system;radiology;teleradiology	Ronald S.

9b72c3babd20062301bb3aef300f972c3c940af3	towards a dsl-based approach for specifying and monitoring home care plans		A (home) care plan defines the health cares or supportive cares delivered by health care professionals in patients’ homes. Such a care plan is usually constructed through a complex process involving a comprehensive assessment of patient’s needs as well as its social and physical environment. Managing home care plans is challenging because care plans are inherently non-structured processes which require complex interdisciplinary cooperation. This paper addresses the problems underlying the design and management of home care plans. First, we present a DSL (Domain Specific Language) based approach tailored to express home care plans using high level and user-oriented abstractions. Then, we describe and discuss preliminary results regarding formalization of the proposed DSL abstractions using timed automata in order to provide basic services to support analysis, verification, enactment and management of home care plans.	digital subscriber line	Kahina Gani;Marinette Bouet;Michel Schneider;Farouk Toumani	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-06257-0_27	systems engineering;computer science;health care;business process management;abstraction;digital subscriber line;domain-specific language	SE	-55.29440071903071	-61.4387408810981	145275

During the five-year project, IDX (now part of GE Healthcare) worked in partnership with Apelon Inc., Intermountain Health Care, Mayo Clinic, Stanford Medical Informatics, and the University Of Nebraska Medical Center to achieve all major project objectives. In this session, we identify key innovations in each of the main project focus areas: The SAGE Guideline Representation Model, the Protege-based guideline encoding workbench, the SAGE Guideline Execution Engine, and the standards-based interfaces with host clinical information systems. In each area we also describe how our consortium worked collaboratively to define requirements, resolve technical and informatics challenges, and validate prototypes in end-to-end testing.		Robert M.

Most of the systems are rule-based and very few have become fully functional prototypes or commercially viable systems that can be deployed in real situations. The attempts to build large-scale systems without examining the intrinsic systemic nature of the clinical process have resulted in limited operational success and acceptance. The clinical function, another area of medical activity, has emerged rapidly offering potential for clinical decision support systems. This article discusses the systemic differences between clinical reasoning and clinical function and suggests that different design methodologies be used in the two domains. Clinical reasoning requires a holistic approach, such as an intelligent multiagent, incorporating the properties of softness, openness, complexity, flexibility, and generality of clinical decision support systems, while traditional rule-based approaches are sufficient for clinical function applications.	agent-based model;clinical decision support system;holism;logic programming;openness	Wullianallur Raghupathi	2007	IJHISI	10.4018/jhisi.2007010104	clinical decision support system;medicine;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;nursing;health;management science;health care	AI	-55.70356632590463	-61.62286958013169	145330
39db15a419d2cb0c4a75d1b08ec4e6e1fb781ddd	improving e-health services and system requirements by modelling the health environment		E-health is a rising research area in the public health, business and medical informatics sectors and refers to health and information services that are delivered or improved by using the Internet and other related information technologies. Various aspects of e-health are discussed in the literature; however, there is a research gap in the areas of system requirements engineering and ehealth business goals. It is widely accepted that e-health business goals can play a pivotal role in capturing the details of e-health system requirements. Therefore, understanding e-health goals is important to obtain suitable e-health system requirements. This paper focuses on how business goal– driven requirements are elicited in e-health to help to fill this gap in the literature. This will aid e-health system developers in developing systems according to e-health business expectations. A case study on routine patient consultation visits in a health environment has been used to validate the approach and to ensure that an e-health system that successfully fulfils the needs of the e-health business is developed.	informatics;internet;requirement;requirements analysis;requirements engineering;system requirements	Ahmed Alahmadi;Ben Soh;Azmat Ullah	2014	JSW		computer science;knowledge management;management science	SE	-59.37762998113667	-59.64685321934241	145426

The aim of the preliminary study was to evaluate satisfaction with this system among physicians and pharmacists at the early stage of system implementation.   METHODS A questionnaire was developed through a review of the literature and discussion in 6 focus groups to understand the level of satisfaction, attitudes, and intentions of physicians and pharmacists using the PharmaCloud system. It was then administered nationally in Taiwan in July to September 2015. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression were performed to identify variables influencing satisfaction and intention to use the system.   RESULTS In total, 895 pharmacist and 105 physician questionnaires were valid for analysis. The results showed that satisfaction with system quality warranted improvement. Positive attitudes toward medication reconciliation among physicians and pharmacists, which were significant predictors of the intention to use the system (β= 0.223, p < 0.001). Most physicians and pharmacists agreed that obtaining signed patient consent was needed but preferred that it be conducted by the NHIA rather than by individual medical institutions (4.02 ± 1.19 vs. 3.49 ± 1.40, p < 0.01).   CONCLUSIONS The preliminary study results indicated a moderate satisfaction toward the PharmaCloud system. Hospital pharmacists had a high satisfaction rate, but neither are physicians and community pharmacists. Continuously improvement on system quality has been performing based on the results of this preliminary survey. Policies and standardization processes, including privacy protection, are still warranted further actions to make the Taiwan PharmaCloud system a convenient platform for medication reconciliation.

As their economic costs are high and emergency trauma care is lacking in the country, the prevention of the road traffic injuries is extremely important. To prevent road traffic injuries, accurate information are mandatory on modes, patterns and trends of crashes and injuries. However, existing surveillance systems in Sri Lanka carry enormous deficiencies in receiving, recording and disseminating information of road traffic crashes and injuries. Hence, we designed a Web based injury surveillance system (WBISS) to overcome these deficiencies and to improve the inter-sector coordination for road traffic injury prevention in Sri Lanka. We adopted to WHO injury surveillance guidelines and used standard injury scales in designing this system. The system utilizes available resources without causing extra burden to government of Sri Lanka. This WBISS collects data on road traffic injuries from hospitals and relevant police stations. Data will be entered online to a Web based data base. WBISS will provide accurate, complete, timely data on patterns and determinants of road traffic injuries and will help to implement timely interventions. This system will also aid the frequent updating of the knowledge on road traffic injuries in the country. WBISS can be used worldwide. Other developing countries can also share the same system.	database;world wide web	Achala Upendra Jayatilleke;Chandrajith Ashuboda Marasinghe;Shinji Nakahara;St Nandasara;Achini Jayatilleke;Masamine Jimba	2007	7th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT 2007)	10.1109/CIT.2007.102	law;computer security;government;health care	Robotics	-58.20633141909327	-62.414547925386856	146065

In this study touchscreen and accelerometer data was collected from a group of 98 volunteers during filling in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire on a tablet computer. Subjects performed swipes on the touchscreen in order to answer the questions. Touchscreen swipes have been already used for user authentication. We show that our constrained swipes contain enough user specific information to be utilized for the same task. Moreover, we have studied the predictability of personality traits such as extraversion, and neuroticism from the collected data. Extraversion was found to be the most reliably predictable personality trait.

In this paper, we sought to explore the reasons for delays in implementing major hospital-based HIT, through studying computerized physician order entry (CPOE) and clinical decision support (CDS) systems for prescribing and to develop a provisional taxonomy of causes of implementation delays.   METHODS We undertook a series of longitudinal, qualitative case studies to investigate the implementation and adoption of CPOE and CDS systems for prescribing in hospitals in the U.K. We used a combination of semi-structured interviews from six case study sites and two whole day expert roundtable discussions to collect data. Interviews were carried out with users, implementers and suppliers of CPOE/CDS systems. We used thematic analysis to examine the results, drawing on perspectives surrounding the biography of artefacts.   RESULTS We identified 15 major factors contributing to delays in implementation of CPOE and CDS systems. These were then categorized in a two-by-two delay classification matrix: one axis distinguishing tactical versus unintended causes of delay, and the second axis illustrating internal i.e., (the adopting hospital) versus external (i.e., suppliers, other hospitals, policymakers) related causes.   CONCLUSIONS Our taxonomy of delays in HIT implementation should enable system developers, implementers and policymakers to better plan and manage future implementations. More detailed planning at the outset, considering long-term strategies, sustained user engagement, and phased implementation approaches appeared to reduce the risks of delays. It should however be noted that whilst some delays are likely to be preventable, other delays cannot be easily avoided and taking steps to minimize these may negatively affect the longer-term use of the system.	apache axis;axis vertebra;cds isis;categorization;clinical decision support system;computerized physician order entry system;contribution;information sciences;interviews;morphologic artifacts;order management system;preventable;semiconductor industry;taxonomy;thrombocytopenia;while	Hajar Mozaffar;Kathrin M.

ccfb79181a7eaf9b304ca1fa51ced5fe34e98e3a	linking nurses with evidence-based information via social media tools: an analysis of the literature		Many health professional believe that social media tools can play a pivotal role in sharing and facilitating the use of evidence-based information with patients and other healthcare providers. By understanding how social media tools function, healthcare professionals can capitalize on these interactive platforms to improve the health of others. However, limited information exists to guide nurse educators in preparing healthcare professionals to engage patients or share evidence-based information among peers. The purpose of this literature review was to determine the extent to which professional development programs using social media for sharing evidence-based information have reported their research and/or experience in the published literature.	patients;preparation;scientific publication;social media	Heather Carter-Templeton;Mangala Krishnamurthy;Ramona Nelson	2016	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-658-3-1007	professional development;evidence-based nursing;knowledge management;health informatics;social media;evidence-based practice;health care;medicine;nursing research	HCI	-62.171243902137064	-60.236798339621004	146421

We built an ontology-based decision support system that generates discharge recommendations for patients who have undergone surgical procedures. Discharge decisions are made based on patient vitals, symptoms, medical history and details of the surgical procedure. The output recommendations of our system can aid healthcare providers in discharge decision-making and potentially reduce readmissions due to improper discharge. This project demonstrates the potential uses of ontologies in medical decision support systems, especially in areas that use specific scoring guidelines to aid decision-making.	clinical decision support system;discharger;heart rate variability;ontology (information science)	Lucy L.

The new CIS is a Web-based one and now integrated to the Hospital Information System (HIS). In a close collaboration with the experts, we have, first, specified the relevant information for each report. Then, we have linked the system to those HIS DBs containing this information. Finally we have developed a well-secured intranet Web site, on which the concerned practitioners can instantaneously review the latest alerts and/or the summarized/detailed reports. The preliminary results shows that the system is reliable in medical practice and the response time is satisfying.		Samir Bouam;Emmanuelle Girou;Christian Brun-Buisson;Éric Lepage	1999	Proceedings.

The lack of support services can make handicapped people overly dependent on their families, which prevents them from being economically active and socially included. The Internet of Things can offer people with disabilities the assistance and support they need to achieve a good quality of life and allows them to participate in the social and economic life. In this paper, an overview of the Internet of Things for people with disabilities is provided. For this purpose, the proposed architecture of the Internet of Things is introduced. Different application scenarios are considered in order to illustrate the interaction of the components of the Internet of Things.

In an attempt to ascertain how well current electronic health records (EHRs) facilitated these processes, we evaluated the graphical displays of laboratory test results in eight EHRs using objective criteria for optimal graphs based on literature and expert opinion. None of the EHRs met all 11 criteria; the magnitude of deficiency ranged from one EHR meeting 10 of 11 criteria to three EHRs meeting only 5 of 11 criteria. One criterion (i.e., the EHR has a graph with y-axis labels that display both the name of the measured variable and the units of measure) was absent from all EHRs. One EHR system graphed results in reverse chronological order. One EHR system plotted data collected at unequally-spaced points in time using equally-spaced data points, which had the effect of erroneously depicting the visual slope perception between data points. This deficiency could have a significant, negative impact on patient safety. Only two EHR systems allowed users to see, hover-over, or click on a data point to see the precise values of the x-y coordinates. Our study suggests that many current EHR-generated graphs do not meet evidence-based criteria aimed at improving laboratory data comprehension.	angular defect;apache axis;data point;depth perception;diagnostic tests;electronic health records;graph (discrete mathematics);graph - visual representation;graph of a function;infographic;laboratory procedures;list comprehension	Dean F.

In the Health e-Decision project, we address these limitations in our work on building general HDAs targeted for older adults. Our approach uses a decision-support software architecture that enables principled methods for HDAs. We have formalized a novel knowledge-based decision model (KBDM), using Protégé OWL, that developers and clinicians can instantiate to tailor the components of the architecture for a particular health problem. In this paper, we present the methods used in the architecture and the knowledgebase design; the latter encompasses influence-diagram concepts, specific health problems, health outcome states, and probabilistic relationships. We discuss how this approach improves upon prior HDA methods. We also show that our use of computer-interpretable knowledge provides a structured, customizable means of enabling patient-centered decision support.	aids-related malignant cervical neoplasm;accessibility;acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;decision making;decision support systems, clinical;decision support system;influence diagram;intel high definition audio;knowledge bases;knowledge base;knowledge-based systems;patients;protégé;software architecture	Amarendra K Das;Bilal A.

Each record contains image information, such as body part and view position, exposure level, technologist identifier, and—if the image was rejected—the reason for rejection. Extensive database filtering was required to ensure the integrity of the reject-rate calculations. The reject rate for CR across all departments and across all exam types was 4.4% at UH and 4.9% at CH. The most frequently occurring exam types with reject rates of 8% or greater were found to be common to both institutions (skull/facial bones, shoulder, hip, spines, in-department chest, pelvis). Positioning errors and anatomy cutoff were the most frequently occurring reasons for rejection, accounting for 45% of rejects at CH and 56% at UH. Improper exposure was the next most frequently occurring reject reason (14% of rejects at CH and 13% at UH), followed by patient motion (11% of rejects at CH and 7% at UH). Chest exams were the most frequently performed exam at both institutions (26% at UH and 45% at CH) with half captured in-department and half captured using portable x-ray equipment. A ninefold greater reject rate was found for in-department (9%) versus portable chest exams (1%). Problems identified with the integrity of the data used for reject analysis can be mitigated in the future by objectifying quality assurance (QA) procedures and by standardizing the nomenclature and definitions for QA deficiencies.	anatomic structures;arterial pulse quality:type:pt:xxx:nom:palpation;body part;bone structure of face;cardiovascular technologist;computed radiography;data collection;deny (action);hospitals, community;hospitals, university;identifier;lesch-nyhan syndrome;nomenclature;recommender system;rejection sampling;roentgen rays;skeletal bone;software quality assurance;vertebral column	David H.

It is argued that successful adoption of the processes that are critical to quality improvement is necessary for durable improvements in quality. Knowledge sharing is necessary for supporting the skills in performing activities associated with practice audit, change management and use of the associated technology. This paper introduces the Relationships, Communities, Quality (RCQ) model, which provides a framework for the purpose of conceptualizing how quality improvement in healthcare can be sustained. A variance model is proposed for the evaluation of communities of practice for their value in quality improvement in healthcare.

Although the ability to change clinical processes is essential, change becomes a significant challenge within complex organizations as characteristic of healthcare, and precarious when dealing with human life. Inter-clinician relationships have the ability to support PA efforts within healthcare organizations. In this context, relationships may be defined as a socio-cultural medium for the interchange of knowledge as well as fostering a heightened level of mutual understanding between clinicians. These relationships are connections that clinicians draw upon when knowledge is sought, or if new knowledge needs to be communicated. Communities of practice (COPs) offer a venue in which these relationships can be formed and maintained. It is argued that sustained adherence to such auditing processes is necessary for durable improvements in quality, and knowledge sharing is necessary for this prolonged adherence, as conducting PA requires many skills that clinicians do not necessarily possess. Chief among these skills is working with the required technology, change management and creation of an appropriate intervention to address quality issues. This paper presents a framework for the evaluation of communities of practice as a facilitator of quality improvement in healthcare. The motivation for this paper is to foster the sharing of knowledge and facilitating relationships among healthcare practitioners, as well as others interested in quality improvement in healthcare, thereby encouraging practitioners to engage in improving the quality in healthcare. To accomplish this goal, quality improvement in healthcare will be characterized, and the factors that impact the participation in PA in healthcare will be presented. Accordingly, the importance of maintaining inter-clinician relationships for knowledge sharing with COPs will be discussed, and the determinants of participation and methods of evaluation will be presented. The issues with applying communities of practice for the purpose of quality improvement in healthcare are explored, including issues with the workplace, technology as well as clinical perspectives. The Relationships, Communities, Quality (RCQ) variance model will then be posited, which provides a framework for evaluating communities of practice in the domain of quality improvement in healthcare. Finally, opportunities for applying the framework in a research situation, and implications for practitioners will be discussed. BACKGROUND–QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTHCARE In Canada, clinicians, managers and policymakers are aware of quality deficiencies in the Canadian healthcare system, as it is a top priority of Health Canada (2004). Preventable adverse events (AEs), which are unintended injuries or complications resulting in harm of a patient, offer an example of this. It has been estimated that, of 185,000 acute care hospital admissions associated with AEs, 70,000 may have been preventable. Insufficient emergency room capacity and wait times for surgery have occasionally resulted in occasionally fatal consequences (“Ontario emergency room waits,” 2005; “Alta. MLA alleges hush-money,” 2011; Global Winnipeg, 2009). As well, factors including rapidly escalating medical costs and increasing demands for accountability and transparency in clinical practice, have mandated the development of metrics in performance assessment and mechanisms for promoting perpetual improvement in quality (Harrigan, 2000). Various approaches have been implemented in healthcare to address quality issues. Common among each of these approaches are measurement of key indicators, inference causes of quality issues, creation of solutions for these problems, implementation of change and evaluation of performance post-change. PA in particular (Godwin, 2001), espouses physicianinitiated refinement of clinical processes, so that they meet or exceed a target standard. Although some audits are merely descriptive, that is they describe a current state of performance, others are prescriptive, in the sense they report on im15 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/rcq-model-conceptualizing-interclinician/67368?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Medicine, Healthcare, and Life Science, InfoSciSelect, InfoSci-Select, InfoSci-Healthcare Administration, Clinical Practice, and Bioinformatics eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology.

METHODS We inter-viewed EMR physician champions from 20 solo/small group practices to understand different types of EMR users and their EMR-related costs and benefits.   RESULTS Interviewees differed greatly in the EMR-related benefits they generated. These differences were associated with how they used the EMR, and the amount of effort they invested in making changes to complement EMR use. We defined five types of physician EMR users: Viewers, Basic Users, Strivers, Arrivers, and System Changers. The majority of interviewees were Strivers and Arrivers, physicians who have already invested substantial time in numerous process changes that help generate EMR-related benefits.   CONCLUSIONS Incentives and comprehensive support services for facilitating complementary process changes could be important for moving physicians from one user group to another. Additional research is needed to verify this user typology and to further define the relationship between user types and EMR-generated financial and quality benefits.	biological anthropology;complement system proteins;electronic health records;electronics, medical;excalibur: morgana's revenge;solo;structure of observed learning outcome;benefit	Robert H.

One innovative approach to addressing this problem is Exergaming. A combination of Exercise and Gaming, the objective is to motivate people participate in exercise regimes, usually in their home environment. In this article a more holistic interpretation of this exercise paradigm is proposed. Freegaming augments Exergaming in a number of key dimensions but especially through the promotion of games in outdoor mobile contexts and within a social environment. The design and implementation of a platform for Freegaming is described and illustrated through the description of a sample game.	augmented reality	Levent Görgü;Abraham G.

With such experience, in addition to extensive practice in managing change, knowledge sharing and innovation, it would be interesting in offering a contribution by facilitating a dialogue, knowledge café (i.e. bringing in knowledge) on these issues, and how to apply them to new and altering scenarios. When one comes into the area of health care, one major limitation felt by those institutions is in the selection process of physicians to undertake a specific task, where there is a lack of objective, of validated measures of human performance. Indeed, objective measures are necessary if simulators are to be used to evaluate the skills and training of medical practitioners and teams or to evaluate the impact of new processes or equipment design on the overall system performance. In this paper it will be presented a logical theory of Situation Awareness (SA) and discusses the methods required for developing an objective measure of SA within the context of a simulated medical environment, as the one referred to above.

We sought to understand the broad range of social and technical factors that affect test result management in an integrated EHR-based health system.   METHODS Between June and November 2010, we conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of all primary care practitioners (PCPs) within the Department of Veterans Affairs nationwide. Survey development was guided by a socio-technical model describing multiple inter-related dimensions of EHR use.   FINDINGS Of 5001 PCPs invited, 2590 (51.8%) responded. 55.5% believed that the EHRs did not have convenient features for notifying patients of test results. Over a third (37.9%) reported having staff support needed for notifying patients of test results. Many relied on the patient's next visit to notify them for normal (46.1%) and abnormal results (20.1%). Only 45.7% reported receiving adequate training on using the EHR notification system and 35.1% reported having an assigned contact for technical assistance with the EHR; most received help from colleagues (60.4%). A majority (85.6%) stayed after hours or came in on weekends to address notifications; less than a third reported receiving protected time (30.1%). PCPs strongly endorsed several new features to improve test result management, including better tracking and visualization of result notifications.   CONCLUSIONS Despite an advanced EHR, both social and technical challenges exist in ensuring notification of test results to practitioners and patients. Current EHR technology requires significant improvement in order to avoid similar challenges elsewhere.	cross-sectional data;electronic health records;imagery;neoplasms, unknown primary;notification system;patients;personnameuse - assigned;primary health care;sociotechnical system;technical standard;web application	Hardeep Singh;Christiane Spitzmueller;Nancy J.

But the trend toward wearable computing is not as new as it seems. Taking something useful and making it more convenient is as old as time. This can be seen with the historical shift from pocket watches to wrist-watches. We're now seeing new tools and technologies being taken out of our pockets and put into seemingly more convenient places like our wrists, feet, and faces— think Google Glass. These trends might revolutionize the way we live, behave, and interact. However , we know convenience and wow factor won't be the only driver in the explosion of wearable devices. Beyond the current commercial applications, extensive research is being done to push the limits of wearable computing. Shoes, watches, gloves, hats, and other common body-worn items could become a dynamic sensor network, providing vast quantities of information about the wearer and their surroundings. Providing a comprehensive picture of recent trends in wearable computing seems infeasible. Thus, in this issue we highlight applications in personal behavior monitoring, health care, and human-computer interaction. peRsonAL BehAvioR moniToRing Sports are an everyday activity for millions of people. But not everybody has access to a trainer. Prompting Christina Strohrmann and Gerhard Tröster to introduce a wearable sensor system to monitor a runner's performance in the field. They suggest methods that assess skill level, technique, and fatigue from motion sensor data. For those that are less active, fitness track-ers can be a motivator to get moving. Andrew Miller shares his experience using Fitbits and social media concepts with teens to help increase activity and stave off obesity. An active body is ideal, but we mustn't forget about mental agility. Reading is a highly frequent activity that trains our mental fitness. Kai Kunze proposes a novel method to recognize document types based on gaze tracking. Integrating such a system into glasses could improve awareness about our personal knowledge acquisition in the future. heALThcARe AppLicATions Wearable computing opens up a number of possibilities in healthcare. Current research experiences shift from acute care toward long-term monitoring with a focus on outpatient prevention and rehabilitation.

8a53d647e669a1dbe135b5630945ba3838cf93b5	facilitating flexible electricity use in the home with eco-feedback and eco-forecasting	sustainability;energy consumption;domestic;flexibility	Over the last decade there has been an increased focus on changing domestic electricity consumption behaviors. While the usual approach has been to facilitate reduced consumption, recent work has started looking at facilitating more flexible electricity use as a means of shifting consumption to more favorable times. This approach means that people may behave more sustainably without necessarily using less electricity. Exploring this emerging approach, this paper presents a study of flexibility in domestic electricity use as facilitated by an eco-feedback system with forecast information about price, availability of green energy, and grid demand. The prototype system was deployed in three households for 22 weeks. Our findings show that flexible electricity use is far from trivial to achieve in domestic households. The details of this is relevant for understanding people's ability and willingness to shift electricity consumption, and for the design of systems that facilitate doing this.	prototype	Jesper Kjeldskov;Mikael B.

DESIGN In the first part of the paper, we summarize results from a study in which patients were interviewed before their interactions with physicians and where physician-patient interactions were recorded and analyzed to evaluate patients' and physicians' understanding of the patient problem. We give a detailed presentation of one of such interaction, with characterizations of physician and patient models. In a second set of studies, the contents of both paper and EMRs were compared and in addition, physician-patient interactions (involving the use of EMR technology) were video recorded and analyzed to assess physicians' information gathering and knowledge organization for medical decision-making.   RESULTS Physicians explained the patient problems in terms of causal pathophysiological knowledge underlying the disease (disease model), whereas patients explained them in terms of narrative structures of illness (illness model). The data-driven nature of the traditional physician-patient interaction allows physicians to capture the temporal flow of events and to document key aspects of the patients' narratives. Use of electronic medical records was found to influence the way patient data were gathered, resulting in information loss and disruption of temporal sequence of events in assessing patient problem.   CONCLUSIONS The physician-patient interview allows physicians to capture crucial aspects of the patient's illness model, which are necessary for understanding the problem from the patients' perspective. Use of computer-based patient record technology may lead to a loss of this relevant information. As a consequence, designers of such systems should take into account information relevant to the patient comprehension of medical problems, which will influence their compliance.		Vimla L.

Integrating patient information into an electronic patient record system has become key for modern patient care in medicine in recent years. Clinically, it is also necessary to track patients' progress in longitudinal studies, in order to provide comprehensive understanding of disease progression and response to treatment. As the amount of required data increases, there exists a need for an efficient systematic solution to store and analyze MS patient data, disease profiles, and disease tracking for both clinical and research purposes.   METHOD An imaging informatics based system, called MS eFolder, has been developed as an integrated patient record system for data storage and analysis of MS patients. The eFolder system, with a DICOM-based database, includes a module for lesion contouring by radiologists, a MS lesion quantification tool to quantify MS lesion volume in 3D, brain parenchyma fraction analysis, and provide quantitative analysis and tracking of volume changes in longitudinal studies. Patient data, including MR images, have been collected retrospectively at University of Southern California Medical Center (USC) and Los Angeles County Hospital (LAC). The MS eFolder utilizes web-based components, such as browser-based graphical user interface (GUI) and web-based database. The eFolder database stores patient clinical data (demographics, MS disease history, family history, etc.), MR imaging-related data found in DICOM headers, and lesion quantification results. Lesion quantification results are derived from radiologists' contours on brain MRI studies and quantified into 3-dimensional volumes and locations. Quantified results of white matter lesions are integrated into a structured report based on DICOM-SR protocol and templates. The user interface displays patient clinical information, original MR images, and viewing structured reports of quantified results. The GUI also includes a data mining tool to handle unique search queries for MS. System workflow and dataflow steps has been designed based on the IHE post-processing workflow profile, including workflow process tracking, MS lesion contouring and quantification of MR images at a post-processing workstation, and storage of quantitative results as DICOM-SR in DICOM-based storage system. The web-based GUI is designed to display zero-footprint DICOM web-accessible data objects (WADO) and the SR objects.   SUMMARY The MS eFolder system has been designed and developed as an integrated data storage and mining solution in both clinical and research environments, while providing unique features, such as quantitative lesion analysis and disease tracking over a longitudinal study. A comprehensive image and clinical data integrated database provided by MS eFolder provides a platform for treatment assessment, outcomes analysis and decision-support. The proposed system serves as a platform for future quantitative analysis derived automatically from CAD algorithms that can also be integrated within the system for individual disease tracking and future MS-related research. Ultimately the eFolder provides a decision-support infrastructure that can eventually be used as add-on value to the overall electronic medical record.		Kevin C. Ma;James R.

We propose an online care and rehabilitation planning tool as a potential eHealth service for stroke patients. The aim is to study the care professionals' perceived usefulness of the planning tool. We developed and presented a functional prototype to a neurology team in Stockholm. Three focus groups were performed with the care professionals in the team and the data were analysed based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. Although care professionals mentioned challenges such as time limitation for using the tool and issues related to the responsibility of the system, they were positive towards the tool and its potential usefulness in ease of understanding the rehabilitation process and support for collaboration.

To persuade clinicians to act, CEMs have used prewritten-text explanations. However, we encountered limitations of prewritten-text explanations in our CEM. Therefore, we decided to implement an advanced method for explanation (Suermondt's method for belief-network explanation). This method is promising, but whether it is generally applicable to all of clinical event monitoring and whether it is as efficacious as prewritten-text explanations remain areas for future research.	algorithm;bayesian network;certified emergency nurse;event monitoring;horner's method;explanation	William R.

Such systems are already prevalent in fields like cardio diagnosis and it is still very nascent in the field of ophthalmology. But with the emergence of affordable and high quality remote-control cameras, a host of new possibilities have opened up. In this paper, we have developed innovative gaze alignment techniques for ensuring Mutual Gaze, Gaze Awareness and Gaze following. The system is shown to work effectively even for interactions that are as complex as involving multiparty consultations involving remotely located patients through the use of a mobile telemedicine network and general physician/physician-assistant and specialist ophthalmologist.

02ef1ba821429776b3dca4bc14c71a13c8c5fccd	user acceptance of and satisfaction with a personal electronic health record		OBJECTIVE With akteonline.de a patient owned Electronic Health Record (EHR) has been implemented that combines both data from clinical information systems and data entered by the patient. In addition the EHR supports information exchange/communication controlled by the user. The EHR thus offers the potential to place the patient into a more empowered position. This impact on patient empowerment and the implementation of additional features is to be investigated. Additionally, the user satisfaction is to be evaluated regarding patients' acceptance and utilization of the system.   METHOD Users were divided into three groups, two of which received different training on the functionalities of akteonline.de. A quantitative study employing an online-questionnaire and considering all registered users was conducted.   RESULTS Users evaluated the internet based system to be feasible and the navigation to be suitable, yet additional training for users regarding particular features seems to be required and also for hospital staff in general. The proposed add-ons were approved of. The study also showed positive effects on patient empowerment.	computer user satisfaction;electronic health records;information systems;information exchange;information system;internet;patients;registration	A.

bbfb2b98ff2403ae94c1a8be5ad057e56dab85ed	neuroehr: open source telehealth system for the management of clinical data, eeg and remote diagnosis of epilepsy		Problem: A number of technologies has been developed aiming at improving the availability, opportunity, difficulty of access or efficiency of epilepsy diagnosis based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, these approaches are not all based on open technologies, neither are they integrated into Electronic Health Record information (EHR) systems to support continuity of care. Objective: To develop an open source EHR system for the management of patient’s information, encounter scheduling, remote registration, and subsequent analysis of EEG data. Methods: The analysis, design, and implementation of the system followed the Scrum framework. The implementation was based on an open source platform for EHR systems named OpenMRS. Results: NeuroEHR supports the provision of Tele-EEG services, integrates patient’s clinical information, and EEG data captured remotely from an EEG device, stores the data in an EEG repository, and allows a neurologist to provide a diagnosis based on clinical and EEG data. Conclusions: The NeuroEHR system is currently being used in the context of the NeuroMoTIC project, in which a pediatric EEG data set is being created and annotated, and some Artificial Intelligence algorithms are being tested to support a telehealth service for the diagnosis of epilepsy.

036e15049af8401a6e51d149531fec95b3abe12a	nurses: extending care through telehealth		Nurses have an immense impact on the growth and scope of Telehealth as they embrace diverse roles. TeleNursing introduces transformational change which positively impacts both clients and providers, increasing access to care and reducing the time and costs associated with traveling for health care. Integration of clinical support and remote diagnostic tools inspire new uses of Telehealth, thus enabling care previously only possible in person to be delivered virtually. Nurses currently leverage Telehealth to deliver care and education, monitor clients remotely and support medical consultations. Over 90% of Island Health nurses surveyed recommend Telehealth as a care modality to clients and 100% support Telehealth as a means to increase care to vulnerable communities. Programs wish to increase uptake of TeleNursing but face numerous challenges regarding funding, resourcing, scheduling and geographical ownership. TeleNursing goes beyond clinical support and has the potential to exponentially expand Telehealth services, normalizing Telehealth as a care modality. Nurses look to Telehealth to improve their ability to partner with clients over distance, providing surgical care, maternal/pediatric care and group education.	clients;community;consultation;embedded system;embedding;health care;modality (human–computer interaction);physical examination;programming paradigm;scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;telemedicine;telenursing;exponential;travel	Maryah Allen;Mya Aylott;Margarita Loyola;Mika Moric;Lisa Saffarek	2015	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-488-6-35	family medicine;medicine;nursing;emergency medicine	HCI	-58.79196428717432	-61.131203340146136	149729

It aims to use lifestyle information to map out the key elements of a regular railway commute, the stressors encountered during the process, and the factors that make it a salient habit. Research will then involve the utilisation of both travel and lifestyle data to identify the points in a person's life at which these habits can be influenced -- namely, the question of whether information provision during times of lifestyle/contextual change can be effective in influencing travel habits. Furthermore, it will involve the analysis of key stressors within the travel context, and how they can be avoided through the provision of appropriate information at the right time. The objectives of this form research involve improving customer experience for the individual through personal optimisation of everyday travel, while also providing train operating companies with a more comprehensive understanding of customer issues.  The project will give the academic literature a comprehensive understanding of the psychological motivations, and situational factors that influence the daily commuter; thus providing a more in-depth understanding of how the concept of digital identity can be used to understand the life of a typical railway traveller.	digital curation;digital identity;mathematical optimization;personally identifiable information	Shalaka Kurup;David Golightly;Nick Wilson	2016		10.1145/2968219.2968318	simulation;behavior	HCI	-62.025005158751284	-57.11474644134262	149780
5c7287a6f1a06bb0e910f71436b2c01803322588	enhancing patient care and care coordination using event notification systems		Event notification systems (ENS) are being deployed to provide timely alerts to participating providers when their patients are being admitted, discharged or transferred (ADT) from participating hospitals. Hospitals and health information exchanges (HIE) are implementing ENS in an effort to reduce costly hospital readmissions and to improve the overall quality of patient care through improved care coordination. Today, there are numerous ENS actively facilitating care coordination across the country. For those participating providers and hospitals, coordination has been significantly improved and hospital readmissions have been reduced. Furthermore, patients and clinicians report improved patient care and care coordination, and report higher levels of patient satisfaction. Despite reported success, the application and implementation of ENS vary across the country. Some of the variability stems from the challenges that are inherent to the design of the ENS. These challenges, discussed herein, require careful consideration in order to fully realize ENS benefits.

Despite wide-spread availability, computerised aids have not been shown to significantly improve diagnostic decision-making in a real world environment, mainly due to the need for prolonged system consultation. In this study performed in the clinical environment, we used a Web-based diagnostic reminder system that provided rapid advice with free text data entry to examine its impact on clinicians' decisions in an acute paediatric setting during assessments characterised by diagnostic uncertainty.   METHODS Junior doctors working over a 5-month period at four paediatric ambulatory units consulted the Web-based diagnostic aid when they felt the need for diagnostic assistance. Subjects recorded their clinical decisions for patients (differential diagnosis, test-ordering and treatment) before and after system consultation. An expert panel of four paediatric consultants independently suggested clinically significant decisions indicating an appropriate and 'safe' assessment. The primary outcome measure was change in the proportion of 'unsafe' workups by subjects during patient assessment. A more sensitive evaluation of impact was performed using specific validated quality scores. Adverse effects of consultation on decision-making, as well as the additional time spent on system use were examined.   RESULTS Subjects attempted to access the diagnostic aid on 595 occasions during the study period (8.6% of all medical assessments); subjects examined diagnostic advice only in 177 episodes (30%). Senior House Officers at hospitals with greater number of available computer workstations in the clinical area were most likely to consult the system, especially out of working hours. Diagnostic workups construed as 'unsafe' occurred in 47/104 cases (45.2%); this reduced to 32.7% following system consultation (McNemar test, p < 0.001). Subjects' mean 'unsafe' workups per case decreased from 0.49 to 0.32 (p < 0.001). System advice prompted the clinician to consider the 'correct' diagnosis (established at discharge) during initial assessment in 3/104 patients. Median usage time was 1 min 38 sec (IQR 50 sec-3 min 21 sec). Despite a modest increase in the number of diagnostic possibilities entertained by the clinician, no adverse effects were demonstrable on patient management following system use. Numerous technical barriers prevented subjects from accessing the diagnostic aid in the majority of eligible patients in whom they sought diagnostic assistance.   CONCLUSION We have shown that junior doctors used a Web-based diagnostic reminder system during acute paediatric assessments to significantly improve the quality of their diagnostic workup and reduce diagnostic omission errors. These benefits were achieved without any adverse effects on patient management following a quick consultation.	active worlds;attempt;b. j. fogg;cfh gene;cns disorder;consultation;crew resource management, healthcare;data collection;decision making;decision making, computer-assisted;diagnostic medical sonography;diagram;discharger;drug delivery systems;evaluation procedure;hiv enteropathy;health services, national;identifier;interpretation (logic);login;manuscripts;maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;outcome measures;patients;pediatrics;potts model;primary health care;rating (action);regulatory submission;revision procedure;text corpus;united states indian health service;usage data;workstation;world wide web;benefit;emergency medicine (field);interest;research grants;subsidiary	Padmanabhan Ramnarayan;Andrew Winrow;Michael Coren;Vasantha Nanduri;Roger Buchdahl;Benjamin Jacobs;Helen Fisher;Paul M.

Electronic platforms for various procedures and resource sharing systems, such as electronic medical equipment, accumulated medical knowledge, various disease studies, information services management, and retaining and transferring health records, undergo constant development. Previous procedures followed by hospital social workers when recording suicide attempts were complicated and tedious, reducing the level of care provided to monitored cases and affecting the quality of suicide prevention and quality control indicators. Therefore, we implemented an information system for hospital suicide prevention operations and simplified the procedures to enable health care workers to effectively understand the conditions of suicidal cases. This information system not only enhances suicide prevention operations but also provides an effective information platform for the suicide prevention link actively promoted by the government.	information system	Chien-Nan Lee;Yi-Hsing Ho	2012	2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359669	lead;social work;logic gate;suicide prevention;computer-aided software engineering;information system;health care	DB	-55.29031391682959	-61.52521071163668	150370
396e1b59f3d3dce402fcacbbc1098ea2686a2171	automatic and strategic search during analogical retrieval		The present study investigates two key aspects of analogical retrieval: (1) whether other activities different from problem solving automatically elicit a search for analogical sources, and (2) whether strategic search can overcome the superficial bias observed in classical experiments. In Experiment 1, participants had to generate persuasive arguments for a target situation under three experimental conditions: without indication to use analogies, with instruction to use analogies, and with indication to search for sources within four predefined domains: health, human relations, housekeeping, and breeding of animals and plants. Responses from the first condition showed that argumentation rarely triggers spontaneous analogical retrievals, a result that is at odds with most studies on problem solving. Results from the remaining conditions demonstrated that the superficial bias can be strategically reversed when participants are suggested to focus on specific domains. Experiment 2 replicated this last result with the simple instruction to search within domains different from that of the target (i.e., without being provided with a list of specific domains). The theoretical and educational implications of these findings are discussed.	analogical modeling;cooperative breeding;experiment;information retrieval;problem solving;small-bias sample space;spontaneous order;the superficial	Máximo Trench;Valeria Olguín;Adrián Margni;Ricardo A.

In general, they are considered as innovations potentially delivering benefits to patients. Physicians are considered as potential channels to disseminate these innovations to patients. However, physicians' behavior in this regard has not been studied.   OBJECTIVES To capture physicians' attitudes towards recommending health apps to patients and to describe factors influencing physicians' behavior, taking the specifics of an early adopter country, Sweden, into account.   METHODS Diffusion of Innovation theory, the Health App Maturity Model and the Six Hurdles Model were used to construct a web-based survey that was answered by 44 Swedish physicians. Survey results were followed up with 2 individual interviews. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data analysis and recursive abstraction for qualitative data analysis.   RESULTS Only a small group of physicians currently recommend mobile health apps to their patients. However, most physicians have a positive attitude and perceive improvement of patients' self-management ability as main benefit of health apps. Main perceived weaknesses include the lack of evidence-based content and lack of multi-language support. Regulation of health apps under the Medical Device Directive is asked for to assure quality and patient safety.   CONCLUSION Innovators and early adopters play an important role in the diffusion of mobile health apps. Interpersonal communication is seen as the most effective way for physicians gaining information and also motivates them to recommend mobile health apps to their patients. Physicians' knowledge about certified websites to ensure quality is however low.	attitude;capability maturity model;description;directive (programming);health occupations;medical care team;medical records systems, computerized;mobile health;numerical analysis;numerous;optimism;patients;recursion;self-management (computer science);weakness;web application;women's health services;benefit	Yiping Zhang;Sabine Koch	2015	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-512-8-793	family medicine;medicine;nursing;emergency medicine	HCI	-61.83176315845777	-62.810836905841526	150498
8b7249fce4511ad4927d98a15fae45571897d779	sleep quality as a mediator between technology-related sleep quality, depression, and anxiety		This study examines (a) relations among technology use during sleep time, sleep quality, and depression/anxiety and (b) time awake due to technology use. Two hundred thirty-six college students completed self-report questionnaires and week-long sleep diaries. Results revealed that 47 percent of students reported night-time waking to answer text messages and 40 percent to answer phone calls. Regression analyses indicated that higher levels of technology use after the onset of sleep predicted poorer sleep quality, and poorer sleep quality predicted symptoms of depression/anxiety. Finally, sleep quality is a mediator between technology use after the onset of sleep and depression/anxiety. College students who have difficulty setting boundaries around technology use may be at increased risk for psychological health concerns.	anxiety disorders;bonjour sleep proxy;depressive disorder;diaries;emoticon;mediator brand of benfluorex hydrochloride;onset (audio);sleep apnea syndromes;sleep quality question;testicular regression syndrome;mental health;message	Sue K.

To this end, ICT plays a crucial enabling role providing a growing ecosystem of diagnostic and monitoring devices, communication networks, and information management applications. As a part of this, advanced software architectures provide means for effective integration and management of clinical data produced by a variety of sources and accessed by a variety of actors involved in the care process. We describe the software architecture of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system that exploits the Reflection architectural pattern to allow agile tailoring for the needs of different medical specialties. We then show how this adaptability can be further exploited to face a number of challenging requirements posed by the context of home care, including: patient-centric personalization of the record structure; user-adapted content presentation; automated support for compliance verification; systems medicine connection of clinical observations pertaining to different specialties; integration of users observations and data streams acquired from remote monitoring devices.	agile software development;architectural pattern;coherence (physics);domain model;ecosystem;high-level programming language;information management;personalization;requirement;software architecture;software deployment;software engineering;systems medicine;telecommunications network	Fulvio Patara;Enrico Vicario	2014	2014 8th International Symposium on Medical Information and Communication Technology (ISMICT)	10.1109/ISMICT.2014.6825237	medicine;multimedia;biological engineering;world wide web	Arch	-55.32435632496355	-61.105491137208155	150687

Such e-health solutions range from being on one-side patient controlled to the other end of the spectrum being provider controlled. However, most agree that these solutions should be patient-centric. Australia has opted for a unique solution in an attempt to have the best of both worlds; i.e, some level of patient control and some level of provider control. This system is known as the PCEHR (personally controlled electronic health record). The following serves to investigate this system and if it is patient centric. In particular, how well patient focus, patient activity and patient empowerment are supported and/or enabled.	display resolution	Imran Muhammad;Nilmini Wickramasinghe	2014			simulation;medicine;knowledge management;multimedia	EDA	-59.09208271316429	-61.5256483496318	150789

Diabetes complications mostly occur due to a bad follow-up of patients. In this paper, we propose a new IT architecture for diabetes follow-up and introduce the bases of a new distributed computation protocol for this architecture. Our approach does not require any preexisting support communication infrastructure, can be deployed at low cost, and provides strong privacy and security guarantees. This work envisions an experiment in the field we plan to conduct under the authority of the Cameroonian National Center for Diabetes and Hypertension, with a potential for generalization to other diseases.	computation;cryptography;distributed computing;docking (molecular);emergence;high-level programming language;key (cryptography);privacy;requirement;server (computing);smartphone;tablet computer	Nicolas Anciaux;Sébastien Guilloton;Luc Bouganim;Sergio Ilarri;Alain Kamgang;Abraham Ngami;Christophe Nouedoui;Philippe Pucheral;Maurice Tchuente	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-43696-8_18	environmental health;environmental resource management	Security	-58.400472748965264	-62.36499005887544	151015

A crucial component to enhance reproducibility is to comprehensively collect and store metadata, that is, all information about the experiment, the data, and the applied preprocessing steps on the data, such that they can be accessed and shared in a consistent and simple manner. However, the complexity of experiments, the highly specialized analysis workflows and a lack of knowledge on how to make use of supporting software tools often overburden researchers to perform such a detailed documentation. For this reason, the collected metadata are often incomplete, incomprehensible for outsiders or ambiguous. Based on our research experience in dealing with diverse datasets, we here provide conceptual and technical guidance to overcome the challenges associated with the collection, organization, and storage of metadata in a neurophysiology laboratory. Through the concrete example of managing the metadata of a complex experiment that yields multi-channel recordings from monkeys performing a behavioral motor task, we practically demonstrate the implementation of these approaches and solutions with the intention that they may be generalized to other projects. Moreover, we detail five use cases that demonstrate the resulting benefits of constructing a well-organized metadata collection when processing or analyzing the recorded data, in particular when these are shared between laboratories in a modern scientific collaboration. Finally, we suggest an adaptable workflow to accumulate, structure and store metadata from different sources using, by way of example, the odML metadata framework.	documentation;experiment;handling (psychology);laboratory;monkeys;neurophysiology - biologic function;numerous;partial;preprocessor;science of neurophysiology;benefit	Lyuba Zehl;Florent Jaillet;Adrian Stoewer;Jan Grewe;Andrey Sobolev;Thomas Wachtler;Thomas Brochier;Alexa Riehle;Michael Denker;Sonja Grün	2016		10.3389/fninf.2016.00026	electrophysiology;neuroscience;computer science;bioinformatics;reproducibility;data mining;database;world wide web;data element;meta data services;statistics;metadata repository	ML	-49.035260179323586	-65.31158015169657	151136

0a0414300955917c171cd5e95bc2e0a552a952d4	family history assessment for colorectal cancer (crc) risk analysis - comparison of diagram- and questionnaire-based web interfaces	health informatics;surveys and questionnaires;information systems and communication service;internet;genetic predisposition to disease;adult;management of computing and information systems;risk assessment;algorithms;medical informatics applications;humans;user computer interface;colorectal neoplasms	BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a high incidence, especially in New Zealand. The reasons for this are unknown. While most cancers develop sporadically, a positive family history, determined by the number and age at diagnosis of affected first and second degree relatives with CRC is one of the major factors, which may increase an individual's lifetime risk. Before a patient can be enrolled in a surveillance program a detailed assessment and documentation of the family history is important but time consuming and often inaccurate. The documentation is usually paper-based. Our aim was therefore to develop and validate the usability and efficacy of a web-based family history assessment tool for CRC suitable for the general population. The tool was also to calculate the risk and make a recommendation for surveillance.   METHODS Two versions of an electronic assessment tool, diagram-based and questionnaire-based, were developed with the risk analysis and recommendations for surveillance based on the New Zealand Guidelines Group recommendations. Accuracy of our tool was tested prior to the study by comparing risk calculations based on family history by experienced gastroenterologists with the electronic assessment. The general public, visiting a local science fair were asked to use and comment on the usability of the two interfaces.   RESULTS Ninety people assessed and commented on the two interfaces. Both interfaces were effective in assessing the risk to develop CRC through their familial history for CRC. However, the questionnaire-based interface performed with significantly better satisfaction (p = 0.001) than the diagram-based interface. There was no difference in efficacy though.   CONCLUSION We conclude that a web-based questionnaire tool can assist in the accurate documentation and analysis of the family history relevant to determine the individual risk of CRC based on local guidelines. The calculator is now implemented and assessable through the web-page of a local charity for colorectal cancer awareness and integral part of the local general practitioners' e-referral system for colonic imaging.	colorectal carcinoma;cyclic redundancy check;diagram;documentation;family history domain;floor and ceiling functions;it risk management;incidence matrix;interface device component;malignant neoplasms;patients;stand up to cancer;usability;user interface;version;web application	Michael Schultz;Steven Bohwan Seo;Alec Holt;Holger Regenbrecht	2015		10.1186/s12911-015-0211-1	health informatics;risk assessment;the internet;medicine;data science;nursing;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-58.84143270232096	-65.43611758853282	151351

The relationship between device ownership/provision and usage is, however, rarely discussed. This paper therefore presents survey data (N=267) on mobile computer ownership and use by doctors in two Portuguese and two US hospitals, considering both devices owned by individuals and those supplied by the hospital. The results show that ownership is not clearly related to either usage pattern or frequency of use. Providing handheld computers also did not lead to higher number of users, higher frequency of use or significant differences in tasks carried out. Nevertheless, doctors owning handhelds alone or in combination with laptops used them more frequently than those using laptops alone. Differences in usage pattern proportions rather than demographics were a better indication of differences in usage frequencies and the tasks for which MICT devices were being used.		Henrique M. G.

By collecting and sharing their health data through self-tracking devices and health networking services, self-experimenters engage in a unique form of n=1 citizen science-style research. This data sharing altruism is constrained by limited data security, validity, and socio-economic access. We will explore these issues as design challenges.

To date, the methods that underpin the scoping of user-identified online information needs in palliative care have remained under-explored. This paper describes the benefits and challenges of a collaborative approach involving users and experts that informed the first stage of the development of a palliative care website 1.   METHOD The action research-inspired methodology included a panel assessment of an existing palliative care website based in Victoria, Australia; a pre-development survey (n = 197) scoping potential audiences and palliative care information needs; working parties conducting a needs analysis about necessary information content for a redeveloped website targeting health professionals and caregivers/patients; an iterative evaluation process involving users and experts; as well as a final evaluation survey (n = 166).   RESULTS Involving users in the identification of content and links for a palliative care website is time-consuming and requires initial resources, strong networking skills and commitment. However, user participation provided crucial information that led to the widened the scope of the website audience and guided the development and testing of the website. The needs analysis underpinning the project suggests that palliative care peak bodies need to address three distinct audiences (clinicians, allied health professionals as well as patients and their caregivers).   CONCLUSION Web developers should pay close attention to the content, language, and accessibility needs of these groups. Given the substantial cost associated with the maintenance of authoritative health information sites, the paper proposes a more collaborative development in which users can be engaged in the definition of content to ensure relevance and responsiveness, and to eliminate unnecessary detail. Access to volunteer networks forms an integral part of such an approach.	accessibility;behavior;floor and ceiling functions;information resources;information needs;inspiration function;iteration;needs analysis;palliative care;patients;relevance;responsiveness;scope (computer science);self-information;stage level 1;victoria (3d figure);web site;web application;web developer;benefit;cellular targeting	Annette F.

Hence, in developing an information system for emergency care processes, it is essential to support individual process activities and to satisfy collaboration and coordination needs by providing readily access to patient and operational information regardless of location and time. Filling this information gap by enabling the provision of the right information, to the right people, at the right time fosters new challenges, including the specification of a common information format, the interoperability among heterogeneous institutional information systems or the development of new, ubiquitous trans-institutional systems. This paper is concerned with the development of an integrated computer support to emergency care processes by evolving and cross-linking institutional healthcare systems. To this end, an integrated EMS cloud-based architecture has been developed that allows authorized users to access emergency case information in standardized document form, as proposed by the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) profile, uses the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) standard Emergency Data Exchange Language (EDXL) Hospital Availability Exchange (HAVE) for exchanging operational data with hospitals and incorporates an intelligent module that supports triaging and selecting the most appropriate ambulances and hospitals for each case.	ambulances;authorization;automation;cloud computing;content format;crew resource management, healthcare;emergency medical service;genetic heterogeneity;information systems;information system;interdependence;interoperability;mobile computing;patients;platform as a service;source-to-source compiler;specification;technical support;standards characteristics	M.

METHOD A review of major programs and initiatives for ensuring safety of health information technology in the three countries was conducted. Published literature and Web resources from national programs were reviewed for relevant information.   RESULTS It was found that in all three countries the issue of technology-induced error has been recognized as being of critical importance. The three countries have developed approaches for dealing with the issue that have some commonalities; however, they are at varying different stages of maturity, with England having the longest standing and most well developed safety programs, while Canada and the United States are at earlier stages. The types of approaches employed have included work on developing standards related to usability and interface design, certifications, directives from regulatory bodies, educational initiatives in health information technology (HIT) safety as well as research into safer HIT design and implementation methods.   CONCLUSIONS HIT promises to lead to improved patient safety. However, it has become recognized that if not designed and deployed appropriately, such systems can lead to new types of errors. Based on this recognition, a variety of initiatives are being undertaken in Canada, the United States and England to promote the safe design, procurement and deployment of HIT. It is concluded that improved approaches to system design, testing, regulation, error reporting, safety education and cross-country collaboration will be needed to further promote safer HIT.	capability maturity model;certification;exception handling;hit (internet);information sciences;information system;interface device component;norm (social);objective-c;procurement;software deployment;system safety;systems design;thrombocytopenia;usability;user interface design;web resource;standards characteristics	André Kushniruk;David W.

Memory for these passwords was examined at short and long recall delays. There was a significant interaction between type of password and recall delay for both the amount of time and number of attempts needed for participants to accurately recall their passwords. Participants trained in how to use the mnemonic technique to generate their own passwords were able to recall them more quickly and accurately than participants who were trained in how to use the mnemonic technique to memorize their assigned passwords. The impact of self-generated passwords on memory was discussed as well as the relative value of the mnemonic training strategy. Areas of future research were identified that may lead to the development of mnemonic training strategies to better enable users to recall their passwords.	password;self-censorship	Deborah Nelson;Kim-Phuong L.

ef058dd849f09c8e8f48f23a7e0305a309753662	health is silver, beauty is golden? - how the usage context influences the acceptance of an invasive technology		The acceptance of novel technology is one if not the most decisive component of the success of the technology rollout. Though, acceptance criteria differ not only across the diversity of users, but might also differ across the different usage context. This is especially valid for technologies in the health and beauty context, in which the balance between pro-using arguments and contra-using arguments is especially fragile. This paper focuses on the impact of the context towards the motivation to use an invasive technology. A survey was conducted in which 170 participants of a wide age range (17-89 years) took part. In the study, three different usage scenarios were presented (medical scenario, preventative healthcare scenario and beauty scenario). After an introduction into each scenario the participants had to evaluate usage motives and barriers. The results corroborated the impact of the situational context and the dependency of acceptance outcomes on the reasons for which technology might be used. Overall, acceptance was highest for medical technology and lowest for the beauty context. Considering the single reasons for or against the technology, we find that nature and weighing of perceived barriers and concerns are quite similar, independently of the context.	barrier (computer science)	Johanna Kluge;Martina Ziefle	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39345-7_12		HCI	-62.160436485828114	-58.397331979452574	152831

We are seeing a growth not only in the availability of hardware and software solutions for health care but also in a much wider range of settings than before. Whereas previously information technology was predominantly based in the consulting room, clinicians now have access to mobile devices such as personal digital assistants, computers-on-wheels, and tablet PCs, and electronic whiteboard are becoming increasingly popular within the hospital environment. These technologies mean that clinicians can access electronic information, such as electronic patient records and clinical decision support systems on wards, by the patient’s bedside, and during ward rounds. Healthcare technologies are also making their way into patients’ homes, for example, as telecare and assistive technology packages, and providing remote physiological and activity monitoring and remote consultations. These technologies do not just influence the distribution of information but also allow for the creation of new processes for patient care. Such changes present interesting opportunities for interaction design but also present new challenges for evaluation. Evaluating new health care technologies in a complex context of use such as the hospital or home presents practical challenges, but evaluation strategies that fail to understand how the technology is used	assistive technology;clinical decision support system;computer hardware;interaction design;interactive whiteboard;mobile device;personal digital assistant;pervasive informatics;sensor;tablet computer;wheels	Rebecca Randell;Stephanie M.

The development process, including clinical and technical considerata is described in order to draw conclusions about the ways in which EPR's can be a vehicle for change from traditional practice to the multidisciplinary, community based practise developments of recent years. The system can generate information for continuous quality improvement, service planning, and philosophies of care. The key requirements of good record systems are established and the inability of paper records to meet them. In contrast the electronic record has demonstrated ability to guarantee personalised, quality, mental health care.	epr paradox;health care;information system;mental health services;patients;philosophy;psychiatric hospital;requirement	Monica Mooney;Siobhan Barry;Ronald Draper	1998	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-896-0-14	mental health;emergency medicine;family medicine;medicine	HCI	-58.243374506519096	-61.52545356445619	153688
e31b23c154cf1af65aa343b7465bb717a7f84bde	addressing the healthcare cost dilemma by managing health instead of managing illness - an opportunity for wearable wireless sensors		The cost of healthcare is increasing worldwide. Without disruptive changes, a large part of the population in many developed countries will no longer be able to afford healthcare by 2040. Part of the solution will come from focusing on prevention. Having personal tools at everyone's disposal, which will help people to monitor their health and to change their behavior, can enable disease prevention. Managing weight and managing stress are two societal challenges where a behavioral change can have huge cost savings. In this paper, it is shown how wearable sensor devices are able to detect energy expenditure as well as monitor stress levels. System aspects and validation are discussed. Because convenience and user acceptance are key for making these tools a success, smaller form factors and more convenient sensor locations on the body are required.	computer form factor;sensor;wearable computer	Chris Van Hoof;Julien Penders	2013	2013 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)			HCI	-60.06193695525902	-56.219866149332844	153796

However, as infrastructure and evaluation system are more diversified and complicated compared with single screening, the development of a novel health information system is paramount.   METHODS The main goal of our health information system was to support the multiple screening program not only from technical aspect but also from a broad range of perspectives including quality assurance system, organized features appertaining to screening, economic evaluation (cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis), epidemiological applications, behavior risk factor surveillance system, and social impact due to the introduction of the Keelung Community-Based Integrated Screening (KCIS) program.   RESULTS Health information system was designed and programmed on the basis of the demand derived from KCIS within which five cancers and three chronic diseases were included. In addition to the detailed description of infrastructure and process, design, relevant database and security involved in health information system, an innovative and extensive evaluation system in accordance with the main goals was included in our health information system.   CONCLUSION Our information system proposed several aspects regarding organized screening system that has never been addressed in computerized system supporting for single screening. These included quality assurance system, organization features, co-morbidity profiles, epidemiological applications and social and economic considerations.

Current research shows that strategies to promote early recognition and treatment of symptoms and enhance self-care management behaviors reduce unnecessary hospitalizations. However, mechanisms to monitor patients' health status and behaviors are limited by constraints imposed by the patient's geography, infirmity, or resources. Remote monitoring supports a more dynamic connection between healthcare providers and patients, improves health promotion and patient care through monitoring of health data, communicates health reminders, and makes provisions for patient feedback. This paper will describe two versions of Weight and Activity with Blood Pressure Monitoring System (WANDA [22]) that leverages sensor technology and wireless communication to monitor health status of patients with CHF. The WANDA system is built on a three-tier architecture consisting of sensors, a web server, and back-end database tiers. The system was developed in conjunction with the UCLA School of Nursing and the UCLA Wireless Health Institute to enable early detection of key clinical symptoms indicative of CHF-related decompensation in a real-time automated fashion and allows health professionals to offer surveillance, advice, and continuity of care and triggers early implementation of strategies to enhance adherence behaviors. The small study has enabled patients to reduce or maintain the number of readings which are out of the acceptable range. For diastolic, systolic, and heart rate values, the t-test results show that the WANDA study is effective for patients with CHF.	cryptographic hash function;multitier architecture;real-time transcription;scott continuity;sensor;server (computing);web server	Myung-kyung Suh;Lorraine S.

The VR was developed for constructing a novel online hospital system using a virtual environment called Hyper Hospital, a medical care system constructed in a distributed manner using VR as a human interface to the electronic information network. Ten healthy young male subjects were exposed to the VR system with different intensities of physiological and psychological stimuli. As a psychological stimuli, they underwent an interview with a virtual (electronic) nurse. The interview session was divided into two parts, namely one of low stress and one of high stress. Following each interview session, subjects were exposed to a moving scene (similar to a roller coaster ride) of varying intensities. The responses were compared with those obtained in the control experiments in which an environmental video (just a seaside scene) was presented. None of the physiological or psychological parameters (such as urinary catecholamine release, heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) indicated that significant fatigue occurred. This implies that fatigue was not induced by the usage of our VR system when compared with the results of the control experiments.	autonomic computing;experiment;graphical user interface;head-mounted display;human factors and ergonomics;planet coaster;seaside;user interface;virtual reality	Takami Yamaguchi	1999	Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments	10.1162/105474699566080	simulation;computer science;virtual machine;blood pressure;operating system;virtual reality;multimedia;human interface device	Visualization	-54.142239047156444	-54.79966728218077	154838

Clinical information systems have been comprehensively adopted to assess the quality of care and outcomes, to improve the performance of health care providers, and to support health care information management. Our billing operation has experienced the need of an extended processing time to cope with the charge capture tasks related to physician reimbursement. We developed a semi-automated charge capture system assisted with information technology to improve the billing interface and promote physician productivity. This pilot system was adopted to test our hypothesis that information technology could improve the billing workflow. Physicians found that electronic juxtaposition of the pilot system with the electronic medical record (EMR) helpful in patient data verification from the progress note. The pilot system was successfully designed to assist physicians to improve productivity. Clearer changes in physician behavior and organizational management are needed to reduce administrative cost and prevent further errors. Although overall technical improvement may provide access to desired information, major barriers on data entry still hamper the efficient implementation and adoption of clinical information systems.	accessibility;documentation;electronic billing;excalibur: morgana's revenge;information management;information system;memory barrier;requirement;semiconductor industry	Chiang S.

In the real world, smell plays a leading role in helping us appreciate an environment, for example the smell of fresh coffee, or the dead body. High-fidelity virtual environments are being increasingly used as an accurate representation of the real world for a wide variety of applications, including training, phobia treatment and virtual archeology. This paper compares the diffusion and perception of smell in real and virtual environments. Although airflow can be computed within a virtual environment using, for example a computational fluid dynamic simulator, the results do not necessarily predict how smell may be perceived in the real-world. Virtual smell needs to take into account the type of smell being considered and how humans may perceive this smell.	computational fluid dynamics;humans;virtual reality	Belma Ramic-Brkic;Alan Chalmers	2010		10.1145/1811158.1811166	simulation;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;perception	Visualization	-54.70379335248115	-52.798770884925794	155048

Through a qualitative research study, we identify three prominent peripheral activities that affect the continuity of care: (1) transition between multiple artifacts, (2) movement between multiple locations and (3) transition of information between multiple care providers. We discuss how the peripheral activities can introduce new errors and create bottlenecks in patient flow, consequently affecting both clinical and organizational goals. We highlight the importance of integrating EMR applications with the model of practice in the ED.	accident and emergency department;electronic health records;electronics, medical;erectile dysfunction;excalibur: morgana's revenge;medical records;morphologic artifacts;patients;peripheral;scott continuity	Joanna Abraham;Thomas George Kannampallil;Madhu C.

Blood pressure (BP) management is one of the easiest ways suggested for preventing and controlling cardiovascular diseases before the patient develops complications and death-following outcomes. Appearance of technology advancements in the health system has motivated researchers and health providers to study its different aspects and applications in order to improve disease prevention and management. Following these efforts, mobile health (mHealth) technologies were presented to provide people with fast and easier-to-use services. Although there are some unsolved challenges, these technologies have become popular among many people. As an important part of mHealth, mobile applications (apps) have been the focused subject of many studies in the last decade. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the potential effects of mobile apps designed for BP management by scrutinizing the related studies.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases in December 2016: Medline (PubMed), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Education Resources Information Center(ERIC), Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. No language restriction and start point limitation were imposed.   SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies that evaluated and assessed mobile apps for BP management and related clinical trials that considered mobile app as the only difference between intervention and control groups.   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors applied the eligibility criteria, extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies.   RESULTS Literature search resulted in 13 included studies and 27 reviews. 12 records of 13 included studies identified as interventional studies. The review showed that the mobile apps may improve individual's BP condition and medication adherence.   CONCLUSION Most of the studies had emphasized positive effects of mobile apps in BP management. However, there is a necessity for performing further investigations due to the identified issues in this study such as low number of participants and limited intervention period in randomized controlled trials, and interventions limited to only hypertensive or high-risked individual.

We used a cross-sectional design wherein patients' at an urban, primary-care clinic ranked various reminder systems and indicated their usage of technology and familiarity with other service providers contacting them over text messages and e-mails. We assessed the impact of patient usage of text messages and e-mails and patient familiarity with other service providers contacting them over text messages and e-mails on effectiveness of and responsiveness to appointment reminder systems. We found that patient usage of text messages or e-mails and familiarity with other service providers contacting them are the best predictors of perceived effectiveness and responsiveness to text message and e-mail reminders. When these variables are accounted for, age and other demographic variables do not predict responsiveness to reminder systems.	1,3-dihydroxyeudesman-6,12-olide;cross-sectional data;demography;email;immunization;mail;medicine, east asian traditional;patients;personalization;reminder systems;responsiveness;telephone line;message	Stacey R.

However, little information exists on the implementation process for AIMS within ambulatory surgery centers (ASC). The objectives of this descriptive study are to document: 1) the phases of implementation of an AIMS at an ASC; and 2) lessons learnt from a socio-technical perspective. The ASC, within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), has hosted an AIMS since 2008. As a quality improvement effort, we implemented a new version of the AIMS. This new version involved fundamental software changes to enhance clinical care such as real-time importing of laboratory data and total hardware exchange. The pre-implementation phase involved coordinated preparation over six months between multiple informatics teams along with local leadership. During this time, we conducted component, integration, and validation testing to ensure correct data flow from medical devices to AIMS and centralized databases. The implementation phase occurred in September 2014 over three days and was successful. Over the next several months, during post-implementation phase, we addressed residual items like latency of the application. Important lessons learnt from the implementation included the utility of partnering early with executive leadership; ensuring end user acceptance of new clinical workflow; continuous testing of data flow; use of a staged rollout; and providing additional personnel throughout implementation. Implementation of an AIMS at an ASC can utilize methods developed for large hospitals. However, issues unique to an ASC such as limited number of support personnel and distinctive workflows must be considered.	ambulatory surgical procedures;cns disorder;centralized computing;continuous testing;dataflow;description;electrocardiography, ambulatory;implementation;informatics (discipline);information management system (ims);management information systems;medical devices;published database;real-time computing;real-time transcription;sociotechnical system;ti advanced scientific computer;ambulatory surgery center;teams	Seshadri C.

The promising outcomes of BCSSs make them especially useful in certain areas such as healthcare, where these systems could be leveraged to motivate people toward healthy behavior and then help them to achieve their goals better. However, health BCSSs cannot help facilitate self-monitoring and self-management or even improve patients’ health outcomes when patients do not accept the technology first. In this article, we extend the existing literature of users’ acceptance of health BCSSs by introducing new variables that impact users acceptance, especially with the proliferation of wearable devices. Specifically, we intent to examine the impact of integration, technical and social support as well as the informative presentation support on users’ acceptance of mobile diabetes applications as instance of health BCSSs.	information system;self-management (computer science);social support;sociotechnical system;wearable technology	Mohammad Al-Ramahi;Insu Park;Jun Liu	2016			knowledge management;environmental resource management;social psychology	HCI	-60.80512536286923	-57.10371715710571	155849

New paradigms as mobile computing can support a big amount of healthcare needs. The aim of this research work is to present the application of good practices in the design of healthcare information technology following a methodological approach for apps in mobile environments involving fictitious users based on knowledge of real users in the app design. Real users’ needs have been extracted from empirical researches, guidelines and standards, favoring an outstanding role to users. In order to illustrate the approach and provide a resource to designers, a case study showing how to obtain an accessible design is introduced. The mobile app considered supports a Personal Health Record and self testing for anticoagulated patients who are often elderly. The access characteristics of the elderly and their possible disabilities are essential aspects to keep in mind in the design of a mobile user interface. To address users’ needs on the healthcare mobile applications it has been concluded that the requirement elicitation must take into account functional requirements concerning aspects that characterize a disease, and accessibility requirements related to special needs of patients suffering a disease.	accessibility;functional requirement;mobile app;mobile computing;user interface	Adrián Casado-Rivas;Lourdes Moreno;Paloma Martínez;Javier García Guzmán	2014		10.5220/0004805703510357	knowledge management;medical record;medicine	HCI	-59.95177333643738	-57.884656481537746	155862

Although the subject has been widely researched and published in dental literature, the topic of best way to restore endodontically treated teeth still remains an area prone to anecdotal decision-making. Inappropriate management of such teeth can cause adverse clinical consequences and significant inconvenience to the patient as well as financial implications both for the patient and provider. To address this problem, we have developed a clinical decision support and training system based on expert knowledge and evidence-based guidelines that provides case-specific recommendations, alerts and treatment prognosis. This method presentation article provides design and implementation details of the system that can be leveraged by students and less-experienced clinicians at point-of-care to enhance decision-making and improve treatment outcomes for endodontically treated teeth.	circuit restoration;clinical decision support system;experience	Anjali Shah;Louis DiPede;Shankar Srinivasan;Dinesh P.

We take a socio-technical approach to understanding quality during telemedicine encounters. This approach has not been well studied in telemedicine service encounter research. To enrich understanding, we use a multimethod (direct observation, interview, focus group, survey) field study to collect and interpret a rich set of data. We conduct this study from two perspectives. First, we focus on the perceptions of the medical providers (e.g. physicians) who directly use the technology and are accountable for patient care. We then compare provider perspectives to those of patients, who act as indirect users of telemedicine technology and are the ultimate consumers of health care services provided via telemedicine. The result of this field study is a comparative framework of quality attributes for telemedicine service encounters that prioritizes the attributes from the provider and patient perspectives.	field research;focus group;interaction;list of system quality attributes;multiple dispatch;requirement prioritization;sociotechnical system	Cynthia LeRouge;Alan R.

Using the concept of capability, the system facilitates the maintenance of an IHT and assignment of workflow tasks to the most appropriate team members. Moreover, following the principles of participatory medicine, MET4 facilitates involving the patient and her preferences in the management process. We describe conceptual foundations of the system and present the system design combining multi-agent and ontology-driven paradigms. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of MET4 and illustrate operations of the prototype using an example involving chronic pain management in palliative care.	multi-agent system;ontology (information science);prototype;systems design	Szymon Wilk;Davood Astaraky;Wojtek Michalowski;Daniel Amyot;Runzhuo Li;Craig E.

In doing so, they save costs (time and effort) and maximize their own benefit. However, if everyone behaved in this way, there would be no information sharing at all. In this experiment, we tested if the presentation of a random number could serve as a cognitive anchor and influence the amount of shared information. The experimental setting had all the features of an information-exchange dilemma. Before participants could share information, a random generator presented a random number. It was found that this number served as a cognitive anchor and influenced both the participants' behavioral intentions and their actual behavior. Particularly, the high anchor increased cooperation, even though enhanced cooperation was obviously detrimental to the individual's own benefit.

Until now, any disease or injury during a trip was regarded as an emergency and the patient is usually sent back to the closest hospital having an emergency room. With the ordinary emergency healthcare service, the traveler may suffer from high cost due to unnecessary additional emergency treatment or improper treatment because of insufficient personal health information. However, a traveler may receive a more convenient (and efficient) healthcare service if pertinent context information for the traveler is provided, for example location of the patient, sex, age or important medical history.

Research approach -- A prototype of an Intra-operative Visualization System (IVS) was developed, Based on the understanding of surgical workflow (problem solving process). IVS aimed to provide decision support to perform a minimally invasive procedure called Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA), to treat cancerous tumors in liver. Theory of situation awareness which is regarded as the theoretical backbone for improving information visualization in system design was incorporated to design the IVS. An experimental study was conducted with 8 expert intervention radiologist and 8 final year medical students. The study compared the performance of both the groups by using two systems: IVS and the conventional Ultrasound (US) guided intervention to perform RFA.  Findings/Design -- The results reveal significant evidence for improved decision-making when using the IVS by both the clinical experts and students. In terms of three performance measures both the groups: (1) needed less intra-operative planning time; (2) illustrated increase in accuracy of hitting the tumor in the centre and (3) fewer errors in hitting the wrong tumor.  Take away message -- Medical visualisation in decision support systems that focuses on enhancing situation awareness and supports surgical workflow can improve surgical decision making and hence the task performance.	decision support system;experiment;information visualization;internet backbone;medical imaging;problem solving;prototype;radio frequency;radiology;status message (instant messaging);systems design	Ashis Jalote-Parmar;Petra Badke-Schaub	2010		10.1145/1962300.1962341	situation awareness;simulation;visual system;decision support system;computer science;engineering;ultrasound;multimedia;biological engineering;systems design	HCI	-52.06469884704308	-59.8920099219366	157125

Rather than simply introducing new technologies to address these problems, we propose low-cost hacking of existing equipment available at these centers. This approach is philosophically consistent with the creative, pragmatic approach OTs take in their work, and is likely to lead to better acceptance without sacrificing the quality of the exercises. To illustrate our approach, we modify two existing training devices with simple digital interaction in order to nudge patients to improve movement quality, and to collect data to track progress. We present our preliminary results when employing these modified devices at a community center.	nudge (instant messaging)	Thi Ngoc Tram Nguyen;Shienny Karwita;Liangkun Yan;Yongjie Sim	2018		10.1145/3197391.3205421	hacker;occupational therapy;human–computer interaction;engineering;rehabilitation;emerging technologies	HCI	-57.27036803236696	-54.637378604102274	157362

However, with current adoption rates being reportedly low, the potential of IATs might remain under-expressed as long as the reasons for suboptimal adoption remain unaddressed. Among these, ethical and social considerations are critical. This article reviews the spectrum of IATs for dementia and investigates the prevalence of ethical considerations in the design of current IATs. Our screening shows that a significant portion of current IATs is designed in the absence of explicit ethical considerations. These results suggest that the lack of ethical consideration might be a codeterminant of current structural limitations in the translation of IATs from designing labs to bedside. Based on these data, we call for a coordinated effort to proactively incorporate ethical considerations early in the design and development of new products.

Thirteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Use was influenced by infrastructural challenges, user experience, system performance problems and lack of perceived usefulness. The majority of impact studies focus on effectiveness outcomes with studies providing promising evidence for the contribution of e-health to quality of care. However, more limited attention has been placed on the impacts of e-health on equity, access and efficiency.

With careful clinical, pathologic and outcomes annotation, samples can be better matched to the research question at hand and experimental results better understood and verified. However, the difficulty and expense of detailed specimen annotation is well beyond the capability of most banks and has made access to well documented tissue a major limitation in medical re-search. In this context, we have implemented automated annotation of banked tissue by integrating data from three clinical systems--the cancer registry, the pathology LIS and the tissue bank inventory system--through a classical data warehouse environment. The project required modification of clinical systems, development of methods to identify patients between and map data elements across systems and the creation of de-identified data in data marts for use by researchers. The result has been much more extensive and accurate initial tissue annotation with less effort in the tissue bank, as well as dynamic ongoing annotation as the cancer registry follows patients over time.	annotation;bank (environment);biological specimen;british informatics olympiad;cdisc send biospecimens terminology;cancer registry;document completion status - documented;neoplasms;patients;registries;tissue bank	John R.

20b5ceb4293f6f1e02d2530f0e292fb2439afa17	impact of information technology-based interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus on glycaemic control: a systematic review and meta-analysis.		Information technologies (IT) are increasingly being used to manage health care. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding whether or not IT improves diabetes outcomes. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review and metaanalysis of clinical trials, assessing the impact of IT on changes in levels of haemoglobin (HbA1c) and mapping the interventions with Chronic Care Model (CCM) elements. Electronic databases Medline and EMBASE were searched to identify relevant studies that were published up until December 2013, a method that was supplemented by identifying articles from the references of the articles already selected using the electronic search tools. The study search and selection were performed by independent reviewers. Of the 1,006 articles retrieved, 29 trials (focussing on a total of 40,536 patients) were included 1-29 A random effects model was applied to estimate the pooled results. IT-based interventions were associated with a statistically significant decline in HbA1c levels (mean difference -0.28% 95% CI 0.22, 0.34; P < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed that studies focussing on computer-based self-management demonstrated the largest reduction in HbA1c (0.48%) , followed by those with EMR (0.19%), an electronic decision support system (0.15%) , and diabetes registry (0.06%) . In addition, the more CCM incorporated IT interventions the more improvements there were in HbA1c levels. IT strategies combined with care were with the cause of improved glycaemic control in diabetes patients. No clinically relevant impact was observed on LDL and blood pressure, but there was evidence that the cost of care was lowered. However, these outcomes should be further explored in future trials.	database;decision support system;embase;excalibur: morgana's revenge;medline;nsa product types;random effects model;self-management (computer science);systematic review	Nouf Sahal Alharbi;Nada Alsubki;Simon de Lusignan	2015		10.3233/978-1-61499-512-8-944	diabetes mellitus	HCI	-60.9109492111051	-64.55757996528536	158209

Between 20% and 46% of prescriptions requiring dosage adjustments based on renal function are inappropriate. This study aimed to determine whether implementing alerts at the time of ordering medication integrated into the computerized physician order entry decreases the proportion of inappropriate prescriptions based on the renal function of inpatients.   DESIGN Six alternating 2-month control and intervention periods were conducted between August 2006 and August 2007 in two medical departments of a teaching hospital in France. A total of 603 patients and 38 physicians were included. During the intervention periods, alerts were triggered if a patient with renal impairment was prescribed one of the 24 targeted drugs that required adjustment according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).   MEASUREMENTS The main outcome measure was the proportion of inappropriate first prescriptions, according to recommendation.   RESULTS A total of 1,122 alerts were triggered. The rate of inappropriate first prescriptions did not differ significantly between intervention and control periods (19.9% vs. 21.3%; p=0.63). The effect of intervention differed significantly between residents and senior physicians (p=0.03). Residents tended to make fewer errors in intervention versus control periods (Odds ratio 0.69; 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 1.15), whereas senior physicians tended to make more inappropriate prescriptions in intervention periods (odds ratio 1.88; 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 3.89).   CONCLUSION Alert activation was not followed by a significant decrease in inappropriate prescriptions in our study. Thus, it is still necessary to evaluate the impact of these systems if newly implemented in other settings thanks to studies also designed to watch for possible unanticipated effects of decision supports and their underlying causes.	academic medical centers;alert brand of caffeine;confidence intervals;convergence insufficiency;egfr protein, human;estimated glomerular filtration rate;hyperprolactinemia;inappropriate adh syndrome;kidney diseases;order management system;outcome measures;patients;renal insufficiency;treatment - filtration;inpatient	Elodie Sellier;Isabelle Colombet;Brigitte Sabatier;Gaelle Breton;Julie Niès;Eric Zapletal;Jean-Benoit Arlet;Dominique Somme;Pierre Durieux	2009	Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA	10.1197/jamia.M2805	intensive care medicine;medicine;decision support system;renal function;pediatrics;medical emergency	HCI	-59.89696968685352	-65.86717527755629	158247

Hospital-based applications of telemedicine present a potentially important solution, particularly for small and rural hospitals where access to local specialists is rarely available.   PURPOSE We conducted a systematic review of telemedicine applications for hospital-based emergency care, which aims to synthesize the existing evidence on the impact of tele-emergency applications that could inform future efforts and research in this area.   BASIC PROCEDURES A search of four databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane) using a combination of telemedicine and emergency room (ER) keywords for publications yielded 340 citations. Four coders independently determined eligibility based on initial criteria and then extracted information on the 38 resulting articles based on four main categories: study setting, type of technology, research methods, and results.   MAIN FINDINGS Of the 38 articles, 11 studies focused on telemedicine for diffuse patient populations that typically present in ERs, 8 studies considered telemedicine in the context of minor treatment clinics for patients presenting with minor injuries or illnesses, and 19 studies focused on the use of telemedicine to connect providers in ERs to medical specialists for consultations on patients with specific conditions. Overwhelmingly, tele-emergency studies reported positive findings especially in terms of technical quality and user satisfaction. There were also positive findings reported for clinical processes and outcomes, throughput, and disposition, but the rigor of studies using these measures was limited. Studies of economic outcomes are particularly sparse.   PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS Despite limitations in their research methodology, the studies on tele-emergency indicate an application with promise to meet the needs of small and rural hospitals to address infrequent but emergency situations requiring specialist care. Similarly, studies indicate that tele-emergency has considerable potential to expand use of minor treatment clinics to address access issues in remote areas and overcrowding of urban ERs.	accident and emergency department;basic;cinahl;categories;clinic;cochrane library;computer user satisfaction;consultation;database;eligibility determination;embase;extraction;hospitals, rural;illness (finding);patients;population;pubmed;rigor - temperature-associated observation;sparse matrix;systematic review;tcap gene;telemedicine;telephone number;television;throughput;citation	Marcia M.

This paper looks at a telehealth implementation of outpatient consultations for tertiary-level paediatric surgical patients, consultations which exercise a high degree of interpersonal and data-sharing communication between the participants. Framing the telehealth situation as a media space invites the designer of the telehealth system to access a large body of prior work which identifies and discusses many of the issues that will arise in this complex multi-participant telehealth context. This paper presents, as a case study, a two-year project that developed and deployed a whole-of-room telehealth system in partnership with surgeons from The Royal Children’s Hospital (RCH), Melbourne, Australia. Based on observations at the hospital and discussions with the surgeons, a descriptive model of the proposed telehealth consultation (and of its deployment in a clinical trial) was developed. This descriptive model became the vehicle for gathering requirements and for design and evaluation of the telehealth system. The evaluation contained four major components: two human factors studies, an observational study of training and process change for the clinicians and a clinical trial of the resulting system. The case study demonstrates the flow of design decisions from concept to deployment. It highlights the gaps that appeared in the descriptive model when the transition was made from the laboratory to deployment in the hospital. The conclusion is that, at this relatively unexplored level of telehealth, there are likely to be gaps in such a descriptive model that are not uncovered by laboratory experiments or by analytic evaluation but emerge only during a clinical trial with actual patients, clinicians and patient data.	computer science;experiment;file spanning;framing (social sciences);high-level programming language;human factors and ergonomics;interaction;jane (software);media space;requirement;software deployment;the australian;tom proulx	Duncan Roderick Stevenson	2010	Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)	10.1007/s10606-010-9125-8	design;simulation;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;clinical trial;observational study	HCI	-60.141961376582906	-61.08236535158319	158316

We developed virtual game environments which were host to a progressive set of training tasks from precise fine motor movements to reaching movements that involve full arm and shoulder activity. Concurrently, the therapist monitored the progress of the patient through a video channel. Assessment of psychosocial variables show that negative feelings (confusion, t(13)=2.54, p<.05, depression t(13)=2.58, p<.05, and tension, t(13)=2, p<.1) were significantly lessened after the game play. Patients' overall satisfaction with the telerehabilitation system was positively correlated with the feeling of co-presence of the therapist, r(8)=.770, p<.005. Patients felt less efficacious in continuing therapy after participating in the telerehabilitation game compared to their reported perseverance self-efficacy before the game, t(5)=2.71, p<.05 and showed decreased willingness to persist in therapy regardless of fatigue after the game play, t(5)=2.67, p<.05. However, when patients' pretest mood scores were taken into account, this trend was reversed. Patients' active mood before the game was positively correlated with their willingness to persist in the therapy after the game, r(14)=.699, p<.005. Telerehabilitation significantly enhanced stroke patients' psychological states.

This way, during a diagnosis decision a user can be supported by a remote knowledge database constructed by other users, like, for instance, a reference specialist discussion board. Usually, medical applications scenarios like this use different terminology systems leading to terminological interoperability problems. Still, clinical applications frequently make use of different clinical ontology systems that do not provide semantic types necessary to create a structure to carry shared knowledge database. The lack of this semantic types brings ontology interoperability problems which difficult the support of collaborative clinical decision-making. This paper presents a UMLS interoperable solution to promote clinical applications development intended to contribute with collaborative diagnosis decision, in a distributed computer environment based on service-oriented architecture. This paper still presents a case study to demonstrate DDSOnt usability through the development of a system prototype integrated to a collaborative and multimedia communication distance-learning environment.	clinical decision support system;computer;interoperability;prototype;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;usability	D.

This paper aims to examine the predictors of informal payments in Turkey. The study surveyed a random sample of 3,727 people in a medium-sized city, of whom 706 received medical care for illness and/or non-illness related reasons, using a Turkey-specific version of a model questionnaire focused exclusively on informal out-of-pocket payments. Using multivariable logistic model, household health expenditure, health insurance, service type and provider ownership were found to be statistically significant predictors of informal payment. The findings suggest the supply side factors as the main drivers of informal payments and thus a need for radical changes in the supply side as well as actions to rebuild lost confidence in the health care system of Turkey.	contribution;expenditures, out-of-pocket;health care;health expenditures;information;light;merck index;private practice;random sampling;relevance;funding grant;non-t, non-b adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia;payment	Hacer Özgen;Bayram Sahin;Paolo Belli;Mehtap Tatar;Peter Berman	2008	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-008-9251-8	health policy;sampling;actuarial science;nursing;statistical significance;logistic regression;statistics	HCI	-61.57994280489889	-65.7163476386071	158514
98e5c1b63f097510dd97e48f6dca60419beb4dcc	user centered design of an augmented reality gaming platform for active aging in elderly institutions		In this article, we describe the design and development of a gaming platform with augmented reality components whose purpose is to fight sedentary lifestyle by promoting active aging in elderly institutions. The augmented reality components project games on the floor where the users can interact by moving sideways or sitting and playing with the arms. In this work, we target the design of a complete platform that can be easily transported, configured and deployed in elderly institutions to promote exercise. The concepts were developed using a user-centered methodology. End-users were motivated to participate in a study where social, economic and pathological conditions were analysed. The acceptance of the concept, the expectations generated, and the concerns raised, were assessed through questionnaires formulated both to the elderly users and to the professionals of the care institutions. Our results show that the elderly can be stimulated to practice physical exercise with the addition of fun and social interaction.	augmented reality;coat of arms;user-centered design	Hugo Simão;Alexandre Bernardino	2017		10.5220/0006606601510162	human–computer interaction;multimedia;augmented reality;engineering;user-centered design	HCI	-60.12460528404443	-54.01900222226017	158679
4d77f48eb0968369e1c18909fba08c47f891a641	towards the development of a national ehealth interoperability framework to address public health challenges in greece		Modern health systems depend on interaction between several cooperating actors. These include amongst others patients, caretakers, general practitioners, health specialists, pharmacies, laboratories, hospitals, clinics, insurance organizations, and research centers, from both public and private sectors. Interoperability of information and communication technology (ICT) systems is central for reliable and efficient collaboration between the involved actors. The purpose of the paper is to present the vision for the development of a national domain interoperability framework (DIF) for eHealth in Greece, within the context of the new European interoperability framework (EIF). The framework must be able to support current and future challenges, as the classical healthcare system is shifting towards early detection and home care monitoring to support personalized care. The objective is for public health in the country to benefit from its application, by setting the ground for making available comparable, clinically significant electronic health record (EHR) data (for both primary and secondary use), and by defining technical specifications for well-defined use cases, in a legitimate and standardized manner. Some relevant research limitations relate to consent management and semantic issues. Practical implications relate to European and country level compatibility, sustainability, as well as the readiness to address the continuously evolving interoperability. It becomes evident that in order to provide services for better citizen care and control over costs, the country has to make certain steps towards applying a national interoperability framework to accelerate transformation for a more sustainable health system.	data interchange format;european interoperability framework;personalization	Dimitrios G.

e1ac4b6f49a9e887f0c688e6427a836ebed98867	a usability study of cpoe's medication administration functions: impact on physiciannurse cooperation		Implementation of CPOE systems in Healthcare Institutions has proven efficient in reducing medication errors but it also induces hidden side-effects on Doctor-Nurse cooperation. We propose a usability engineering approach to this problem. An extensive activity analysis of the medication ordering and administration process was performed in several departments of 3 different hospitals. Two of these hospitals are still using paper-based orders, while the 3rd one is in the roll-out phase of medication functions of its CPOE system. We performed a usability assessment of this CPOE system. The usability assessment uncovered usability problems for the entry of medication administration time scheduling by the physician and revealed that the information can be ambiguous for the nurse. The comparison of cooperation models in both situation shows that users tend to adopt a distributed decision making paradigm in the paper-based situation, while the CPOE system supports a centralized decision making process. This analysis can support recommendation for the re-engineering of the Human-Computer Interface.	application program interface;centralized computing;computerized physician order entry system;decision making;human–computer interaction;programming paradigm;scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;usability engineering;usability testing	Marie-Catherine Beuscart-Zéphir;Sylvia Pelayo;Patrice Degoulet;Françoise Anceaux;Sandra Guerlinger;Jean-Jacques Meaux	2004	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-949-3-1018		HCI	-60.402669070186825	-63.331754059709	158806

Whereas robots have been used extensively in the form of robotic orthoses to rehabilitate early trauma patients, there is more that can be done to develop robots that help children, the elderly and late-stage rehabilitation patients to excel at physical skills. In order to do this, we must develop robots that do not actuate on the students, but coach them through hands-off modalities such as verbal advice and demonstrations. This approach requires sophisticated perception, and modeling of the student's movement in order to deliver effective advice. Preliminary results suggest that these goals can be achieved with consumer-grade sensing hardware. We present planned future work towards achieving this vision.	robot	Alexandru Litoiu;Brian Scassellati	2015		10.1145/2701973.2702726	simulation;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-56.341563869582146	-55.1411231693429	158815

We implemented the RFID framework as the electronic patient identifier into the process improvement of ED workflow; it defined as the safety portal to introduce PSI safety features on the real-time basis.   METHODS Since 2004, we were applying RFID technology into a 200 daily visits emergency department of the regional medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. We then developed wireless web-based RFID safety portal to implement the real-time safety reminders such as the laboratory and radiology reports to the physician who can make decision promptly to the patients in the ED.   RESULTS Under the ED safety portal, the diagnosis time for physicians to make clinical decision is largely reduced nearly 40 percent due to the safety enhancement RFID system. ED physician who could actively receive patient's updated clinical data to make clinical decision via web-based informatics system reasonably decreases.   CONCLUSIONS The effectiveness of RFID system not only enhance patient identification during ED process but combine ED safety net which providing needed data for ED physician and staff who visit ED patients with valuable real-time data on time. Patient safety on ED can be clearly improved from the embracing modern technology and build up a patient centered ED environment.	accident and emergency department;bridging (networking);clinical data;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;erectile dysfunction;identifier;informatics (discipline);patients;radio frequency identification device;radio-frequency identification;radiology;real-time clock;real-time data;real-time web;web application	Chang-I Chen;Cheuk-Sing Choy;Tu-Bin Chu;Yu-Sheng Lo;Wei-Kee Huang;Ching-Feng Kuan;Yu-Chuan Li	2006	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-58603-647-8-77	medicine;emergency medicine;medical emergency;computer security	Mobile	-58.65411784947142	-66.05657427553744	159350

This paper introduces the Malaysian Telemedicine vision, its functionality and associated operational conditions. In particular, we focus on the conceptualisation of one key Telemedicine component i.e. the Lifetime Health Plan (LHP) system--a distributed multimodule application for the periodic monitoring and generation of health-care advisories for all Malaysians. In line with the LHP project, we present an innovative healthcare delivery info-structure--LifePlan--that aims to provide life-long, pro-active, personalised, wellness-oriented healthcare services to assist individuals to manage and interpret their health needs. Functionally, LifePlan based healthcare services are delivered over the WWW, packaged as Personalised Lifetime Health Plans that allow individuals to both monitor their health status and to guide them in healthcare planning.	advocate (person);delivery of health care;loop heat pipe;occupational health services;programming paradigm;telemedicine;www;women's health services	Syed Sibte Raza Abidi;Yusoff Zaharin	1999	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-912-7-283		ML	-56.60218654129233	-60.353216431630784	159459

User-created passphrases are easier to remember, but tend to be less secure than ones created from words randomly chosen in a dictionary. This paper develops a way of making more memorable, more secure passphrases. It investigates the security and usability of creating a passphrase by choosing from a randomly generated set of words presented as a two-dimensional array. A usability experiment shows that participants using this method achieved 97% to 99% of the maximal theoretical entropy and commited fewer than half as many memory mistakes as a control group with assigned passphrases. It also shows that their choices are affected by word familiarity and weakly by the word's position in the array. Prompting a person with random words from a large dictionary is an effective way of helping them make a more memorable high-entropy passphrase.		Nikola K.

These templates contain great value, as they carve a path based on best practice for the radiologist to follow, and thus should be shared, reviewed, and improved. Unfortunately, these templates are often not shareable today due to a lack of standards for describing and transporting templates. This paper outlines and discusses an appropriate and effective electronic method for transporting radiology report templates using of the style of representational state transfer (REST). Enabling a structured radiology report template library with REST enables just-in-time accessibility of templates, achieving efficiencies and effectiveness.	accessibility;best practice;clinical use template;efficiency;embedding;generic programming;just-in-time-concept;outlines (document);radiology;representation (action);representational state transfer;standards characteristics	Brad W.

We found that context does not make a difference but surprisingly, people completed interrupted tasks in less time with no difference in quality. Our data suggests that people compensate for interruptions by working faster, but this comes at a price: experiencing more stress, higher frustration, time pressure and effort. Individual differences exist in the management of interruptions: personality measures of openness to experience and need for personal structure predict disruption costs of interruptions. We discuss implications for how system design can support interrupted work.	denial-of-service attack;interrupt;openness;systems design	Gloria Mark;Daniela Gudith;Ulrich Klocke	2008		10.1145/1357054.1357072	experiment;simulation;human multitasking;empirical research;systems design	HCI	-52.179223157320344	-52.35312101005321	159925

Given long hours watching TV in the elder population, most of the existing TV services are not geared for them. The elderly cannot tolerate complexity and negativity due to decline in cognitive abilities. In addition, the program is not adapted to the user’s current emotional status. As a result, existing TV services can not achieve optimal performance across a broad set of user types and context. To provide content tailored to individual needs, and interests of the elderly, caregivers have to select an appropriate program manually. However, this can not scale well due to shortage of caregivers and high monetary cost. We present the personalized emotion-aware video streaming system, a redesign of conventional TV system to provide appropriate program flexibly, efficiently and responsively. Our proposed architecture adds video affective profiling, real-time emotion detection and Markov decision process based video program generation to the streaming service to this end. We present a complete implementation of our design.

23cc40da3d27fc6b8f7c7be26e4e4768a4731afc	exploring the role of self-efficacy in biofeedback video games		Biofeedback training and game-based biofeedback are increasingly used to improve mental health. When evaluating the effects of biofeedback however, the focus often lies solely on therapeutic outcomes. Meanwhile, it is known that psychological factors such as perceptions of competence, also known as self-efficacy, can significantly influence one's experience and psychological wellbeing. The current paper examined the role of self-efficacy in the context of biofeedback video games. A pilot study was conducted with DEEP, a Virtual Reality video game that uses respiratory-based biofeedback to help individuals cope with stress and anxiety. Self-efficacy was found to be a significant predictor of physiological regulation, highlighting the importance of taking psychological factors such as self-efficacy into account in the development and evaluation of biofeedback games designed to improve mental wellbeing.	kerrison predictor;virtual reality	Joanneke Weerdmeester;Marieke van Rooij;Owen Harris;Niki Smit;Rutger C.

The need exists to develop a standardized electronic (e)-portfolio to provide the aggregate data to improve education and patient care. This process requires a sound methodology using XML metadata to allow portability of e-portfolio data. We surveyed publicly available metadata and developed an e-portfolio system for the Henry Ford Hospital General Surgery Residency Program. Based on our implementation of e-portfolios for 70 physicians, we call upon the ACGME, the Residency Review Committees, and the American Board of Medical Specialties to establish a method to formalize and develop a standard for residency competency metadata. Using an approach similar to that of our study can streamline data and lead to improved medical education and ultimately better patient care.	adobe streamline;aggregate data;call to action (marketing);education, medical;xml	Sishir Rao;Andrew Swartz;Leila Obeid;Sevith Rao;Barbara Joyce;Sarah Whitehouse;Mathilda Horst;Jack Butler;Ryan Kinnen;Alexander Shepard;Ilan Rubinfeld	2010	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-010-9490-3	medical education;internal medicine;family medicine;medicine;computer science;nursing;metadata	HPC	-59.39304651543906	-63.310921215277524	160495

In this paper, the authors propose an intelligent cloud-based electronic health record (ICEHR) system that has the potential to reduce medical errors and improve patients’ quality of life, in addition to reducing costs and increasing the productivity of healthcare organizations. They developed a set of best practices that encompass end-user policies and regulations, identity and access management, network resilience and service level agreements, advanced computational power, “Big Data” mining abilities, and other operational/managerial controls that are meant to improve the privacy and security of the ICEHR, and make it inherently compliant to healthcare regulations. These best practices serve as a framework that offers a single interconnection agreement between the cloud host and healthcare entities, and streamlines access to private patient information based on a unified set of access principles.

With its ability to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety and quality of living, Health Information Technology (HIT) is viewed by many as an enabler of a revamped U.S. healthcare system (Institute of Medicine, 2001). HIT’s benefits are expected to further materialize into increased productivity and reduced costs through faster and more reliable information sharing and integration across healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions (Blumenthal, 2011). A 2006 study conducted at the University of Minnesota analyzed the costs and benefits of one such technology, telehealth that consists of remotely monitoring the well-being of patients using HIT. The study was conducted by creating three separate groups of patients. The first control group received traditional skilled nursing care at home. The second group received traditional skilled nursing care at home and virtual visits using videoconferencing technology. The third and last group received traditional skilled nursing care at home, virtual visits using videoconferencing technology, and physiologic monitoring for their underlying chronic condition. Within 6 months of study, no differences in mortality or morbidity were found between the groups. The average visit costs were $48.27 for face-to-face home visits, $22.11 for average virtual visits, and $32.06 and $38.62 for average monitoring group visits for congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects, respectively. The results of the study showed that virtual visits and monitoring by skilled healthcare practitioners of chronically ill patients can provide positive patient outcomes at a lower cost compared to traditional face-to-face meetings (Finkelstein et al., 2006). Despite all of its potential, HIT has historically faced many barriers to acceptance and adoption by healthcare practitioners because of its high implementation and maintenance costs, difficulties of integration with legacy health infrastructures, the lack of standards that ensure interoperability between various HIT components, and the time and effort required for learning and training. In addition, patients have thus far shown meager interest in adopting pricey HIT products and services, and have expressed concerns about sharing their private information online. For example, the free Google Health service shutdown after only a few years of operation because of lack of adoption by patients (Google, 2011). Organizations in the US that furnish, bill, or receive payment for healthcare, and transmit or perform transactions involving an individual’s protected health information (PHI) are required to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Title I of HIPAA is aimed at ensuring that no patient is denied insurance coverage based on health conditions, and at limiting coverage exclusions based on preexisting health conditions (U.S. Department of Labor, 2004). Title II of HIPAA has promoted the standardization of healthcare through using HIT in an effort to ensure that patients’ private information is protected and transferred securely (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2012). The fundamental issues of privacy loss and excessive costs that permeate HIT were addressed in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) that was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009. ARRA allocated $300 million for improving health information exchanges, $20 million to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards and enhance system interoperability, and $1.5 billion for health IT system upgrades in public health centers (Hoyt, 2009). Most importantly, ARRA included a provision stipulating over $19 billion in funding to establish a national electronic health record (EHR) system that enforces stringent security measures to protect patients’ private information (Khansa et al., 2012). This provision, called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) act, was meant to “promote the adoption and meaningful use of health information technology” (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2009a, p. 56124). Further, Title XIII of HITECH specifically encouraged healthcare institutions to adopt EHR systems 13 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/proposing-intelligent-cloud-basedelectronic/72885?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Communications and Social Science.

Because of their direct relationship with patients, nurses are also the most influential hospital staff who play a vital role in providing healthcare services. In this paper, a novel Data Envelopment Analysis Matrix (DEAM) approach is proposed for assessing the performance of nurses based on relative efficiency. The proposed model consists of five input variables (including type of employment, work experience, training hours, working hours and overtime hours) and eight output variables (the outputs are amount of hours each nurse spend on each of the eight activities including documentation, medical instructions, wound care and patient drainage, laboratory sampling, assessment and control care, follow-up and counseling and para-clinical measures, attendance during visiting and discharge suction) have been tested on 30 nurses from the heart department of a hospital in Iran. After determining the relative efficiency of each nurse based on the DEA model, the nurses’ performance were evaluated in a DEAM format. As results the nurses were divided into four groups; superstars, potential stars, those who are needed to be trained effectively and question marks. Finally, based on the proposed approach, we have drawn some recommendations to policy makers in order to improve and maintain the performance of each of these groups. The proposed approach provides a practical framework for hospital managers so that they can assess the relative efficiency of nurses, plan and take steps to improve the quality of healthcare delivery.	aftercare;data envelopment analysis;delivery of health care;discharger;division of extramural activities;documentation;health care reform;patients;sampling (signal processing);suction drainage	Ali Vafaee Najar;Alireza Pooya;Ali Alizadeh Zoeram;Ali Emrouznejad	2018	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-018-0974-x	data mining;sampling (statistics);documentation;work experience;attendance;health administration;data envelopment analysis;overtime;health care;medicine;nursing	SE	-61.47078674920297	-65.98504621017817	161032

It is clearly important to find ways to stimulate cognitively this population, helping them to develop strategies and maintaining independency in their daily life activities. Conventional cognitive stimulation is time consuming task often causing discom‐ fort in patients. Computer based tools may be used to perform cognitive stimu‐ lation and improve transferability in a setting that does not increase anxiety in individuals. This paper aims to present a pilot study of automatic platforms to enhance the cognitive process for older adults in order to promote an active aging.

Like other medical data as well, the produced imagery data has to be stored in archives for a comparatively long time. One of the largest problems is the searchability of such data archives. Current search options are often restricted to a plain text search that can only search within digital (or digitalized) reports and possibly also annotations. The first part of this thesis focuses on a problem stated by radiologists that are working on Computer Tomography (CT) data. In that part, a new technique is presented that allows a query-by-example search in CT volume scans that requires only a minimal set of input data to obtain a very accurate result. The second part of the medical imaging topic in this thesis covers the automatic detection of the vertebra within a single CT image. The results of this method can be used as an initialization for several other techniques that are yet only semi-automatic as they often need a manual initialization. The second part of the thesis is concerned with the analysis of medical sensor data. This work was motivated by the importance of physical activity to modern health care. The importance of physical activity in medical prevention and in therapy is non-controversial. However it is comparatively hard to monitor the physical activity of a patient if he is not in a controlled environment like a hospital. Currently this can be accomplished if the patient is writing a detailed log, yet this is neither convenient nor objective.

These performance measures are derived from a detailed analysis of human performance during a month-long training experiment where participants learned to operate a 2-DOF haptic interface in a virtual environment to execute a manual control task. The motivation for the analysis presented in this paper is to determine measures of participant performance that capture the key skills of the task. This analysis of performance indicates that two quantitative measurestrajectory error and input frequencycapture the key skills of the target-hitting task, as the results show a strong correlation between the performance measures and the task objective of maximizing target hits. The performance trends were further explored by grouping the participants based on expertise and examining trends during training in terms of these measures. In future work, these measures will be used as inputs to a haptic guidance scheme that adjusts its control gains based on a real-time assessment of human performance of the task. Such guidance schemes will be incorporated into virtual training environments for humans to develop manual skills for domains such as surgery, physical therapy, and sports.	dynamical system;haptic technology;human reliability;missile guidance;real-time clock;resonance;virtual reality	Joel C.

8d2aeda1206a411d6c75ebb61c000d9d7bf06a86	boredom, information-seeking and exploration		Any adaptive organism faces the choice between taking actions with known benefits (exploitation), and sampling new actions to check for other, more valuable opportunities available (exploration). The latter involves informationseeking, a drive so fundamental to learning and long-term reward that it can reasonably be considered, through evolution or development, to have acquired its own value, independent of immediate reward. Similarly, behaviors that fail to yield information may have come to be associated with aversive experiences such as boredom, demotivation, and task disengagement. In accord with these suppositions, we propose that boredom reflects an adaptive signal for managing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, in the service of optimizing information acquisition and long-term reward. We tested participants in three experiments, manipulating the information content in their immediate task environment, and showed that increased perceptions of boredom arise in environments in which there is little useful information, and that higher boredom correlates with higher exploration. These findings are the first step toward a model formalizing the relationship between exploration, exploitation and boredom.	experience;experiment;exploit (computer security);sampling (signal processing);self-information	Andra Geana;Robert Wilson;Nathaniel D.

The authors propose such a framework, describe general design principles and system architecture, and illustrate a multimodality neuroimaging data warehouse system implemented for clinical epilepsy research. The data warehouse system is built on top of a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) environment and applies an iterative object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) approach and recognized data interface and design standards. The implementation is based on a Java CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and Web-based architecture that separates the graphical user interface presentation, data warehouse business services, data staging area, and backend source systems into distinct software layers. To illustrate the practicality of the data warehouse system, the authors describe two distinct biomedical applications--namely, clinical diagnostic workup of multimodality neuroimaging cases and research data analysis and decision threshold on seizure foci lateralization. The image data warehouse framework can be modified and generalized for new application domains.	application domain;archive;common object request broker architecture;disease management;disk staging;epilepsy;geographic information systems;graphical user interface;iterative method;java programming language;multimodal imaging;neuroimaging;picture archiving and communication system;seizures;systems architecture;user interface device component;anatomical layer;standards characteristics	Stephen T.

As changing reimbursement paradigms move towards quality outcomes and bundled payments, extensive care coordination between healthcare providers is imperative. We developed an approach to quantify care coordination relationships among providers treating breast cancer patients at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Our cohort of 1285 providers treated 3924 breast cancer patients, and had 1758 unique provider-provider relationships. Providers treating stage III breast cancer patients had the highest ratio of providers to patients, indicating a more tightly connected network than providers treating stage I or II patients. Network analysis can provide quantitative approaches to understanding the relationships of multi-specialty providers and may inform approaches to measuring the impact of care coordination on outcomes.	crew resource management, healthcare;imperative programming;mammary neoplasms;numerous;patients;social network analysis;stage iii breast cancer ajcc v7;payment;stage ii bladder cancer	Bryan D.

A mediation model was used to test two hypotheses, (1) Online Support Group (OSG) use mediates self-stigma and recovery from self-stigma and (2), recovery from self-stigma mediates OSG use and support seeking. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using Bayesian estimation with Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) was used to analyse the model, based on the data collected from 99 users of OSGs for mental illness. The hypotheses were not supported. Active users were found to have higher levels of recovery from self-stigma and increased likelihood to have sought formal support. However, these perceived benefits maybe attributable to underlying factors which encourage a user to actively participate. Frequency of visits negatively affects recovery from self-stigma, suggesting that OSGs are a form of social avoidance, as opposed to a method of challenging the problem of stigma. This supports a growing body of research which is highlighting the negative effects of excessive dependency on OSGs. Users, moderators and mental health professionals need to be cognizant of the potential harm that excessive dependency can cause to already vulnerable people.	online and offline;scott meyers;stepping level	Aideen Lawlor;Jurek Kirakowski	2014	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2013.11.015	psychology;psychiatry;social psychology;clinical psychology	HCI	-59.854995334659954	-53.281369864001675	162701

PurposeAre assistive technology interventions effective in learning disabilities for participants ages 14 and up? How do these interventions affect the lived experience of users? We performed a systematic review of both qualitative and quantitative studies to answer these questions. MethodsUsing 5 search methods, we located 38 quantitative group-design and single-subject intervention studies, 5 survey studies and 13 qualitative studies. We sorted the group-design and single-subject studies into groups by intervention type and performed meta-analyses. We provided a narrative summary of survey and qualitative publications. We used a modified version of the Downs-Black checklist to assess study quality, where applicable. ResultsWhile assistive interventions proved overall beneficial, the most commonly used interventions were unexpectedly not the most effective. Interventions based on word processing, multimedia and hypertext proved the most effective, while smart pens and text-to-speech systems presented mixed results. Speech-to-text systems had a small positive effect. Participants had mixed emotions and attitudes about their assistive technology. ConclusionsAssistive technology interventions can be helpful for adolescents and adults with learning disabilities, but interventions need to be carefully compared, and customized to the individual. Assistive technology can be useful for adolescents and adults with LD.Word processing, multimedia and hypertext interventions were the most effective.Speech-to-text interventions had a small effect.Smart pens and text-to-speech systems had mixed results.Interactions with baseline ability or age can obscure intervention success.

The core definition of BMI adopted by AMIA specifies that BMI is 'the interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective uses of biomedical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human health.' Application areas range from bioinformatics to clinical and public health informatics and span the spectrum from the molecular to population levels of health and biomedicine. The shared core informatics competencies of BMI draw on the practical experience of many specific informatics sub-disciplines.

Many western countries have adopted the use of innovative products in the form of mobile/web technologies and wearable devices to improve their healthcare system. Interestingly, a wearable device called MYO Armband is being adopted in the physiotherapy treatment and few studies show doctors and patients are interested in using the device but due to MYO's cumbersome nature, we decided to consider non-wearable device(s) for the treatment. Recently, we identified a touchless device (non-wearable) called “Leap Motion”, which is used for gaming systems and controlling applications in mobiles and computers. A sudden spark made us think the Leap Motion could be used in the physiotherapy treatment and we also, spotted interesting web applications which could potentially be used along with the device. We conducted workshops with the UK and Indian doctors and common people to understand the Leap Motion's use in physiotherapy and set some guidelines in using the device. Though the methodology of using workshops and survey responses collected to analyze is not the strongest of research methodologies, we tried to generalize the outcomes and recommendations, and the stimulating discussions with the doctors and practitioners helped us address ten-points to improve the healthcare system in India.	myo armband;wearable computer;wearable technology;web application	Mithileysh Sathiyanarayanan;Sharanya Rajan	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2017.7945443	web application;wearable computer;communications system;wearable technology;physical therapy;computer science;health care	HCI	-58.29356487745325	-57.19613313356792	163797

Many patients, however, face multiple social disadvantages that may influence their ability to fully participate in SDM or to use PtDAs; additionally, these social disadvantages are among the determinants of health associated with greater cancer risk, unwarranted variations in care and worse outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to describe the extent to which disadvantaged social groups in the United States (US) have been included in trials of cancer-related PtDAs and to highlight strategies, lessons learned and future opportunities for developing and evaluating PtDAs that are appropriate for disadvantaged populations.   METHODS We selected cancer-related US studies from the Cochrane 2014 review of PtDAs and added RCTs meeting Cochrane criteria from searches of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO (January 2010 to December 2013); and reference lists. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts; three reviewers independently screened full text articles, performed data extraction and assessed: 1) inclusion of participants based on seven indicators of social disadvantage (limited education; female gender; uninsured or Medicaid status; non-U.S. nativity; non-White race or Hispanic ethnicity; limited English proficiency; low-literacy), and 2) attention to social disadvantage in the development or evaluation of PtDAs.   RESULTS Twenty-three of 39 eligible RCTs included participants from at least one disadvantaged subgroup, most frequently racial/ethnic minorities or individuals with limited education and/or low-literacy. Seventeen studies discussed strategies and lessons learned in attending to the needs of disadvantaged social groups in PtDA development; 14 studies targeted disadvantaged groups or addressed subgroup differences in PtDA evaluation.   CONCLUSIONS The diversity of the US population is represented in a majority of cancer-related PtDA RCTs, but fewer studies have tailored PtDAs to address the multiple social disadvantages that may impact patients' participation in SDM. More detailed attention to the comprehensive range of social factors that determine cancer risk, variations in care and outcomes is needed in the development and evaluation of PtDAs for disadvantaged populations.

fa48046f9d10b27b5dfd705d1c6b50c7b55d7c1c	linking macro-level goals to micro-level routines: ehr-enabled transformation of primary care services		Information and communication technologies are known to be instrumental in the enhancement of healthcare management capabilities in developing countries. Turkey – a developing country – has undergone a major healthcare transformation marked by the redesign of primary care delivery and the implementation of a nation-wide Electronic Health Records (EHR) system. In this research, presenting Turkey’s case, we investigate the consequences of EHR implementation in developing countries. We argue that to better understand the consequences, we need to link macro-level healthcare goals with micro-level system usage behaviors that actualize the macro-level goals or alternatively result in unintended negative health outcomes. We posit that this linkage is achieved through the meso-level structures, namely the EHR and the organizational context, in which it is embedded. Hence, we examine the EHR’s role in this relationship. Our findings indicate that EHR usage both enables and constrains the achievement of clinicians’ professional goals in the context of primary care delivery. Moreover, goal alignment between the government agency as the designer of the system and the clinicians influence the outcomes of the EHR-enabled transformation. When the healthcare goals are aligned, the system enables the clinicians to achieve their professional goals and their system usage behaviors converge, contributing to improvements in health outcomes. Contrarily, when the goals are misaligned, the system constrains goal achievement and the clinicians show divergent usage behaviors, including goal abandonment. In turn, goal abandonment may lead to negative consequences and even adversely affect the achievement of population-level healthcare goals in the long run.

08d6d82a489e8bad865cf9d5df4be8c789e34035	expanding access to high-quality plain-language patient education information through context-specific hyperlinks		Medical records, which are increasingly directly accessible to patients, contain highly technical terms unfamiliar to many patients. A federally qualified health center (FQHC) sought to help patients interpret their records by embedding context-specific hyperlinks to plain-language patient education materials in its portal. We assessed the impact of this innovation through a 3-year retrospective cohort study. A total of 12,877 (10% of all patients) in this safety net population had used the MPC links. Black patients, Latino patients comfortable using English, and patients covered by Medicaid were more likely to use the informational hyperlinks than other patients. The positive association with black race and Latino ethnicity remained statistically significant in multivariable models that controlled for insurance type. We conclude that many of the sociodemographic factors associated with the digital divide do not present barriers to accessing context-specific patient education information once in the portal. In fact, this type of highly convenient plain-language patient education may provide particular value to patients in traditionally disadvantaged groups.	ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;hyperlink;literatura latino-americana e do caribe em ciências da saúde;patients	Jessica S.

35eab217bf65e842c3239485a356a4f583682fd1	facilitating interaction in web-based communities: the case of a community for innovation in healthcare		Integrating users on web-based platforms is achieved in many settings such as communities for innovation as well as in different areas like healthcare. In web-based communities, interaction is the basic mechanism from which users as well as organizers derive benefit and, thus, is very important for indicating whether a community is successful or not. Facilitation of users can help to address challenges in establishing and nurturing interaction in web-based communities. The objective of this paper is to explore interactions on web-based communities for innovation and how they could be supported by means of automated or human facilitation. Following an action research approach, we investigate possibilities for interaction along an exploratory interpretive in-depth single case study of a community for innovation that pursues to help patients suffering from a rare disease. Using investigative analysis, we disclose possibilities of interaction and suggest a framework for interaction-based facilitation.	interaction;virtual community;web application	Sabrina Adamczyk;Dominik Böhler;Angelika C.

Although this approach holds considerable promise, it promises to be a complicated and expensive undertaking. This study described the development and implementation of a community wide system for electronic sharing of summary health care utilization data.   METHODS The development of the community wide data system focused on the following objectives: ongoing monitoring of the health care system, evaluation of community wide individual provider initiatives, identification and development of new initiatives. The system focused on the sharing of data related to hospital acute care, emergency medical services, long term care, and mental health. It was based on the daily distribution of reports among all health care providers related to these services.   RESULTS The development of the summary reports concerning health care utilization produced a system wide view of health care in Syracuse, New York on a daily basis. It was not possible to isolate the results of these reports because of the impact of specific projects and other factors. At the same time, the reports were associated with reduction of hospital inpatient stays, improvement of access to hospital emergency departments, reductions in stays for patients discharged to nursing homes, and increased access of mental health patients to hospital inpatient units.   CONCLUSION The implementation of the system demonstrated that summary electronic utilization data could provide daily information that would support the improvement of health care outcomes and efficiency. This approach could be implemented in a simple, direct manner with minimal expenses.	accident and emergency department;data system;digital electronics;emergency medical service;mental disorders;nursing homes;patient acceptance of health care;patients;inpatient;long-term care	Ronald J.

Although there have been previous attempts to use computer technology to obtain this information, they have proved to be costly and complex and therefore not widely used. However, a behavioral monitoring technology, based on smart-home and telemedicine applications, has been developed that obtains more accurate and timely information on the ability of frail individuals to accomplish specific tasks in their own residences than any other existing method. During a twelve month pilot study, this system has been used by care providers to assess the status of their clients, respond to immediate needs and alter overall care plans, thus resulting in better care and greater peace of mind for the individual.	client (computing);colon classification;computer;doris (geodesy);exemplification;home automation;internet;iteration;keystone effect;mind;out there;sensor;tom;telematics;ubiquitous computing	Anthony P.

86a4655a54a807f66f08209b2992cb3dd4daed80	old, sick and no health insurance.: will you need a permit to use your home-made health wearable?		We posit that as aging populations grow, so too will the demand for wearable devices that help people manage their chronic health conditions autonomously, at home, without medical supervision. Although healthcare providers are now integrating wearables into frontline services, the regulatory journey from consumer use to patient use for these devices is complex and oft protracted due to strict legislation. Through the creation of a design fiction -- HealthBand -- we explore how open source and crowd-funded wearables might impact future health product legislation. We argue that the generated artefacts co-construct a world in which HealthBand could plausibly exist, and in turn can help audiences engage more explicitly with the fiction's broader debates. Further, if future health wearables are to be adopted, HCI and design researchers must not focus solely on creating prototypes but also engage with regulatory change. We assert design fictions that build worlds like HealthBand have a role in highlighting the changes required.	autonomous robot;crowdfunding;human–computer interaction;open-source software;population;wearable computer;wearable technology	Michael Stead;Paul Coulton	2017		10.1145/3064857.3079127	wearable technology;wearable computer;engineering;human–computer interaction;multimedia;health care;design fiction;legislation	HCI	-60.69659835034221	-54.480287913435184	165034

Methods used to create these functionalities can be divided into two groups, each being associated to different questions. Data-based methods are seen as black boxes for which it is impossible to understand how the decision is taken; knowledge-based methods need to rely on formalized knowledge sources on the basis of evidence, which can be discussed and criticized by physicians for their use in real life. This paper presents a new modular decision support system for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, based on knowledge and on cooperative decision between the patient and the physician. The decision support system is based on two layers: (i) the first layer is a knowledge-based module which generates automatically patient profile, and prevention strategies associated to the profile; (ii) the second layer is a dynamic collaborative graphic user interface which displayed information about the risks of treatment adherence failure, personalized motivation and follow-up strategies. In the future, we aim at assessing the platform in real life.

As health education is to persuade patients on health behavioural change, understanding perceived benefits of online health education is an important aspect to explore. The aim of this study is to explore consumers and health professionals opinion on online health education. Literature review was conducted and identified the benefits of online health education (OHE). Survey was conducted to health consumers and health professionals. Descriptive analyses were performed using SPSS Version 19.0. The analysis of the literature has identified a set of 12 potential benefits of OHE which had been used to understand the perceptions of the effectiveness of OPE sites and these have been validated in the study. This study has the practical implication as the study identified OHE effectiveness, which definitely can assist health practitioners on health education, which can lead to better health outcome.	chronic disease;decision making;description;disease management;health education;informatics;internet;patients;spss;benefit;phosphoethanolamine;physical hard work	Khin Than Win;Naffisah Mohd Hassan;Andrew Bonney;Don Iverson	2015	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-015-0224-4	health policy;family medicine;health promotion;medicine;consumer;health belief model;hrhis;nursing;health;health care;health education	HCI	-62.42255173652501	-61.18533397422557	165790

Apart from being responsible for premature deaths, early diseases and reduced immunity, smoking also inhibits physiological and psychological problems in children born from addicted mothers. Though many developed countries have consciously made efforts to curb smoking, for the developing countries, the trend is still on the rise. The promising factor is that there are many people who are willing to quit smoking and are resorting to technology and electronic media for the same. In this paper, we have proposed a unique smoking intervention plan with the help of mobile phones that uses a Case Based Recommender system.

The design of the reference architecture was based on the results of 14 working sessions with 10 eHealth Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) and the theory behind the Refined eHealth European Interoperability Framework (ReEIF). The evaluation with experts revealed additional conditions that – next to the reference architecture – are needed before interoperable eHealth in primary care can actually be achieved.	european interoperability framework;reference architecture	Wendy Oude Nijeweme d'Hollosy;Lex van Velsen;Alexander Henket;Hermie Hermens	2018	2018 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2018.8538576	knowledge management;ehealth;computer network;reference architecture;interoperability;primary health care;computer science	Arch	-55.6945189433307	-62.262840038160505	166592
d744923d7417d64a2dce621e4e304f5b72f848cb	an information system to support and monitor clinical trial process		The demand of transparency of clinical research results, the need of accelerating the process of transferring innovation in the daily medical practice as well as assuring patient safety and product efficacy make it necessary to extend the functionality of traditional trial registries. These new systems should combine different functionalities to track the information exchange, support collaborative work, manage regulatory documents and monitor the entire clinical investigation (CIV) lifecycle. This is the approach used to develop MEDIS, a Medical Device Information System, described in this paper under the perspective of the business process, and the underlining architecture. Moreover, MEDIS was designed on the basis of Health Level 7 (HL7) v.3 standards and methodology to make it interoperable with similar registries, but also to facilitate information exchange between different health information systems.	.cda file;business process;civ (rail travel);data quality;health level 7;information exchange;information retrieval;information system;interoperability;next-generation secure computing base	Daniela Luzi;Fabrizio Pecoraro	2012	CoRR	10.5121/ijcsit.2012.4602	knowledge management;data mining;computer security	HCI	-54.93819543017983	-62.737021556211175	166901

The system has some additional features as it is the formation of continuity of care records and the transmission of referral letters with a semantically annotated web service. The platform's Web-orientation provides significant advantages, allowing for easily accomplished remote access.

No study has qualitatively investigated the role of the Emergency NP in Australia, nor the impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on this disruptive workforce innovation. This study aimed to investigate ways in which Nurse Practitioners (NP) have incorporated the use of ICT as a mechanism to support their new clinical role within Emergency Departments.   METHODS A cross-sectional qualitative study was undertaken in the Emergency Departments (EDs) of two large Australian metropolitan public teaching hospitals. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with five nurse practitioners, four senior physicians and five senior nurses. Transcribed interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach to develop themes in relation to the conceptualisation of the ED nurse practitioner role and the influences of ICT upon the role. Member checking of results was achieved by revisiting the sites to clarify findings with participants and further explore emergent themes.   RESULTS The role of the ENP was distinguished from those of Emergency nurses and physicians by two elements: advanced practice and holistic care, respectively. ICT supported the advanced practice dimension of the NP role in two ways: availability and completeness of electronic patient information enhanced timeliness and quality of diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making, expediting patient access to appropriate care. The ubiquity of patient data sourced from a central database supported and improved quality of communication between health professionals within and across sites, with wider diffusion of the Electronic Medical Record holding the potential to further facilitate team-based, holistic care.   CONCLUSIONS ICT is a facilitator through which the disruptive impact of NPs can be extended. However, integration of ICT into work practices without detracting from provider-patient interaction is crucial to ensure utilisation of such interventions and realisation of potential benefits.	accident and emergency department;breast feeding;checking (action);cross-sectional data;decision making;disruptive behavior disorder;e (complexity);emergence;erectile dysfunction;health promotion;holism;medical records systems, computerized;numerous;nurse scheduling problem;patients;primary health care;semiconductor industry;teaching hospitals;benefit	Julie Li;Johanna I.

The film is not a literal prediction, but rather a projection of where current technologies are headed and what changes they will produce in the fields of medical diagnosis, patient care and hospital administration. Though produced at Hewlett-Packard, IMAGINE represents the capabilities of many companies and is a demonstration of open systems and their integration. The film’s three scenarios highlight a range of situations. All pose problems in patient treatment or cost control, and in each it is information, delivered when and where it’s needed, that provides the solutions. All of the medical procedures, information presentations, and interaction techniques were reviewed by experts in the fields concerned. Cardiologists, neurologists, pathologists, nurses and administrators provided abundant critical review to ensure accuracy. While this process was time consuming for such a fast paced film, it was felt to be essential for acceptance by the medical community.

However, there is a lack of direct evidence to help the clinicians make a decision. Objectives The aim of this review is to determine whether one of the approaches is more benefit than any of the others for the treatment of IBS through adjusted indirect comparison. Methods We searched the Cochrane Library (from inception to March 2014) using the keyword “irritable bowel syndrome” for systematic reviews. According to the pre-specified selection criteria, qualified trials were selected from the identified reviews. We calculated pooled random- or fixed-effects estimates according to the type of treatment for the proportions of treatment response. Adjusted indirect comparison was used for the pooled RRs of any two types of treatments with placebo as the common control. The primary outcome was improvement of patients global assessment. The second outcome included the improvement of IBS-symptom score and improvement of symptoms of abdominal pain. Results Nine systematic reviews were identified including 203 trials. Ultimately, 62 studies (N= 11,326) fulfilled inclusion criteria. For primary outcome global assessment, herbal medicine was associated with greater effects than western active medicine (RR, 1.34 [95%CI, 1.03-1.75]). For secondary outcome, the adjusted indirect comparison showed that there was no statistically significant difference between acupuncture and western active medicine in symptom severity. Herbal medicine may possibly be more effective than western active medicine in reducing abdominal pain, although the wide confidence intervals preclude any definite conclusions, with a RR of 1.18 [95%CI, 0.65-2.15]. Conclusions Herbal medicine may be more effective than western active medicine for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, especially in relieving the global symptoms, which may help the clinicians to make a decision in routine practice.	carpal tunnel syndrome;cochrane library;rapid refresh;systematic review	Qian Li;Wen-ting Liu;Jing-jun Xu;Jian-hui Xie;Xiao-bo Yang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)	10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999327	biology;systematics	SE	-61.20222541573383	-65.69154866888924	167300

However, the absence of standardized vocabularies for annotating events in a machine understandable manner, the welter of collection-specific data organizations, the difficulty in moving data across processing platforms, and the unavailability of agreed-upon standards for preprocessing have prevented large-scale analyses of EEG. Here we describe a """"containerized"""" approach and freely available tools we have developed to facilitate the process of annotating, packaging, and preprocessing EEG data collections to enable data sharing, archiving, large-scale machine learning/data mining and (meta-)analysis. The EEG Study Schema (ESS) comprises three data """"Levels,"""" each with its own XML-document schema and file/folder convention, plus a standardized (PREP) pipeline to move raw (Data Level 1) data to a basic preprocessed state (Data Level 2) suitable for application of a large class of EEG analysis methods. Researchers can ship a study as a single unit and operate on its data using a standardized interface. ESS does not require a central database and provides all the metadata data necessary to execute a wide variety of EEG processing pipelines. The primary focus of ESS is automated in-depth analysis and meta-analysis EEG studies. However, ESS can also encapsulate meta-information for the other modalities such as eye tracking, that are increasingly used in both laboratory and real-world neuroimaging. ESS schema and tools are freely available at www.eegstudy.org and a central catalog of over 850 GB of existing data in ESS format is available at studycatalog.org. These tools and resources are part of a larger effort to enable data sharing at sufficient scale for researchers to engage in truly large-scale EEG analysis and data mining (BigEEG.org)."""	application program interface;archive;brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;collections (publication);data mining;electroencephalography;epworth sleepiness scale questionnaire;eye tracking;large;machine learning;neuroimaging;pipeline (computing);powerpc reference platform;preprocessor;unavailability;vocabulary;xml;standards characteristics	Nima Bigdely Shamlo;Scott Makeig;Kay A.

There is an increasing demand for a better healthcare support for the elderly and one promising solution is the development of a context-aware middleware infrastructure for pervasive health/wellness-care. This allows the accurate and timely delivery of health/medical information among the patients, doctors and healthcare workers through a widespread deployment of wireless sensor networks and mobile devices. In this paper, we present our design and implementation of such a context-aware middleware for pervasive homecare (CAMPH). The middleware offers several key-enabling system services that consist of P2P-based context query processing, context reasoning for activity recognition and context-aware service management. It can be used to support the development and deployment of various homecare services for the elderly such as patient monitoring, location-based emergency response, anomalous daily activity detection, pervasive access to medical data and social networking. We have developed a prototype of the middleware and demonstrated the concept of providing a continuing-care to an elderly with the collaborative interactions spanning multiple physical spaces: person, home, office and clinic. The results of the prototype show that our middleware approach achieves good efficiency of context query processing and good accuracy of activity recognition.	activity recognition;anytime algorithm;care-of address;context awareness;context-aware network;database;file spanning;incidence matrix;interaction;internet;lookup table;middleware;mobile device;peer-to-peer;personalization;pervasive informatics;prototype;provisioning;semiconductor industry;sensor web;service composability principle;software deployment;testbed;usability;web service	Hung Keng Pung;Tao Gu;Wenwei Xue;Paulito P.

dc71d9d0626c4b0a37cc47055fb84537eb6eea99	doubling the signal quality of smartphone camera pulse oximetry using the display screen as a controllable selective light source		Recent smartphones have the potential to bring camera oximetry to everyone using their powerful sensors and the capability to process measurements in real-time, potentially augmenting people’s lives through always-available oximetry monitoring everywhere. The challenge of camera oximetry on smartphones is the low contrast between reflections from oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. In this paper, we show that this is the result of using the camera flash for illumination, which illuminates evenly across bands than thus leads to the diminished contrast in reflections. Instead, we propose capturing pulse using the front-facing camera and illuminating with the phone’s display, a selective illuminant in the red, green, and blue band. We evaluate the spectral characteristics of the phone display using a spectroradiometer in a controlled experiment, convolve them with the sensitivity curves of the phone’s camera, and show that the screen’s narrow-band display illumination increases the contrast between the reflections in the desired bands by a factor of two compared to flash illumination. Our preliminary evaluation showed further support for our approach and findings.	bands;convolution;deoxyhemoglobin measurement;laptop;mobile device;oled;oxygen saturation measurement;oxyhemoglobin device;period-doubling bifurcation;real-time clock;reflection (computer graphics);smartphone;tablet dosage form;traditional pulse diagnosis;sensor (device)	Christian Holz;Eyal Ofek	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513286	computer vision;pulse oximetry;standard illuminant;spectroradiometer;artificial intelligence;pulse (signal processing);computer science	Visualization	-58.90704784045246	-53.161818429300645	167620

Medical networks are communication networks that serve for the purpose of monitoring and protecting human health. These networks are designed to use biotelemetric ways to transmit the vital data to health observers such as doctors, nurses, first-aid teams, hospitals, and health agencies. These networks are also used in collective damages that may occur in situations such as flood, earthquake, war and terror and for treatments and follow-up of patients and to organize health teams more effective and efficiently. Implementations using this model presented here provides a reference design. In addition MCP (Medical Communication Protocol) and MMP (Medical Management Protocol) are designed to reveal how communications between modules designed.

Patients as well as medical professionals are, from a information and communication technology (ICT) point of view, better equipped than ever before. Despite this, many hospitals and other healthcare service providers have yet to exploit the potential unleashed by these technologies. In this paper, we present a framework for adaptive user interfaces for home care and smart hospital services. The framework uses the current context to provide healthcare professionals or patients with simpler, more efficient user interfaces. In a home care environment, user interface adaption is needed to tailor user interfaces to patients needs and impairments. In a smart hospital, user interface adaption considers medical professionals’ preferences and priorities. In addition, by using context to make input suggestions simplifies the input and limits the scope for errors. Our frameworks uses a modelbased approach and includes the current context in the interface generation process.	adaptive grammar;adaptive user interface;android;chief information officer;dyson (operating system);human–computer interaction;microsoft outlook for mac;mobile device;point of view (computer hardware company);prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;the sims;uiml;ubiquitous computing	Joël Vogt;Andreas Meier	2010			user interface design;human–computer interaction;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia;user interface	HCI	-59.469536600174905	-57.13091096520634	167826
4499b3fd7ad85774d536ed643e384ffc9bd02fca	avim - a contactless system for infant data acquisition and analysis: software architecture and first results		Traditional techniques for the diagnosis of neurological disorders are recently complemented by contact-less methods that provide a semi-quantitative assessment of the patient status. In this framework, the assessment of infant's behaviour based on the analysis of audio and video recordings is appealing thanks to its unobtrusiveness and to the affordable costs of the equipment.#R##N##R##N#This paper presents the architecture of a system, named AVIM, conceived for supporting clinical diagnosis in newborns with contact-less techniques. Its most innovative aspect is the ability of merging in a single tool the management of medical records and reports, audio/video data acquisition, handling and analysis, editing and filling out customized tests. Moreover, unlike other commercial or open source software tools, AVIM allows adding markers and notes while recording audio and video signals and provides detailed reports with both perceptual scores and acoustical and kinematical parameters of clinical interest computed through dedicated innovative techniques. AVIM is therefore a unique and flexible system that could successfully support the clinician during the entire process from the acquisition of the signals to the results. In addition to providing an appreciable decrease in investigation time, costs and errors, AVIM could support the diagnosis integrating clinicians’ qualitative analysis, based on subjective skills, with objective measurements. To highlight its capabilities, AVIM is applied here to the management and analysis of personal and clinical data of newborns audio/video recorded in 5 time points from 10 days to the 24th week of age, according to a specific protocol. Patient data, results of customized tests, tables and plots are provided in a user-friendly environment.	contactless smart card;data acquisition;software architecture	Silvia Orlandi;Andrea Guzzetta;Andrea Bandini;Vittorio Belmonti;Salvatore D.

7130684e8af9b5317337fd9f46233d026aa71188	development and evaluation of ontology for intelligent decision support in medical emergency management for mass gatherings	ontology development and evaluation;medical emergency management;knowledge management;intelligent decision support;case based reasoning;mass gatherings	Conducting a safe and successful major event highly depends on the effective provision of medical emergency services that are often offered by different public and private agencies. Poor communication and coordination between these agencies and teams can result in delays in decisionmaking and duplication of efforts. Another related issue is that emergency decisions are usually made based on individual experience and domain knowledge of relevant managerial personnel. For sustainable knowledge management and more intelligent decision support it is beneficial to collect, consolidate, store and share these experiences in a form of a knowledge base or domain ontology. State-of-the-art surveys identify this gap that there is no common ontology describing the domain knowledge for planning and managing medical services in mass gatherings. Part of the reason is that the process of construction of such an ontology is not a trivial task. In this paper, we describe the process of developing and evaluating a Domain Ontology for Mass Gatherings (DO4MG) with a focus on medical emergency management. As part of the evaluation, we illustrate the application of DO4MG for implementing a case-based reasoning decision support for emergency medical management in mass gatherings. Such an implementation demonstrates the potential of using ontology for resolving terminology inconsistencies and their usefulness for supporting communication between medical emergency personnel in mass gatherings. We also illustrate how this ontology can be applied to different stages of medical emergency management as part of a system architecture.

Adaptive serious games seek to provide the patients with an individualized rehabilitation environment that meets their training needs. In this paper, a dynamic difficulty adaptation (DDA) technique is suggested. This technique focuses on the online adaptation of the game difficulty by taking into account patients’ abilities and motivation.

1d55be1148593bd9379df500b8d28e0170c44072	a comparison of nepalese and american children's concepts of free will		Recent work finds that children as young as four years old have an intuitive belief in free will. To what extent is this early-developing intuition universal, and to what extent culturally situated? We surveyed school-aged children (4-11) in two countries (Nepal and the United States) about their beliefs about people’s “free will” to follow personal preferences; break physical and mental constraints; and break social constraints. Results showed both universal and culturally-learned beliefs in free will. Children across cultures shared the early-developing intuitions of free will and constraint, though American children were more likely construe actions as choices. While American children were more likely to believe in the free will to break social constraints as they aged, Nepali children showed the opposite pattern. These findings show that while a basic notion of free will is present and early-developing across both cultures, construals of choice are also culturally learned over time.	situated	Nadia Chernyak;Tamar Kushnir;Katherine M.

1f4548d30fffc62eb68d92d91433576bc82f1d16	active and healthy ageing: development of a robotic platform as an exercise trainer		In this paper a new robotic system is introduced that will engage, coach, assess and motivate the elderly in physical exercises that are recommended by the National Health Services (NHS) in the UK. With the rise in the population of the elderly which is expected to triple by 2050, this robotic system will aims to improve the quality of life for a significant proportion of the population. Physical activities have tremendous benefit to elderly people. Regular exercise helps the elderly by improving their physical fitness, immune system, sleep and stress levels, not to mention the countless health problems it reduces such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, obesity, joint pains etc.  Having a human instructor for each elderly person is not feasible due to the increase in the population of the elderly. The solution to this, therefore, is having a Exercise Trainer Socially Assistive Robot (ETSAR) that engages the elderly in the needed physical activity, coaches, motivates and also assesses their performance.	assistive technology;robot;the quality of life	Ahmad Lotfi;Caroline S.

In the field of clinical information systems less attention has been paid to approaches aimed at reducing risks and errors  by integrating both declarative and procedural aspects of medical knowledge. This work describes a semantic clinical knowledge  representation framework that allows representing and managing, in a unified way, both medical knowledge and clinical processes  and supports execution of clinical process taking into account risk handling. Framework features are presented by using a  running example inspired by the clinical process adopted for caring breast neoplasm in the oncological ward of an Italian  hospital. The example shows how the proposed framework can contribute to reduce risks.  	knowledge representation and reasoning;risk management	Ermelinda Oro;Massimo Ruffolo;Domenico Saccà	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-01190-0_3	clinical decision support system;economics;risk management;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management science;risk management information systems;management;health care	AI	-55.37191363773355	-62.095143465377475	168476

Its treatment represents a real challenge of nowadays medicine and requires a complex and multidisciplinary management. That implies the necessity of a real team work, as well as computer-based record of the osteoarthritis patients at least at a regional level. There has in view an efficient communication among orthopaedic surgeon, rehabilitation physician and general practitioner. Patients' accessibility to the network will assure a useful and easy patient-physician communication. The computer-based record will provide precise and complete data of clinical, investigatory and functional osteoarthritis patients' parameters. The final goal is a better quality of life in osteoarthritis population who needs conservative or surgical treatment.

Digital medical images are managed with the DICOM standard format. While DICOM contains a large amount of meta-data about whom, where, and how the image was acquired, DICOM says little about the content or meaning of the pixel data. An image annotation is the explanatory or descriptive information about the pixel data of an image that is generated by a human or machine observer. An image markup is the graphical symbols placed over the image to depict an annotation. While DICOM is the standard for medical image acquisition, manipulation, transmission, storage, and display, there are no standards for image annotation and markup. Many systems expect annotation to be reported verbally, while markups are stored in graphical overlays or proprietary formats. This makes it difficult to extract and compute with both of them. The goal of the Annotation and Image Markup (AIM) project is to develop a mechanism, for modeling, capturing, and serializing image annotation and markup data that can be adopted as a standard by the medical imaging community. The AIM project produces both human- and machine-readable artifacts. This paper describes the AIM information model, schemas, software libraries, and tools so as to prepare researchers and developers for their use of AIM.	aim alliance;automatic image annotation;cancer bioinformatics grid;community;compliance behavior;dicom;data collection;description;entity name part qualifier - adopted;genetic translation process;graphical user interface;health care;human-readable medium;image markup;information model;libraries;markup language;medical image;medical imaging;meta;morphologic artifacts;pixel;semantic interoperability;serialization;silver;cagrid;explanation;format;standards characteristics	David S.

Novel technologies facilitate self-management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. However, not all the patients are motivated to use technologies to manage their chronic conditions. Patients depend on certain human values to self-manage their conditions and these values are not implicated in the technologies they use. In this research in progress study we draw on value sensitive design methodological and theoretical approach to investigate human responses to self-management technology. We collect app reviews for a diabetes app and schematically code the review. Our findings contribute to designing technologies and systems that account for the human values of the patients-users.	self-management (computer science);smartphone;value (ethics);value sensitive design	Majid Dadgar;Kshiti D.

AccessMRS functions as a patient-centered interface for viewing OpenMRS data; managing patient information in reminders, task lists, and previous encounters; and launching patient-specific 'Smart Forms' for electronic data collection and dissemination of health information. We present AccessMRS in the context of related software applications we developed to serve Community Health Workers, including AccessInfo, AccessAdmin, AccessMaps, and AccessForms. The specific features and design of AccessMRS are detailed in relationship to the requirements that drove development: the workflows of the Kenyan Ministry of Health Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) supported by the AMPATH Primary Health Care Program. Specifically, AccessMRS was designed to improve the quality of community-based Maternal and Child Health services delivered by CHVs in Kosirai Division. AccessMRS is currently in use by more than 80 CHVs in Kenya and undergoing formal assessment of acceptability, effectiveness, and cost.	android;community health centers;data collection;eighty;electronic health records;electronics, medical;interface device component;medical records;mobile device;open-source software;patients;requirement	Louis E.

We believe that the same holds for robotic teammates, if they are to perform in a similarly fluent manner with their human counterparts.In this work, we propose an adaptive action selection mechanism for a robotic teammate, making anticipatory decisions based on the confidence of their validity and their relative risk. We predict an improvement in task efficiency and fluency compared to a purely reactive process.We then present results from a study involving untrained human subjects working with a simulated version of a robot using our system. We show a significant improvement in best-case task efficiency when compared to a group of users working with a reactive agent, as well as a significant difference in the perceived commitment of the robot to the team and its contribution to the team's uency and success. By way of explanation, we propose a number of fluency metrics that differ significantly between the two study groups.	action potential;action selection;robot	Guy Hoffman;Cynthia Breazeal	2007	2007 2nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)	10.1145/1228716.1228718	human–robot interaction;relative risk;lead;simulation;action selection;teamwork;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-51.44719803897539	-54.79527336944064	169675

Wireless and wearable devices enable the constant monitoring of vital parameters; with the aid of appropriate infrastructures they can be sent to the hospital and when it is needed help can be sent at home. As the number of remotely monitored patients grows, there is a need for efficient management of emergency messages originating from portable and wearable devices as well as a demand for an efficient management scheme for mobile units, which provide help at home or transfer patients to the hospital. We present an architecture that enables provision of help at home with wearable devices and wireless transmission methods. Our approach also focuses on providing help at home in an efficient manner minimizing the service time while maintaining high availability for the high priority calls. We present an algorithm that enables the management of prioritized messages and manages the mobile units providing assistance at home in an efficient manner.	algorithm;high availability;software portability;wearable technology	Grammati E.

The platform is implemented in the LuMiR project for Basilicata, an Italian region where integration of healthcare applications is required. The LUMIR approach, its origin and peculiarities are briefly presented. The project's final target is the regional health digital ecosystem that interacts with the healthcare system for better supporting it.

There is a need for less expensive, compatible, and easy-to-use video conferencing system. The web real-time communication (WebRTC) promises to deliver such a solution by enabling web browsers with real-time communications capabilities via simple JavaScript APIs. Utilizing WebRTC, users can conduct video/audio calls and data sharing through web browsers without having to purchase or download extra software. Though the promise and prospective of WebRTC have been agreed on, there have not been many cases of real life applications (in particular in telehealth) that utilizes the WebRTC. In this paper, we present our practical experience in the design and implementation of a video conferencing system for telehealth based on WebRTC. Our video conferencing system is a part of a large tele-home monitoring project that is being carried out at six locations in five different states in Australia. One of the aims of the project is to evaluate whether high-bandwidth enabled telehealth services, delivered through tele-home monitoring, can be cost effective, and improve healthcare outcomes and access to care. This paper however focuses on WebRTC-based video conferencing system which allows online meetings between remotely located care coordinators and patients at their home. We discuss the underlying issues, detailed design and implementation, and current limitations of using WebRTC in a real life application.	download;emoticon;interoperability;javascript;operating system;performance evaluation;prospective search;prototype;real life;real-time transcription;real-time web;response time (technology);responsiveness;streaming media;systems architecture;television;web application;webrtc;world wide web	Julian Jang;Surya Nepal;Branko George Celler;Bo Yan	2014	Computing	10.1007/s00607-014-0429-2	simulation;decision support system;computer science;interface;peer-to-peer;multimedia;videoconferencing;world wide web	OS	-54.93179710659483	-59.517042479216634	170326

Today, also economical, organizational, and quality aspects move into the centre of medical knowledge management, such as efficiency, analysis, and optimisation of hospital processes, workflow management and collaborative treatments by physicians of remote health care facilities. Using the changing accounting system based on flat rates, health care organizations have to change their operating philosophies to become profitable, enterprise-like organizations. The Workshop KMM05 presented concepts and solutions that show how knowledge management can be applied profitably to solve today’s problems and challenges in the medical domain.

The study builds on an existing employer–employee relationship, adding realism to the ongoing research of task meaning. Owing to an unexpected project cancelation, we are able to study how varying the information provided about the meaning of previously conducted work—without the use of deception, but still maintaining a high level of control—affects subsequent performance. We observe a strong decline in exerted effort when we inform workers about the meaninglessness of a job already done. Our data also suggests that providing a supplemental alternative meaning perfectly compensates for this negative performance effect. Individual characteristics such as reciprocal inclinations and trust prompt different reactions.

Our study tested this hypothesis to determine whether real-world need satisfaction and video game need satisfaction independently predict internet gaming disorder scores (IGD). We also assessed the effects of need frustration in both domains. As expected, we found strong support for the need-density hypothesis in terms of need satisfaction. Unexpectedly, need frustration in both domains was positively associated with IGD scores. A second goal of our study was to determine how the satisfaction and frustration of needs in both domains relate to well-being. We found consistent associations between well-being and real-world need satisfaction and frustration. Associations between well-being and video game need satisfaction and frustration were inconsistent, however. This pattern suggests that the satisfaction and frustration of needs in the real world is more important for well-being than the satisfaction and frustration of needs in video games. Thus, the real-world superiority hypothesis was supported over the video game superiority and equivalence hypotheses. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional health and wellness logs such as food and physical activity diaries do not include location information in a meaningful way. As the ability to track and make sense of location is improving, it will be possible to associate high-quality data regarding the user location and location-derived activities to health and wellness logs. This can significantly improve the ability of these logs to expose meaning to the user, specifically around food and physical activity behaviors. We address four dimensions of location related information: location in terms of places and travels; information derived from location such as roles and transitions; routines identified from places and place transitions; and finally, identifying cohorts and aggregating over routines.	earthbound;information retrieval;lifelog;login;self-reflection;tracing (software)	Adrienne H.

Currently, training tasks for the elderly thus affected are still presented in 2D form. However, clinical research indicates that this strategy generates a cognitive load that reduces the interest of the trainees and diminishes the effects of training. In contrast, augmented reality (AR) is a rising solution that effectively reduces cognitive load, improves the sense of spatial direction of the elderly, and helps increase interest in training. We recruited 28 elderly (age ≥ 65 years) for this study. Fourteen were randomly assigned to an active Intervention group and were given AR-based 3D hologram (AR-3DH) mental rotation training, and 14 were assigned to a group that used the traditional 2D model. Both groups took ABA-designed pre-and post-tests that required inferring the rotating shapes' states from standard mental rotation tasks. Change scores for the two groups were compared using error rates and reaction times as covariates. After six-week of training, the mental rotation ability of the Intervention group improved through the use of AR-3DH training system during the intervention phase. The practical and developmental implications of the findings are discussed.	augmented reality;holography	I-Jui Lee;Chien-Hsu Chen;Kuo-Ping Chang	2016	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.014	psychology;augmented reality;simulation;mental rotation;communication;social psychology	HCI	-55.9416776652137	-53.62192834204691	171327
d93ef49340a249795846591bf78e07ad4b4dca51	a vision for enhancing multimorbid care using clinical decision support systems		There has been a substantial increase in Multimorbidity, worldwide. Extensive empirical research has found that General Practitioners (GPs) often feel overwhelmed when dealing with such patients [1]. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are effective at reducing clinical decision errors and improving healthcare processes across diverse settings [2], the use of CDSS within multimorbidity care is under investigated. This study employs a multi-method approach to examine how well CDSS currently support Irish GPs when dealing with multimorbid patients. The findings uncover a number of inadequacies, including: a lack of provision of integrated medical guidelines for multiple chronic diseases within current CDSS; and an inability to centralise the patient rather than the disease using such systems. This research underlines the need for further research into CDSS for multimorbidity and highlights key issues that must be addressed in order to improve how CDSS support the care of multimorbid patients.

The combination between accuracy measurements and the quality and frequencies of outcome variables such as the length of the hospital stay were only minimally addressed.   METHOD An audit of 300 randomly selected digital nursing records of patients (age of >70 years) admitted between 2013-2014 for hip surgery in two orthopaedic wards of a general Dutch hospital was conducted.   RESULTS Nursing diagnoses: Impaired tissue perfusion (wound), Pressure ulcer, and Deficient fluid volume had significant influence on the length of the hospital stay.   CONCLUSION Nursing process documentation can be used for outcome calculations. Nevertheless, in the first generation of electronic health records, nursing diagnoses were not documented in a standardized manner (First generation 2010-2015; the first generation of electronic records implemented in clinical practice in the Netherlands).	breast feeding;dehydration;document completion status - documented;documentation;electronic health records;hip structure;nursing records;patients;pressure ulcer;randomness;ward (environment)	Wolter Paans;Maria Müller-Staub;Wim P.

The first can be used to request Basic Life Support (BLS) guidelines any time by using a WAP device and to teach people and non-professionals involved in health care emergency situations. The second is a WEB-WAP based tool for medical data retrieval and at-home health care monitoring of chronically ill patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) or diabetes. Medical education content related to these diseases is available on the WEB and on the WAP device. The WAP application uses the features found in the last generation of mobile phones such as better multimedia information presentations, better interactivity capabilities, and enhanced ease of use. Based on these two applications, a promising platform is offered for developing applications in health care, home care, medical monitoring and health education ensuring continuity of care. In the paper we present the preliminary results of a pilot test at Thessaloniki University (Greece) where the WEB-WAP based tool is used to monitor patients with diabetes or CHF.	basic life support;congestive heart failure;critical illness;data retrieval;diabetes mellitus;emergency medical service;health care;home care of patient;interactivity;mobile phone;multimedia;patients;scott continuity;usability;world wide web	Gianluca De Leo;Santosh Krishna;E.

Therefore, involving them to a greater extent in their own futures requires care in considering how smaller projects can be created that facilitate progression of overarching eHealth work. Therefore, this paper considers the future need for eHealth monitoring and describes some projects that, while allowing independent learning over short timescales, can add significant value to related academic research.	color gradient;futures and promises;smart tv	Andrew M.

But HL7 is also developing standards for the representation of clinical documents (such as discharge summaries and consultation notes). These document standards comprise the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA). Last year we presented a high-level conceptual overview of the CDA. Since that time, CDA has entered HL7's formal ballot process (which when successful will make the CDA an ANSI-approved HL7 standard). This article delves into the technical details of the current CDA proposal. Note that due to space limitations, only a subset of CDA details can be described. Also, because the ballot process elicits considerable feedback, it is likely that the material presented here will undergo evolution prior to becoming a final standard.

This study focuses on the expression of temporal information in a fire situation. Both absolute time and relative time were designed to compare the expression types of temporal information. The time sequence and spatial sequence were designed to explore the expressions of a complicated fire that has more than one point of origin. A 5-point Likert scale and ranking task were used to evaluate the comprehensibility of different presentation forms. The results show that using absolute time to describe the point of origin of the fire and its spreading state aided better comprehension. The mechanism and potential reasons are also discussed. In addition, some suggestions for future designs of fire alarm systems are proposed.	natural language	Yan Ge;Xianghong Sun;Li Wang	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39360-0_4	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication	NLP	-49.130001344920856	-54.52609901374888	172263

However, the influence of goals on the development of 'cognitive maps', has largely been ignored. The results of two experiments are reported that investigated the role of both goals and environmental structures on memory for distance and time in Virtual Reality (VR) environments. Experiment 1 compared the effect of goals varying in urgency and desirability on memory for distance and time in VR environments with and without turns. Striking effects of goals were found for memory for distance and time in both environments. Experiment 2 examined the origins of these goal effects through the use of physiological measurement and mood scales. Results show that goals influence distance estimation as a function of the degree of urgency experienced in situ, and not as a function of overall mood state or arousal on the estimation process.

Such systems have been shown to improve care delivery and reduce costs. However, the lack of integration with Electronic Health Record systems and their high cost of maintenance have been identified as important barriers to their adoption. This paper aims, first, to describe a meta-architecture to seamlessly interoperate non-rule-based CDSS with archetype-based Electronic Health Records and, second, to allow the CDSS to perform self-maintenance tasks over its knowledge and inference engine. To achieve these objectives the Dual-Model Approach, in combination with clinical terminologies have been used to define a system capable to be plugged into any OpenEHR system and maintain its knowledge by using the semantics described through clinical terminologies.	clinical decision support system;inference engine;interoperability;knowledge base;knowledge management;logic programming;plug and play	Luis Marco-Ruiz;José Alberto Maldonado;Vicente Traver;Randi Karlsen;Johan Gustav Bellika	2014	IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)	10.1109/BHI.2014.6864416	clinical decision support system;intelligent decision support system;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;database	SE	-54.71422596123002	-62.14318684311003	172531

However, many challenges remain in order to deliver usable systems acceptable to a diverse range of stakeholders, including end-users, and their families and carers, as well as health and social care services. ALSs need to support activities of daily-living while allowing end-users to maintain important social connections. They must be dynamic, flexible and adaptable living environments. In this article, we provide an overview of the technological landscape of assisted-living technology (ALT) and recent policies to promote an increased adoption of ALT in Scotland. We discuss our experiences in implementing technology-supported ALSs and emphasise key lessons. Finally, we propose an iterative and pragmatic user-centred implementation model for delivering ALSs in complex-needs scenarios. This empirical model is derived from our past ALS implementations.

We investigated how EMR was adapted to the complex clinical work environment and how doctors and nurses engaged in the adaptation process. In this paper, we present three cases in which ED clinicians designed workarounds in order to adapt to the new work practice. Our findings reveal a rich picture of ED clinicians' active reinterpretation and modification of their work practice through their engagement with the system-in-use and its organizational and physical context. These findings call for the adaptation period in designing a socio-technical system in healthcare settings to be critically considered as an active end-user design process, a negotiating process, and a re-routinized process.	excalibur: morgana's revenge;sociotechnical system;software deployment;workaround	Sun Young Park;Yunan Chen	2012		10.1145/2207676.2208361	design;design process;computer science;knowledge management;workaround;management;observational study;adaptation	HCI	-61.24268617066993	-61.261087415056295	172606
504140618d39cca99134d9487173bd8f9afeafdc	the design and evaluation of a body-sensing video game to foster empathy towards chronic pain patients		"""Chronic Pain (CP) has been identified as a complex medical condition, one that is difficult for sufferers to articulate and for others to discern. This may interfere with the ability of a patient's family, friends and healthcare practitioners to understand what it is like to live with CP, or to even believe it exists. A reluctance by or ability of others to believe a CP patient may in turn exacerbate pain and sequelae common in CP, such as depression, frustration, stigma or social isolation. The goal of this research is to help foster empathy of what CP patients experience by designing and evaluating a body-sensing video game titled AS IF. In this game, players """"inhabit"""" a virtual body or avatar of a CP patient. The virtual body simulates physical limitations and displays red areas meant to indicate painful areas. A pilot study with 15 participants was conducted. Results show that while not every aspect of the game proved successful, players had a significant increase in their willingness to help patients. This research demonstrates an approach that may help foster empathy towards CP patients through an embodied game simulation, and has design implications for future research and gameplay explorations."""	simulation;virtual body	Xin Tong;Servet Ulas;Weina Jin;Diane Gromala;Chris Shaw	2017		10.1145/3154862.3154869	distributed computing;chronic pain;social isolation;empathy;social psychology;health care;computer science;frustration;embodied cognition	HCI	-56.111656336574534	-52.203198000753574	172646

We found that the difference between high and low performing navigators showed up in the speed they completed their task and also in the way they use maps. High performers plan routes using a survey method whereas low performers use a route strategy. We suggest that when people are given a task that does not match their cognitive style they try to transform the task to better suit their cognitive abilities and cognitive style.	map;situated cognition	Kenny Skagerlund;David Kirsh;Nils Dahlbäck	2012			psychology;cognitive psychology;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;sociology;communication;cognitive science	HCI	-53.12295661492974	-54.197085776217385	172829

Among various factors affecting the value of emergency exercises, including their design, development, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning, this paper emphasizes the focal role of evacuees and their behavior. We address two concerns: What are the intrinsic reasons behind human behavior? How do we model and exhibit human behavior? We review studies investigating the mechanisms of psychological behavior and crowd evacuation animation. A comprehensive analysis of logical patterns of behavior and crowd evacuation is presented first. The interactive effects of information (objective and subjective), psychology (panic, small groups, and conflicting roles), and six kinds of behavior contribute to a more effective understanding of an emergency scene and assist in making scientific decisions. Based on these studies, a wide range of perspectives on crowd formation and evacuation animation models is summarized. Collision avoidance is underlined as a special topic. Finally, this paper highlights some of the technical challenges and key questions to be addressed by future developments in this rapidly developing field.	apache continuum;focal (programming language);focus group;information	Gao-qi He;Yu Kyung Yang;Zhi-Hua Chen;Chun-hua Gu;Zhi-geng Pan	2013	Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE C	10.1631/jzus.CIDE1301	simulation;artificial intelligence	HCI	-53.99779105189646	-52.84909691845987	173439

The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate the use of EDRs by the dental community in the São Paulo city area. A quantitative case study was performed using a survey on the phone. A total of 54 offices were contacted and only one declinedparticipation in this study. Only one office did not have a computer. EDRs were used in 28 offices and only four were paperless. The lack of studies in this area suggests the need for more usability and implementation studies on EDRs so that we can improve EDR adoption by the dental community.

The deployment of a semantic interoperability solution has the potential to enable a wide range of informatics supported applications in clinical care and research both within as ingle healthcare organization and in a network of organizations. At the same time, building and deploying a semantic interoperability solution may require significant effort to carryout data transformation and to harmonize the semantics of the information in the different systems. Our approach to semantic interoperability leverages existing healthcare standards and ontologies, focusing first on specific clinical domains and key applications, and gradually expanding the solution when needed. An important objective of this work is to create a semantic link between clinical research and care environments to enable applications such as streamlining the execution of multi-centric clinical trials, including the identification of eligible patients for the trials. This paper presents an analysis of the suitability of several widely-used medical ontologies in the clinical domain: SNOMED-CT, LOINC, MedDRA, to capture the semantics of the clinical trial eligibility criteria, of the clinical trial data (e.g., Clinical Report Forms), and of the corresponding patient record data that would enable the automatic identification of eligible patients. Next to the coverage provided by the ontologies we evaluate and compare the sizes of the sets of relevant concepts and their relative frequency to estimate the cost of data transformation, of building the necessary semantic mappings, and of extending the solution to new domains. This analysis shows that our approach is both feasible and scalable.	automatic identification and data capture;ct scan;informatics;link relation;meddra;ontology (information science);scalability;semantic interoperability;software deployment;systematized nomenclature of medicine	Ahmed Ibrahim;Anca I.

3d5e59ad3d0ec9d24225f7ee84d71dc7434dfbdf	using multi-sensor tracking data to analyze the mobility and activity behavior of older adults		Projections indicate that by 2050 the elderly population will reach 2 billion people worldwide (Toledo & Barela, 2010) Along with these demographic changes, medical conditions associated with aging will represent a burden to society, for example by an increase in demand for health services. Because older adults demand more from the health service infrastructure, efforts have been made to understand the factors that contribute to healthy aging (Toledo & Barela, 2010). The WHO, in its “World Report on Ageing and Health”, defines healthy aging as the process of maintaining the “functional ability” of individuals through a dynamic interplay between an individual’s biological and physiological endowments, abilities, skills, diseases, subjective evaluations, traits, environments, and real-life activities (Sugawara & Nikaido, 2014). To describe and analyse functional mobility, then, one needs to measure all mobility-related biological and physiological endowments, mobility-related abilities, skills, diseases, subjective evaluations, traits, contexts, and activities, as potentially these are all equally relevant parts of an individual’s functional mobility profile, uniquely characterizing an individual. Research on some of these elements of a mobility profile has been carried out in mobility laboratories or in clinical and experimental studies. The advantages of laboratory experimentation have a price, however, as the laboratory setting by definition isolates research participants from their everyday concerns and activities and subjects them to an artificial environment in which nearly all contextual factors – for example physical features, goals, or other persons involved – are determined by the experimenter (Mehl & Conner, 2012). In field settings (i.e. real-life contexts), in contrast, the physical and social environment is substantially cluttered, people must choose for themselves which tasks to pursue and how to engage them and the option of changing the setting and tasks is usually available. All of these can, of course, alter the results of the research (Mehl & Conner, 2012). In essence, we find the inverse of the laboratory situation, that is, a high ecological validity of the results at the price of reduced internal validity. There is some flexibility in what counts as a method for studying daily life. Among the terms used for studying daily life we find, among others, the term ambulatory assessment (AA). Alternative labels for this methodology are ecological momentary assessment and experience sampling methodology (Brose & Ebner-Priemer, 2015). The aim of this study is by utilizing ambulatory assessment methods to contribute to developing a full, individualized description of human mobility behavior considering different spatio-temporal patterns, and link such personal mobility profiles to psychological resources available to an individual. To do so, we aim to address the following research questions: Using multi-sensor tracking data to analyze the mobility and activity behavior of older adults	conner peripherals;experiment;internal validity;real life;sampling (signal processing)	Hoda Allahbakhshi	2017				HCI	-58.89496473196105	-55.019200855692056	173764

A patient work approach to CHI draws on medical social science and human factors engineering models and simultaneously attends to patients, their family members, activities, and context. A patient work approach extends existing approaches to CHI design that are responsive to patients' biomedical realities and personal skills and behaviors. It focuses on the embeddedness of patients' health management in larger processes and contexts and prioritizes patients' perspectives on illness management. Future research is required to advance (1) theories of patient work, (2) methods for assessing patient work, and (3) techniques for translating knowledge of patient work into CHI application design. Advancing a patient work approach within CHI is integral to developing and deploying consumer-facing technologies that are integrated with patients' everyday lives.	am broadcasting;basal ganglia diseases;behavior;chi;chronic disease;clinical informatics;human factors and ergonomics;informatics (discipline);locus;large;lower limit of normal;patients;peer review;requirement prioritization;responsiveness;science;self-care interventions;self-management (computer science);social sciences;theory;united states national institutes of health;user-centered design;responsibility	Rupa Valdez;Richard J.

Given these strong advantages, it is interesting that technology diffusion for process support in hospitals is somewhat slow. The major process of a hospital -delivering patient careis still supported by traditional paper files in the vast majority of German hospitals. In this paper, we ask what the barriers towards implementing and using an electronic medical record (EMR) -the electronic patient filemight be. Technology resistance theories indicate that perceived risks are a major inhibitor towards systems acceptance. In the absence of thorough empirical studies, we start our investigation by conducting exploratory research into the risks hospital-based physicians associate with using an EMR. A list of possible risks was derived from the literature and 10 physicians were interviewed to gather their assessment. Our findings show that, indeed, physicians associate several risks with adopting EMRs, thereby suggesting these risks will need to be mitigated to enable proper user acceptance.	americas conference on information systems;excalibur: morgana's revenge;exploratory testing;theory	Andy Weeger;Heiko Gewald;Leah J.

b4697e6696b904011c50d54cf25f150f16b9d7e0	a business process model for integrated home care		Currently, Integrated Home Care (IHC) represents a good alternative for providing health and social care but, even if several research efforts have been made, the complexity of the domain implies further investigation. In particular, the lack of precision in defining activities, actors involved and goals have led some European countries including Italy to have low levels of coordination and integration of care delivery. In order to tackle this issue, this paper presents an analysis on existing IHC processes in Italy and, starting from the results of such an analysis, proposes an IHC process model represented by using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). The choice of BPMN relies on its flexibility that makes it preferable if compared to other similar languages. Indeed, it offers two levels of representation: the graphical notation, that makes it simple to understand, and modeling constructs to represent the message-based interactions and the event-based decisions, and then relevant features such as dynamics. Additionally, such a modeling allows early detection and resolution of critical issues. This work can be an essential previous step for further analysis and improvements of IHC processes, including the adoption of ICT. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

3d43b43e1213e6ab7b4ff46e36cfb75852ea8660	quality assurance of loinc mapping for laboratory tests - a local experience with people, process and technology		In Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA), the Electronic Patient Record (ePR) module of Clinical Management System, implemented since 2003, bring together all the information from various clinical module and hospitals into a single corporate wide, longitudinal, integrated record. Nowadays there are billions of laboratory test results stored in the web-based ePR where laboratory results being shared with the HA clinicians for patient care. In order to produce interoperable laboratory data in the ePR, the HA adopts LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) as the reference standard for laboratory tests. Every local test codes have been mapped with LOINC code where possible. Thus, the accuracy of LOINC mapping for laboratory tests in the HA is imperative. This paper describes a quality assurance program of LOINC mapping for laboratory tests conducted in 2011/12. With the use of right people, right process and right technology, we reviewed over 28,000 local test codes and there are around 2,400 distinct LOINC concepts mapped and defined in the system.

This collaboration is often through multidisciplinary case analysis meetings, but it has a high cost for each treated case. In order to understand how collaboration is done and how technology supports it, we conducted a study in a healthcare center in Maipú, Chile. We found several problems regarding collaboration: a lack of awareness of the case status and the activities held by each of the professionals, and that the standard Electronic Medical Records System was not able to capture information about collaboration instances, making the awareness more difficult. To solve this, we propose a web-based system that allows the team to visualize the case status and track the cases in just one screen. We evaluated the relevance of this proposal through interviews with team leaders, who had positive opinions about it. Although our study has limitations, we conclude that the main requirements for collaboration in this context are the awareness that must exist about the activities of other team professionals and the possibility to see them at a glance. Future work will implement the proposal for an evaluation with a large number of users.	prototype;relevance;requirement;web application	Cecilia Saint-Pierre;Esteban Piñones;Matías Rojas;Valeria Herskovic	2013		10.1145/2535597.2535599	simulation;medicine;systems engineering;knowledge management	HCI	-60.28492535661613	-59.406360026000016	174423

The operating capacity of ED is often challenged with overcrowding especially with patients at non-emergency situation using it as point of access for primary care. Application of Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) technology in ED is gaining significant attention with the potential to improve ED care service and subsequently reduce cost. Our previous pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying patient alone time and provider time in establishing relationship to the ED length of stay (LOS). In this work, RFID data within the ED on a larger patient group was used to quantify and understand the various factors influencing ‘patient alone’ time in ED. Results indicate that many factors such as patients per physician or nurse and order volumes are controllable to improve the operating efficiency. These findings motivates further investigation to explore the relationship of patient alone time to overall hospital LOS, readmission, patient leaving without being seen, mortality, patient satisfactions and other complications for a particular cohort of disease group to improve quality of care at ED.	chaos theory;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification	Shivaram P.

98e4381d5e7e5568e48f0984fb23c895fb9bb62f	user acceptance of self-monitoring technology to prevent cardio-metabolic diseases: the wize mirror		Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide and impose a tremendous burden on socio-economic costs. At present, prevention strategies based on personalized lifestyle interventions are considered the best way to contain the epidemics of these diseases. In this view, availability of innovative technological systems able to assist people in self-monitoring and self-coaching is expected to play a crucial role. Aiming to this, we have developed a multi-sensing device, called Wize Mirror which has the appearance of a conventional mirror. The Wize Mirror allows the users to self-monitor their cardio-metabolic risk also providing personalized lifestyle guidance. The mirror has undergone a validation study in three centers to assess the coherence of mirror measurements with standard clinical tests and to evaluate its acceptability by potential users. In this paper, following a summary of the major functionalities of the mirror, we report on the analysis of data about system acceptability assessed during the validation study. Acceptability was measured by means of the System Usability Scale, which resulted in “good” usability of the Wize Mirror.	personalization;smartphone;system usability scale;tablet computer	Giuseppe Coppini;Veronica Chiara Zuccaia;Renata De Maria;Julie-Anne Nazare;Maria-Aurora Morales;Sara Colantonio	2017	2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115837	self-monitoring;management science;distributed computing;system usability scale;usability;data analysis;knowledge management;psychological intervention;computer science	Visualization	-59.71548515374564	-57.606633251216	174503
2e8fbdd7173be0b7f7152ed1ced59536da39f813	a process analysis of computer-generated patient reminders delivered by nursing personnel		Purpose: To measure the extent to which health care reminders are offered by nursing personnel and accepted by patients, we performed a detailed process study of a computer-generated, patient-specific mammography reminder. Subjects: 25,971 consecutive visits by 2,814 women age 50 and older seen during an eight year period in an academic internal medicine practice. Methods: An implementation trial with historical controls was done in the Internal Medicine Clinic at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. We incorporated a computer reminder system into the nursing check-in process along with the standing orders for mammograms. The administration of the reminder, the patient response to the reminder, and subsequent follow-through with mammography were tracked during the intervention phase. Patients were considered if a mammogram had been done within two years before the visit, or if one was obtained within 60 days after the visit. Results: The proportion of patients up-to-date increased from 48% during a four-year pre-intervention phase to 54% in the intervention phase. Process analysis showed that clinic personnel offered the reminder in 31% of eligible visits, 11% of reminded patients agreed, and 53% of patients who agreed had mammography done. One unsuspected carcinoma was diagnosed. Patient race, insurance coverage, and number of visits during the prior two years influenced whether patients agreed to mammography and whether they then had the test done.	computer-generated holography	Thomas G.

There are specialized disciplines in medical sciences for consultation, services, and surgery. Tele medicine is one such area of service through which the aged, rural residents and dwellers of remote hilly and highland areas can be benefited. Often, people in these areas suffer from disease like Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), hypertension, cardiovascular problems, obesity, diabetes etc., or respiratory diseases like asthma, pulmonology related to lungs and so on with a high risk of mortality. In this paper, we propose a Petri Net based framework for analysis and integration of tele-health monitoring service systems over wireless and hybrid networks.	petri net;sleep mode;television	Bidyut Biman Sarkar;Sugata Sanyal;Nabendu Chaki	2011		10.1145/2185216.2185318	simulation;medicine;physical therapy;medical emergency	AI	-56.96374650164521	-60.51592973118833	174887

We interviewed a diverse sample of primary care providers and surgical providers during their patient's transitions of care before and after surgery at a Veteran's Health Administration hospital and a large tertiary academic medical center to understand how providers communicate and exchange health information for medically complex older patient across different care settings. Our objective was to identify factors that lead to poor communication as well as strategies to optimize provider-provider communication. This paper highlights the methods providers use to communicate and document health information within two separate electronic medical record (EMR) systems during transition of care and presents a conceptual diagram of how information exchange occurs within these two EMR systems.	academic medical centers;acknowledgement detail type - information;concept map;diagram;documentation;electronic health records;excalibur: morgana's revenge;information exchange;medical records;patients;primary health care;tertiary	Stacey Slager;Julie Beckstrom;Charlene R.

In Japan, the billing system assigns an """"insurance disease names"""" to performed exams based on the diagnosis type. Departmental systems provide localized, departmental services, such as order receipt and diagnostic reporting, but do not provide patient demographic information. The system above has many problems. The departmental system's terminals and the HIS's terminals are not integrated. Duplicate data entry introduces errors and increases workloads. Order and exam data managed by the HIS can be sent to the billing system, but departmental data cannot usually be entered. Additionally, billing systems usually keep departmental data for only a short time before it is deleted. The billing system provides payment based on what is entered. The billing system is oriented towards diagnoses. Most importantly, the system is geared towards generating billing reports rather than at providing high-quality patient care. The role of the application server is that of a mediator between system components. Data and events generated by system components are sent to the application server that routes them to appropriate destinations. It also records all system events, including state changes to clinical data, access of clinical data and so on. Finally, the Resource Management System identifies all system resources available to the enterprise. The departmental systems are responsible for managing data and clinical processes at a departmental level. The client interacts with the system via the application server, which provides a general set of system-level functions. The system is implemented using current technologies CORBA and HTTP. System data is collected by the application server and assembled into XML documents for delivery to clients. Clients can access these URLs using standard HTTP clients, since each department provides an HTTP compliant web-server. We have implemented an integrated system communicating via CORBA middleware, consisting of an application server, endoscopy departmental server, pathology departmental server and wrappered legacy HIS. We have found this new approach solves the problems outlined earlier. It provides the services needed to ensure that data is never lost and is always available, that events that occur in the hospital are always captured, and that resources are managed and tracked effectively. Finally, it reduces costs, raises efficiency, increases the quality of patient care, and ultimately saves lives. Now, we are going to integrate all remaining hospital departments, and ultimately, all hospital functions."""	application server;clients;clinical data;common object request broker architecture;compliance behavior;electronic billing;http;hospital departments;hospital information systems;information management;information system;management system;mediator brand of benfluorex hydrochloride;middleware;name;patients;server (computer);server (computing);the hub (forum);usb hub;web server;workload;xml	Masanori Akiyama	2000	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-928-8-715	library science;medicine;data science;data mining	OS	-53.612888345956684	-62.58392646751458	175168

After a short introduction into the German healthcare system and its potential starting points for virtual communities, the authors focus on cancer patients. They analyse their situation through field studies and identify information and interaction needs. On this basis, requirements for user centric socio-technical system design for cancer patients are derived. Since no existing offers meet these prerequisites, the authors work on piloting a mobile virtual community for cancer patients in Germany. Some of the identified user needs hint at an extension of web-based services for overcoming internet-related boundaries. New technological possibilities like mobile services and mobile devices are influencing virtual communities. Subjects like ubiquitous community access, new possibilities of user identification and location related services are of special interest since they might allow real ‘anytime-anyplace’ access to the community platform. But regardless of the vast (theoretical) technical possibilities of new mobile technologies for extending web-based services, only socially accepted, technically stable and economically feasible solutions can ensure sustainable success of mobile virtual healthcare communities.	anytime algorithm;mobile device;requirement;sociotechnical system;systems design;virtual community;web application	Jan Marco Leimeister;Miriam Daum;Helmut Krcmar	2004	IJWBC	10.1504/IJWBC.2004.004799	mobile telephony;computer science;knowledge management;mobile technology;mobile device;multimedia;information management;world wide web;information system	HCI	-59.90965098683971	-58.17118893474262	175230

Despite its importance, systematic evaluations of the potential rules for terminating search are scarce. Recent work has focused on two variables: the total time spent in memory search before search is terminated and the exit latency (the time between the last retrieved item and the time of search termination). These variables have been shown to limit the number of plausible rules for terminating memory search. Here, we introduce an alternative stopping rule based on a rational moment-to-moment cost–benefit analysis and derive a closed-form expression of the exit latency function using this rational approach. We show the model’s ability to capture critical latency data and make testable predictions about the influence of changing the relative costs and benefits of memory search. Results from an experiment are presented that support the model’s predictions. We conclude that the decision to terminate memory search is based on momentto-moment changes in subjective utility of retrieved memories. 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.	abstract rewriting system;newman's lemma;terminate (software)	Eddy J.

The paper explores the process of initiating patient communities online as a way of coping and making sense of a difficult life situation when facing illness. The purpose of the paper is to analyze this process in order to increase our understanding of what triggers some individuals to put the technology to use in order to create online communities for patients. A better understanding of these processes is believed to be important both to increase our knowledge of the activities as an online phenomenon but also to inform the design of future information technology use. A descriptive qualitative design of the study was used and ten face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted with purposefully selected patients who share the experience of initiating and managing online communities. In addition, online observations of 15 communities were performed mainly focusing their general structure and design. On a general level it is concluded that the initiation of patients¿ online community building is grounded in personal coping processes involving a complex mix of different coping strategies rather than as direct and purposeful action in order to fulfill group specific purposes. In addition it is suggested that the experiences and the knowledge developed by the patients during this process can be a valuable resource both in the design and in the maintenance of information technology support used in the healthcare ¿ patient relationship.	experience;internet;online community;semiconductor industry;net	Ulrika Josefsson	2004	37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

NICU health care providers employ cutting edge clinical processes, technologies, and latest tools and techniques to provide care for critically ill new born infants. Research has shown that predicting an infant's mortality is important in making critical care decisions. Contemporary, 21st century neonatal intensive care involves the active participation of parents. Although, there are neonatal scores that can be used to measure severity of illness, they are complex and are difficult to comprehend for a novice. Hence, there is a need to combine all the care related information to obtain an indication of the newborn infant's state of health. A new score for Neonatal Mortality Prediction (NMPS) is proposed in this paper. This NMPS would provide an easy to understood numeric value that can be comprehended by both neonatal health care providers and parents. The NMPS would employ factors captured from the antenatal, perinatal and neonatal periods for estimating a consolidated score.	change management (engineering);knowledge management;my baby (series);state of health	Vikraman Baskaran;Irene Bajan;Bharat Shah;Franklyn I.

For example, successfully performing an action following a request may be viewed as an acceptance, while performing the wrong action may be construed as a mis-understanding. Even hesitating to perform a requested physical action may be viewed as a signal of non-understanding. Thus, unlike in the more orthodox domain of non-situated dialogue, natural human-robot dialogue must account for physical actions as a natural and effective implicit communication channel. Though physical actions have not always been explicitly accounted for in dialogue act annotation schemes and models, e.g., vanilla DAMSL lacks a direct mechanism for such implicit communication (Allen and Core 1997), the nature of physical actions as a type of communicative act has been long recognized within the dialogue community (see for example Coulthard & Brazil (1979) for an early account). Indeed, the physical performance of an action can be regarded as a variant on multi-modal interaction (Pfleger, Alexandersson, and Becker 2003). However, while the analysis of physical actions as communicative acts is not new, it is less clear how dialogue planning policies for human-robot interaction should be influenced by the co-occurrence of physical tasks actions. Addressing this issue successfully inevitably depends on knowing whether users consider verbal communication acts alongside physical acts to be superficial or unnatural, and on whether explicit verbal acts can be beneficial given the limitations of imperfect communication. With these questions in mind, in the following we report on a recently conducted study with an implemented humanrobot dialogue system which was designed to assess the importance of compounded physical and verbal communicative acts in human-robot dialogue.	channel (communications);dialog system;donald becker;human–robot interaction;modal logic;multimodal interaction;robot;situated;the superficial	Robert Ross	2010			artificial intelligence;evaluation;feedback	AI	-51.882302240171924	-52.21596948788699	176257
83e6ea08d83c0144d8c80315d45c1b604d17acb6	iot-based services and applications for mental health in the literature		Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a new paradigm today, connecting a variety of physical and virtual elements integrated with electronic components, sensors, actuators and software to collect and exchange data. IoT is gaining increasing attention as a priority research topic in the Health sector in general and in specific areas such as Mental Health. The main objective of this paper is to show a review of the existing research works in the literature, referring to the main IoT services and applications in Mental Health diseases. The scientific databases used to carry out the review are Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science, taking into account as date of publication the last 10 years, from 2008 to the present. Several search criteria were established such as “IoT OR Internet of Things AND (Application OR Service) AND Mental Health” selecting the most interesting articles. A total of 51 articles were found on IoT-based services and applications in Mental Health, of which 14 have been identified as relevant works in mental health. Many of the publications (more than 60%) found show the applications developed for monitoring patients with mental disorders through sensors and networked devices. The inclusion of the new IoT technology in Health brings many benefits in terms of monitoring, welfare interventions and providing alert and information services. In pathologies such as Mental Health is a vital factor to improve the patient life quality and effectiveness of the medical service.

Using a four-stage Data Envelopment Analysis methodology, we are able to explicitly take into account the role of ICT in affecting the efficiency of primary care centres. We understand that this is the first time that ICT enters into the determination of efficiency of the health sector. The role of exogenous factors is explicitly considered in this analysis and shows that including these variables is not neutral to the efficiency evaluation, but leads to an efficiency indicator that only encompasses the effect of managerial skills. The paper provides some useful policy implications regarding the role of ICT in improving the efficiency of primary care units.	data envelopment analysis;database;neoplasms, unknown primary;primary health care	Manuela Deidda;Francisco Lupiáñez-Villanueva;Cristiano Codagnone;Ioannis Maghiros	2014	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-014-0122-1	information and communications technology;medicine;computer science;primary health care;data envelopment analysis;efficiency;management;operations research	AI	-62.26068278272667	-65.92448038923284	176354
f334546dc651cb4c4d7f7ec2c4778ed546f1f3a6	empirical analysis of the effect of ehealth on medical expenditures of patients with chronic diseases		This paper aims to evaluate empirically the effect of eHealth in Ni- shi-aizu Town, in Fukushima Prefecture, based on the mail survey to the resi- dents and their receipt data of National Health Insurance from 2006 to 2007. Samples were divided into two groups: users and non-users, and the effects were analyzed in comparison of medical expenditures of two groups. Particularly what kind of diseases eHealth in this town is effective to reduce medical expenditures is focused. The targets are four chronic diseases such as heart diseases, high blood pressure, diabetes, and strokes. Panel data analysis is employed to estimate the monetary effect of eHealth in reduction of medical expenditures of users with these diseases. As a result, eHealth is verified to provide the positive effect to heart diseases, high blood pressure, and diabetes among four diseases. These re- sults provide evidence for policy such as reimbursement from the medical insur- ance to eHealth.

8ed1725a0ac1dc8090bc3b8ca1d15ecd5e7f0db6	the effects of egocentric and allocentric representations on presence and perceived realism: tested in stereoscopic 3d games	egocentric representation;sense of presence;perceived manipulation;allocentric representation;dual mode model;perceived realism	Recently, stereoscopic 3D technologies have come to be used widely in various applications including movies and computer games. Stereoscopic 3D is defined as that which provides visual depth and details by exploiting the stereoscopic vision of the eyes caused by binocular disparity. Prior studies proposed important system features of stereoscopic 3D that may increase the user's sense of presence. However, few studies, either theoretical or empirical, have investigated how these perceived system features affect the user's sense of presence. This study aims to construct a theoretical model that explains the perceived effects of stereoscopic 3D features on sense of presence, and to verify the validity of the model in the 3D computer game domain. The study focuses on spatial representation and perceived realism as important mediating factors between the perceived system features and sense of presence. According to the Dual Mode Model (DMM), two types of spatial representation are crucial for perceived realism and presence: egocentric representation and allocentric representation. Egocentric representation implies representing locations with respect to the particular perspective of the perceiver, while allocentric representation locates reference points outside of the perceiver, regardless of his or her position. Research questions in this study are: How strongly do perceived expression and manipulation features of stereoscopic 3D systems influence spatial representation? How does spatial representation influence perceived realism and presence in a stereoscopic 3D environment? In order to answer these research questions an empirical study was conducted in a controlled lab environment. A total number of 257 users participated in the study and collected data was analyzed by using structural equation modeling with SmartPLS2.0. The findings are as follows: First, both the perceived expression and manipulation features of the stereoscopic 3D system influenced spatial representation, but the perceived expression features had stronger effects than the perceived manipulation features. Second, both egocentric and allocentric representation were found to affect presence. In addition, egocentric representation was found to affect sense of presence both directly and indirectly through perceived realism, whereas allocentric representation contributed a sense of presence only indirectly through perceived realism. This paper concludes by discussing the study's limitations and implications.	stereoscopic video game;stereoscopy	Sangwon Bae;Haein Lee;Hyejin Park;Hanju Cho;Joonah Park;Jinwoo Kim	2012	Interacting with Computers	10.1016/j.intcom.2012.04.009	computer vision	HCI	-48.92340104295231	-52.474296505764706	176477

Integrated care has to be supported by extended communication and cooperation between the involved healthcare establishments' information systems. The required interoperability level goes beyond technical interoperability and simple data exchange as it has been started in the early world of electronic data exchange (EDI). For realising semantic interoperability, series of standards must be specified, implemented and enforced. The paper classifies standards for health information systems needed for enabling practical semantic interoperability.

This can be a challenge in the community setting where care occurs in the patient's home and clinicians do not have the benefit of face-to-face interactions with colleagues. The purpose of this study was to explore the nurses' perceptions of handover and their views on using an electronic application as opposed to their current email system. Nurses completed two surveys, one prior to viewing the application and the second after reviewing the application. Both surveys were analyzed by educational preparation and age to explore whether either factor influenced opinions of handover or the electronic application. Nurses reported that handover was important and standardization of reporting improved their knowledge of their patients' care plan.	care plan;discipline of nursing;email;interaction;patients;review [publication type]	Nicole Michaud-Hamilton;Noreen Frisch;Abdul V.

Learning from the experience of another medical center in Taiwan, Kaohsiung Municipal Kai-Suan Psychiatric Hospital has changed the nursing informatics system step by step in the past year and a half . We considered ethics in the original idea of implementing barcodes on the test tube labels to process the identification of the psychiatric patients. The main aims of this project are to maintain the confidential information and to transport the sample effectively. The primary nurses had been using different work sheets for this project to ensure the acceptance of the new barcode system. In the past two years the errors in the blood testing process were as high as 11,000 in 14,000 events per year, resulting in wastage of resources. The actions taken by the nurses and the new barcode system implementation can improve the clinical nursing care quality, safety of the patients, and efficiency, while decreasing the cost due to the human error.

3c84b8d1ffbfe93635030d846d559f560b1c7fc2	a digital sleep restriction system for insomnia therapy based on sleep window shift negotiation		Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder, characterized by problems with sleep initiation, and/or sleep maintenance. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the current standard intervention. The labor-intensive nature of CBT-I hampers its scalability. Digital CBT-I could be an alternative solution, but the therapeutic feedback is too general and over-simplified at present, especially concerning sleep-restriction, a key component of CBT-I and also a standalone intervention. Here, a novel sleep restriction tool is described with an algorithm based on the negotiation of sleep window shift. The algorithm calculates the best-fitting sleep window from self-recorded sleep logs. The results of our study provided information about the tools' alignment with clinical practice. The future step is to improve the tool based on therapists recommendation, develop a functional prototype and carry out validation studies. Strategies used for this tool could create a new perspective in negotiation with digital therapy systems.	algorithm;bonjour sleep proxy;prototype;scalability	Begum Erten-Uyumaz;Sebastiaan Overeem;Loe M.

Specifically, we describe a smart garment designed to monitor upper body posture that provides vibrotactile notifications at different joint areas in order to remind users to correct their posture. We present the design and evaluation of a related smartphone application that supports shoulder training exercises to treat and prevent shoulder pain. The usability of the system for shoulder training was evaluated positively in a laboratory test (N=17). The effectiveness of the system for posture monitoring was assessed with a field deployment (N=25) in which students working with laptops used the posture monitoring system for a whole day. The results demonstrate the system can help the participants facilitate improving their posture in sedentary work.	activity tracker;emoticon;general-purpose modeling;informatics;iteration;laptop;mobile app;poor posture;precondition;smartphone;software deployment;stepwise regression;systemc;usability;user experience design;wearable computer;wearable technology	Jiachun Du;Qi Wang;Liesbet De Baets;Panos Markopoulos	2017		10.1145/3154862.3154886	computer network;shoulder exercises;human–computer interaction;computer science;software deployment;wearable technology;behavior change;usability;posture correction	HCI	-57.47132886794252	-55.820362598967286	177827

Nowadays, it is becoming an aging society in Taiwan people have irregular life, long-term unhealthy diet, work pressure and other factors to be chronic disease, such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol, and so on. However, most of the dietary recommendation system cannot give the dietary recommendations for patients of chronic diseases. The patients care what foods are edible, but they do not notify whether the nutrients are in balance. Therefore, this study built a diet recommendation system of chronic diseases with an expert knowledge, and gave chronic diseases more convenient and more precise dietary recommendations. In this study, we use ontology, decision tree and Jena to build the recommendation system. The dietary recommendations result is through assessment of dietitians, and verification accuracy is 100%. Therefore, this system of dietary recommendations can provide dietary recommendation of nutrient for patients of chronic diseases to achieve convenient and healthy diet.	algorithm;apache jena semantic web framework;decision tree;decision tree learning;emoticon;expert system;inference engine;information science;ontology (information science);personally identifiable information;recommender system	Rung Ching Chen;Yu-Hsien Ting;Jeang-Kuo Chen;Yu-Wen Lo	2015	2015 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI)	10.1109/TAAI.2015.7407127	alternative medicine;medicine;knowledge management;marketing	AI	-58.093536381230564	-59.30350196153444	177888

In contrast to the conventional model of centralized data contribution, warehousing, and control, we design a self-scaling registry technology for collaborative data sharing, based upon the widely adopted Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) data warehousing framework and the Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) peer-to-peer networking software.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Focusing our design around creation of a scalable solution for collaboration within multi-site disease registries, we leverage the i2b2 and SHRINE open source software to create a modular, ontology-based, federated infrastructure that provides research investigators full ownership and access to their contributed data while supporting permissioned yet robust data sharing. We accomplish these objectives via web services supporting peer-group overlays, group-aware data aggregation, and administrative functions.   RESULTS The 56-site Childhood Arthritis & Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry and 3-site Harvard Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Longitudinal Data Repository now utilize i2b2 self-scaling registry technology (i2b2-SSR). This platform, extensible to federation of multiple projects within and between research networks, encompasses >6000 subjects at sites throughout the USA.   DISCUSSION We utilize the i2b2-SSR platform to minimize technical barriers to collaboration while enabling fine-grained control over data sharing.   CONCLUSIONS The implementation of i2b2-SSR for the multi-site, multi-stakeholder CARRA Registry has established a digital infrastructure for community-driven research data sharing in pediatric rheumatology in the USA. We envision i2b2-SSR as a scalable, reusable solution facilitating interdisciplinary research across diseases.	centralized computing;chronic disease;data aggregation;display resolution;endocrine system diseases;entity name part qualifier - adopted;health information exchange;image scaling;numerous;objective-c;ontology;open-source software;peer-to-peer;policy;registries;rheumatology specialty;scalability;test scaling;web service	Marc D.

ad3f4db0c551647ab8f7df65442676c9d210dbf3	designing technology for older people - the role of technical self-confidence in usability of an inclusive heating control		The ageing population of the UK is providing a large market opportunity for inclusive products and services. Yet older people are often excluded from using new technology due to inadequate consideration of their needs during the design process. This study focused specifically on including older people (aged 50-80) in the testing of a novel heating control interface under development. Recent studies have used two scalar methods to assess self-confidence; building upon this a technical self-confidence questionnaire was developed and completed by participants prior to attempting a usability task using the prototype. This study found that high technical self-confidence was inversely correlated to successful task performance. The participants who rated themselves as most technically self-confident were not successful in completing the task. Whereas, participants that rated themselves less confident had greater success completing the task. In general older people reported high levels of technical self-confidence and they were found to be willing to engage with the technical prototype. This highlights the high expectations of the older users group to be able to effectively engage with new technological systems. Designers should aim to instil further confidence amongst older users and provide systems that both support and include older people.	usability	Nicola Combe;David Harrison;Hua Dong	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39238-2_6	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;social psychology	HCI	-61.98748028287758	-53.30783662741652	178054
a34bb1ecc82ffb2736598d9f5e34b4d1932996b8	health care performance monitoring using an inpatient reference process model and clinical kpis		Health care processes are nowadays heavily dependent on Information Technology (IT). On the other side, assessing a higher quality of health care to patients has become increasingly important. Effective health care processes are thereby heavily dependent on a comprehensive IT-support. Therefore, a thorough understanding about both the hospital IT-systems and clinical pathways is required, to identify quality problems. Improving quality of care through process performance measurement in hospitals and the identification of bottlenecks in performed workflows is thereby a promising concept. On this account we propose a novel approach based on an inpatient reference process model aiming a standardized and automated retrieval of quality and performance metrics along the clinical pathways of time-critical diseases in the context of various clinical standards and systems.	mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;process modeling;process optimization;window of opportunity	Eva Gattnar;Okan Ekinci;Vesselin Detschew	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-29262-0_5	medicine;nursing;medical emergency	SE	-57.10888219624028	-62.19287244477523	178166

These assessments, often carried out by specialized physicians, can be complicated by wrong expectations or defensive attitudes of disability benefit claimants. It is hypothesized that empowerment of these claimants will enhance the physician-patient relationship by shifting claimants from a passive role to a more active and constructive role during disability assessments. Furthermore, empowerment of claimants may lead to a more realistic expectation and acceptance of the assessment outcome among claimants and may lead to a more accurate assessment by the physician.   METHODS/DESIGN In a two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT), 230 claimants will be randomized to either the intervention or control group. For the intervention group, an interactive website was designed http://www.wiagesprek.nl using an Intervention Mapping procedure. This website was tested during a pilot study among 51 claimants. The final version of the website consists of five interactive modules, in which claimants will be prepared and empowered step-by-step, prior to their upcoming disability assessment. Other website components are a forum, a personal health record, a personal diary, and information on disability assessment procedures, return to work, and coping with disease and work disability. Subjects from the control group will be directed to a website with commonly available information only. Approximately two weeks prior to their disability assessment, disability claimants will be recruited through the Dutch Workers Insurance Authority (UWV). Outcomes will be assessed at five occasions: directly after recruitment (baseline), prior to disability assessment, directly after disability assessment as well as 6 and 16 weeks after the assessment. The study's primary outcome is empowerment, measured with the Vrijbaan questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include claimants' satisfaction, perceived justice, coping strategy, and knowledge. A process evaluation will also be conducted.   DISCUSSION This study evaluates the effectiveness of an interactive website aimed at empowerment of disability claimants. It is hypothesized that by increasing empowerment, the physician-patient relationship may be enhanced and claimants' satisfaction and perceived justice can be improved. Results are expected in 2010.

2d25c0dd66ac741c466b10cc871f4542b5b85484	dispositional resistance to change and hospital physicians' use of electronic medical records: a multidimensional perspective	change	Although electronic medical records (EMR) adoption by health care organizations has been widely studied, little is known about the determinants of EMR individual use by physicians after institutional adoption has taken place. In this study, the determinants of inpatient physicians’ continuous use of EMR were studied. Four dimensions of EMR use were analyzed: use intensity, use extent, use frequency, and use scope. A web-based survey was administered to physicians at a large university hospital; respondents filled out a survey with questions relating to their EMR use, attitude, beliefs, work style, and dispositional resistance to change. Structural equation modeling was carried out to analyze the relationship between these factors. Physicians were found to differ substantially in the scope, extent, and intensity of their EMR use. Their attitude toward EMR use was associated with all use dimensions. Dispositional resistance to change was negatively related to perceived ease of use and with perceived usefulness both directly and through the mediation of compatibility with preferred work style. Time loss was negatively related to both perceived usefulness and attitude toward EMR use. Implications for research and practice are discussed.	excalibur: morgana's revenge;structural equation modeling;usability;web application	Oded Nov;William Schecter	2012	JASIST	10.1002/asi.22602	computer science;variance	HCI	-62.3809798802026	-63.21715189980049	178561

e9a7673ef5deb0846b0f8f2b6e6f4598fbb7ab9b	internet-based intervention for secondary and tertiary prevention of depressive symptoms		Depression is one of the most disabling psychological disorders worldwide. A very important challenge today consists on addressing the issue of depression from a preventive perspective. A growing body of research supports the efficacy of Internet-based treatments. We have developed an Internet-based program (Smiling is Fun) with the objective of helping people in prevention of depression and anxiety symptoms. It is based on classical cognitive behavioral techniques, such as behavioural activation, and also includes other positive psychological strategies to improve coping ability and positive mood. We applied this intervention program in people who had to cope at least with one stressor in their life producing interference (secondary prevention) and also in people who had to cope at least a stressor and met the diagnosis of an emotional disorder (ED) (tertiary prevention). All participants had minimal to moderate depressive symptoms. The principal objective of the present work is to present the data about the efficacy of this Internet-based intervention as a secondary and tertiary prevention tool comparing both groups.	internet	Adriana Mira;Juana Breton-López;Azucena García-Palacios;Rosa María Baños;Cristina Botella	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-32270-4_23	emotional disorder;mood;the internet;stressor;coping (psychology);clinical psychology;anxiety;tertiary prevention;cognition;psychology	HCI	-57.53325319662476	-53.51594722234089	178787
62cbe5863a117ed8b41660e421cfb80135fb8b39	visualization of order set creation and usage patterns in early implementation phases of an electronic health record		Robust order set catalogs are considered to be a vital part of a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) implementation. Tools and processes for building, localizing, and maintaining these content sets in a centralized repository are important in facilitating the knowledge management lifecycle. Collectively, these order sets represent a significant investment of effort and expertise in capturing and distributing best clinical practice throughout an enterprise. In order to address an important gap of understanding how order sets are both created and used in practice in a current EHR installation, we have developed tools to analyze how order sets are used and customized in clinical practice. In this paper, we present the capabilities of these tools. We further characterize early development patterns in our enterprise order set catalog in early phases of a system-wide vendor EHR rollout. We present data that show how personalized order sets (favorites) are authored and then used in clinical practice.

Today the translation of NGS technology to (cancer) diagnostics and therapeutics is widely anticipated. In this paper we give an overview of design, user experience and usability (DUXU) requirements for NGS applications with a special focus on clinical and diagnostic settings and describe a data driven GUI and visualization framework for a NGS based clinical decision support system (DSS). In such a DSS it is hard to oversee the huge amount of information, especially if given only in textual form. To overcome this we developed a visual language for electronic health records (EHR) for navigation within a case and comparison of medical cases.	clinical decision support system;communications satellite;graphical user interface;requirement;throughput;usability;user experience;visual language	Heimo Müller;Robert Reihs;A.

We examine the use of features such as temperature, relative humidity, influenza severity, day/night shift, federal holidays and the presence of new residents in predicting daily hand hygiene compliance. The results suggest that colder temperatures and federal holidays have an adverse effect on hand hygiene compliance rates, and that individual cultures and attitudes regarding hand hygiene exist among facilities.	file spanning;night shift;predictive modelling;terminator 2: judgment day	Michael T.

In this work, we present a different approach for large-scale use of DICOM SR in telemedicine networks using structured vocabularies as its foundation, resulting in a reliable, efficient and data mining ready application applied in a real world telemedicine network. This approach is applied in a large-scale network where 60 physicians report daily an average of 400 reports; resulting in more than 80,000 reports written and stored in the last nine months.

For the system to deliver benefits, it must support nursing tasks and be seamlessly integrated into the nursing workflow. To identify whether and how an EHR system can do this most effectively, direct observation was conducted in a residential aged care home on nurses' use of EHR for wound care. The work processes of wound care and its documentation were investigated. Problems in the use of EHR were identified: 1) functional deficiencies of the EHR system which included a lack of functions to remind nurses of the existence of a wound chart, unavailability of an existent function when needed and a lack of sufficient detail in the information provided; 2) a lack of mobile devices to allow nurses to access the EHR system at the point-of-care, resulting in nurses using paper for point-of-care documentation. The findings suggest that continuous improvement in both the EHR system and its management is required to achieve integration of people, task, process and technology for the optimal benefits of EHR.	cognitive dimensions of notations;curve fitting;documentation;manuscripts;mobile device;unavailability;benefit	Siyu Qian;Ping Yu	2014	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-427-5-130	intensive care medicine;medicine;nursing;emergency medicine	HCI	-58.97704910759194	-62.21032483573309	180101

BACKGROUND Customized feedback coupled with active learning in a simulator has been shown to be an effective means of significantly improving the intersection scanning behavior of older drivers. However, the long-term effect of such training has not been established.   METHOD Older drivers from the active learning and control groups from Romoser and Fisher were invited to participate in a 2-year follow-up field drive in their own vehicle starting at their home. Secondary looks, defined as looking away from the path of the vehicle while entering the intersections toward regions to the side from which other vehicles could appear, were recorded.   RESULTS Two years after their training, older drivers in the active learning group still took secondary looks more than one and a half times as often as 2009 pretraining levels. Control group drivers saw no significant change in performance over the 2-year period.   CONCLUSION Customized feedback and active learning in a simulator is an effective strategy for improving the safe driving habits of older drivers over the long term. It provides drivers a means by which to reincorporate previously extinguished behaviors into their driving habits.   APPLICATION These results can guide the development of older driver retraining programs that could have the potential to reduce intersection crashes.	active learning (machine learning);behavior;behaviorial habits;drug vehicle;feedback;intersection of set of elements;learning disorders;neoplasm metastasis;simulation;simulators;saw (device)	Matthew R.

The typical examples are hospital information system (HIS) and picture archiving and communication system (PACS), which computerized the management procedure of medical records and images in hospital. Because these systems were built and used in hospitals, doctors out of hospital have problems to access them immediately on emergent cases. To solve these problems, this paper addressed the realization of system that could transmit the images acquired by medical imaging systems in hospital to the remote doctors’ handheld PDA’s using CDMA cellular phone network. The system consists of server and PDA. The server was developed to manage the accounts of doctors and patients and allocate the patient images to each doctor. The PDA was developed to display patient images through remote server connection. To authenticate the personal user, remote data access (RDA) method was used in PDA accessing the server database and file transfer protocol (FTP) was used to download patient images from the remove server. In laboratory experiments, it was calculated to take ninety seconds to transmit thirty images with 832 × 488 resolution and 24 bit depth and 0.37 Mb size. This result showed that the developed system has no problems for remote doctors to receive and review the patient images immediately on emergent cases.	24-bit;archive;authentication;cellular phone;computation (action);data access;download;emergence;experiment;file transfer protocol;handheld game console;hospital information systems;information system;instrumentation (attribute);medical imaging;ninety;patent ductus arteriosus 1;patients;personal digital assistant;picture archiving and communication system;recommended daily allowances;record management system;remote database access;server (computer);server (computing)	SangBock Lee;Taesoo Lee;Gyehwan Jin;Juhyun Hong	2008	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-008-9153-9	data access;embedded system;code division multiple access;file transfer protocol;computer science;operating system;mobile device;management system;multimedia;picture archiving and communication system;world wide web;computer security;medical record	Mobile	-51.90696268348264	-61.18413579805812	180162

The increasing of the related health care costs lead to the limits of affordability of health care systems. Building Health networks and standardization of clinical processes are the main trend facing these challenges. Actually, the main instrument for documentation and managing of clinical processes are Clinical Pathways (CPs). They allow to transfer evident knowledge in practice and they are the central point of clinical quality management. In contrast, Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) aggregate the evident medical knowledge in a compact form to support physicians in their practice. In the paper analyze the model-driven development of CP for a health network. Therefore, we work out problems of integration. Finally, the paper shows aspect for a model-based integration of CPGs in CPs. These findings are proofed with the help of the documentation of the regional stroke-network called SOS-NET.	aggregate data;algorithm;central pattern generator;clinical decision support system;data validation;documentation;gene regulatory network;knowledge management;model-driven engineering;programming language;reference model	Hannes Schlieter;Werner Esswein	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15961-9_30	quality management;reference model;software engineering;process modeling	HCI	-52.23551558451108	-65.52151320986283	180191

METHODS A prospective, quantitative survey design was used to collect data from quasi-randomly selected clusters of 25 rural health facilities in 5 of the 36 states in Nigeria over a 2-month period from June to July 2010. A total of 200 maternal and child health workers were included in the survey, and the data were analyzed using a modified theory of acceptance model (TAM).   RESULTS There was no significant difference between ICT knowledge and attitude scores across states. There were significant differences in perceived ease of use (P<.001) and perceived usefulness scores (P=.001) across states. Midwives reported higher scores on all the constructs but a lower score on endemic barriers (which is a more positive outcome). However, the differences were only statistically significant for perceived usefulness (P=.05) and endemic barriers (P<.001). Regression analysis revealed that there was no interaction between worker group and age. Older workers were likely to have lower scores on knowledge and attitude but higher scores on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Lastly, we found that worker preference for ICT application in health varied across worker groups and conflicted with government/employer priorities.   CONCLUSIONS Although the objective of this study was exploratory, the results provide insight into the intricacies involved in the deployment of ICT in low-resource settings. Use of an expanded TAM should be considered as a mandatory part of any pre-implementation study of ICT among health workers in sub-Saharan Africa.		Lanrewaju Jimoh;Muhammad Ali Pate;Li Lin;Kevin A.

During a 3-month period, surveys were given to all adult outpatients undergoing computed tomography. The survey asked 4 questions: (1) Do you own a computer?, (2) If you own a computer, does it have Internet access?, (3) If you do not own a computer, do you have access to a computer with Internet capabilities?, and (4) If we provide helpful information regarding preparation for and the conduct of various radiological procedures on the Internet, would you use it? Four hundred surveys were collected. Two hundred one of the respondents (50.3%) owned a computer; 189 of the 201 (94.0%) had Internet access on their computer or had access to another computer with Internet capabilities. One hundred ninety-nine of the 400 respondents (49.8%) did not own a computer, 57 of these (28.6%) had access to a computer and the Internet. Of the 246 of those with Internet access, 205 (83.3%) indicated that they would use a website that provided helpful information regarding radiological examinations. The Internet is an excellent resource for educational information for patients about various radiological procedures. This study showed that 61.5% of patients had access to the Internet, and 83.3% of these would use such a site. It is likely that these numbers will increase with the rapid growth of the Internet and the steadily increasing number of homes with computers.	arabic numeral 100;ct scan;computer;computers;information source;internet access;ninety nine;outpatients;patients;radiology;web site;x-ray computed tomography	Karen M.

There is evidence of a strong relationship between familial risk factors and epilepsy, as well as associations with substance use. The goal of this study was to explore the interactions between familial risk factors and substance use based on structured data from the family and social history modules of an electronic health record system for adult epilepsy patients. A total of 8,957patients with 38,802 family history entries and 8,822 substance use entries were gathered and mined for associations at different levels of granularity for three age groupings (>18, 18-64, and ≥65 years old). Our results demonstrate the value of an association rule mining approach to validate knowledge of familial risk factors. The preliminary findings also suggest that substance use does not demonstrate significant association between social and familial risk factors for epilepsy.	association rule learning;electronic health record system;electronic health records;epilepsy;family history domain;interaction;mental association;mined;patients;women's health services;nervous system disorder	Yan Wang;Elizabeth S.

Increasing evidence suggests that many DM patients have poor adherence with prescribed medication therapies, impacting clinical outcomes. Patientsu0027 barriers to medication adherence and the extent to which barriers contribute to poor outcomes, however, are not routinely assessed. We designed a dashboard for an electronic health record system to integrate DM disease and medication data, including patient-reported barriers to adherence. The dashboard was pilot tested at multiple ambulatory clinics to examine whether integrated electronic tools can support patient-centered decision-making processes involving complex medication regimens for DM and other chronic diseases. During pilot testing, we encountered several challenges when engaging patients and clinicians in using the dashboard as well as a portal used to gather self-reported psychosocial information directly from patients. In this paper we explore those challenges and suggest methods for better supporting the adoption and use of e-health technologies to improve care delivery processes as well as health outcomes for populations like diabetic patients.

In this study we investigate the impact of a VH’s conversational mistakes in the context of persuasion. Users interacted with a VH that told persuasive information, and they were given the option to use the information to complete a problem-solving task. The VH occasionally made mistakes such as not responding, repeating the same answer, or giving an irrelevant reply. Results indicated that a VH who makes conversational mistakes is capable of social influence. Individual differences also shed light on the cognitive processes of users who interacted with error-prone VHs. We discuss the implications of these results with regard to VH design.	cognitive dimensions of notations;problem solving;relevance;virtual actor	Yuqiong Wang;Peter Khooshabeh;Jonathan Gratch	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40415-3_30	psychology;artificial intelligence;communication;social psychology	HCI	-52.02002191396972	-52.84984890987294	180929

Such a development fosters the usage of those devices for various purposes, including health care as a prominent example. Mobile health (mHealth) is a subfield of electronic health (eHealth) that refers to the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile devices. A specific concern for mHealth is the limitation of power supply for the mobile devices, since interruptions on power supply can result in critical situations. This paper proposes analytical models to identify the mean time of one life cycle of the battery, and thus identify the average battery lifetime considering some device utilization characteristics. We evaluate the impact of both network connectivity (local and wide areas) and communication protocols (Polling, Long polling, WebSockets, and XMPP) on the discharging rate, and subsequently on the lifetime of batteries with different power capacities. We observed a noteworthy impact of these factors on battery usage and, thus, on mHealth applications. We use a hierarchical modeling approach that enables efficient representation of system complexity and provides accurate results for planning the autonomy of mobile devices in an mHealth context.	mobile device	Jean Araujo;Rubens de S.

Because of the time needed for the culturing of infectious agents, final hardcopy culture results will often be available too late to have a significant impact on early antimicrobial therapy decisions, vital in infectious disease management. The clinical microbiologist therefore reports to the clinician clinically relevant preliminary results at any moment during the diagnostic process, mostly by telephone. Telephone reporting is error prone, however. Electronic reporting of culture results instead of reporting on paper may shorten the turnaround time and may ensure correct communication of results. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the implementation of electronic reporting of final microbiology results on medical decision making.   METHODS In a pre- and post-interview study using a semi-structured design we asked medical specialists in our hospital about their use and appreciation of clinical microbiology results reporting before and after the implementation of an electronic reporting system.   RESULTS Electronic reporting was highly appreciated by all interviewed clinicians. Major advantages were reduction of hardcopy handling and the possibility to review results in relation to other patient data. Use and meaning of microbiology reports differ significantly between medical specialties. Most clinicians need preliminary results for therapy decisions quickly. Therefore, after the implementation of electronic reporting, telephone consultation between clinician and microbiologist remained the key means of communication.   CONCLUSIONS Overall, electronic reporting increased the workflow efficiency of the medical specialists, but did not have an impact on their decision-making.	clinical decision support system;cognitive dimensions of notations;communicable diseases;disease management;handling (psychology);medical decision making;medical specialities;semiconductor industry;structured analysis;infectious agent	Marjan J.

INTRODUCTION Older adults face a much higher risk of sudden illness/injury and are the age group with the largest percentages of emergent and urgent healthcare visits. Emergency information (health information needed in an emergency situation such as emergency contact information, diagnoses, and advance directives) needs to be maintained and easily accessible to ensure older adults get appropriate care and treatment consistent with their wishes in emergency situations. Current health information technologies rarely take into consideration the emergency information needs of older adults, their caregivers, and emergency responders.   METHODS As part of a larger study we performed in-depth interviews with 90 older adults living in a variety of residential settings (independent living, retirement communities, assisted living) regarding how they manage information about their health. Interview sessions included photos of important health information artifacts. Interviews were transcribed and coded.   RESULTS Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that emergency information is a type of health information that older adults frequently manage. Participants differed in whether they practice emergency planning (e.g. the preparation and continued management of emergency information), and in whether they involve others in emergency information and emergency planning. Despite its importance, emergency information was often not up-to-date and not always kept in locations readily apparent to emergency responders.   CONCLUSION Emergency information, such as emergency contact information, diagnoses, and advance directives, is a type of health information that older adults manage. Considering emergency information in the design of health information technologies for older adults could address some of the barriers and support the facilitators to emergency planning and information management.	brain injuries;community;description;emergence;independent living;information sciences;information management;information needs;interviews;large;morphologic artifacts	Anne M.

The aim of this paper is to explore issues that promote the development and implementation of patient-centered care services for the elderly. An exploratory case study approach is applied to a e-Health monitoring service that was developed and piloted in 38 homes for the elderly in Sweden and the Netherlands. The unit of analysis, concept of 'value-in-use', was used in order to determine how pilot participants felt about a service of this kind benefiting them the most. The findings were then translated into actionable considerations for implementing organizations. The results indicate a need for active participation, technical support infrastructure, mobility demands, and an extension of the concept of trust in e-Health services. The knowledge presented in the study is important for decisions makers, public organization strategists, and policy writers.	health services;patients;technical support;benefit	Bertil Lindenfalk;Vivian Vimarlund	2017	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-830-3-151	engineering management;pathfinder;engineering	HCI	-60.21814603031838	-59.48541654626238	181539

This development requires a high acceptance of users to the presence of mobile services in various usage contexts. In an exploratory focus-group-interview approach (n = 63), this research investigates usage motives as well as barriers, which are perceived by users of wireless mobile technologies. In order to understand the impact of specific usage contexts, in which mobile services are applied, an ICT context was contrasted to a medical service context. Outcomes show that acceptance factors are neither static nor independent from the specific usage or service context in which a technology is applied. Rather, acceptance reveals to be a product of individual usage motivations, situation-specific evaluations, and individual user profiles.	acceptance testing;focus group;user profile	Katrin Arning;Sylvia Gaul;Martina Ziefle	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16607-5_3	knowledge management;multimedia;business;world wide web	HCI	-62.431085526220286	-54.605868168023285	181562

Currently, numerous smartphone applications are capable of tracking medication adherence through patient-generated data (PGD), but few are integrated with the electronic health record (EHR). Integration of medication adherence PGD into the EHR can give both healthcare providers and patients increased insight into patterns of missed doses, effects on vital signs, and correlation with side effect symptomology to inform healthcare decisions. We propose the generation of a medication adherence """"vital sign"""", a score calculated based upon the patient's reported doses taken collected through a smartphone application and streamed into the EHR on a daily basis. We also propose the creation of Patient Health Reports that incorporate relevant patient history, information from previous visits, and the medication adherence scores to give providers a comprehensive view of patients' health prior to clinic visits. These features are intended to incorporate PGD into clinical care to inform decision making in way that streamlines patient visits, reduces healthcare costs, and improves health outcomes."""	acute myocardial infarction;crew resource management, healthcare;decision making;electronic health records;mobile app;patient visit;patients;smartphone;streaming media;vital signs	Jane Wang;Shannon Wongvibulsin;Katharine Henry;Saki Fujita	2017	AMIA ...

Self-management, therefore, has been long suggested as an integral solu- tion of diabetes treatment (1) which requires patients to adopt strained lifestyle modifications (e.g., balancing diets and frequent monitoring of blood glucose) (2, 3). With the proliferation of smart devices, this study proposes a theoretical framework as an important guideline for designing and prototyping a life- changing mobile platform for a next-generation diabetes self-management. It revolutionises the interaction between patients and their smart phone with a high degree of media richness and social connectivity for better health management success.	self-management (computer science)	Hoang D.

To succeed in this, a quality process is necessary for quality management. To set it up, it is necessary to have different piloting tools. Data collection of effective information is one of these tools. It is necessary to be able to process the data quickly in order to answer the various demands rapidly. This project consists in proposing the possibility of declaring different dysfunctions and incidents by a simple formula integrated into the intranet services of the hospital for the medical, nursing and administrative staff. This should lead to quality management of the medical units.	intranet;public-private sector partnerships;women's health services	Franck Le Duff;S. Daniel;B.

Two experiments were conducted to investigate whether a facilitative effect will occur in the judgment of causal strength. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to learn causal strength in a situation where the target cause and context independently produced the effect. The intervention group could manipulate the state of the cause, which was later presented to the observation group (i.e., yoked-control procedure). The results demonstrated that participants made similar evaluations for the target cause, but not for the context. Experiment 2 was designed to examine whether different estimations were because of facilitation or bias in which participants undervalue other causes. The results provide support for a facilitative effect, but suggest that the improvement with intervention may be limited to the estimation of weak causal strength.	causal filter;causality;experiment	Motoyuki Saito;Tsuneo Shimazaki	2014			psychology;applied psychology;developmental psychology;social psychology	HCI	-53.85003595771572	-53.18574986815092	182529

In this study, the effects of eco-driving training on different driving behaviors in start, stop, speed choice and no-idling from different levels of training, from receiving only static information (EDUCATION) to guided practicing (COACHING after EDUCATION), were thoroughly evaluated and compared. The drivers’ comprehensibility with eco-driving information was examined through eco-driving questionnaire surveys. The results indicated that EDUCATION alone was effective to improve driver’s comprehensibility with the basic concepts of eco-driving, to reduce the percentages of vehicle idling and to help drivers to avoid rapid starts slightly. EDUCATION alone did not significantly improve the driving behaviors of stop and speed choice, while COACHING after EDUCATION was found to enhance the effectiveness of these two elements of eco-driving. COACHING after EDUCATION did not introduce much additional benefit for more fuel-efficient starting pattern. In addition, eco-driving training led to more consistent driving behavior as evidenced by smaller standard deviation values on all measures related to fuel efficiency.	driving simulator	Yiping Wu;Xiaohua Zhao;Jian Rong;Yunlong Zhang	2017	Cognition, Technology & Work	10.1007/s10111-017-0432-4	engineering;simulation;fuel efficiency;coaching;driving simulator	HCI	-54.282023383382025	-56.18521513786119	182744

Self-management is important to achieving diabetes treatment goals and can be a tool for lifestyle changes for patients with Type 2 diabetes. The autoimmune disease Type 1 diabetes requires a more intensive management than Type 2 - thus more advanced functionalities is desirable for users. Both simple and easy-to-use and more advanced diaries have their respective benefits, depending on the target user group and intervention. In this poster we summarize main findings and experience from more than a decade of research and development in the diabetes area.

Providing timely feedback to healthcare workers on the level of adherence can improve process measures. However, it is challenging to present data on adherence to repetitive time-sensitive tasks in a clear manner.   OBJECTIVES We used inpatient glucose monitoring as a test case to explore the feasibility of using visualizations to communicate adherence to repetitive scheduled tasks to healthcare workers.   METHODS We selected four candidate plots that represented distribution across time: histogram, probability density function plot (pdf plot), violin plot and cumulative density function plot (cdf plot). Doctors and nurses involved in inpatient diabetes care in a tertiary hospital were invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire that measured self-reported baseline knowledge, performance, and perception towards the visualizations. Performance was assessed by determining if a participant was able to correctly identify visualizations representing protocol adherence. We also assessed the perception of usability of these visualizations for monitoring protocol adherence. Binomial regression models were used to identify factors associated with overall performance and perception. Logistic regression models with generalized estimating equation were used to compare performance and perception between visualizations, and identify effect modifiers.   RESULTS A total of 57 doctors and nurses completed the questionnaire. Participants were most familiar with histogram (87.7%), followed by cdf plot (61.4%), pdf plot (40.4%), and violin plot (7%). However, the percentages of participants who identified non-adherence using these plots were generally lower, ranging from 29.8% to 40.4%. Participants' perception of usability ranged from 14% to 17.5% across these visualizations. More favorable perceptions were found among participants with baseline knowledge for two or more visualizations (adjusted odds ratio: 3.21; 95%CI: 1.29, 7.96; p-value: 0.012) and having identified two or more non-adherent visualizations (adjusted odds ratio: 4.23; 95%CI: 1.95, 9.16; p-value: < 0.001).   CONCLUSIONS Adherence to repetitive time-sensitive tasks can be presented in the form of visualizations. However, nurses' and doctors' knowledge and understanding of these visualizations are generally poor. This may influence their perception of usability of these plots. Therefore, these visualizations need to be implemented in tandem with training on their interpretation, to enhance the usefulness of these plots in motivating quality improvement.

BACKGROUND Rest breaks are effective in avoiding an accumulation of fatigue during work. However, little is known about individual differences in rest-break behavior.   METHOD In Study 1, the association between rest-break intention and the daily number of rest breaks recorded over 4 consecutive workdays was determined by generalized linear model in a sample of employees ( n = 111, 59% females). In Study 2, professional geriatric nurses ( n = 95 females) who worked over two consecutive 12-hour day shifts recorded well-being (fatigue, distress, effort motivation) at the beginning and the end of their shifts. The effect of rest-break intention on the change of well-being was determined by multilevel modeling.   RESULTS Rest-break intention was positively associated with the frequency of rest breaks (Study 1) and reduced the increase of fatigue and distress over the workday (Study 2).   CONCLUSION The results indicate that individual differences account for the number of breaks an employee takes and, as a consequence, for variations in the work-related fatigue and distress.   APPLICATION Strengthening rest-break intentions may help to increase rest-break behavior to avoid the buildup of fatigue and distress over a workday.	12-hour clock;buildup;distress (novel);fatigue;fifty nine;generalized linear model;intention - mental process;inventory;multilevel model;representational state transfer;tree accumulation	Gerhard Blasche;Sanja Pasalic;Verena-Maria Bauböck;Daniela Haluza;Rudolf Schoberberger	2017	Human factors	10.1177/0018720816671605	differential psychology;psychology;simulation;distress;social psychology	HCI	-59.13351302647978	-53.54296854899334	183152

However, little is known about the mechanisms that maintain this behavior. We recruited a sample of 308 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk labor market. Participants responded to standardized measures of problematic smartphone use, and frequency of smartphone use, depression and anxiety and possible mechanisms including behavioral activation, need for touch, fear of missing out (FoMO), and emotion regulation. Problematic smartphone use was most correlated with anxiety, need for touch and FoMO. The frequency of use was most correlated (inversely) with depression. In regression models, problematic smartphone use was associated with FoMO, depression (inversely), anxiety, and need for touch. Frequency of use was associated with need for touch, and (inversely) with depressive symptoms. Behavioral activation mediated associations between smartphone use (both problematic and usage frequency) and depression and anxiety symptoms. Emotional suppression also mediated the association between problematic smartphone use and anxiety. Results demonstrate the importance of social and tactile need fulfillment variables such as FoMO and need for touch as critical mechanisms that can explain problematic smartphone use and its association with depression and	amazon mechanical turk;fear of missing out;smartphone;the turk;zero suppression	Jon D.

Unfortunately, methods for real-time assessment and proactive health management of diet do not currently exist. There are only minimally successful tools for historical anal- ysis of diet and food consumption available. In this paper, we present an integrated database system that provides a unique perspective on how dietary assessment can be accomplished. We have designed three interconnected databases: an image database that contains data generated by food images, an ex- periments database that contains data related to nutritional studies and results from the image analysis, and finally an enhanced version of a nutritional database by including both nutritional and visual descriptions of each food. We believe that these databases provide tools to the healthcare commu- nity and can be used for data mining to extract diet patterns of individuals and/or entire social groups.	cessation of life;data mining;description;dietary assessment;image analysis;published database;real-time transcription	Marc Bosch;TusaRebecca E Schap;Fengqing Zhu;Nitin Khanna;Carol Jo Boushey;Edward J.

The present study examined skill acquisition and retention of a non-injured population performing a complex, sensorimotor navigation task in the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN). Seventeen subjects participated twice weekly for 6 weeks, with follow-up visits at 3-month intervals for 1 year. Subjects performed a navigation task, where they drove a virtual boat through a scene using weight shifting and body movement. Subjects improved over time on all outcome measures. A significant effect was observed for visit number on total score, time to complete the task, number of buoys navigated successfully, and number of penalties incurred. Task-specific training in IVREs may be effective for operational skills training and rehabilitation of injured populations by employing tasks that lead to long-term retention.	caren (system);enterprise application integration;immersion (virtual reality);maximal set;population;virtual reality	Amanda E.

519c3ef4a5bfd6df0ebfeb8e6d5643f562add066	contextual constraints for the design of patient-centered health it tools		Technologists are constantly working to improve clinical practice by developing new health information technology (Health IT) tools, yet may not always consider the context of how these tools may be used. Patient preferences can vary widely as a result of demographics, health conditions, physical limitations, and personal inclinations, with healthcare providers having to adapt clinical encounters to better suit patient needs. Health IT tools, too, need to be agile across different healthcare contexts, with each stakeholder's specific needs in mind. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and limitations associated with the design and automation of contextually sensitive devices in the healthcare environment. We target the various contexts in which health information is presented in patient-provider encounters, and discuss contextual constraints that may apply to the aforementioned situations. In addition, we present a number of suggestions for informational constraints and the design of informational tools in these settings so that patient and provider informational needs can be better met in clinical communication contexts.	agile software development;crew resource management, healthcare;demography;information sciences;patients;informational	Michael J.

This is largely due to falling fertility and rising longevity phenomena, as well as due to the proliferation of the aging population all over the world. In this paper we present a number of leading edge audio and video processing technologies, which can be exploited to build robust ambient assisted living applications for elderly groups. In particular, we discuss application requirements aiming at alleviating the cognitive decline of elderly users and present audio and video processing components that can essentially fulfill these requirements. We emphasize on technologies such as automatic speech recognition, speaker identification, face detection, person tracking, face identification, and demonstrate how mature versions of these technologies can be appropriately customized to give a significant boost to AAL applications for senior citizens. The challenges, solutions and ideas within this paper are part of the EU project HERMES, which aims at providing an integrated approach to cognitive care, based on assistive technology that reduces age-related decline of cognitive capabilities.	atm adaptation layer;assistive technology;face detection;norm (social);pervasive informatics;requirement;speaker recognition;speech recognition;video processing	Vasileios Mylonakis;John Soldatos;Aristodemos Pnevmatikakis;Lazaros Polymenakos;Alexander Sorin;Hagai Aronowitz	2008		10.1145/1389586.1389620	embedded system;computer vision;simulation;artificial intelligence;automatic speech;multimedia;computer security	HCI	-60.35725214951254	-54.84332653005569	184773

The use of exercise-promoting application software may improve clinical outcomes for cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. The study aimed to compare and analyze the functions of the top 10 exercise Android Apps which had more than 1,000,000 downloads from the main four Android App stores in mainland China. The results showed that most of these popular apps had pedometer, exercise plan preset, user data presentation, user encouragement and community sharing functions while a few of them had exercise video clips or animation support and wearable devices. Given these data, the conclusion is that these popular apps fulfill some of the functions recommended by medical guidelines, however, lack of some functions such as pre-exercise risk assessment, the exercise intensity recording, specific instructions by professionals, and monitoring functions for CVD patients.	android;animation;cardiovascular diseases;exercise;exercise, aerobic;microscopic observation:prid:pt:xxx:nom:india ink preparation;patients;pedometer;promotion (action);risk assessment;video clip;wearable technology	Yanling Wang;Liu Sun;Yahong Xu;Qian Xiao;Polun Chang;Ying Wu	2015	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-564-7-1024	wearable technology;application software;multimedia;exercise intensity;android (operating system);animation;telemedicine;aerobic exercise;pedometer;medicine	HCI	-56.650661867975295	-58.62189560337921	185030

However, transferring healthcare research data from one institution to another can increase the risk of data privacy and security breaches.   METHODS A working group of multi-site research programmers evaluated the need for tools to support data security and data privacy. The group determined that data privacy support tools should: 1) allow for a range of allowable Protected Health Information (PHI); 2) clearly identify what type of data should be protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); and 3) help analysts identify which protected health information data elements are allowable in a given project and how they should be protected during data transfer. Based on these requirements we developed two performance support tools to support data programmers and site analysts in exchanging research data.   RESULTS The first tool, a workplan template, guides the lead programmer through effectively communicating the details of multi-site programming, including how to run the program, what output the program will create, and whether the output is expected to contain protected health information. The second performance support tool is a checklist that site analysts can use to ensure that multi-site program output conforms to expectations and does not contain protected health information beyond what is allowed under the multi-site research agreements.   CONCLUSIONS Together the two tools create a formal multi-site programming workflow designed to reduce the chance of accidental PHI disclosure.	clinical use template;data security;error-tolerant design;health insurance portability and accountability act;health services research;information privacy;lead programmer;numerous;phi-base;personal health information;population;programmer device component;protected health information;requirement;workplan	Christine E.

6e093d2c353ab769f06809af920c6493a5a1f002	intelligent image management in an integrated telemedicine services network	integrated telemedicine services network;intelligent image management	In recent years, advances in information technology and telecommunications have acted as catalysts for significant developments in the sector of health care, creating the new application domain of health telematics. These technological advances have had a particularly strong impact in the field of medical imaging, where film radiographic techniques are gradually being replaced by digital imaging techniques, and this has provided an impetus to the development of integrated hospital information systems which support the digital transmission, storage, retrieval, analysis and interpretation of medical images [1]. The provision of added-value telemedicine and, in the case of diagnostic imaging, teleradiology services is a natural outcome of the above developments and support the remote access to information contained in the medical record of a patient, remote medical consultation and patient monitoring, and in some cases the remote delivery of health care [2]. All these functions of an integrated telemedicine services network are very important and are currently the subject of vigorous investigation. This presentation is primarily concerned with the first, and implicitly the second. In particular, the presentation will consider issues arising from the need to efficiently and intelligently manage multimedia patient data with emphasis on the management of image data, which constitutes by far the largest volume of data currently generated by different hospital departments. This is a practical issue, whose successful resolution will undoubtedly have a strong impact on the timely and effective delivery of health care services and, therefore, patient outcome.		Stelios C.

It does this by providing: adaptable software which enables interoperable data access; a step-wise and flexible integration strategy, allowing new information to be overlaid on top of existing annotations and context graphs; and through the provision of asynchronous messaging to support rapid integration of new analysis mechanisms. This work is illustrated through the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study. Addama is being used within a TCGA analysis center to identity new therapeutic intervention approaches by equating clinical outcomes with underlying genomic effects across heterogeneous data from approximately 20,000 patient samples. Addama supports projects like the TCGA through accepting that biological understanding continually changes, and that the rapid integration of new information and analyses is an essential requirement when supporting research.

However, long-term healthcare is labor intensive. To alleviate the possible social costs associated with manpower and physical resources, we propose an evidencebased caring system which can inconspicuously and automatically monitor the health status of the elderly by continuously analyzing their real-life long-term living patterns deduced from activity recognition. In this way, caregivers can get hold of the behavior changes even the elderly is not under caregivers' supervision. Moreover, we adopt a persuasive policy to provide timely reminders and encourage the elderly to achieve a healthier life. In the primary stage, we do preliminary experiments in a nursing room. Based on the experiment, we conduct several interviews aiming to improve our system in the next phase.	persuasive technology	Yu Chun Yen;Ching-Hu Lu;Yi Chung Cheng;Jing Siang Chen;Li-Chen Fu	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21666-4_27	simulation;medicine;nursing;social psychology	HCI	-59.08517534616282	-55.457801735963685	185973

Smarcos focuses on interusability of multi-device embedded and networked services. The work presented here is devoted to the development of context-aware personal coaching service systems that give users personalized feedback to empower them to make healthy lifestyle choices. Our target group consists of diabetes type II patients and the lifestyle intervention concerns situated coaching with respect to physical activity and medicine compliance. We describe the stages in the process, starting with user studies. We describe the ontology that supports the interoperability and the knowledge design to support the coaching strategy, the architecture of the prototype system and the interactions that users have with the system through various (mobile) devices in various contexts. The ultimate aim of the system is to increase the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions by means of interusable coaching interactions. We conclude with an outlook and discussion on the effectiveness of a human-like (autonomous) character as a relational agent representing a virtual coach across devices and situations.	autonomous robot;embedded system;interaction;interoperability;microsoft outlook for mac;personalization;prototype;situated;usability testing	Rieks op den Akker;Randy Klaassen;Tine Lavrysen;Gijs Geleijnse;Aart van Halteren;Henk Schwietert;Marloes van der Hout	2011			service delivery framework;work in process;mobile device;physical fitness;service system	HCI	-59.16647496479072	-57.412902311056754	185998

Smartphone users can choose from tens of thousands of applications, designed to prevent or manage certain diseases, or induce behavior change to improve health and life quality in general. However, the value of most applications remains unclear, as they stop short from documenting adherence to medical evidence. We review the fundamental mobile health challenges and propose Mobile Quality of Life Lab (mQoL), a mobile health platform which addresses the identified challenges and leverages recent developments to facilitate the deployment of much-needed longitudinal, multidimensional, evidence-based studies that are minimally obtrusive for the participants, yet provide high value in terms of the collected datasets, as well as potential for behavior change towards improving Quality of Life.	holism;mhealth;mobile operating system;smartphone;software deployment;software documentation	Vlad Manea;Katarzyna Wac	2018		10.1145/3267305.3267549	software deployment;human–computer interaction;self-assessment;behavior change;quality of life;computer science	HCI	-59.493185922862466	-56.42064758572085	186223
e9ba0178223fde9f15a73e1048bfccbcbfdf1700	application of grid technology for automated detection of sleep disordered breathing		Sleep related breathing disorders (SRBD) represent a major disease in sleep medicine. For diagnosis and therapy control, extensive overnight investigations are required, encompassing long-term measurement of multiple biosignals in specialized sleep disorders centers. To date, evaluation of the examination is realized by comprehensive visual inspection of the data by an expert. Therefore, many approaches have been made to facilitate diagnosis, among them automated analysis of the ECG signal. In this article, we present a grid based infrastructure for computer aided diagnosis of SRBD, accessible for distributed users. As the analysis algorithms itself are still in a validation phase, and the Grid infrastructure is not approved for clinical applications, the application is currently used for research purposes only. But as important aspects of data-security, accessibility from protected environments, usability and fault-tolerance are already covered, the implementation is a solid base for further enhancement of the platform and paves the way for a sustainable service grid for sleep medicine.

Recently, several commercial software tools for waveform acquisition became available. Although commercial products and even turnkey systems are now being marketed as simple and effective, the performance of those solutions is not known. The additional expense upfront may be worthwhile if commercial software can eliminate the need for custom software and hardware systems and the associated investment in teams and development. We report the development of a computer system for long-term large-scale recording and storage of multichannel physiologic signals that was built using commercial solutions (software and hardware) and existing hospital IT infrastructure. Both numeric (1 Hz) and waveform (62.5-500 Hz) data were captured from 24 SICU bedside monitors simultaneously and stored in a file-based vital sign data bank (VSDB) during one-year period (total DB size is 4.21TB). In total, vital signs were recorded from 1,175 critically ill patients. Up to six ECG leads, all other monitored waveforms, and all monitored numeric data were recorded in most of the cases. We describe the details of building blocks of our system, provide description of three datasets exported from our VSDB and compare the contents of our VSDB with other available waveform databases. Finally, we summarize lessons learned during recording, storage, and pre-processing of physiologic signals.	commercial software;computer;critical illness;database;engineering;hertz (hz);level of measurement;numbers;patients;preprocessor;solutions;systems design;terabyte;turnkey;vital signs;waveform;contents - htmllinktype;intensive care;teams	Anton Burykin;Tyler Peck;Timothy G.

In this paper we focus on factors that facilitate or inhibit user acceptance of pervasive computing in healthcare. We present selected findings of the research project dasiaPerCoMed - Pervasive Computing in Healthcarepsila. The project is based on two case studies in pre- and post-clinical healthcare. In the first study, the potential of pervasive computing technologies for the treatment of acute cardiovascular diseases is investigated, in the second case study, the potential for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) is evaluated. A qualitative user acceptance analysis of the two case studies shows the following results: the main factor of user acceptance is the perceived medical usefulness. Furthermore, acceptance is strongly inhibited if data privacy or if subjective norms are violated. Usability only presents a decisive factor of acceptance if problems with usability reduce the perceived usefulness.	information privacy;ubiquitous computing;usability	Mandy Scheermesser;Hannah Kosow;Asarnusch Rashid;Carsten Holtmann	2008	2008 Second International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare	10.4108/ICST.PERVASIVEHEALTH2008.2539	usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;world wide web;ubiquitous computing;health care	HCI	-61.385179468441045	-61.152868585843855	186746

A non-laboratory, paper-based CVD risk assessment chart tool has previously been developed to make screening more affordable in developing countries. Task shifting to community health workers (CHWs) is being investigated to further scale CVD risk screening. This study aimed to develop a mobile phone CVD risk assessment application and to evaluate its impact on CHW training and the duration of screening for CVD in the community by CHWs.   METHODS A feature phone application was developed using the open source online platform, CommCare(©). CHWs (n=24) were trained to use both paper-based and mobile phone CVD risk assessment tools. They were randomly allocated to using one of the risk tools to screen 10-20 community members and then crossed over to screen the same number, using the alternate risk tool. The impact on CHW training time, screening time and margin of error in calculating risk scores was recorded. A focus group discussion evaluated experiences of CHWs using the two tools.   RESULTS The training time was 12.3h for the paper-based chart tool and 3h for the mobile phone application. 537 people were screened. The mean screening time was 36 min (SD=12.6) using the paper-base chart tool and 21 min (SD=8.71) using the mobile phone application, p=<0.0001. Incorrect calculations (4.3% of average systolic BP measurements, 10.4% of BMI and 3.8% of CVD risk score) were found when using the paper-based chart tool while all the mobile phone calculations were correct. Qualitative findings from the focus group discussion corresponded with the findings of the pilot study.   CONCLUSION The reduction in CHW training time, CVD risk screening time, lack of errors in calculation of a CVD risk score and end user satisfaction when using a mobile phone application, has implications in terms of adoption and sustainability of this primary prevention strategy to identify people with high CVD risk who can be referred for appropriate diagnoses and treatment.	brain–computer interface;cardiovascular diseases;disease ontology;disease screening;experience;feature phone;focus group;maxima and minima;mobile app;mobile phone;multistage interconnection networks;open-source software;projection screen;randomness;risk assessment;women's health services;community health discipline	Sam Surka;Sisira Edirippulige;Krisela Steyn;Thomas A Gaziano;Thandi Puoane;Naomi Levitt	2014	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.06.008	simulation;health promotion;medicine;young adult;focus group	HCI	-62.00794829321454	-63.017738943009675	186874

Our underlying hypothesis is that ICTs can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public health delivery mechanisms. In our framework, we include the ICT factors of accessibility, quality, affordability, applications, and institutional efficiency and sustainability. The public health delivery is represented by the changes in the indicators of immunization coverage, TB infection, sanitation, undernourishment, life expectancy, mortality rate, and health care expenses. Results indicate in most cases ICT factors have a significant correlation to a country‘s delivery of public health over and above a country‘s income level. The ―Accessibility‖ ICT factor contributes to improved delivery for nearly all of the public health indicators. This is followed by ―ICT Applications.‖ Increased ICTs usage leads to increased health care expenditure. Our findings are useful at the country level for informing policy decisions regarding the nature and extent of investment in ICT infrastructure for the delivery of public health. We do caution that merely investing in more ICTs does not imply an automatic improvement in public health. Rather, ICTs have the potential to improve the delivery process.

One of parents' main responsibilities is to manage their children's health. Through their actions of caring for their children, parents want to know they're doing the best job to ensure their children's well being.  Unfortunately, much of the time this responsibility is a challenge-particularly for busy, dual-income parents-because it involves the collection, organization, retrieval, and transfer of information between many people in many different contexts. In our user research with dual-income parents they shared their experiences of forgetting to give medication, and of both not having an easy way of recording information and not having the information they needed when communicating with childcare and healthcare providers.  Smart home technology appears to offer a promise to easy this situation for parents; however, the HCI community has only investigated healthcare in the home with a focus on elders. To better understand this opportunity area we conducted a user-centered design project looking at the management of children's by their parents.	care-of address;human–computer interaction;user research;user-centered design	Hee Young Jeong;Sun Young Park;John Zimmerman	2008		10.1145/1358628.1358835	user-centered design;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;medical history;interaction design	HCI	-60.429131348727445	-57.596448133177375	186910

For example, decision support tools can help clinicians reduce misdiagnoses during the interpretation of the Electrocardiogram (ECG), by providing a reference to ECG background, causes, features, waves and segment data. As a potential solution to these problems an ECG interpretation clinical decision support tool (CDSS) was constructed. The prototype consisted of a web based user interface connected to a SQL database of thirty-eight identified ECG diagnostic interpretations. Benefits and risks of using a clinician friendly web based query-builder interface to perform SQL queries on the database against traditional ECG interpretation methods were identified. Ethical reasons for using the web based decision support system software to assist ECG interpretation are discussed. Potential benefits in using the ECG interpretation CDSS across computer /tablet/smart-phone devices to assist the clinician's diagnosis decision making process are identified.	clinical decision support system;prototype;sql;smartphone;user interface	Ronald Cloughley;Raymond R.

This is done through the use of a computerised booking system. After a 2004 pilot study, Choose and Book was formally launched in January 2006. This is the first study of patient experience of Choose and Book since then.   METHODS A questionnaire survey of reported experience of choice over the time, data and place of appointment, carried out in a National Health Service hospital in London. 104 patients at their first outpatient appointment completed the questionnaire, consisting of a consecutive series of patients referred through Choose and Book and a sample referred through the conventional booking system.   RESULTS Among the Choose and Book patients, 66% (31/47; 95% CI 52 to 78%) reported not being given a choice of appointment date, 66% (31/47; 95% CI 52 to 78%) reported not being given a choice of appointment time, 86% (37/43; 95% CI 74 to 94%) reported being given a choice of fewer than four hospitals in total and 32% (15/47; 95% CI 20 to 46%) reported not being given any choice of hospital.   CONCLUSION In this study, patients did not experience the degree of choice that Choose and Book was designed to deliver.	books;fail-safe;outpatients;patients;united states indian health service;universal quantification	Judith Green;Zoe McDowall;Henry W.

Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is an effective medication to help patients quit smoking tobacco. Yet, 18% of adults in the United States still smoke cigarettes. With advancements in health technology and improved features within electronic health record (EHR) systems, it is crucial to understand how differences in EHR features influence the prescribing of NRT. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 174 primary care practices to better understand how EHR features, including drug reference databases in EHRs, were associated with NRT prescribing at a practice level. Regression models were created to understand NRT prescribing patterns among clinics with varying EHR features and found that practices using an EHR with a drug reference database were 2.3 times more likely to view NRT as a high priority for treating smokers. Use of NRT in primary care differs significantly in relation to the capability of a clinic’s technology. Clinics with more EHR features, specifically EHR drug reference databases, favored NRT. Our study suggests that pharmacotherapy could become the preferred activity in smoking cessation treatment, as EHR-integrated drug reference database prevalence increases.		Thomas M.

It is carried out in the Central Sterilization Supply Department (CSSD). Failures during reprocessing can endanger patients' safety and increase costs. The benefits of an assistance system helping workers in preventing failures are therefore obvious, whereas challenging requirements arise through process complexity, legislation, integration and hygiene restrictions. We propose an assistance system that supports the worker in the unclean area of a CSSD under these requirements. It provides a user interface for context-aware guidance and collection of process relevant data from the worker. 'Virtual touches' fulfill the hygiene requirements and are realized with a depth camera and a projected user interface. Business process models control the workflow and maintain a valid database for quality assurance and worker guidance. We evaluated the system with a user study focusing on failure prevention, task completion time and usability.	business process;database;failure;requirement;usability testing;user interface	Stefan Rüther;Thomas Hermann;Maik Mracek;Stefan Kopp;Jochen J.

Extensive research has shown that social networks differ by sex and has attempted to explain these differences either through structural availability or individual preferences. Addressing the limitations of these explanations, we build on an increasing body of research emphasizing the role of cognition in the formation and maintenance of networks to argue that males and females may exhibit different strategies for encoding and recalling social information in memory. Further, because activating sex roles can alter cognitive performance, we propose that differences in recall may only or primarily appear when respondents are made aware of their sex. We explore differences in male and female network memory using a laboratory experiment asking respondents to memorize and recall a novel social network after receiving either a sex prime or a control prime. We find that sex significantly impacts social network recall, however being made aware of one's sex does not. Our results provide evidence that differences in male and female networks may be partly due to sex-based differences in network cognition.		Matthew E.

However, existing research, indicate that EHRs have recorded greater quantity of bad data instead of improving the quality of data. The reasons for this is not exactly clear. Accordingly, this paper takes a broader socio-technical approach to explore the issues in more detail. The paper explores the relationship between EHRs and quality at the Pentecost Hospital Madina-Ghana by using an interpretative research approach. The result of our study indicates that the EHRs introduced at the hospital have so far had limited effect on data quality and that context-related challenges are the major pitfalls identified in the study. Based on a socio- technical approach the paper discusses the need to; consider users and technology as intertwined, how technology changes practice and how it formalizes roles and responsibilities in the process, why it requires collaborative work and why realistic goals as opposed to exaggerated expectation.	data quality;sociotechnical system	Samuel Darko-Yawson;Gunnar Ellingsen	2016		10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.039	peer review;data quality;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;management science;operations research	EDA	-61.10383970803486	-62.176018041287506	187812

For this reason healthcare organizations and providers are asking their staff to interact more often with computer systems during their working day. Hospitals and healthcare centers are nowadays sufficiently rich in their computing infrastructure to handle the internal administrative and clinical processes for their inand outpatients [1, 2]. In addition the rapid development in communications through fixed or mobile networks has opened new ways in computer-based health systems by providing the capability of providing healthcare services remotely [3, 4]. In modern telemedicine systems, medical data may be captured and transmitted, received or updated, stored or retrieved, securely and in realtime by users in geographically distributed and organizationally independent organizations or distant locations.	information systems;information system;real-time computing;simulation	Ilias Maglogiannis;Charalabos Skianis;James G.

The physician is able to register and review patient-related information through a user-friendly web-based interface, assign medication treatment plans, examination plans etc. The patient receives notifications about the treatment plan through several means, including Short Message Service (SMS) and e-mail. The common web-based space shared by the patient and the physician enables the bidirectional exchange of observations or comments about the treatment, publishing additional guidelines augmenting the treatment outcome, reporting side-effects etc. The implementation of the service is based on MS SQL Server Notification Services technology and we believe that is has the potential to improve adherence to the medication plans, especially in the case of long-term therapy.	conformance testing;email;microsoft sql server;sql server notification services;surface web;usability;web application	Nikolaos Riggos;Ilias Skalkidis;George Karkalis;Maria Haritou;Dimitris Koutsouris	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-74161-1_17	computer science;database;multimedia;world wide web;side effect;short message service	Web+IR	-58.28156309367062	-64.20669974051825	189165

Half of the employees received some ergonomics training. Results showed that 25-40% reported the ergonomic products were somewhat or much less comfortable to use, and around the same proportion found them somewhat or much more comfortable to use. Between 25-40% of employees reported frequent neck, shoulder, back and right wrist discomfort and many reported that these symptoms interfered with work activities. There was clear evidence that levels of discomfort increased over the course of the work day. Employees were equally split on whether the office changes helped or hindered their work productivity. Comparison of the trained versus untrained employees showed that training reduced the problems associated with their new workstations. Overall, the results suggest that ergonomic products alone may not compensate for problems associated with smaller workstations.

Since most patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) suffer life threatening adverse events [1-2], there must be an effective and efficient communication protocol that facilitates workflow among the clinical team. In this paper, we studied the significance of communication at the ICU and ways to improve it. Through literature review, we identified and analyzed current research methods in order to locate the areas that require further exploration. Based on research methods review, we proposed our methodology to further comprehend the communication framework at the ICU which enables identifying factors that enhance and limit the communication process. This research proposes that through data collection, first hand and from literature, more communication factors can be identified. Through better understanding, we aim at building a knowledge base which will serve as the foundation to our long term goal of building an ontology-driven educational tool. Such a tool will be used to educate clinicians about miscommunication issues and as a means to improve it. The ultimate goal of our research is through improving clinical communication to reduce medical errors and costs and hence, enhance patient safety.	communications protocol;imperative programming;international components for unicode;knowledge base;knowledge representation and reasoning	Saif Sherif Khairat;Yang Gong	2010		10.1145/1882992.1883102	medicine;knowledge management;nursing;biological engineering	HCI	-57.315779788732094	-61.62987232323289	189773

Towards the development of Guadalajara's Smart city there are several Mobile Mammography Service units. These units are able to provide the citizens the results of their Breast Cancer test in a period from 3 to 6 months, but in many cases, this period of time could be a problem for the women under test. In this work, an Information Technology (IT) prototype that focuses in accelerating the process for breast cancer detection is proposed. This prototype is an application powered by IBM Watson's Cloud Cognitive Services. Also a customized methodology that facilitates the integration of leading edge technologies is described in this article. This methodology was used in order to develop the s-Health solution presented. The project is being developed due to a partnership between the Smart Cities Innovation Center at Universidad de Guadalajara and IBM, also the development of this prototype is being validated by a potential collaboration under legal review, with the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Mexico.	cloud computing;prototype;smart city;watson (computer)	Manuel Avalos;Pablo Salazar;Victor M.

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have been shown to improve clinical performance and patient outcomes, but the failure rate of such systems is still over 50 percent. To contribute to a wider understanding of issues surrounding CDDS acceptance, we performed a systematic review of studies that evaluated CDSS implementations in clinical care to determine the factors that are associated with acceptance of CDSS by physicians. The factors that were found were categorized according to the HOT-fit framework. The mapping of factors concerning CDSS acceptance on the HOT-fit framework revealed gaps in each domain of the framework and showed that research has mainly focused on human and technology factors and a lack of research on organizational factors. A potential area of research could thus be studying the organizational factors that may influence CDSS acceptance.	categorization;clinical decision support system;failure rate;patients;systematic review	Ellen Kilsdonk;Linda W.

We present, OPAD, a clinical decision support system in the field of the medical care of osteoporosis. We utilize clinical information from international guidelines and experts in the field of osteoporosis. Physicians are provided with user interface to insert standard patient data, from which OPAD provides instant diagnostic comments, 10-year risk of fragility fracture, treatment options for the given case, and when to offer a follow-up DXA-evaluation. Thus, the medical decision making is standardized according to the best expert knowledge at any given time. OPAD was evaluated in a set of 308 randomly selected individuals. OPAD's ten-year fracture risk computation is nearly identical to FRAX (r = 0.988). In 58% of cases OPAD recommended DXA evaluation at the present time. Following a DXA measurement in all individuals, 71% of those that were recommended to have DXA at the present time received recommendation for further investigation or specific treatment by the OPAD. In only 5.9% of individuals in which DXA was not recommended, the result of the BMD measurement changed the recommendations given by OPAD.	cns disorder;care-of address;clinical decision support system;computation;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;medical decision making;osteoporosis;randomness;user interface device component	Bjarni V.

8d83acf8bb3b186339de1621748b69f5ab762aaf	knowledge sharing in online cancer survivorship community system: a theoretical framework		Innovative uses of technology to support patient to patient or patient to clinician knowledge sharing are emerging through professional health institutions and communities that take advantage of social networking technologies. Although successful online health communities exist, many such communities do fail. Researchers have stated that the reason for these failures is due to the lack of evidence-based, scientific guidance in building and managing online communities. Knowledge sharing among participants is important for the survival of online health communities. The most difficult and challenging task for online health communities is to understand why certain participants share knowledge in a sustained manner while others do not. The purpose of this study is to identify the conditions that will predict and prescribe a successful online health community. We propose a theoretical model that presents computer self-efficacy, system capabilities, patient characteristics, appropriation support as determinants of knowledge sharing. We also propose that knowledge sharing affects satisfaction, and frequent usage of online health community networks within online cancer survivorship community.	online community;theory	Usamah Zagaar;Souren Paul	2012			simulation;knowledge management;environmental resource management	HCI	-61.94145249247127	-59.501528157106996	190267

However, involving patients in their own treatment is challenging. Clinics often lack appropriate tools for information sharing and collaboration between patients and audiologists. In addition, patients may find it difficult to relate the treatment provided at the clinic to the hearing and hearing aid problems they experience in their daily listening environments. To help remedy these challenges we have investigated how hearing aid users and audiologists look on the idea of using shared tabletop interfaces, in combination with simulated sound environments, to support active patient participation during hearing aid adjustments. We have conducted three workshops in which hearing aid users and audiologists have co-designed low-fidelity mock-ups of tabletop interfaces. This paper reports on central design concepts and considerations that emerged through this work, and discusses the main design lessons that can be learned from this.	mock object	Yngve Dahl;Hanne Linander;Geir Kjetil Hanssen	2014		10.1145/2639189.2639221	co-design;multimedia	HCI	-60.01495723775284	-58.66697994722912	190365

Methods: Participants rated the quality of 28 indicators of the guidelines using a 4-point scale, 1 (very poor) to 4(very good). Demographic and professional information was recorded for these physicians after they had taken part in a clinical trial in which they treated 629 patients with angina pectoris according to and not to the guidelines. Rusult: Fifty physician participants completed a questionnaire about the quality of the clinical guidelines. Their mean age was 34.4 years, male was 40%. Among them, 60% participants worked in hospitals of level 2, others in level 3; 36% were residents, attending physicians 22%, associated chief and chief physicians were 20% and 22%, respectively. This guideline, which contained 6 domains and 28 items, was rated as “good”(median score was 3) by these participants. Physicians rated domain 2 (stakeholder involvement) and item 6(corporation among multiple disciplines) as the poorest one in their own groups, respectively. Domain 5(TCM characteristics) and item 14 (No-contradiction-among-contents) was rated as the best one, respectively. In regression models, level 2 hospital was significantly associated with higher score (better rating) assigned by these subjects to Domain 2, and 5, as well as item 6 and total score. The score for higher total score was significantly associated with younger age. Conclusions: The current clinical practical guidelines were “good” basing on a questionnaire survey. Stakeholder involvement and its sub-item corporation among multiple disciplines were the poorest indicators in the guidelines. The level of a hospital in which the appraiser was working was the strongest predictor of perceived evaluation of the guidelines.	cpu cache;kerrison predictor	Danping Xu;Weihui Lu;Liuling Ma;Jianping Wu;Huanlin Wu	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)	10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999354	logistics;traditional chinese medicine	HCI	-61.207888618223656	-65.22033482177443	190700

DESIGN Cross-sectional survey of primary care providers (n = 53) in a large integrated health care organization that recently implemented new medication reconciliation technology.   METHODS Surveys assessed 5 technology-related perceptions (compatibility with work values, implementation climate, compatibility with work processes, perceived usefulness, and ease of use) and 1 outcome variable, ETU. ETU was measured as both consistency and quality of technology use.   RESULTS Compatibility with work values and implementation climate were found to have differential effects on consistency and quality of use. When implementation climate was strong, consistency of technology use was high. However, quality of technology use was high only when implementation climate was strong and values compatibility was high. This is an important finding and highlights the importance of users' workplace values as a key determinant of quality of use.   CONCLUSIONS To extend our effectiveness in implementing new health care information technology, we need parsimonious models that include actionable determinants of ETU and account for the differential effects of these determinants on the multiple dimensions of ETU.	cross reactions;dimensions;ethylenethiourea;health care organization;information sciences;medical device incompatibility problem;medication reconciliation;occam's razor;primary health care;usability	Patricia J.

012328db1d73808723f6227b36e904c71617abb9	trends in european research projects focused on technological ecosystems in the health sector		Over the past decade, the health domain has grown at a fast pace. The stakeholders are not only limited to patients, but also include formal and informal careers, doctors, research institutions and technological solution providers. As such, different technological ecosystems of interconnected health communities have arisen to adopt the best practices to improve the wellbeing and health of patients. In order to identify the lacks and opportunities in this area, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the ecosystems in the health domain, presenting a systematic mapping study of research projects developed in Europe and related to the field. The systematic mapping review was conducted on the AAL Programme, CORDIS and KEEP databases. The paper describes the methodology employed for conducting such a review, and provides an analysis of results that give an overview of the evolution of related European projects until today along with the conclusions obtained from the study.	atm adaptation layer;best practice;database;ecosystem;sensor	Samuel Marcos-Pablos;Alicia García Holgado;Francisco J.

Researchers require systems that provide traceability of information through provenance data capture and management to support their clinical analyses. We present an approach that has been adopted in the neuGRID and N4U projects, which aimed to provide detailed traceability to support research analysis processes in the study of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, but is generically applicable across medical systems. To facilitate the orchestration of complex, large-scale analyses in these projects we have adapted CRISTAL, a workflow and provenance tracking solution. The use of CRISTAL has provided a rich environment for neuroscientists to track and manage the evolution of data and workflow usage over time in neuGRID and N4U.	accessibility;big data;traceability	Richard McClatchey;Jetendr Shamdasani;Andrew Branson;Kamran Munir;Zsolt Kovacs;Giovanni B.

8ffa3164a1b8a529a2f961fd8ec890e17dbd21cd	policy satisfaction for separation of dispensing from medical practices in taiwan: success of the prescription-release information system	system success;healthcare policy;separation of dispensing from medical practice;prescription release information system;policy satisfaction	Although the policy of the separation of dispensing from the medical practice (SDMP) has been promoted by the Department of Health (DOH) in Taiwan for many years, it has never been significantly successful. Instead of transferring prescriptions to the insurance-contracted pharmacy (ICP) in the community, most of the patients still fill their prescriptions in the hospital or clinic. This is because the policy lacks the necessary supporting measures and incentives. Therefore, we propose a prescription-release information system (PRIS) that makes the prescription release more convenient under the governmental healthcare policy. This test-run system is integrated into the hospital information system (HIS) of Sinying Hospital, which allows the outpatient to choose a preferable pharmacy and transfer prescriptions there via the virtual private network (VPN) in a self-guided way. We posit that this PRIS is a major factor in the successful promotion of the SDMP policy. Therefore, a research model is built, and the corresponding survey is administered to validate our hypotheses. The results indicate that most of the respondents are satisfied with the PRIS and the SDMP and that the PRIS concretely supports the prevalence of the SDMP policy. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

8f6e59916f19592f6771d3aa01b101dcc4557973	regaining joy of life: theory-driven development of mobile psychotherapy support systems		This paper addresses the theory-driven design of a mobile health (mHealth) application that supports modern psychotherapy with information communication technology (ICT). It presents the initial stage of a larger multi-disciplinary project involving researchers from clinical psychology and information systems (IS). We derive guidelines for developing ICT that support cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a form of psychotherapy that is well established for the treatment of several mental disorders such as anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorders. Furthermore, we identify core challenges of CBT that can be mitigated with ICT support: patient compliance with therapy homework as well as relapse prevention. These challenges are linked to the theoretical constructs of motivation and continued use intention. As a first step of our multi-disciplinary research-in-progress, we derive five principles and 14 guidelines for the design of an mHealth application supporting CBT before implementing and testing it within our research cluster.	certified broadcast technologist;information system;mhealth	Tillmann Neben;Anna-Maria Seeger;Tommi Kramer;Andrew J.

METHOD We analyzed the inpatient and outpatient revenue data of all general hospitals (212) in South Korea obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Corporation (KNHIC) during the period from 1996 to 1999 using the mixed model for repeated measure data.   RESULTS Analysis of the 4-years' panel data showed that both outpatient and inpatient revenues increased significantly after POE introduction. The hospital characteristics significantly influencing inpatient revenue were the number of beds, number of physicians and the tertiary status of a hospital; whereas those for outpatient revenue were the number of beds, number of physicians, the private status of a hospital, the tertiary status of a hospital and the urban status of a hospital.   CONCLUSION The revenues from both outpatients and inpatients were found to be increased after the introduction of the POE, while controlling for population size, competition, income, hospital location, hospital size, tertiary status and public status.

In the CAFÉ project we aim to provide a web-service enabling ontology-driven comparison of the organizational characteristics of trauma centers and trauma systems. Trauma remains one of the biggest challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Research has demonstrated that coordinated efforts like trauma systems and trauma centers are key components of addressing this challenge. Evaluation and comparison of these organizations is essential. However, this research challenge is frequently compounded by the lack of a shared terminology and the lack of effective information technology solutions for assessing and comparing these organizations. In this paper we present the Ontology of Organizational Structures of Trauma systems and Trauma centers (OOSTT) that provides the ontological foundation to CAFÉ's web-based questionnaire infrastructure. We present the usage of the ontology in relation to the questionnaire and provide the methods that were used to create the ontology.	information sciences;nomenclature;ontology;solutions;trauma centers;web application;web service;wounds and injuries	Joseph Utecht;John Judkins;Mathias Brochhausen;Terra Colvin;J.

We highlight these recent and ongoing research projects and compare this unique paradigm with conventional nonVR techniques by discussion of potential benefits and possible shortcomings. Due to the nature of research, ethical and human factors cannot be over emphasized. We also describe the limitations of VR in the field of practical psychology as media hype has over sold its potential.

However, it is currently unknown whether people with PD would even accept a robot as part of their healthcare processes. We thus conducted a first human-robot interaction study to assess the extent to which people with PD are willing to discuss their health status with a robot. We specifically compared a robot interviewer to a human interviewer in a within-subjects design that allowed us to control for individual differences of the subjects with PD caused by their individual disease progression. We found that participants overall reacted positively to the robot, even though they preferred interactions with the human interviewer.

We consider that the generalization of dental tele-consultations is related to the acceptance of the e-DENT system, as stated by Broens & et al. (2007). This paper proposes a new methodological approach for assessing the perception of a medical procedure, involving the use of technology, for subjects with minor, mild or severe cognitive impairment. Semi-structured interviews, indirect patient observations and non-participant observations have allowed us to highlight the nurses' acceptance of the e-DENT system, the patients' perception of the oral tele-consultation procedure and to describe the induced organizational changes.

The VAS is a method that can be readily understood by most people to measure a characteristic or attitude that cannot be directly measured. VAS is of most value when looking at change within people, and is of less value for comparing across a group of people because they have different sense. It could be argued that a VAS is trying to produce interval/ratio data out of subjective values that are at best ordinal. Thus, some caution is required in handling VAS. We describe VAS as distribution and handle it as new type data in SDA.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect on drug-prescribing behaviour of implementing prescribing guidelines by means of a reactive computer reminder system (CRS).   DESIGN Cluster-randomised controlled trial with an incomplete block design in the south of the Netherlands: 25 GPs (7 GP practices) received reminders about antibiotics and asthma/COPD prescriptions, 28 GPs (7 GP practices) received reminders about cholesterol prescriptions. Prescription guidelines were integrated into the computerised GP information system.   MEASUREMENTS Both performance indicators and prescription volumes were calculated as the main outcome measures. Next to individual volume measure, sum scores were constructed on the volume measures per drug group (antibiotics, asthma/COPD and cholesterol).   RESULTS Variation between GPs turned out to be larger and more skewed than expected. No differences between groups were found for indicators and volumes related to recommendations advocating certain drugs. Although there was a tendency towards clinically relevant results for prescription volumes that were supposed to drop, the difference in sum score between the groups was not significant. For antibiotic prescriptions that were supposed to drop, the sum score for the intervention group was 28.2 (95% CI: 20.8-44.5) prescriptions per 1000 patients per GP, while this was 39.7 (95% CI: 29.7-64.1) for the control group (p 0.2). For prescriptions asthma/COPD that were supposed to drop, the sum score for the intervention group was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.6-2.6) prescriptions per 1000 patients per GP, while this was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-4.3) for the control group (p 0.1). On three specific recommendations (on quinolones for cystitis, corticosteroids for CPOD, and antibiotics for acute sore throat) significant differences were found.   CONCLUSIONS This study turned out to be underpowered due to high inter doctor variation in prescribing behaviour. Nevertheless, computerised reminders sometimes have a favourable effect on restricting certain drugs that are not or no longer indicated in general practice.		Jody D.

In our previous work, we measured the effectiveness of handwriting during a note-taking task in Japanese, and found that the input speed during note-taking was higher by hand than by keyboard. The results also showed that the quality of notes taken by hand was higher than that of notes taken by keyboard, and this might have been due to the higher cognitive load during typing. In addition, observation during the experiment revealed several problems subjects faced in the keyboard input task. To evaluate the significance of these observations, we had to obtain quantitative evidence through further study of participant behavior. Therefore, we repeated the experiment, this time with video analysis of the keyboard subtask. By analyzing the participants’ eye movements and their behavior throughout the keyboard subtask we obtained quantitative evidence to support our findings from the previous study. Here, we describe this experiment and our findings in detail.	computer keyboard;plover;typing;video content analysis	Muhd Dzulkhiflee Hamzah;Shun'ichi Tano;Mitsuru Iwata;Tomonori Hashiyama	2006			simulation;computer science;multimedia;cognitive load;eye movement	HCI	-49.78171669562691	-53.72248976728027	193792
7aa04eda949f7946ae9f8b0072d0c9d23f2e8132	a craft approach to health awareness in children	children s health;craft technology;health visualization;wearable computing	Children in the USA are increasingly at risk for a vast array of health problems due to poor dietary habits and lack of physical activity. In recent years, a burgeoning landscape of wearable and mobile health technologies in the form of activity trackers and fitness applications have focused on addressing this problem. While these solutions have had some measure of success with children, there is also evidence that youngsters are not readily adopting the types of fitness implements that adults find useful. In this paper, we present a computational toolkit that blends craft and health, permitting children to craft their own tangible health visualizations based on data from an accompanying wearable device. We also present the results of an encouraging 2-month study conducted with middle school children. The results suggest that craft could potentially serve as a gateway to healthful thinking in children.	activity tracker;mhealth;wearable computer;wearable technology	Swamy Ananthanarayan;Katie A.

Decision support systems are mainly used as help in this situation. These systems reduce the possibility of risks caused by poor communication. But the decisions and dimensions of the decisions made by nurse manager are still unsolved. The aim of our study was to describe the timeframe of the decisions made by nurse managers in the daily unit operation in perioperative settings. The results indicated that nurse managers made operational and tactical decisions. These operational and tactical decisions happened coincide during the nurse managers shift. The nurse managers were repeatly interrupted in decision-making.	decision making;decision support systems, clinical;decision support techniques;decision support system;interrupt;occur (action)	Eriikka Siirala;Laura-Maria Peltonen;Heljä Lundgrén-Laine;Sanna Salanterä;Kristiina Junttila	2016	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-658-3-864	knowledge management;operations management;perioperative care;workload;decision support system;unit operation;workflow;intensive care medicine;nurse administrator;perioperative;medicine	HCI	-59.28725512999866	-61.11407079363333	194329

This qualitative research, was conducted through: two focus groups and nine personal interviews performed with internal medicine physicians. Collection and analysis of obtained data was carried out by two professionals. It was made by the codification and categorization of data based on a process of constant comparison. The authors agreed upon three main dimensional themes: information, physician-patient/relatives communication, impact of PHR in physician workload. Physicians suggested functionalities and expressed concerns related to the management of sensitive information. As a conclusion we understand that it is crucial to involve physicians along PHR's development. This will help to overcome barriers and will improve adoption chances. Physicians will be directly affected by the implementation of a PHR for inpatients.		Julia Frangella;Gabriela García;Lucila Bruchanski;María I. Smith;Janine Sommer;Romina P. Rapisarda;Daniel R.

However, it is not clear whether off-the-shelf wireless networking will work as well within medical centers as this technology works outside of the medical center. Therefore, we evaluated the coverage of wide-area wireless technology within two representative academic medical centers. The study determined the rate of connectivity by testing both the Palm VII and the Minstrel V modem in a set of locations typically frequented by house staff in their daily activities. Within one hospital, connectivity was 59% for OmniSky service, and 78% for Palm.net. The second hospital's connectivity was over 93% with both devices. Differences in connectivity were likely due to the number of rooms visited with externally exposed walls, the suburban versus urban location of the academic medical center, and the relative location of service transponders. When examined by the Johns Hopkins Clinical Devices Laboratory, both devices were found to operate without interfering with other hospital equipment.	academic medical centers;capsule endoscopy;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;fifty nine;null modem;palmtop pc;real-time locating system;transponder;vii;walls of a building;wireless technology	James M.

The usage of medical data is very important, both administrative or medical point of view. Medically they have the ability to increase the efficiency of decision-making for all health care providers, both in the private and in the public area. It presents how a medical document model can be used nationwide and internationally and how it can facilitate the interoperability of medical data. In order to do that, a medical questionnaire is proposed (a model presentation of health data in a systematic and uniform way) that generates prerequisites standardization documents which represents in fact the patient’s medical history and disease description. Once the questionnaire has been defined (which varies depending on existing medical specialties), the corresponding XML schema is generated that makes computer-computer interaction available.	interoperability	Elena Madalina Rac-Albu;Vlad Ciobanu;Marius Rac-Albu;Nirvana Popescu	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-32689-4_52	interoperability;data mining;database;world wide web	HPC	-55.08660588919031	-62.86143861317885	194759

c8c04a03e3e38ee4ee1acea0f3566d46df3c0750	telerobotic surgery is clinical reality: current experience with telementoring in adults and children		A clinical telepresence surgical system was developed at The Johns Hopkins Bayview Hospital. Using both fiberoptic and coaxial cable, a control room located within the hospital was connected to the telepresence operating room. Systems allowing remote surgical teaching included continuous two-way audio communication, real-time laparoscopic and external video imaging, remote telestration, and remote control of a robotic arm designed to manipulate the laparoscope. Using this system, 27 operations were performed in adults and children under the direction of a remote surgical mentor. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications in this series of cases. All operations were successful. Telementoring was successful in 26 of the 27 cases. In one case, poor positioning of the robotic arm was responsible for a breakdown in the remote surgical teaching process. Operative times for telepresence operations and traditionally mentored cases are compared. In summary, telementoring has proven to be a safe and potentially useful application of telerobotic surgery.	optical fiber;real-time locating system;remote control;robot;robotic arm;telerobotics;telestrator	Steven G.

Two of the engineers were novices who had just begun their work at the hospital a few days before the observation started. Another engineer was an expert who had more than sixteen years of experience.  As a framework of cognitive task analysis, we developed a six gaze metrics that are closely connected with the cognitive aspects in efficient and safe operations of the hemodialysis. Trends of each novice engineer's information acquisition along with learning during a set-up task that is a part of hemodialysis operation were analyzed on the basis of the six gaze metrics. Several issues/implications on the novice engineers' adaptation to the hemodialysis operation task was discussed after the study.	eye tracking;task analysis	Hirotaka Aoki;Satoshi Suzuki	2010		10.1145/1931344.1931357	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication	HCI	-54.64614293505733	-55.8958899804596	195080

However, patients are often unable to select the music pieces that might be helpful for them in a current situation. We are suggesting a self-learning decision support system that allows a patient to answer questions on music anamnesis, is ready for inclusion into an electronic health record, and which enables a therapist to compile a therapeutic music program for the patient at home. Beyond this, the system also suggests appropriate music and duration of listening based on the patient's reported current mental state. In this paper, a concept for such a mobile system for receptive music therapy will be proposed.	cns disorder;compiler;decision support systems, clinical;decision support system;electronic health records;immunologic memory;mental state;music therapy;pain;patients;rap music	Kerstin Denecke	2017	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-830-3-54	psychotherapist;anamnesis;music therapy;medicine	HCI	-56.970904117882405	-56.22882680373236	195109

Thus, new procedures are needed to facilitate research while protecting the confidentiality of patient data and ensuring the integrity of clinical work in the expanding environment of electronic files and databases. We have addressed this problem in a university hospital setting by developing the Tampere Research Archival System (TARAS), an extensive data warehouse for research purposes. This dynamic system includes numerous integrated and pseudonymized imaging studies and clinical data. In a pilot study on asthma patients, we tested and improved the functionality of the data archival system. TARAS is feasible to use in retrieving, analyzing, and processing both image and non-image data. In this paper, we present a detailed workflow of the implementation process of the data warehouse, paying special attention to administrative, ethical, practical, and data security concerns. The establishment of TARAS will enhance and accelerate research practice at Tampere University Hospital, while also improving the safety of patient information as well as the prospects for national and international research collaboration. We hope that much can be learned from our experience of planning, designing, and implementing a research data warehouse combining imaging studies and medical records in a university hospital.	accident and emergency department;archive;automated planning and scheduling;cns disorder;computer file;confidentiality;conflict (psychology);data integrity;data security;database;dynamical system;hospitals, university;information systems;information source;information system;medical imaging;patients;protected health information;regulation;research data archiving;research grants	Tiina Rajala;Sami Savio;Jarkko Penttinen;Prasun Dastidar;Mika Kähönen;Hannu Eskola;Risto Miettunen;Väinö Turjanmaa;Ritva Järvenpää	2010	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-010-9350-1	medicine;data science;data mining;management science	DB	-53.054436614186876	-63.246795986337865	195130

With the increasing power of mobile phones and the recent emergence of personal heart rate monitors, aimed at dedicated amateur runners, there is now a possibility to develop “Persuasive Mobile Health Applications” to promote well being through the use of real-time physiological data and persuade users to adopt a healthier lifestyle. In this paper we present a novel general health monitoring software for mobile phones called Heart Angel. This software is aimed at helping users monitor, record, as well as improve their fitness level through built-in cardio-respiratory tests, a location tracking application for analyzing heart rate exertion over time and location, and a fun mobile-exergame called Health Defender.	emergence;mhealth;mobile phone;population;real-time transcription	Carlos Garcia Wylie;Paul Coulton	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-00413-1_11	simulation;computer science;multimedia;physical fitness;computer security	HCI	-59.10304859023084	-56.29710216071877	195200
7ca4a1cde17f744bd245be6587f3925a3745aa6f	dynamic detection of radical profiles in social networks using image feature descriptors and a case-based reasoning methodology		Nowadays, security forces are challenged by a new type of terrorist propaganda which occurs in public social networks and targets vulnerable individuals. The current volume of online radicalization messages has rendered manual monitoring approaches unfeasible, and effective countermeasures can only be adopted through early detection by automatized tools. Some approaches focus on mining the information provided by social users in the form of interactions and textual content. However, radical users also tend to exhibit distinctive iconography in their profile images. In this work, we propose the use of local image descriptors over profile images to aid the detection and monitoring of online radicalization processes. In addition, we complement this approach with an interaction-based formula for risk assessment, so candidate profiles can be selected for image-analysis based on their interaction with confirmed radical profiles. These techniques are combined in the context of a Case-Based Reasoning framework which, together with the feedback provided by the end-user, enables a continuous monitoring of the activity of radical users and eases the discovery of new profiles with a radicalization agenda.	case-based reasoning;social network	Daniel López Sánchez;Juan Manuel Corchado;Angélica González Arrieta	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-01081-2_15	artificial intelligence;security forces;machine learning;radicalization;computer science;social network analysis;data science;visual descriptors;continuous monitoring;case-based reasoning;social network;countermeasure	AI	-57.657192975447934	-58.000744953179804	195294

But, based on research conducted by United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), the result of DTC DNA tests was questionable. Therefore, we offer to develop a knowledge based system for analyzing human's SNP. The knowledge based will use validated SNP public database as the knowledge base.

The focus was on limiting the frequency of forwarding a message ridiculing a peer. Experimental research on adolescent students was conducted in conditions simulating online contact. The results confirmed the significance of cognitive empathy activated immediately prior to decision making on limiting involvement in reinforcing cyberbullying behavior. The long-term impact of empathy was markedly limited.

Despite significant progress, """"basic emotions"""" (e.g., anger, disgust, sadness) have been emphasized in AC at the expense of other non-basic emotions. The present paper questions this emphasis by analyzing data from five studies that systematically tracked both basic and non-basic emotions. The results indicate that engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration (all non-basic emotions) occurred at five times the rate of basic emotions after generalizing across tasks, interfaces, and methodologies.

The potential use of technology by care staff has not been a focus of researcher attention. The work reported here provides initial steps in addressing that gap, considering both the design requirements for this population and presentation of early work on a software system for use by care staff. We describe the development of a software tool for use by care staff, called Portrait, and report two studies related to factors affecting technology use by this population. The results of this research are promising, with Portrait being very positively received by care managers and care staff. Use of this software in a care home for over a month indicated continued use, with care staff returning to the system throughout the test period. The contributions of this research are the identification of factors important in working with a care staff population, the introduction and evaluation of a novel software tool for care staff in residential homes, and the highlighting of potential benefits of technology in assisting care staff.	programming tool;requirement;software system	Gemma Webster;Vicki L.

Over a 1-year period, Duke University Hospital engaged in the challenging task of enhancing an established computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system to address the unique medication dosing needs of pediatric patients.   METHODS An advanced dosing model (ADM) was designed to interact with our existing CPOE application to provide decision support enabling complex pediatric dose calculations based on chronological age, gestational age, weight, care area in the hospital, indication, and level of renal impairment. Given that weight is a critical component of medication dosing that may change over time, alerting logic was added to guard against erroneous entry or outdated weight information.   RESULTS Pediatric CPOE was deployed in a staggered fashion across 6 care areas over a 14-month period. Safeguards to prevent miskeyed values became important in allowing providers the flexibility to override the ADM logic if desired. Methods to guard against over- and under-dosing were added. The modular nature of our model allows us to easily add new dosing scenarios for specialized populations as the pediatric population and formulary change over time.   CONCLUSIONS The medical needs of pediatric patients vary greatly from those of adults, and the information systems that support those needs require tailored approaches to design and implementation. When a single CPOE system is used for both adults and pediatrics, safeguards such as redirection and suppression must be used to protect children from inappropriate adult medication dosing content. Unlike other pediatric dosing systems, our model provides active dosing assistance and dosing process management, not just static dosing advice.	computerized physician order entry system;decision support systems, clinical;decision support system;formulary (model document);gestational age;information systems;information system;order management system;patients;pin grid array;population;renal insufficiency;requirement;zero suppression	Jeffrey M.

3cea33fa9b1a858fac6278db8f39919aafa300e6	a reliable and secure virtualized clinical assistance tool for doctors and patients		Virtual clinic is a web based application where the patients can consult with doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other medical professionals regarding their symptoms in a virtual environment. The virtual clinic does not require the physical presence of the patient at the time of assessment if the disease does not require it as its mandatory requirement for diagnosis. In this paper, we propose the functional and non-functional requirements and design for such a clinic. These requirements were gathered based on the input provided by medical practitioners through interviews which had semi structured and open ended questions regarding disease assessment in accordance with their experience. Our special consideration during the development of the virtual clinic application was that the services are provided and the data is stored in a reliable, secure, and efficient manner. © 2016 The Authors.

In this paper we present a process to integrate the data gathered by therapeutic machines of our industrial partner used for treatment of neurological and orthopedic disorders. These devices are deployed in numerous physical therapy clinics worldwide. During a therapy session they collect and store precise measurements of various physical parameters. As they have been used for many years, they hold a large and valuable set of data. One goal of the project was to develop a mechanism for transferring those dispersed data to a central server where they can be analyzed by a team of specialists in medical statistics. Another goal was to develop a software that permits to define flexibly various statistics by those specialists, without a necessity of having IT skills. In addition to the system permitting to collect and analyze the therapy session data, an application has been developed to implement a standardized quality of life questionnaire (EuroQol-5D) that allows to compare the results of the therapy using this machine with other therapy methods. As an incentive to cooperate in the program, the patient receives a personal report about his/her therapy progress, possibly benchmarked against the progress of other patients suffering from the same disease. This report also can be flexibly configured by a software developed in this project. In this way, valuable data, previously dormant on isolated systems worldwide, can be reused to validate and improve the therapy for the benefit of the patients.	benchmark (computing);legacy system;server (computing)	Jan Sliwa;Emmanuel Benoist	2013	2013 Sixth International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering	10.1109/DeSE.2013.23	alternative medicine;medicine;biological engineering	DB	-54.299730992466834	-61.49878547260551	195854

Methods: The architecture proposed is based on an open software platform and standard personal computing hardware. This provides great flexibility to develop new applications over the underlying infrastructure or to integrate new devices, for instance to monitor a broad range of vital signs in those cases where home monitoring is required. Results: An actual system as a proof-of-concept was designed, implemented, and deployed. Applications range from social network clients to vital signs monitoring; from interactive TV contests to conventional online care applications such as medication reminders or telemedicine. Conclusion: In both cases, the results have been very positive, confirming the initial perception of the TV as a convenient, easy-to-use technology to provide social and health care. The TV set is a much more familiar computing interface for most senior users, and as a consequence, smart TVs become a most convenient solution for the design and implementation of applications and services targeted to this user group. Significance: This proposal has been tested in real setting with 62 senior people at their homes. Users included both individuals with experience using computers and others reluctant to them.	application program interface;clients;computation (action);computer hardware;computers;health care;health services;open architecture;open-source software;personal computer;smart tv;social network;telemedicine;television set	Carlos Rivas Costa;Luis E.

fec261fa1c3ff6e12a6afa8c1b5e2bb0bdfe513c	vrinsole: an unobtrusive and immersive mobility training system for stroke rehabilitation		Stroke is a leading cause of long-term impairment, causing a fatality if not act upon in time. Home-based post-stroke rehabilitation plays an important role in helping patients to regain normal mobility and functionality at their residence. However, existing home-based rehabilitation approaches fail to effectively motivate patients on frequent engagement with exercise to achieve the intended outcome. In this paper, we develop VRInsole, a synthetical solution combining a Smart Insole footwear sensor and virtual reality (VR), targeting lower extremity mobility training in an immersive environment for stroke rehabilitation. Specifically, the motion information collected from the Smart Insole serve as the input for the VR to perform corresponding exercise animations. To prove the feasibility of VRInsole, an experiment is conducted on the recognition of lower extremity motion direction, which achieves an average accuracy of 93.9%.	immersion (virtual reality);smart tv;unobtrusive javascript;virtual reality	Hawkar Oagaz;Anurag Sable;Min-Hyung Choi;Wenyao Xu;Feng Lin	2018	2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)	10.1109/BSN.2018.8329645	animation;training system;computer vision;artificial intelligence;simulation;task analysis;computer science;immersion (virtual reality);rehabilitation;virtual reality;stroke	Mobile	-55.473206768952274	-54.11193347376762	196308

Breakdowns have been identified as the leading cause of adverse events in healthcare, especially in the Operating Room environment. As a result, researchers have started to examine breakdowns in healthcare as emergent dynamics of teamwork. However, the occurrence and consequences of breakdowns related to inter-team processes are yet to be addressed at a fine level of detail. In this paper we seek understanding of breakdowns at the systemic level, and its relevance to design.   OBJECTIVES The objective of this study is to bring forward an in-depth understanding of the impact of breakdowns on the surgical process by expanding the focus of analysis beyond teamwork dynamics, to the level of hospital system processes. This study also aims to examine the implications of such understanding of breakdowns for the design of clinical systems.   METHODS Properties of breakdowns and repairs were inductively derived, and developed into a formal coding scheme, which was applied over a set of observed breakdowns from an elective surgery unit in a North American hospital. Systematic content analysis was employed to quantify qualitative data spanning 79 h of observations, followed by statistical hypotheses testing for relationships between variables of breakdowns and repairs.   MEASURES Breakdown type, theme, tangibility, coordination scale, breakdown lifetime, repair strategy, and repair cost.   RESULTS The results reveal that properties of breakdowns determine properties of repairs. The majority of breakdowns were outside the scope of teamwork--at the inter-team coordination level. The results also demonstrate that breakdowns usually propagate downstream in the surgical process, affecting the work of multiple teams, and the longer they propagate the higher the communication cost associated with the respective repair. The implications are two-fold: in terms of theory we develop a conceptual framework of breakdowns in perioperative work, and in terms of system design we propose a design framework informed by the acquired understanding of breakdowns.   CONCLUSIONS This study achieved an initial understanding of the deep features of breakdowns from a process-oriented perspective, which allowed us to build the groundwork for a theoretical model of breakdowns in perioperative activities and to propose a design approach that tackles breakdowns during early stages of system development. The direct association between breakdowns and repairs can be exploited in both IT-system design and organizational design. The patterns of repair work can inform design so as to provide clinicians with the types of information that will prevent breakdowns from occurring or to mitigate the impact of breakdowns. The results reveal that preventing breakdown propagation should be a prime target in surgical applications design.	asea irb;adverse event;anthony cleaver;automated planning and scheduling;bernhard schölkopf;data collection;disintegration (morphologic abnormality);downstream (software development);elective surgical procedures;emergence;file spanning;gesellschaft für informatik;higgins;human factors and ergonomics;level of detail;manuscripts;operating room;propagation delay;recombinant erythropoietin;regulatory submission;relevance;seventy nine;software propagation;stephanie forrest;subject matter expert turing test;surgical repair;switzerland;systems design;theory;wound healing;interest;teams	Svetlena Taneva;Gudela Grote;Anthony C.

In this project, a relational database was developed for the rheumatic outpatient clinic of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). The primary goal of this database is to collect and organize visit-related information of outpatients with rheumatic diseases to meet information needs of clinical research, health care continuity and teaching of rheumatic diseases. The implementation of this database can improve health services, medical records management and clinical research of outpatients with rheumatic disease at PUMCH.	ambulatory care facilities;health care;health services research;information needs;morbidity - disease rate;outpatients;patients;records control;relational database;rheumatism;rheumatology specialty;scott continuity	Xinping Tian;William R.

EHRs used for research purposes demand privacy, confidentiality and all information governance concerns are addressed. However, existing solutions are unable to meet the evolving research needs especially when supporting data access and linkage across organization boundaries. In this work, we show how semantic methods can aid in the specification and enforcement of policies for privacy protection. This is illustrated through a case study associated with the Australasian Diabetes Data Network (ADDN), the national paediatric type-1 diabetes data registry and the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN) platform that supports Australia-wide access to urban and built environment data sets. Specifically we show that through extending the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) with semantic capabilities, we are able to support fine-grained privacy-preserving policies leveraging semantic reasoning that is not directly available in XACML or other existing security policy specification languages.	access control;australasian conference on information systems;confidentiality;data access;information governance;linkage (software);markup language;privacy;specification language;the australian;world wide web;xacml	Yang Lu;Richard O.

9836d8c151dc5489b26799ceadca4db58be21ba3	the utility of the virtual reality in autistic disorder treatment		Autistic disorder patients lack the social communication abilities and need interventional therapy to alleviate such symptoms. The cost of health care and treatment across the lifespan of patients were up to $3.2 million which places a crushing burden on the poor patients and their families. To relieve the symptoms of disease and reduce the financial pressure of the patients, many methods were proposed. The normal therapy is proceeding under the instruction of professional doctors in the hospital. Each person need to spend 6–8 h in the specialized institutions. Given the cost of treatment and time, the treatment could not carry out continually which could lead to reducing the curative effectiveness. The current study explores the utility of the virtual reality interventions to the autistic disorder patients. In the virtual environment, the patients could be receiving treatment continually and practice their social communication abilities in different social scenes. To generate immersive virtual social environment, a VR engine (Unity3D 5.0) were used. Some typical social communication scenes were also established which include the classroom, shopping mall and hospital. In these virtual scenes, the ASD patients were required to communicate with artificial intelligence (AI) players and finish some tasks. The coach which played by the researcher or expert would send appropriate instructions to help the patient when they encounter the difficulties. Two different statistic tables will be collected twice: one is before the training, the other one is after the training. The two checklists are Autism Behavior Scale (ABS) table and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) table. By comparing the scores which achieved in different time, researchers could assess the result of treatment and changing the content of the treatment in time. Four ASD children who had confirmed ASD diagnoses from a clinical doctor take part in this experiment. Informed consent was obtained from the parents before participation. The average age of the subjects is 6 (±1). These volunteers were asked to execute nine tasks in different social scenes, which include communicate with strange teachers, sellers and doctors. All these tasks have three levels: in lv1, only one AI player in the scenes, in lv2, two AI players in scenes, in lv3, no less than three AI players will in the scenes. The patients in which scenes at which levels is controlled by researchers. According to the results, we find that after the training that the scores of the ASD patients are raised. Such results suggest that the VR technology could very helpful for the adjuvant therapy of the ASD.	virtual reality	Sicong Liu;Yan Xi	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-92049-8_40	autism;social environment;asd;informed consent;health care;applied psychology;virtual reality;psychological intervention;psychology;childhood autism rating scale	Visualization	-57.00330921488267	-54.73574262443741	196746

Today’s smartphones are equipped with increasingly more sensors and accessible data types that enable the collection of literally dozens of signals related to the phone, its user, and its environment. A great deal of research effort in academia and industry is put into mining this raw data for higher level sense-making, such as understanding user context, inferring social networks, learning individual features, and so on. In many cases, this analysis work is the result of exploratory forays and trial-and-error. In this work we investigate the properties of learning and inferences of real world data collected via mobile phones for different sizes of analyzed networks. In particular, we examine how the ability to predict individual features and social links is incrementally enhanced with the accumulation of additional data. To accomplish this, we use the Friends and Family dataset, which contains rich data signals gathered from the smartphones of 130 adult members of a young-family residential community over the course of a year and consequently has become one of the most comprehensive mobile phone datasets gathered in academia to date. Our results show that features such as ethnicity, age and marital status can be detected by analyzing social and behavioral signals. We then investigate how the prediction accuracy is increased when the users sample set grows. Finally, we propose a method for advanced prediction of the maximal learning accuracy possible for the learning task at hand, based on an initial set of measurements. These predictions have practical implications, such as influencing the design of mobile data collection campaigns or evaluating analysis strategies.	exploratory testing;maximal set;mobile phone;primary source;sensemaking;sensor;smartphone;social network;tree accumulation;wearable computer	Yaniv Altshuler;Michael Fire;Nadav Aharony;Yuval Elovici;Alex Pentland	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-29047-3_6	sample size determination;social science;simulation;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;computer security;statistics;social network	HCI	-61.23494339700095	-54.39976169766691	196854

Specifically, we discuss the epidemiologic triad consisting of host, environment, and agent factors in relation to other person-environment fit models. We propose this model as the underlying framework for a smart homes development approach that focuses on creating task advantages to support independence at home. We provide recommendations to implement the approach by including community-level stakeholders and policy makers in research that uses a model well-recognized by public health professionals.

d6fabc340cdddd6ff9d7f6cf56e30d6f579a42e9	health information system access control redesign - rationale and method		This paper addresses the question of why a health service system might find it necessary to re-engineer the access control model that mediates the interaction of clinicians with health information systems. Factors that lead to increasingly complexity of the access control models are delineated, and consequences of that complexity are identified. Strategies are presented to address these factors, and a stepwise procedure is suggested to structure the access control model re-engineering process.		Kenneth A.

5838037f98b96b6184216a1a86ef70b9e60a82a7	developing a ubiquitous health management system with healthy diet control for metabolic syndrome healthcare in taiwan	diet diary;health risk assessment;mobile application;self-health management;ubiquitous healthcare	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Self-management in healthcare can allow patients managing their health data anytime and everywhere for prevention of chronic diseases. This study established a prototype of ubiquitous health management system (UHMS) with healthy diet control (HDC) for people who need services of metabolic syndrome healthcare in Taiwan.   METHODS System infrastructure comprises of three portals and a database tier with mutually supportive components to achieve functionality of diet diaries, nutrition guides, and health risk assessments for self-health management. With the diet, nutrition, and personal health database, the design enables the analytical diagrams on the interactive interface to support a mobile application for diet diary, a Web-based platform for health management, and the modules of research and development for medical care. For database integrity, dietary data can be stored at offline mode prior to transformation between mobile device and server site at online mode.   RESULTS The UHMS-HDC was developed by open source technology for ubiquitous health management with personalized dietary criteria. The system integrates mobile, internet, and electronic healthcare services with the diet diary functions to manage healthy diet behaviors of users. The virtual patients were involved to simulate the self-health management procedure. The assessment functions were approved by capturing the screen snapshots in the procedure. The proposed system development was capable for practical intervention.   CONCLUSION This approach details the expandable framework with collaborative components regarding the self-developed UHMS-HDC. The multi-disciplinary applications for self-health management can support the healthcare professionals to reduce medical resources and improve healthcare effects for the patient who requires monitoring personal health condition with diet control. The proposed system can be practiced for intervention in the hospital.

acd0ad3552e0502fe38316ed053d9a8486f8da33	patients' perceptions of web self-service applications in primary healthcare	era2015	This paper presents the preliminary findings of a case study of patients' acceptance and usage of web self-service - online appointment system - in a primary health care centre in a regional area in Australia. After two months of implementation, structured interviews were undertaken over three months to ascertain patients' perceptions of the web self-service application. The findings indicates that patients' acceptance of the web self-service application maybe hindered by their relative lower computer ownership or inadequate computer skills and access to the internet, their preference for flexible personal communication for appointment making and inadequate flexibility of the appointment system compared to phone call. Our preliminary findings may suggest that more than half of the healthcare consumers in this area are likely to accept the PCEHR initiative, however the decision makers of the PCEHR system need to carefully design the strategies and practice for the introduction of the innovation to overcome the substantial barriers to consumers' ability to access the internet-based e-health solutions.	health care;internet;patients;self-service software	Xiaojun Zhang;Ping Yu;Jun Yan;Hongxiang Hu;Niraj Goureia	2012	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-078-9-242	implementation;structured interview;medical education;phone;knowledge management;perception;the internet;health care;self-service;computer literacy;medicine	HCI	-60.36300857077662	-63.867775759815714	197608

MATERIALS AND METHODS To gain insight into community-based physicians' goals, environments, tasks, and desired support tools, we used a human-computer interaction model that was based in grounded theory. We conducted 30 recorded interviews with, and 25 observations of, primary care providers within 15 urban and rural community-based clinics across Oregon. Participants were members of three healthcare organizations with different commercial electronic health record systems. We used a grounded theory approach to analyze data and develop a user-centered definition of CDS and themes related to desired CDS functionalities.   RESULTS Physicians viewed CDS as a set of software tools that provide alerts, prompts, and reference tools, but not tools to support patient management, clinical operations, or workflow, which they would like. They want CDS to enhance physician-patient relationships, redirect work among staff, and provide time-saving tools. Participants were generally dissatisfied with current CDS capabilities and overall electronic health record usability.   DISCUSSION Physicians identified different aspects of decision-making in need of support: clinical decision-making such as medication administration and treatment, and cognitive decision-making that enhances relationships and interactions with patients and staff.   CONCLUSION Physicians expressed a need for decision support that extended beyond their own current definitions. To meet this requirement, decision support tools must integrate functions that align time and resources in ways that assist providers in a broad range of decisions.	aggregate data;align (company);clinic;clinical decision support system;cognition disorders;decision making;decision support systems, clinical;electronic health records;grounded theory;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;human–computer interaction;map;motivation;needs assessment;patients;primary health care;promotion (action);redirection (computing);requirement;usability;user-centered design;biopsychosocial aod use disorder theory	Joshua E.

The European population ageing is a challenge for the European social policy and for the mental health professionals. New technologies can play an important role in the neurocognitive stimulation area as they possess characteristics that might reduce the anxiety levels of patients participating in neurocognitive stimulation or assessment programs. In particular, serious games provide a setting that can be explored to improve the easy access to neurocognitive stimulation and assessment, regardless of place and time, at a lower cost then traditional approaches. This paper presents a serious game aiming to analyse neurocognitive deficits and stimulate the players’ deficitary neurocognitive processes. This game is built on top of sound neurocognitive psychotherapy for adults, mainly addressing the cognitive processes of attention and memory. The game will simulate real world scenarios, allowing a better generalization process due to ecological validity.

Clinical neuroscientists, neurosurgeons, and neuroradiologists treating patients with intracerebral aneurysms can benefit from ad hoc designed tools for the collection and retrieval of clinical and radiological data. In fact, data need be collected to answer clinical questions which cannot be inferred from the literature, such as mortality and morbidity data of aneurysm patients for a specific hospital. Moreover, innumerable research questions cannot be properly addressed without the support of clinical and radiological data collected over time. Standards assuring information accuracy and easy access to the stored data must coexist with the standards that protect an individual’s identifiable health information, particularly with a growing number of patients and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. This work, describes the design and application of a relational database by a multidisciplinary team of neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, and neurologists, which can be utilized to manage data from patients with intracranial aneurysms. We discuss the efforts to balance simplicity of access and possibility to share and retrieve data with protection of personal health information (PHI) and the strategies employed to guarantee correctness and completeness of the inserted data.	accessibility;clinical act of insertion;coexist (image);correctness (computer science);hoc (programming language);inference;intracranial aneurysm;morbidity - disease rate;patients;personal health information;radiology;relational database;standards characteristics	Maurizio Bergamino;Laura Saitta;Lucio Castellan;Gianluigi Zona;Bruno Bartolini;Renato Spaziante;Luca Roccatagliata	2011	Neuroinformatics	10.1007/s12021-011-9124-z	computer science;database	DB	-52.876332918698786	-63.116188733729125	198122

They focus or on the professional who will use the software or on its usability or on the software engineering metrics or on financial and managerial issues. The existent approaches are very resources consuming, disconnected, and not standardized. As the software becomes more critical in the health organizations and in patients, becoming used as a medical device or a medicine, there is an urgency to identify tools and methods that can be applied in the development process. The present work is one of the steps of a broader study to identify standardized protocols to evaluate the health information systems as medicines and medical devices are evaluated by clinical trials. The goal of the present work was to evaluate the effect of the introduction of an information system for monitoring tuberculosis treatment (SISTB) in a Brazilian municipality from the patients’ perspective. The Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems were answered by the patients before and after the SISTB introduction, for comparison. Patients from an outpatient clinic, formed the control group, that is, at this site was not implanted the SISTB. Descriptive statistics and mixed effects model were used for data analysis. Eighty-eight interviews were conducted in the study. The questionnaire’s results presented better averages after the system introduction but were not considered statistically significant. Therefore, it was not possible to associate system implantation with improved patient satisfaction. The HIS evaluation need be complete, the technical and managerial evaluation, the safety, the impact on the professionals and direct and/or indirect impact on patients are important. Developing the right tools and methods that can evaluate the software in its entirety, from the beginning of the development cycle with a normalized scale, are needed.	description;health information systems;implants;information system;ion implantation;medical devices;patients;protocols documentation;software engineering;tuberculosis;usability	Nathalia Yukie Crepaldi;Inacia Bezerra de Lima;Fernanda Bergamini Vicentine;Lídia Maria Lourençon Rodrigues;Tiago Lara Michelin Sanches;Antonio Ruffino-Netto;Domingos Alves;Rui Pedro Charters Lopes Rijo	2018	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-018-0968-8	risk analysis (engineering);patient satisfaction;data mining;information system;health care;clinical trial;software;usability;health informatics;descriptive statistics;medicine	HCI	-59.943017597093835	-63.6718684408948	198580

Due to the varieties of anti-hypertensive drugs, patients are interested in how these drugs can be selected to match their respective conditions. This study provides a personalized recommendation service system of anti-hypertensive drugs based on context-awareness and designs a context ontology framework of the service. In addition, this paper introduces a Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)-based rule to provide high-level context reasoning and information recommendation and to overcome the limitation of ontology reasoning. To make the information recommendation of the drugs more personalized, this study also devises three categories of information recommendation rules that match different priority levels and uses a ranking algorithm to optimize the recommendation. The experiment conducted shows that combining the anti-hypertensive drugs personalized recommendation service context ontology (HyRCO) with the optimized rule reasoning can achieve a higher-quality personalized drug recommendation service. Accordingly this exploratory study of the personalized recommendation service for hypertensive drugs and its method can be easily adopted for other diseases.	algorithm;antihypertensive agents;categories;context awareness;eighty;entity name part qualifier - adopted;estimated;futures studies;high- and low-level;how true feel alert right now;hypertensive disease;information literacy;mathematical optimization;ontology;patients;personalization;pharmaceutical preparations;real-time clock;reasoning - publishing subsection;recommender system;rule (guideline);semantic web rule language;system integrity;theory;wearable computer	Dexin Chen;Dawei Jin;Tiong-Thye Goh;Na Li;Leiru Wei	2016	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-016-0560-z	medicine;ontology;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-58.08930811027016	-57.57618732537941	198997

However, there is a paucity of rigorous empirical research that has investigated these assertions. Moreover, those studies that have sought to elucidate the relationship between the introduction of a CCIS and the time spent by staff on in/direct patient care activities have published contradictory findings. The objective of this literature review is to establish the impact of a CCIS on time spent documenting and in direct patient care by staff in the ICU.   METHODS Five electronic databases were searched including PubMed Central, EMBASE, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Reference lists of all published papers were hand searched, and citations reviewed to identify extra papers. We included studies that were empirical articles, published in English, and provided original data on the impact of a CCIS on time spent documenting and in direct patient care by staff in the ICU.   RESULTS In total, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria. Workflow analysis (66%) and time-and-motion analysis (25%) were the most common forms of data collection. Three (25%) studies found an increase in time spent charting, five (42%) found no difference, and four (33%) studies reported a decrease. Results on the impact of a CCIS on direct patient care were similarly inconclusive.   CONCLUSIONS Due to the discrepant findings and several key methodological issues, the impact of a CCIS on time spent charting and in direct patient care remains unclear. This review highlights the need for an increase in rigorous empirical research in this area and provides recommendations for the design and implementation of future studies.	cinahl;chart;cochrane library;database;documented;embase;futures studies;health care;ieee xplore;information system;paper;pubmed central;reference implementation;scientific publication;software documentation;systematic review;citation;intensive care unit	Rebecca L.

9dd9308249bcfc4e02df6db288b8d35e0ced0806	for how long is data from previous admissions accessed by hospital doctors?		Distinguishing relevant information enables for better user interfaces, as well as better storage management. However, it is hard to distinguish between information really important to clinical care and only occasionally desirable. We aim to answer for how long are clinical documents useful for health professionals in a hospital environment considering its’ content and the context of information request. We have studied the databases of a Virtual Electronic Patient Record that included (1) patient identification and the list of clinical documents integrated, (2) the visualization logs; and (3) a hospital encounters database that includes the list of encounters since 1993. Our results show that some clinical reports are still used after one year regardless of the context in which they were created, although significant differences exist in reports created in distinct encounter types. The half-life of reports by encounter type is 1.7 days for emergency, 3.9 days for inpatient and 27.7 for outpatient encounters. We conclude that the usage of patients past information (data from previous hospital encounters), varied significantly according to the setting of healthcare and content.	database;report;user interface	Ricardo João Cruz Correia;Altamiro da Costa Pereira	2008				HCI	-59.10223510350948	-64.63285498958683	199618

The purpose of this research is to address the collaboration of technology with healthcare, in solving the challenge of medication adherence. A questionnaire of 25 questions was sent out through email to 200 people, to get their feedback about medication adherence, the reasons of non-adherent and their level of acceptance in using the mobile application technology as an interventional tool for medication adherence. Results showed a statistically significant correlation between age and medication adherence (P = 0.012). There is a statistical significant impact of forgetfulness on nonmedication adherence (P-value = 0.0003). Additionally, majority of the partici‐ pants identified their willingness to use the application to help in medication adherence (P = 0.001). The conclusion drawn from this study suggests that people are willing to increase awareness of medication adherence.	email;mobile app	Nawal Chanane;Farhaan Mirza;M.

Among these effects, sleep disorders, stress, and degradation of school performance are the most frequent. A common reason behind these effects seems to be related with the disruption of the normal relationships and the lack of contact with the different social groups that the children belong to (family, friends, school, etc.). In this paper we present results of the DESEOS research project, which applies the Ambient Assisting Living (AAL) paradigm to increase the quality of life of health cared children by developing novel devices and applications to enhance the contact with their different daily environments. Security and dependability are central aspects in these scenarios, and consequently are central to the DESEOS solutions.

Traditionally, information has flowed from health care professional to patient, but change to a two-way dialogue is taking place. In this study, we examine a high level design of a perceived medical system and determine the implications of adding patients as active contributors. The main challenge of modifying existing systems to incorporate patient interaction is preserving system integrity. We propose a systematic approach to support scaling health care systems while preserving system integrity. Distributed systems such as personal health records and eHealth systems provide two ways in which patients can become more involved with their own health care with or without the involvement of health care professionals. It is important that modifications to such systems do not compromise patient record integrity regardless of whether the patient is working alone or with their health care professional. The lack of central control in distributed systems added to the complexity of health systems poses challenges for design and modification. Of particular interest is the identification of emergent behavior (behavior not explicitly specified in the specifications) in distributed systems not explicitly defined in the requirements of its individual components. Use of the new emergent behavior detection (EBD) tool offers potentially considerable cost savings by proactively identifying such behaviors during the design rather than the deployment phase of a project. Based on high level message sequence charts, the EBD tool highlighted a data synchronization issue between the main database and the patient's interface to the system. This provides valuable feedback of the early health system design which benefits future design development.	bridging (networking);data synchronization;distributed computing;emergence;high-level programming language;image scaling;internet;level design;message sequence chart;requirement;software deployment;software design;system integrity;systems design	Lisa Graham;Mohammad Moshirpour;Michael Smith;Behrouz Homayoun Far	2014	IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)	10.1109/BHI.2014.6864347	health systems engineering;medicine;systems engineering;knowledge management;hrhis;multimedia	HCI	-61.61101995238874	-60.5877267846025	199901

The purpose of this study was determine if emerging telecommunication technologies could help to change the social framework of homebound and mobility-limited people's lives. Four plain-old-telephone-service (POTs) -based videoconferencing units were placed in the homes of shut-in elderly for six months. Interviews conducted at three time points indicate participants felt more connected to their community because of the technology.	interviews	Jennifer L.

In those tools, controlled vocabulary (e.g., ICD-9-CM, CPT) coded clinical information is often the main search criteria used because of its ubiquity in billing processes. These tools generally require a researcher to pick specific terms from the controlled vocabulary. However, controlled vocabularies evolve over time as medical knowledge changes and can even be replaced with new versions (e.g., ICD-9 to ICD-10). These tools generally only display the current version of the controlled vocabulary. Researchers should not be expected to understand the underlying controlled vocabulary versioning issues. We propose a computable controlled vocabulary versioning system that allows cohort discovery tools to automatically expand queries to account for terminology changes.		Todd A.

The information system stores images, and other objects such as Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and URLs, which are pertinent to the conference presentations, as well as patient and conference metadata. A web-based interface allows clinicians to directly organize conference data, and display that information during a clinical conference. We implemented the system using open source software. It has been deployed since January 2001, and is the subject of an ongoing iterative development and evaluation process.	iterative and incremental development;web application	Hao Li;William B.
