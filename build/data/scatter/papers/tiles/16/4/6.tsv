This book came out of a seminar held by the authors in Amsterdamn from 1988 to 2000. The author listed, Terese, actually stands for Term Rewriting Seminar. A rewriting system is a step-wise transformation of objects. Since all of computer science can be viewed this way (at least abstractly) this field is fundamental to computer science. The book is intended for both beginners and experts. Many results appear here for the first time.	appear here;computer science;rewriting	William I.

Since that review, eleven major versions of the toolkit have been released and many new features added. ECJ is probably the toolkit with the most complete support for GP. ECJ is available for download as a 4 megabyte compressed archive, or from a subversion repository, and is almost entirely released under the Academic Free License. The development team is headed by Sean Luke at George Mason University. It is difficult to measure ECJ’s popularity, partly because there isn’t a unique published paper that is cited by its end users. However a Google Scholar search for the current ECJ URL returned 251 papers mentioning the website.	archive;download;free license;google scholar;mason;megabyte;software review;subversion	David R.

In these circles, formulae largely live by virtue of what they stand for, of what they mean, of how they feel and appeal to our intuition—our(?) intuition? And their meanings then tell which formulae to consider next. Poor Leibniz, poor Lagrange, poor Boole, poor Hilbert, and all others who shifted their attention towards uninterpreted formulae manipulation: they were all wrong, weren't they? Oh, and poor we, Edsger W. Dijkstra and all those programmers who converted themselves to formulae manipulators, because their profession demanded it. (This cultural gap in doing mathematics was once expressed quite aptly by Dijkstra when he remarked, “Ik hou van wiskunde, maar spaar me de mathematen”. [“I love mathematics, but it's the mathematicians I cannot stand”.])  Well, our profession of programming demanded a conscious and active engagement in formula manipulation and therefore we entered that field of endeavour; and we learned how mighty and powerful, how prosperous and effective, and how indicative of designing this change in attitude turned out to be, not only for the benefit of programming, but for vast parts of mathematics as well. And moreover, we learned to enjoy the activity.  In this note we try to convey the effectiveness and joy of formula manipulation through a small number of simple examples from both mathematics and programming.		Wim H. J. Feijen	2001	Inf. Process.

f183ca47e33393a78426bae6360ca10d627544c2	major events in multimedia information retrieval		Multimedia information retrieval (MIR) is a relatively young field in computer science. There are several well-established scientific meetings which produce high-quality peer-reviewed contributions. This editorial summarizes the currentmajor events and meetings. The top conference inMIR is the ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR). The roots of the meeting began in 2002 with the Challenges in Image and VideoRetrieval (CIVR) conferences and then combinedwith several other meetings in 2011 for the first ICMR. Within 3 years, ICMR had already achieved international recognition and was considered by some of the more influential conference rankings (e.g. CCF) to be a top conference in the wide domain of graphics and multimedia. Furthermore, Google conference rankings placed it in the top ten of all multimedia journal and conference publications in terms of citations. ICMR is sponsored by SIGMM and typically held in June:	acm-mm;computer science;graphics;information retrieval;microsoft customer care framework	Erwin M.

The Government's technical evaluation process consisted of evaluating a written technical proposal as well as conducting a benchmark test of each proposed system at the vendor's test facility. The purpose of benchmark testing was to evaluate the performance of the fully integrated system in a simulated operational environment. The benchmark test procedures and test equipment were developed through a joint effort between the Government, academic institutions, and private consultants. Herein the authors discuss the resources required and the methods used to benchmark test a standards-based PACS.	archive;awards;behavior;benchmark (computing);built-in test equipment;contract agreement;digital imaging;file archiver;inclusion body myositis (disorder);intraductal proliferative lesion of the breast;p1 bacteriophage artificial chromosomes;picture archiving and communication systems;picture archiving and communication system;request for proposals;request for proposal;requirement;standards characteristics	Nancy E.

Chemical Titles (CT), for example, became available in this form in 1962 and Chemical-Biological Activities (CBAC) in 1965. These natural-language tapes can form a basis for computerised current-awareness services. The (U.K.) Chemical Society maintained a close interest in these developments and, in August 1966, established the Chemical Society Research Unit in Information Dissemination and Retrieval a t the University of Nottingham, to investigate the practicability and usefulness of providing a computer-based information retrieval service for chemists in Britain. To this end an experimental current-awareness service was offered from the beginning of 1967 to mid-1968. The service was based on CT, as a natural-language titles-only data base, and CBAC as a natural-language titles-plus-digest data base.

aa7333b2883f11b0b327b2a94627317e1cf4b93e	paul erdös and probability theory	probability theory	Paul Erdos, one of the most brilliant and remarkable mathematicians of this ̋ century, died of a massive heart attack on 20 September 1996, while attending a mini-semester on combinatorics at the Banach Center in Warsaw. He devoted his life to mathematics with passion and love rare even among the most single-minded scientists. When he was barely twenty, the great Issai Schur of Berlin called him the ‘‘magician of Budapest’’; other epithets bestowed on him were the ‘‘Mozart of mathematics,’’ the ‘‘occidental Ramanujan’’ and the ‘‘modern-day Euler.’’ Many mathematicians are eccentric, and he was more so than most. He never had a ‘proper job,’ and never applied for one; he had no cheque book or credit card; he never had a driver’s license or health insurance. For over sixty years, carrying two half-empty suitcases, wearing an old suit, with sandals or oversized gym shoes on his feet, he travelled constantly from university to university around the world. Wherever he went, he would bring the latest mathematical news: declaring his ‘‘brain open,’’ he would attack the problems of his hosts with relish, he would see unexpected connections and excitingly new problems, and depart in a few days, leaving the exhausted hosts behind to work out the details of their Ž . collaboration. He wrote more papers about 1500, many still to appear , had many Ž . more co-authors close to 500 , and posed many more problems than anybody else in the history of mathematics. He wrote fundamental papers in number theory, set theory, probability theory, group theory, complex function theory, and combinatorics, among others. It was said that on a long train journey he would write a joint paper with the conductor.

74dcabb86c3fe485d066bfe696b1cde488a78519	mathematical reasoning in computing education	globalisation;collaboration;strategic development;intercultural education;computer education	IT HAS BEEN A WHILE SINCE I have written a purely opinion column. Ten years ago, I would have titled this column “Mathematical Reasoning in Computer Science Education”. However, computing is much broader than computer science, a sign that the fi eld has matured signifi cantly. As I have often said, mathematical reasoning is inherent to our everyday lives – we use basic mathematical logic concepts such as inference all the time. Indeed, mathematical reasoning, whether consciously or unconsciously, is more relevant in computing than many other disciplines. A computer is fundamentally a mathematical device that adheres to well defi ned mathematical rules (computer designers employ signifi cant mathematics). One of the goals of operating systems and software applications is to insulate users from these lower level mathematical/ algorithmic details. This does not necessarily imply insulation from mathematical/ algorithmic reasoning, but reasoning at a more abstract level. In 1999, we started the Math in CS (www.math-in-cs.org) group to promote the relevance of mathematics in computer science education. I often wonder if this group and related activities have had an impact. So, what measure of impact could one use? One factor could be the number of conference and journal articles focusing on this topic. Without doing a formal study, I believe they have increased slightly over the past ten years. Another factor is	computer science;consciousness;operating system;relevance	Peter B.

When Alessandro told me that the IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society’s (IMS) Administrative Committee (AdCom) is considering to appoint me as the next EIC, and asked if I am ready and willing to accept the position, I accepted with little hesitation. As a TIM Associate Editor since 2010, as well as Associate EIC in 2013 and 2016, I have become quite passionate with the vision that Reza and Alessandro have implemented for TIM in their respective terms as EIC, and the amazing improvements that TIM has experienced during those two terms. I can only hope to be able to continue that vision and contribute to TIM’s further improvement.		Wenwu Zhu	2017	IEEE Trans.

26168fcce39c89aa98e9af19fd01153b7bb762e4	on whose shoulders? (keynote)		Bernard of Chartres (via Sir Isaac Newton) reminded us that all progress is achieved “on the shoulders of giants” – that our greatest discoveries and innovations build upon the inspirations, triumphs, and foundational truths established by those who have gone before us. However, in our field of Software Engineering, as new ideas are transmitted at the speed of light, rather than the speed of Bernard’s horse, innovations are typically achieved as we, the ordinary people, exchange ideas, deliver incremental improvements, and offer the occasional truly novel idea to advance our field. In this fastpaced environment it is particularly important for us to take the time to build a strong foundation for our knowledge – keeping audit trails of our experiments, sharing our datasets, releasing the code we used to run our experiments, and generally making our work transparent and reproducible, so that we no longer depend on giants to further the field. Instead our successes are a collective effort from our community. Unfortunately, this degree of openness comes with its own challenges. In this talk, Dr. Cleland-Huang will explore some of the success stories in our field and discuss ways to deal with the psychological, philosophical, and practical barriers that impede open collaboration. BIOGRAPHY Dr. Jane Cleland-Huang is Professor of Software Engineering in the School of Computing at DePaul University, Chicago, where she serves as the director of the Systems and Requirements Engineering Center. She also serves as the North American Director of the International Center of Excellence for Software Traceability. Her research interests emphasize the application of machine learning and information retrieval methods to tackle large-scale Software Requirements problems. Dr. Cleland-Huang serves on the Editorial Board for the Requirements Engineering Journal, and as Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering and IEEE Software. She has been the recipient of the US National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Award, four ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards and 2006 IFIP TC2 Manfred Paul Award for Excellence in Software: Theory and Practice. She is a member of the IEEE Computer Society and the IEEE Women in Engineering. She received her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Chicago. 978-1-4799-8469-5/15/$31.00 c © 2015 IEEE SANER 2015, Montréal, Canada 1	computer science;experiment;ieee software;ieee transactions on software engineering;ifip working group 2.1;information retrieval;jane (software);machine learning;maniac mansion;newton;open collaboration;openness;requirement;requirements engineering;software requirements;traceability	Jane Cleland-Huang	2015		10.1109/SANER.2015.7081808	simulation;engineering;operations research	SE	-62.54543240260192	-17.87107828340106	48326

He is survived by his wife Rose and his two children Anne (21) and Christopher (16). Clemens Lautemann joined the board of the EACSL as treasurer in 1997. We, the EACSL community, and all who knew him, will miss him and remember him warmly. After studying Mathematics, Political Sciences, Philosophy and Computer Sciences at the Universities of Marburg, Bielefeld and Berlin, Clemens Lautemann earned a doctorate in Natural Sciences in June 1983. He dedicated himself to scientific research in Berlin, Osnabrück, Bremen, Edinburgh and Mainz. Theoretical Computer Science was his field of interest, especially Logic and Computational Complexity, and he obtained important results in the fields of Graph Theory, Structural Complexity and Finite Model Theory. His scientific work gained worldwide recognition. Clemens Lautemann joined the Institute for Computer Science at the Johannes Gutenberg University as Professor for Theoretical Computer Science in 1989. He was an inspiring teacher who motivated his students in his special field of expertise and he was actively engaged in encouraging young people. He supported the Bundeswettbewerb Informatik by accompanying pupils interested in the Natural Sciences. Several of his students and PhD candidates were awarded scientific prizes. Clemens Lautemann was deeply concerned with the further development of the Institute for Computer Science. He cared very much for the Institute’s future and played a major part in establishing the new Bachelor of Computer Science program. He was also interested in interdisciplinary cooperation and was one of the founders of the research group Bioinformatik at his university. Clemens Lautemann distinguished himself in many ways, as a warm and forthcoming person, as an original scientist, and as a committed teacher and supervisor with a vision beyond the shortlived fashions of the day. We all liked him very much and will miss his friendly, open-hearted personality. We are very sad that he will not be with us any longer. Clemens Lautemann’s family, friends, students, and colleagues will keep pleasant memories of him with them for a long time.	bachelor of computer science;computational complexity theory;eacsl;gesellschaft für informatik;graph theory;scientific literature;sipser–lautemann theorem;theoretical computer science	Johann A.

adc337064e76f1b383a70f8f22244842dc99fe6e	technical foundations		Graph drawing software relies on a variety of mathematical results, mainly in graph theory , topology , and geometry , as well as computer science techniques, mainly in the areas algorithms and data structures, software engineering , and user interfaces. Many of the core techniques used in automatic graph drawing come from the intersection of mathematics and computer science in combinatorial and continuous optimization. Even though automatic graph drawing is a relatively young scientific field, a few generic approaches have emerged in the graph drawing community. They allow a classification of layout methods so that most software packages implement variations of such approaches. The purpose of this chapter is to lay the foundations for all subsequent chapters so that they can be read independently from each other while referring back to the common material presented here. This chapter has been written based on the requirements and the contributions of all authors in this book. This chapter is not an introduction to automatic graph drawing, because it is neither complete nor balanced. In order to avoid repetitions, we only explain subjects that are basic or used in at least two subsequent chapters. The following chapters contain a lot of additional material. For introductions into the field of automatic graph drawing we recommend the books “Graph Drawing” by Di Battista, Eades, Tamassia, and Tollis [23] and “Drawing Graphs” edited by Kaufmann and Wagner [52]. Nevertheless, this book is self-contained in the sense that after this chapter has been read, every subsequent chapter can be read without referring to external sources.	algorithm;book;computer science;continuous optimization;data structure;graph drawing;graph theory;mathematical optimization;requirement;software engineering;user interface;vector graphics editor	Michael Jünger;Petra Mutzel	2004		10.1007/978-3-642-18638-7_2		Graphics	-48.77179194592729	-18.709982850000245	51241

The Jong Nang is such an example of a binary code, dated back over three quarters of a millennium. The Jeju Jong Nang code is considered as one of the earliest user binary coded communication (UBCC) in the world with a definite “1” or “0” binary symbolic analysis of switching circuits. The Jong Nang used the binary system (000, 010, 101, 111) similar to digital communications [4, 5, 6, 8] and three timbers are exactly like three-user. A unique scientific custom has been used at Jong Nang gate (JNG) in house i.e. the house holder indicates at house or not by three timbers close or open as like as traffic light (red, yellow, green) systems. Moreover, the same principle of Yin-Yang thought, DNA genetic matrices as well.

The author tries to answer to this question through an exploratory analysis of the impact of these tragic events on the research outputs of scientists, institutions and countries. In particular, this report provides a wide range of scientometric data related to terrorism studies over the world during the two decades from 1991 to 2011. After the September 11, 2001 events (9/11) in the United States, the concerned academicians have responded in a way that they started producing an increasing number of research publications, as if they were under the influence of some kind of a driving force, stimulating the overall academic production linked to this tragic event. However, after this trend has reached its peak in 2002, that driving force has visibly weakened, and since the mid 2000’s, the number of research publication in the field of terrorism studies has steadily decreased. Nonetheless, the number of terrorist events per year, along with the property damage and fatality rate, has continuously increased over the observed lapse of time. Using these results as a backdrop, in this paper is argued that the field of terrorism research should be explored from a critical and multi-cultural perspective, and that all scientific researchers should remain objective, for scientific research is to be independent from political systems, its contingent events in any form, and the transitory historical circumstances.	backdrop cms;contingency (philosophy);jackson;pentagon;positive feedback;problem solving;programming paradigm;row (database);scientometrics;self-censorship;shape analysis (digital geometry)	Edoardo Magnone	2014	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1378-4	social science;sociology;terrorism;operations research;law	Metrics	-62.71368982692614	-21.70411237263997	51786

He earned his Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Bucharest in 1966. He defected to Israel in 1967 where he became a professor at the Technion in Haifa, and later moved to Canada, and taught at the University of Montreal (1969–1972), and at the University of Waterloo (1972–1983). In 1983, he moved to the USA and became a professor at Rutgers University, where he founded RUTCOR — the Rutgers Center for Operations Research. He remained the director of RUTCOR until his untimely death in a tragic car accident on December 27, 2006. For more than 40 years, Peter Hammer has ranked among the most influential researchers in the fields of operations research and discrete mathematics. He has made numerous major contributions to these fields, launching several new research directions. His results have influenced hundreds of colleagues and have made a lasting impact on many areas of mathematics, computer science, and statistics. Most of Peter Hammer’s scientific production has its roots in the work of George Boole on propositional logic. More than anyone else, Peter Hammer has used and extended Boole’s machina universalis to handle questions relating to decision making, analysis and synthesis as they arise in natural, economic and social sciences. Over the span of his scientific career, he has conducted eclectic forays into the interactions between Boolean methods, optimization, and combinatorial analysis, while adapting his investigations to the most recent advances of mathematical knowledge and of various fields of application. Among the main research topics which have received his attention, one finds an impressive array of methodological studies dealing with combinatorial optimization, some excursions into logistics and game theory, numerous contributions to graph theory, to the algorithmic aspects of propositional logic, to artificial	boolean algebra;combinatorial optimization;computer science;discrete mathematics;game theory;graph theory;interaction;logistics;machina (company);mathematical optimization;operations research;peter gutmann (computer scientist);propositional calculus;waterloo	Endre Boros;Yves Crama;Bruno Simeone	2007	Discrete Optimization	10.1016/j.disopt.2007.11.001		AI	-56.66373266791724	-15.38591351050563	51832

I t shows how far an acute observer can penetrate behind the glittering facade of """"planned science"""" in even a short and scattered investigation. There is much that I could add from my personal experiences to confirm, extend or correct. Here, however, I shall have to content myself with one observation, concerning the IFAC conference itself. There was in fact at least one presentation differing, and that in a substantial way, from the preprint. This occurred in the case of the Martinek-Svoboda paper (Prague) on a digital machine-tool control. Part of the necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for my leaving Czechoslovakia was that I should complete the design of the machine NUDA, described in detail in the original (preprint) version. This condition I also satisfied. What was my surprise, then, to find that iny machine was described down to the last detail, without my name even once appearing. It is sometimes of use for preprints to be available '% few weeks before"""" a conference. As a result of some energetic letter writing on my part, both to Prague and to the Conference Program Chairman, Mr. J. Oblonsk:~ of the same Institute in Prague as the two hapless """"authors"""" read a long document which has been published as part of the discussion to the reprinted preprint. In this he first corrected the """"oversight"""" that had been made, and then went on to describe the work that had been done since my departure. Considering the respectable contribution to an improvement in the basic conception of the machine that had been made by these two, my only impression is one of amazement that this unfortunate event had occurred at all.

The book is authored by John McCormick, Frank Singhoff, and Jérôme Hugues, three individuals well known to the Ada community in both academic and professional settings. Their extensive experience in those two contexts is reflected throughout. The book is easy to read yet contains pragmatic discussions and examples that are as realistic as an entry-level textbook can be. Indeed that is the stated purpose of the book – an entry level textbook for students and professionals alike – but do not be misled by that fact; the breadth and depth of selected material are significant nonetheless.	ada;embedded system;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;system programming	Howard Ausden	2011	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/2047414.2047437	computer science;artificial intelligence	Graphics	-60.86242523591204	-21.551922709358223	52827

The hardware and software to support virtual meetings is becoming more sophisticated and more accessible, as some Hotel Chains are offering the facility to businesses as part of their portfolio of services. With the rise in popularity of this type of meeting environment the need for a facilitator to co-ordinate this type of activity has become more acute but the technology to support this has lagged behind. With the emergence of the Virtual Design Office as a response to multi-cultural design teams working on global projects the need for virtual meetings becomes more important in time critical situations. This paper presents work that has been completed in developing the requirements for an agent based virtual meeting support system, with particular emphasis on the role of the facilitator.	agent-based model;categorization;emergence;focus group;intelligent agent;modal logic;prototype;requirement;vocabulary	Phil Thompson;Anne E.

It is suggested here, expanding on observations made by anthropologist Gregory Bateson some years ago, that Wallace’s cyberneticslike view of the operation of natural selection—as a governor-like principle tending to keep species unvarying— can be expanded to a more complete evolutionary understanding by exploring in modern context Wallace’s idea that “more recondite forces” are driving the process. Specifically, when the environment is regarded as a final cause (but not a deterministic force), individual adaptations may be viewed as entropyrelaying structures (acting in response to, and as a part of, larger scale biogeochemical agenda), whereas negentropy is accumulated by nonrandomly directed organismand population-level forms of ecological engagement.

Design/methodology/approach – Further work informing this inquiry includes Gregory Bateson on learning levels, Chris Argyris and Donald Schon on double loop learning, Peter Senge on organizational learning, and James G. Miller on the processing of matter/energy and information in living systems, at different levels of organization. Findings – The paper provides an original synthesis of insights from Miller’s living systems theory, in exploring the implications of Bateson’s learning levels, as well as further insights from the work of Argyris, Schon and Senge, at cellular, individual, organisational, and global levels, to reinforce the need for a higher order, global level of learning. Originality/value – Value in findings outlined above. KeywordsLearning, Cognition, Second-order cybernetics, Recursion, Feedback, Self-referential systems, Self-reflexivity, Double loop learning, Learning organisations, Learning levels, Living systems Paper type Conceptual paper Introduction Prompted by an invitation to address the topic of recursion at the 2012 annual meeting of the American society for cybernetics, which was co-sponsored by the Bateson Idea Group, with the overall theme of “An ecology of ideas”, this paper began as an inquiry into the meaning and significance of the concept of recursion in relation to Gregory Bateson’s foundational insights on learning levels. Given my own work on the history of general systems theory, I was encouraged to integrate perspectives from that tradition. Being somewhat less familiar with the field of cybernetics, particularly second-order cybernetics, I approached the paper as an exploration into the cross-fertilization of developments in those two fields, as well as the related fields of system dynamics and organisation development. Focusing specifically on the concept of double-loop learning, as developed by Chris Argyris and Donald Schon, and originally inspired by Bateson’s work, and the related concept of the learning organisation, popularized by Peter Senge, the paper draws on the work of James Grier Miller, from the general systems community, to explore the phenomenon of learning at different organisational levels, from the cellular to the individual, the organisational and the larger socio-ecological contexts. I suggest that our collective understanding of learning is itself evolving and needs to continue to evolve in order to meet the challenges confronting humanity at the dawn of the twenty-first century, extending beyond the individual and even beyond the organisation, to encompass the global dimension, and beyond a purely instrumental The current issue and full text archive of this journal is available at www.emeraldinsight.com/0368-492X.htm Received 4 November 2012 Revised 2 March 2013 Accepted 4 October 2013	archive;cognition;ecology;global serializability;humberto maturana;integrative level;learning organization;living systems;recursion;reflection (computer graphics);richardson number;second-order cybernetics;self-reference;system dynamics;systems theory	Debora R.

The idea for the ﬁrst symposium stemmed from several  theoretical, conceptual, empirical, and applied considerations about the role of metacognition and self-regulation  when learning with computer based learning eEnvironments  (CBLEs). This symposium aims to provide a com- prehensive definition of meta-cognitive educational systems that is inclusive of the theoretical, architectural, and educa- tional aspects of this field.

HotCRP, a web-based conference submission and review package designed for flexibility and ease of use during reviewing, was initially written in summer 2006 as the submission system for HotNets V, which I co-chaired with Greg Minshall. It currently consists of about 20,000 lines of PHP plus 500 lines of Javascript, 1200 lines of CSS, and some others, and has been used for two SIGCOMMs, two USENIX Annual Technical Conferences, NSDI, ISCA, SOSP, and others. This paper discusses its design principles (and how they differ from other systems), my experiences with ongoing development and with anonymity, some interesting bugs, and general thoughts on conference review. Heartfelt thanks to the generous Dirk Grunwald, author of HotCRP’s ancestor CRP. Without CRP, HotCRP would not exist (although since essentially all CRP code has been replaced, any bugs are mine).	cascading style sheets;hot spare;international symposium on computer architecture;javascript;php;software bug;stefan savage;symposium on operating systems principles;usability;web application	Eddie Kohler	2008				SE	-59.60958543740595	-17.34943320712539	53993

ab84a53be0141d1e6f713ece0fd7dbcaaf62c89f	book reviews		"""One of the great challenges in reviewing books is the mul t i -authored volume. All too of ten, the chapters are highly uneven, with some being excellent and others dreary. The editor 's job, one somet imes suspects, is confined to operating the stapling machine. F r o m the viewpoint o f the reviewer, it is like trying to evaluate a fi lm festival. This is no t the case with the present book. Well-edited, it has useful contr ibut ions f rom a variety o f fields. In addit ion, these contr ibut ions flow together, instead o f being isolated lighthouse. The purpose o f the book is simple, and is described in its substitle: """"A Primer for the Scientist and Clinician."""" While much has been writ ten on scientific literature how it is organized, how to use it, and so on very little has related scientific specialities with their branch o f literature. For example, physicists m a y use journals and books somewhat differently f rom chemists , who in turn will differ f rom engineers. The object o f this book is to show biomedical personnel how to use scientific literature and how to create it. This is a tall under taking, bu t Warren's book makes a valiant effort. The volume is ~livided into four parts, with a total o f twelve chapters. The first part deals with how biomedical informat ion is arranged, the second with writing it, the third with using it, and the four th with sources o f informat ion such as libraries. The authors are distinguished, and range f rom D. de Solla Price, one o f the editors o f this journal , to Arnold Relman, the editor o f the New England Journal o f Medicine. Because the contr ibut ions vary so widely in their scope, it is difficult to summarize t hem all. Since so much of scientific literature is poorly wri t ten and unclear, I spent some t ime on the sect ion dealing with how to write (and read) a paper. Eli Chernin notes that Socrates once said, """"How many things there are here that I do not wan t . """" While Socrates was not referring to the scientific literature, it could well apply to it. Much o f what is wri t ten is o f little use, partially because o f the way it is written. Speaking o f scientific papers, Price notes that """" the paper became not just a means o f c o m m u nicating a discovery, b u t . . , it was the discovery i tself ."""" In a phrase I had not hear before, he says that """"science is a sort o f conspiracy that makes knowledge run faster than people ."""" Tha t c o m m e n t alone is wor thy o f an entire review, if not an article. One might th ink tha t while writing a scientific paper is no t easy for mos t people, reading one should be simple. It isn ' t , as Oscar Ramoff points out . He explains the purposes behind each o f the sections o f a paper, and how to get to the meat wi thout digesting too m u c h fat. To some, this is everyday knowledge, bu t judging f rom the number o f papers missed by searchers, Ramoff's message deserves to be heard. If there is one word which characterizes biomedical literature, it is statistics. Without going into great detail, Frederick Mosteller shows how to make sense o f the number s tha t appear in mos t biqmedical articles. He quotes m a n y il luminating examples o f how an effect shows up in a paper when it doesn ' t in nature. For example , he shows (p. 149) tha t studies wi thout control groups have an 85% chance o f successful t rea tment , but studies with these groups have only 19% success. Obviously, the degree o f en thus iasm can color results."""	arnold;book;eli;library (computing);oscar;primer;read-only memory;resources, events, agents (accounting model);scientific literature;wake-on-ring;warren abstract machine	Herbert Inhaber;András Schubert	1982	Scientometrics	10.1007/BF02018452		Robotics	-62.13873459860085	-22.112404733344583	54173

a3925ce10263235c6e2d1e98c26487efd74e29a8	selmer bringsjord, what robots can and can't be, studies in cognitive systems	cognitive systems	In style, as in content, the book blends seeming opposites: It formalizes literally dozens of arguments, rendering many in the austere language of first-order modal logic, yet the would-be heaviness of so much formalization is allayed by the breezy prose (Bringsjord is a published novelist; see Bringsjord 1991) and many helpful (and some lighthearted) illustrations. With several reviewers in the electronic journal Psycoloquy, I agree, “There is much to admire (and dispute!) in Bringsjord’s stimulating book” (Brown and O’Rourke 1984, {1). Admirably, Robots “brings in lots of distinctions and subtleties” (Scholl 1994, {8) and “raises the level of discussion” with its “focus on particular arguments, their premises and conclusions” (Barresi 1995, {1). By “formalizing arguments that are often bandied about loosely, and by offering new thought experiments to remedy defects in previous ones” (Hobbs 1995, abstract), Bringsjord “has tightened up many of the arguments against computer intelligence” (Rickert 1995, abstract) – such as they are (see below). Bringsjord’s “provocative review of the foundations of artificial intelligence” gives an “accessible and useful” account “of many of the disputes swirling about the foundations of AI” (Korb 1995,{1). Even the most negative Psycoloquy review praises Robots’s “clarity of argumentation” and finds it “refreshing to see philosophy presented in a clear enough fashion that it is possible quickly and easily to establish where there is an argument and how to evaluate it” (Mulhauser 1995, {31). Nevertheless . . . for all the book’s admirable qualities, like Gregory Mulhauser, “I find the arguments themselves unsatisfying” (Mulhauser 1995, {31). Robots fascinates despite – indeed, partly because of – “[p]roblem(s) . . . at the foundation” (Scholl 1994, {8). Robots’s reworkings of familiar anti-AI arguments unwittingly spotlight problems endemic to these arguments. The unwittingness, furthermore, seems rooted in presuppositions widely shared by parties to these discussions on both sides.

038f19f850f0d1f40067e1dc8e6cf03de4b90763	updates to the tods editorial board		It is of paramount importance for a scholarly journal such as ACM Transactions on Database Systems to have a strong editorial board of respected, world-class scholars. The editorial board plays a fundamental role in attracting the best submissions, in ensuring insightful and timely handling of submissions, in maintaining the high scientific standards of the journal, and in maintaining the reputation of the journal. Indeed, the journal’s associate editors, along with the reviewers and authors they work with, are the primary reason that TODS is a world-class journal. As of January 1, 2017, three Associate Editors—Divyakant Agrawal, Sihem Amer-Yahia, and Paolo Ciaccia—ended their terms, each having served on the editorial board for roughly six years. In addition, they will stay on until they complete their current loads. Paolo, Divy, and Sihem have provided very substantial, high-caliber service to the journal and the database community. Specifically, they have lent their extensive experience, deep insight, and sound technical judgment to the journal. I have never seen them compromise on quality when handling submissions. Surely, they have had many other demands on their time, many of which are better paid, during these past six years. We are all fortunate that they have donated their time and unique expertise to the journal and our community during half a dozen years. They deserve our recognition for their commitment to the scientific enterprise. Also as of January 1, 2017, three new Associate Editors joined the editorial board:	acm transactions on database systems	Christian S.

Three important findings emerged: (1) current work in computational modeling is described by three different levels of representation; (2) there is a paucity of studies at the highest, most abstract level aimed at inferring the meaning or message of the narrative; and (3) there is a need to establish a standard data bank of annotated narratives, analogous to the Penn Treebank.	computation;computer simulation;treebank	Mark A.

455d178f844dc0026bcd587477d9efc3ee10dd99	further steps in the science of temporal consciousness?	phenomenology;husserl;james;temporal consciousness	Temporal consciousness, the field that focuses on how time figures in our conscious states, is essentially interdisciplinary and has received attention from philosophers and psychologists alike. Nevertheless, there has been little cross-talk between these two disciplines. In this paper, I argue that the reason for this resides in crucially different interests: whereas philosophers have been preoccupied by phenomenology, psychologists have approached the field by downplaying the phenomenology and emphasizing their subjects' performance in various experiments. Despite this difference, existing research already suggests that there are fruitful grounds for interdisciplinary collaboration, should philosophers and psychologists aspire for it.

fb89c5b4a2a6a7de654017d1a2f375155b85ab69	editorial: parallel and distributed processing with applications	parallel and distributed processing	Welcome to the special issue on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications, The Journal of Supercomputing. In recent years, Parallel and distributed processing has become a key technology which will play an important part in determining and shaping future research and development activities in many academic and industrial branches. The stated goal of this special issue was to provide a forum for computer scientists and engineers, applied mathematicians and researchers to present and exchange ideas, results, work in progress and experience of research in the area of parallel and distributed computing. The special issue is in conjunction with the 2003 International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing and Applications (ISPA-03) held in Aizu-Wakamatsu City, Japan on July 2–4, 2003. There were very large amount paper submissions from 13 countries and regions. All submissions were reviewed by at least three referees. It is extremely difficult to select the papers in the special issue because there were so many excellent and interesting submissions. Based on the referee reports, a total of seven revised papers from the proceedings of ISPA-03 were selected for inclusion in the special issue. We believe all of these papers and topics will not only provide novel ideas, and state-of-the-art techniques in this field, but also stimulate the future research activities in the area of parallel and distributed processing with applications. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to all authors for their valuable contributions and to all referees for their cooperation in completing the hard work and putting in the long hours to review each paper in a timely and processional way.	acm/ieee supercomputing conference;computer scientist;distributed computing;noise shaping;the journal of supercomputing	Minyi Guo	2004	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1023/B:SUPE.0000026865.54649.ba	computer science;distributed design patterns	HPC	-61.07594879268506	-17.956392558041124	56031

Activist data mining involves: proposing experiments based on algorithmic and application-specific considerations, evaluating the results, proposing new experiments, evaluating, proposing, and so on. Thus Activist Data Mining is a fundamentally interventionist and iterative endeavour. It entails close collaboration with application specialists. The techniques required include combinatorial design to support a disciplined experimental design, a variety of analog circuit-building techniques, and hypothesis-generation. The talk and this paper discusses these tools in the context of a series of case study collaborations with biologists and physicists. The necessary scientific background will be presented to make the discussion self-contained. The talk is meant to appeal to researchers and practitioners in data mining as well as any visiting natural scientists. The data sizes range from 30,000 items for microarrays to trillions of items in gamma ray experiments. My intent in this paper is to convey the philosophy of my appraoch. You can find the technicalities on my web page or on the conference site.

6c90a6184364282cfe255230c831663052295fb3	the 2014 john cedric griffiths teaching award		It's been 15 years since I first met Clayton Deutsch, and since then, every time I notice a teaching award I cannot help but think that he would be the perfect candidate for such an award. So I guess this laudatio is 15 years in the making. No pressure. Clayton obtained his Master's and Doctorate degrees from Stanford University in 1987 and 1992, respectively. He worked for Placer Dome in the mid to late 1980s, and later for Exxon in the early 1990s. He turned to academia thereafter, first at Stanford University, and in 1997, began his current tenure at the University of Alberta. He founded the Centre for Computational Geostatistics (CCG), and continues to teach undergraduate, graduate, and industry courses in geostatistics mainly for the mining and petroleum sector. I remember first meeting Clayton in 1999, and being struck with how young he was for all his accomplishments. In front of the classroom, however, his youthful appearance gave way to a confident, intelligent, and enthusiastic teacher. He obviously knew theoretical geostatistics, but surprisingly, he was relating this theory to real mines and petroleum reservoirs around the world. Students could actually imagine the purpose of these equations, their value, and their place in the industry. Finally, here was a professor who was teaching not only the first principles of geostatistics, but also relating it to the real world. His ability to give perspective to geostatistical ideas is a lasting legacy. Clayton is a mentor, in every sense of the word. Through his support, encouragement, and passion for geostatistics and its varied applications, he inspired me to pursue this field as my profession. I sincerely believe that this could not have been achieved without his support and advice. This is not an uncommon claim among my fellow peers. From past to current students, words that are usually used to describe Clayton include supportive, inspiring, motivating, and passionate. Whether referred to as an “energizer bunny” or a “cheerleader,” you always knew that he was in your corner. He is generous not only in sharing his time and knowledge with his students, but he shares equally the credit associated to research developments. Many of us attribute our professional achievements to the mentoring that we received and continue to receive from Clayton. Outside the classroom, Clayton welcomed his students to the broader CCG family with semi-annual barbeques at his home, and ski trips to the Rocky Mountains during the long Canadian winters. Many of us have fond (and sometimes painful) memories of hiking the Grand Canyon, the Death Valley march, and climbing Mount Whitney ( 2 for some folks!). He was a walking example of what it meant to be well-rounded, to push boundaries and be adventurous. He encouraged us to set a goal, take those calculated risks, and work hard to achieve them. Clayton is also an outstanding contributor to education in the natural resources sector. He has inspired all demographics of mineral and petroleum industry professionals, from the novice to the experienced. His contribution to the resource industry lies not only in the training of future geologists and engineers, but also in the establishment of good practice in the geomodelling sector of natural resources management. He has written many books, and over 100 articles, that have contributed to the advancement of geostatistics for resource characterization and classification. It is truly my pleasure to announce to the IAMG community that Clayton Deutsch is the recipient of the 2014 John Cedric Griffiths Teaching Award. I cannot think of a more deserving individual than Clayton, and while he is a long-time believer of the motto “there is no free lunch,” I believe there is a free celebratory dinner in the near future.

Even without empirical proof, the Seti@home project gives us some sense of contributing to something larger than ourselves—and hope that the cool, 3D graphs being drawn and redrawn across our screens could be just moments away from plotting a new course for intelligent life in the universe. Well, for those of you losing faith, or just needing a more concrete project to get behind, there is the WCG (World Community Grid). Like Seti@home, the WCG uses idle computers to process data, but in this case the data is human protein structure rather than cosmic radio signals. The WCG exists alongside another grid, United Devices' grid.org, to crunch data for the Human Proteome Folding Project. Its goal is to help scientists understand the structure and function of all 30,000 proteins coded for by the human genome. What's amazing is the sheer amount of data to be processed. It would take up to 1 million years of computing time to do the work on a single modern PC. By distributing the work across millions of computers, the project is already about 20 percent done. Once completed , the information could help scientists find cures and treatments for diseases such as cancer and AIDS. Wanted: Windows Robots Once the sole province of clunky desktops and servers, the front in the Windows-versus-Linux war has migrated to the embedded space. And in any war there will be battles. Case in point: the """" Great Gadget SmackDown, """" sponsored by the editors of LinuxDevices.com and Win-dowsForDevices.com. They created a list of devices that use either Windows or Linux as their embedded operating system and tallied the results. In the end there was no clear winner, with Windows edging out Linux with a grand total of 247 devices compared with Linux's 243. Looking at the numbers for specific popular device categories such as PDAs (Windows: 88 devices, Linux: 40 devices) and mobile phones (Window: 34 devices, Linux: 14 devices) puts Microsoft on top. But if one considers just """" the geek factor, """" we see a slightly different story. Take a look at by far the most geeky category on the list: robots.

In this paper we propose Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as the basis for a practical and well founded methodological approach to the design of educational applications. FCA is a technique that can be applied to model the linguistic conceptualizations that experts make when describing their expertise domain. Thus, FCA can be used as a complementary tool to support design decisions about the structure and the interface of educational applications. We also present how we are using FCA in two different projects: a help system for the Unix operating system, and a multimedia tutorial for improving second language text comprehension. In the final discussion we raise some questions about FCA applicability and introduce some future lines of work. © IFIP, published by Kluwer Academic Publishers	formal concept analysis;international federation for information processing;operating system;unix	Baltasar Fernández-Manjón;Alfredo Fernández-Valmayor	1998	Education and Information Technologies	10.1023/A:1009641330050	telecommunications;computer science;formal concept analysis;theoretical computer science;interface;educational software;design technology;law;information technology;world wide web;software development process	HCI	-56.790191158478585	-18.386947126652238	58354

However, it is very probable that Shannon's article A Mathematical Theory of Communication would not have become famous without the help of Warren Weaver, whose popular text on ''The Mathematics of Communication'' re-interpreted Shannon's work for broader scientific audiences. Weaver's ''preface'' and Shannon's article were published together in the book The Mathematical Theory of Communication. Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics was an even more popular event, when it appeared in print. However publications were influential on two scientific areas with concepts unmentioned or unelaborated within the texts themselves: Systems Theory and information theory. A ''General System Theory'' had already been created by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in the late 1920s for biological and philosophical research. This approach melded in North America in the 1950s with cybernetics, as well as a new system theoretical approach in engineering sciences in the 1950s. Bertalanffy's ''General System Theory'' - or simply ''systems theory'' was used, became even more famous in humanities. In the 1960s attempts to yield both systems theory took root in the humanities, with mixed success. This paper will review the links across these fields showing the influences across cybernetics, system(s) theory and information theory throughout the 1950s and the theory of Fuzzy Sets and Systems. Then we focus to the non-technical but philosophical aspects of information theory. When Weaver emphasized not the technical but the semantic and influential problems of communication, his arguments were very similar to Charles W. Morris' foundations of the Theory of Signs (1938) -Semiotics. We will show some interesting ideas of Weaver related to semiotic thinking and we will advocate a ''fuzzy information theory'' that has to be appropriate to cover this ''semiotic concept of information''. Finally, the paper presents epistemological reflections in historical perspective on the concept of ''information'' as a ''fluctuating object'' that we take as a fuzzy concept.	cybernetics;fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy set;information theory	Rudolf Seising	2010	Inf.

6dcc8075c03aa969b43d61e70121a536fb7afccf	read before you cite!		We report a method of estimating what percentage of people who cited a paper had actually read it. The method is based on a stochastic modeling of the citation process that explains empirical studies of misprint distributions in citations (which we show follows a Zipf law). Our estimate is only about 20% of citers read the original. Many psychological tests have the socalled lie-scale. A small but sufficient number of questions that admit only one true answer, such as “Do you always reply to letters immediately after reading them?” are inserted among others that are central to the particular test. A wrong reply for such a question adds a point on the lie-scale, and when the lie-score is high, the over-all test results are discarded as unreliable. Perhaps, for a scientist the best candidate for such a lie-scale is the question “Do you read all of the papers that you cite?” Comparative studies of the popularity of scientific papers has been a subject of much recent interest [1]-[8], but the scope has been limited to citation distribution analysis. We have discovered a method of estimating what percentage of people who cited the paper had actually read it. Remarkably, this can be achieved without any testing of the scientists, but solely on the basis of the information available in the ISI citation database. 1 Acknowledging the subjectivity inherent in what reading might mean to different individuals, we generously consider a “reader” as someone who has at the very least consulted a trusted source (e.g., the original paper or heavily-used authenticated databases) in putting together the citation list. Freud [9] had discovered that the application of his technique of Psychoanalysis to slips in speech and writing could reveal a lot of hidden information about human psychology. Similarly, we find that the application of statistical analysis to misprints in scientific citations can give an insight into the process of scientific writing. As in the Freudian case, the truth revealed is embarrassing. For example, an interesting statistic revealed in our study is that a lot of misprints are identical. Consider, for example, a 4-digit page number with one digit misprinted. There can be 4 10 such misprints. The probability of repeating someone else’s misprint accidentally is 4 10 . There should be almost no repeat misprints by coincidence. One concludes that repeat misprints are due to copying some one else’s reference, without reading the paper in question. In principle, one can argue that an author might copy a citation from an unreliable reference list, but still read the paper. A modest reflection would convince one that this is relatively rare, and cannot apply to the majority. Surely, in the pre-internet era it took almost equal effort to copy a reference as to type in one’s own based on the original, thus providing little incentive to copy if someone has indeed read, or at the very least has procured access to the original. Moreover, if someone accesses the original by tracing it from the reference list of a paper with a misprint, then with a high likelihood, the misprint has been identified and will not be propagated. In the past decade with the advent of the Internet, the ease with which would-be non-readers can copy from unreliable sources, as well as would-be readers can access the original has become equally convenient, but there is no increased incentive for those who read the original to also make verbatim copies, especially from unreliable resources. In the rest of this paper, giving the benefit of doubt to 2 According to many researchers the Internet may end up even aggravating the copying problem: more users are copying second-hand material without verifying or referring to the original sources.	authentication;bibliographic index;citation index;database;filter (higher-order function);internet;scientific literature;stochastic modelling (insurance);trusted system;verification and validation;zipf's law	Mikhail V.

01cc8dc8e7e92fa4e3e1ad23da4c3ea5b149ace6	editorial pointers		COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM November 2007/Vol. 50, No. 11 5 Unlike many of the sciences, where experimentation and theory go hand-in-hand, computer science generally has taken a different approach, viewing theory as the driving force and experimentation too often as a postscript. But there is a growing faction of CS researchers working to change that modus operandi, calling for higher visibility for experimental computer science with the conviction that only experimentation is able to test and confirm the relevance of theory and established practices. This month’s special section showcases some of the current “experimental” research within a panoply of computer science disciplines, illustrating its many forms, including observation, measurement under controlled conditions, and replication of previous work. The authors present platforms for evaluating system designs, wide-area network services, experimental algorithms, and much more. Guest Editor Dror G. Feitelson, an associate professor and head of the Parallel Systems Lab in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, hopes this collection of articles illustrates how experimentation is as integral to the process as theory and practice.	algorithm;communications of the acm;computer science;postscript;relevance	Diane Crawford	2007	Commun.

BOX 258 Houston, TX 77070-2698 Ivy, VA 22945 Simulation has been used predominantly in the evaluation of systems during the design phase. It has not been as successful as an operation tool. Scheduling, on the other hand, is done traditionally via mathematical model. The interaction between these two fields of operations research has been complementary. Traditiomlly, a schedule is created as an initial guess and is evaluated with a simulation model. A schedule with “acceptable” features can then be adopted for operations. In recent years, as the speed of computer accelerated, real time simulation for the purpose of operation and control is proposed. Simulation based software for operation and control of production system has also evolved into commercial products. As with any new technology, there are different point of views among the researchers, software developem, and users. This panel session will provide a forum for discussion of philosophical issues as well as illuminating merits of each approach.

b84db95bb05ea29eab22f860269552eacb516f4d	towards reasoning vehicles: a survey of fuzzy logic-based solutions in vehicular networks		Vehicular networks and their associated technologies enable an extremely varied plethora of applications and therefore attract increasing attention from a wide audience. However, vehicular networks also have many challenges that arise mainly due to their dynamic and complex environment. Fuzzy Logic, known for its ability to deal with complexity, imprecision, and model non-deterministic problems, is a very promising technology for use in such a dynamic and complex context. This article presents the first comprehensive survey of research on Fuzzy Logic approaches in the context of vehicular networks, and provides fundamental information which enables readers to design their own Fuzzy Logic systems in this context. As such, this article describes the Fuzzy Logic concepts with emphasis on their implementation in vehicular networks, includes classification and thorough analysis of the Fuzzy Logic-based solutions in vehicular networks, and discusses how Fuzzy Logic could be employed in the context of some of the key research directions in the 5G-enabled vehicular networks.	acm computing surveys;algorithm;analysis of algorithms;autonomous robot;big data;cloud computing;cluster analysis;commonsense reasoning;computational complexity theory;control system;critical section;data aggregation;digital distribution;experiment;free library of springfield township;fuzzy logic;network congestion;network planning and design;next-generation network;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;routing;selection (user interface);simulation;software deployment;sparse matrix;spatial variability	Irina Tal;Gabriel-Miro Muntean	2017	ACM Comput.

The workshop was held in conjunction with the 1st International Green Computing Conference. The participants were encouraged to attend the IGCC sessions, in order to identify research problems that might be of interest to the algorithms community and to present them at the workshop. Slides from these presentations are available at http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~kirk/SciPM2/. This quarter’s column has been inspired by several talks at IGCC, although most problems discussed in it were actually added later, when I surveyed the literature on power management.	acm sigact;ibm notes;online algorithm;power management	Marek Chrobak	2010	SIGACT News	10.1145/1907450.1907547	online algorithm;computer science	HPC	-61.12849851621084	-17.459833743114277	60790

In this talk, I will first give an overview on modeling human emotions encapsulated in people’s write-ups. I will then sample two visual analytic systems that use very different methods to automatically extract and visualize human emotions from text for two very different purposes. The first is an interactive visual analytic system that automatically summarizes human sentiment captured in online reviews and leverages the power of a crowd to rectify the imperfections in machine sentiment analysis. The second is a timeline-based visual analytic tool that extracts and visualizes a person’s moods over time based on the person’s tweets. Finally, I will discuss the challenges of inferring human emotional DNA from text in general and potential research directions. EmoVis 2016 Workshop, March 10, 2016, Sonoma, CA, USA.

bf1c7e24cb089b045a224c619f168094ab0b50b0	turing: colossus computer revisited	computing science;history	George Dyson's history of the Colossus computer (Nature 482, 459–460; 2012) is somewhat misleading. The development of Colossus owed little to the Bletchley Park 'bombe' devices. After Bill Tutte developed a statistical strategy to tackle the German Fish cypher, Max Newman proposed a machine to implement it, using two paper tapes. With help from the Telecommunications Research Establishment (later the Royal Radar Establishment) and from Frank Morrell's group at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill, the Robinson machines were built. These were slow but validated the technique. Thomas Flowers' group recommended the use of many more vacuum tubes to improve performance, but they were wrongly considered too unreliable by Bletchley Park. So Flowers built the first Colossus at Dollis Hill instead of Bletchley Park although, in time, Newman spoke to him about his requirements. One crucial technique developed by Turing and used by Tutte was that of 'delta-ing', or using the differences between characters rather than the characters themselves. If Dyson had pointed out that Tutte used this method to detect the statistical non-randomness of plain text, it would also have helped in understanding how different Fish was from Enigma.	colossus computer;turing	Henry Shipley	2012	Nature	10.1038/483275b	turing;algorithm;colossus computer;computer science	Vision	-60.22397542227089	-20.046566701247894	60914

974316ab40a7f88918afdbd6d554e782ecfaed6b	grammar induction: an invitation to formal language theorists		Why should Formal Language specialists get interested and involved in the area of Grammar Induction (GI), likewise known as Grammatical Inference? This is the question we try to answer in this paper. To keep this paper short, we mostly refrain from giving technical details but rather cite according references. So, this is rather a kind of hopefully inspiring (and by no means complete!) annotated bibliography than a technical paper. However, we hope to present an inviting and inspiring panoramic view on the scene. We believe that there are indeed a number of good reasons, the most obvious being that Grammar Induction, as well as Formal Language Theory, deals with formalisms describing languages, i.e., grammars, automata, expressions, etc. This already implies a lot of interesting issues:	applicative programming language;automata theory;bibliographic index;formal language;grammar induction;graph coloring	Henning Fernau;Colin de la Higuera	2004	Grammars			NLP	-59.11327620795914	-22.042498615536786	61348

Some of the best practices in knowledgebased NLP will be illustrated through several NLP systems that use semantic and world knowledge to resolve ambiguities and extract meanings of sentences. Issues in knowledge acquisition and representation for NLP will also be addressed. The article includes pointers to books, journals, conferences, and electronic archives for further information.

ba79a885b06b06572a3f1739b9225c45ede32bdb	editorial note		The theme of the Texas Linguistics Society (TLS) 2003 conference was “The Dynamics of Coarticulation in Speech Production and Perception.” The conference provided a wonderful opportunity for the students and affiliates of the University of Texas at Austin to interact with renowned scholars in the field of speech research over a three-day period. TLS, a student run and non-profit organization, holds an annual conference on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. The success of each conference is dependent on the generosity and support of several different groups and individuals. In recognition of this, the co-chairs of TLS 2003 express their appreciation to all our financial sponsors without whose support this year’s conference would not have been possible. Financial support for this year’s conference came from: Events CoSponsorship Committee (ECC), The Student Senate, The Student Government, The Department of Linguistics, and The Department of		Ilkyeun Ra;C.

We consider how Turing originally introduced his imitation game and discuss what this means in a practical scenario. Due to its popular appeal we also look into different representations of the test as indicated by numerous reviewers. The main emphasis here, however, is to consider what it actually means for a machine to pass the Turing test and what importance this has, if any. In particular does it mean that, as Turing put it, a machine can “think”. Specifically we consider claims that passing the Turing test means that machines will have achieved human-like intelligence and as a consequence the singularity will be upon us in the blink of an eye.	technological singularity;turing test	Kevin Warwick;Huma Shah	2015		10.1007/s12559-015-9372-6	turing degree;turing tarpit;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;description number;algorithm;super-recursive algorithm	ML	-57.41970762125769	-22.043777884519603	61518

The school was co-organized by the Kazan Federal University and the Russian Information Retrieval Evaluation Seminar (ROMIP). The RuSSIR school series started in 2007 and has developed into a renowned academic event with solid international participation. Previously, RuSSIR took place in Yekaterinburg, Taganrog, Petrozavodsk, Voronezh, Saint Petersburg, and Yaroslavl. RuSSIR courses were taught by many prominent international researchers in IR and cognate areas. Kazan, about 800 km east of Moscow, has the population of about 1.1 million people and is one of the oldest Russian cities. Geographical and cultural aspects of both Europe and Asia come together here. Founded in 1804, Kazan University is the third oldest university in Russia. It has over 40,000 full-time students in 180 major degree programmes. Kazan University is the alma mater and life-long affiliation of the Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky (1792–1856), the developer of non-Euclidean geometry, a fact that was symbolised by a hyperbolic triangle on RuSSIR t-shirts. In 2013, the RuSSIR programme featured a track on audio and music IR alongside core information retrieval topics. This led to fruitful discussions among participants coming from different domains and allowed students to learn cross-disciplinary competencies. The school programme consisted of a plenary invited course, six courses running in two parallel sessions, two sponsor presentations, as well as the RuSSIR Young Scientist Conference. Music Hackathon, a co-located event with a focus on hands-on development, was an innovation of this year.	hackathon;hands-on computing;information retrieval	Pavel Braslavski;Nikita Zhiltsov;Stefan M.

b82a9fe3e739df0d5256b89ee587e98b0c4adb2e	introduction to the focused issue of award-nominated papers from jcdl 2013		The papers in this issue represent some of the best-received research presented at the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries in 2013 [1]. The papers were originally selected basedon their nomination for oneof the conference’s best paper awards. The set of nominated papers was then narrowed based on a combination of their original reviews and subsequent examination by the conference program chairs and senior program committee members. After the work’s presentation at the conference, authors were asked to expand on the presentation of their work, taking advantage of feedback from both before and after the conference. The papers in this issue include a mixture of technical and social results related to a range of themes: automatic or semi-automatic metadata generation, archiving, and citation and comment analysis. They have gone through a rigorous additional review cycle ensuring both the quality of the work and that the results go beyond what was presented at the conference. As such, they represent some of the strongest work from the JCDL community. The earlier version of the paper “A Comprehensive Evaluation of Scholarly Paper Recommendation Using Potential Citation Papers”, by Sugiyama and Kan [2] received the conference’s 2013 Vannevar Bush Best Paper Award. The earlier version of the paper by Suppawong Tuarob, Line C. Pouchard, and C. Lee Giles, “A Generalized Topic Modeling Approach for Automatic Document Annotation” [3], received the Best Student Paper Award.

fb915fa484d62b045ac8a4fa9993b893ff4e2480	complexity, the core of elsasser's theory of organisms		A s Harold Morowitz noted in the May/June 2001 issue of Complexity, the eminent theoretical physicist Walter Elsasser was notably prescient about the fundamental significance of complexity for biology. Although I was already aware in the early 1960s of some of his biological writings, it was not until 1981 that I began a concerted effort to understand his thought about organisms. This came about because my own efforts to understand the diverse biochemical responses of cultured cells to a variety of growth stimulators had become so mired in complexity that I began a correspondence with Elsasser seeking guidance about how to deal with it. The exchange of correspondence was intense and lasted for a decade until his death in 1991. During this period he was finishing his fourth book on biology Reflections on a Theory of Organisms, first published in 1987 by a small press in Canada, and reprinted by Johns Hopkins University Press in 1998 [1]. Elsasser’s professional interest in biology began in the early 1930s when he fled Hitler’s Germany, first to Pauli in Zurich who recommended him to Joliot in Paris to serve as his theoretical physicist [2]. The big question that loomed in his mind was whether biology was ultimately reducible to quantum mechanics or required an autonomous biological theory to supplement the physics. In order to take the idea of an autonomous biology seriously, he had to find a way around von Neumann’s mathematical proof of quantum mechanics under which all regularities in nature were reducible to the differential equations of atomic physics. He concluded that the complexity and heterogeneity of organisms put them beyond complete reduction to quantum mechanics, without violating its laws. He therefore set himself the longterm goal of developing a set of autonomous principles to image the organismal complexity. He wrote four books developing his thought on the subject but along the way decided he was “flying with clipped wings” in the first two of these to please the establishment. He began to soar in his third book [3] and continued in free flight in the last book. His basic assumption was that an organism (and even a cell) is a source of causal chains that cannot be traced beyond a terminal point because they are lost in unfathomable complexity. He had come to this conclusion on considering the number of atoms and their possible combinations in a cell, the speed and reversibility of enzyme reactions, and the old Aristotelian idea that no two blades of grass are identical. These features of the living state, of course, differed from the inanimate world of his training in which all electrons are stable and identical. He perceived a difference between heterogeneous classes that make up biology and homogeneous classes that make up physics. A heterogeneous class, of which a species is an example, consists of individuals that share some characters but differ HARRY RUBIN	amiga reflections;autonomous robot;book;causal filter;causality;complexity;quantum mechanics	Harry Rubin	2001	Complexity	10.1002/cplx.10013	machine learning;artificial intelligence;mathematics	Theory	-56.02275259125205	-22.32446210057771	65210

It contains the full papers, poster papers, and plenary abstracts. Collective intelligence has existed at least as long as humans have, because families, armies, countries, and companies have all - at least sometimes - acted collectively in ways that seem intelligent. But in the last decade or so a new kind of collective intelligence has emerged: groups of people and computers, connected by the Internet, collectively doing intelligent things. For example, Google technology harvests knowledge generated by millions of people creating and linking web pages and then uses this knowledge to answer queries in ways that often seem amazingly intelligent. Or in Wikipedia, thousands of people around the world have collectively created a very large and high quality intellectual product with almost no centralized control, and almost all as volunteers! These early examples of Internet-enabled collective intelligence are not the end of the story but just the beginning. And in order to understand the possibilities and constraints of these new kinds of intelligence, we need a new interdisciplinary field.	centralized computing;collective intelligence;computer;display resolution;humans;web page;wikipedia	Thomas W.

Backus, the main creator of Fortran, co-creator of Algol 60 and FP (a variable-free variant of functional programming), and the B “behind” BNF, died on March 17, 2007, 82-year-old, at Ashland, Oregon, near one of his two daughters. Born, 3 December 1924, in Philadelphia, to a well-to-do stockbroker and his wife, John Backus became, from 1954, one of the most influential people in computing. John Backus in many senses was beyond ‘pedagogical reach’ and thank goodness for that! John Backus dropped in and out of schools, studied chemistry for one year (Univ. of Virginia), joined the army in 1943 but was soon rerouted to a pre-engineering programme at Univ. of Pittsburgh, then studied medicine at Haverford College and worked at the Atlantic City hospital. He fell ill with a brain tumour, was operated on, but the inserted plate did not fit so John Backus invented a better one. He then quit the medical field and moved to New York not knowing what he wanted — except that he wanted a hi-fi set — liking music — but could not get a good set so he built one himself after having learned radio basics at a technician’s school. There he helped a teacher doing some mathematical calculation, liked it, and then went to Columbia Univ. from where he got a BA and a Masters, and visited the IBM World HQ (and computer center) in New York. That led to his first, and only employment. From September 1950 until his retirement in 1991 John Backus worked all his life at IBM, more than 40 years — surely, and in no small measure due to John Backus’s work, the most condensed period of scientific and technological achievements of any technology. Within four short years John Backus was engaged in (1) the programming of the IBM SSEC (‘Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator’) for, amongst many things, the calculation of lunar orbit tables later used in the US Apollo project; (2) for the IBM 701 (the “Defense Calculator” used during the Korean War), with Harlan Herrick, inventing (and implementing an interpreter for) the ‘Speedcoding’ language simulating floating point numbers on an integer machine; and (3) designing, later, the first hardware floating point unit for the IBM 704 and persuaded IBM to let the IBM 704 provide for indexing. All this led up to John Backus proposing, in December 1953, and persuading IBM to start, contrary to the advice of John von Neumann, the “automatic programming” project that lead to the November 1954 report ‘The IBM Mathematical FORmulaTRANslating system FORTRAN’ for which the Fortran I compiler was available early 1957 — the result of more than three years of work by John Backus, Robert Nelson, Harlan Herrick, Lois Haibt, Roy Nutt, Irving Ziller, Sheldon Best, David Sayre, Richard Goldberg and Peter Sheridan.	algol 60;automatic programming;beta normal form;business architecture;columbia (supercomputer);compiler;floating-point unit;fortran;functional programming;ibm 701;ibm ssec;john collison;simulation;speedcoding	Dines Bjørner	2008	Formal Aspects of Computing	10.1007/s00165-008-0077-4	chemical engineering;crystal growth;discrete mathematics;halide;inert gas;inert;atmosphere;computer science;crystal	Theory	-58.83365583369648	-20.59931187317317	65451

05ae10b79742b429872ac783f6d43d5eded2d886	the mind without, the world within		The current debate between internalists and externalists is in many ways quite complex. Not only are the terms used differently in the context of epistemology, philosophy of mind and ethics, but a bewildering proliferation of new versions of internalism and externalism have emerged in recent discussions. Consequently, it makes very little sense these days to ask in general whether somebody is an internalist or an externalist, since the answer will depend on the specific kind of internalism or externalism one has in mind. In the present volume, the focus will be on the internalism–externalism debate as it is played out in the context of philosophy of mind. Thus, the internalism in question is the one that, roughly speaking, amounts to the view that a subject’s beliefs and experiences are wholly constituted by what goes on inside the mind of that subject, so that matters in the subject’s natural and cultural environment have no bearing on their content. Externalism, by contrast, is then the rejection of that view. More specifically, however, the centre of attention will be on phenomenological conceptions of the mind-world relation, and the central question asked will be whether classical phenomenology—the philosophical tradition inaugurated by Husserl and continued by such thinkers as Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty—is internalist or externalist in orientation. What is the rationale behind compiling a special issue on this topic right now? There are several different reasons. • One is that the very attempt to apply what must be considered a foreign conceptual framework on phenomenological theories of intentionality can be quite	compiler;design rationale;experience;externalism;intentionality;philosophy of mind;rejection sampling;theory	Dan Zahavi	2006	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-006-9081-5	internalism and externalism;externalism;intentionality;philosophy of mind;epistemology;conceptual framework;phenomenology (philosophy);mental image;mathematics;transcendental idealism	NLP	-55.80315204652197	-23.083488610561762	65767

Working at the Institut für Neuroinformatik has been a huge chance that allowed me to discover the pleasure of interdisci-plinary and exciting scientific work. Advised by Gregor Schöner I experienced a way of doing research that I find very beautiful because of its conceptual clarity. I am very grateful for the guidance, help and inspiration he provided. What makes an aspiring and inspiring work environment is ultimately determined by the surrounding people and the Institut für Neuroinformatik seems to be a place that especially attracts this kind. Thank you all! To name a few of those, I would first like to thank Ioannis Iossifidis for always having an ear and time for discussion for the fun we had and for his cheering laugh. Christian Igel is not only a great partner for having a break but also one for intellectual sparring sessions during those breaks. I am very thankful for these as they trained me to choose my arguments well and how to discuss controversially and yet respectfully. Thanks to Evelina Dineva for teaching me good cooking and food shopping and for being a great colleague to cooperate with even if separated by a huge ocean. I think this thesis would be a pain to read without the help and valuable comments and corrections from John Lipinski. Cheers to John Spencer and the Spam lab crew: your comments and feedback on my work where very motivating and inspiring. Glasmachers and Yulia Sandamirskaya all got pieces of this thesis to read and I am very thankful for their proposals and comments. I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Christian Schmid for writing the second report on this thesis and for his valuable comments. I am grateful to my family for supporting me during my studies. Finally I thank Cordula Körber for the patience and all the love she gave me during the accomplishment of this thesis.	gesellschaft für informatik;john collison;outline of object recognition;scientific literature	Christian Faubel	2009			neural modeling fields;computer vision;computer science;3d single-object recognition;artificial intelligence;cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition	HCI	-59.04160429222819	-23.848139592747	66059

Since May 2010, when the first issue was published, JISA has encountered a growing acceptance in the academic and industrial research communities in topics related to the Internet. Indeed, the journal is now blossoming. The number of paper submissions have been increasing significantly and the impact of the papers published in the journal is growing. It is our great pleasure to announce a second phase of JISA with the journal becoming an Open Access Journal, starting on January, 2013!

a8979e1daabd5cbdae6e3d64669c405997b88639	editorial - advanced modeling and simulation in engineering sciences	theoretical and applied mechanics;computational science and engineering;classical continuum physics	© L p The true birth of a journal comes with publication of the first papers. This great moment has arrived for Advanced Modeling and Simulation in Engineering Sciences (AMSES) in the form of the first six-papers which illustrate the scope of the journal very well. AMSES, which is published by Springer, is a new peer-reviewed and fully open-access journal for the benefit of the broad community of simulation-based engineering science specialists. The authors who publish in AMSES remain the owners of their works and no transfer of copyright is required. Of course, this new publishing scheme requires that authors pay for the diffusion of their work, which is freely available for all readers worldwide, contrary to traditional schemes in which publication is free for the authors but readers must pay. In the case of AMSES, the publication fees charged to the authors are symbolic because CSMA, the French Association of Computational Mechanics, has decided to contribute three-fourths of each paper’s publication fees in order to ensure the best conditions for both the authors and the readers in our community. The scope of AMSES is the vast domain of the advanced modeling and simulation of materials, processes and structures. The emphasis is on advanced and innovative modeling approaches and numerical strategies. The journal should appeal to both academics and practitioners. The manuscripts, like any papers published in a prestigious journal, are peerreviewed. We are extremely focused on scientific quality and the AMSES Editorial Committee guarantees the rigor of the reviewing process in order to ensure the quality of the works published. I am the editor and the associate editors are F. Chinesta , A. Corrigliano , A. Huerta , J.F. Molinari , S. Reese , J. Gopalakrishnan and J. Wang. There is also an Editorial Advisory Board composed of well-known scientists in computational engineering. The ambition of AMSES is to become one of the reference journals in computational engineering and I believe this issue is a promising start.

One example is the Computational Creativity group at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. The team submitted two student-facing exercises to the EngageCSEdu as part of their dissemination plan. Not surprisingly, reviewers found the exercises highly creative and engaging. I recently sat down with two members of the Computational Creativity team, computer science professor Leen-Kiat Soh and art professor Liz Ingraham, to learn more about the project.

43b1661f0db6b29f07a542ee72adee5a134f492a	review of networked life: 20 questions and answers by mung chiang	miscellaneous	"""1 Overview Everyone—or at least anyone who uses the Internet—is impacted daily by networking technologies, whether through their use by companies such as Google, Netflix, or Facebook or in the Internet backbone itself. Scratching the surface of these technologies just a little bit, one finds great ideas from theoretical computer science underlying many of them. These applications thus provide a great """" hook """" by which to interest students in the field of computer science in general, or theoretical computer science in particular. Networked Life uses these technologies that we are all familiar with to motivate the material it covers. As a textbook, it is unusual in several respects. First, it is organized around questions—20, to be exact—rather by """" answers. """" That is to say, each of the book's 20 chapters focuses on a question that any curious person might raise (e.g., """" How does traffic get through the Internet? """"), and develops the necessary background and mathematics needed to address that question. As a consequence, material on, say, game theory is not developed in one place but is instead spread across several chapters throughout the book. The book is also written in a conversational style; moreover, each chapter is divided into sections containing a short answer to the relevant question, a longer answer, and then advanced material. Whether this works or not depends on the reader and (for this reader, at least) on the question being addressed as well. The following provides a taste of some of the questions addressed in thus book, with additional comments in parentheses about what technical material each one corresponds to: • How does a distributed system of wireless transmitters/receivers agree on a set of power levels that will allow them all to communicate without too much interference? (Linear algebra; game theory and linear programming are introduced as well though not really used.) • How do auctions work? (Game theory, algorithmic mechanism design.) • How are webpages ranked? (The Pagerank algorithm, linear algebra.) • How are networks formed, and what effects does this have? Generative graph models, the """" small-world """" phenomenon, scale-free networks.) • How are services priced, and how should they be priced?

5341f6fea906aed27b218b1783dd342bf6184ab5	review of six sources of collapse by charles r. hadlock		Charles R. Hadlock defines a “collapse” to refer loosely to “some relatively rapid process that leads to a significant reduction in quantity, quality, or level of organization” in his book “Six Sources of Collapse; A Mathematician’s Perspective on How Things Can Fall Apart in the Blink of an Eye”. Examples of collapses include the disappearance, over a period of 30 years, of the passenger pigeon population from over four billion to zero pigeons. Enron, of course, was a collapse, as was the 1929 stock market crash or the 2005-6 housing bubble. As a mathematician Hadlock focuses on understanding how and why things go unexpected and catastrophically wrong, and how can we manage the possibility of collapse. Specifically he focuses on six different sources; his list of sources is wide ranging but likely not conclusive.	charles leonard hamblin;crash (computing)	Eowyn Cenek	2014	SIGACT News	10.1145/2696081.2696089	applied mathematics;computer science;combinatorics	ML	-62.63868101768244	-21.852094577168714	67653

67e581cbd2465553f6377da847f44bbe60d1b26a	computational topology in image context	image context;computational topology	CTIC – Computational Topology in Image Context – is a series of annual international workshops devoted to gather researchers dealing with the study of topological invariants from the computational point of view, and/or who want to use topological information in image applications. The workshops intend to provide an opportunity for participants, from different fields related to computational geometry, discrete geometry, geometrical modeling, algebraic topology and image processing, to exchange ideas. CTIC has been held in Poitiers, France (2008) and St Catherine, Austria (2009). The third edition of this series was held in Chipiona, Spain, 10–12 November 2010. The next CTIC workshop will be held in Bertinoro, Italy, 28–30 May 2012. Initially, this workshop series pretended to act as a catalyst for creating new collaborations, and starting new interdisciplinary projects. To achieve this goal, participants were encouraged to present an up-to-date survey of their research related to one of the topics of the workshop (which include computational geometry, discrete geometry, geometrical modeling, algebraic topology and image processing). Recent but yet unpublished results, reports on research in progress, and recently published results (only considered for oral presentations) were submitted. Works related to image applications using topological invariants were particularly welcome. 26 Top-quality scientific papers were accepted to be presented at CTIC2010, based on the scientific reviews from 31 papers submitted. Two internationally recognized speakers accepted our invitation to present stimulating research talks: Claudia Landi, Bologna University (Italy) and Herbert Edelsbrunner, Duke University (USA). 14 Papers were selected to be extended for this special issue. After the reviewing process, 9 of them were accepted. The first paper entitled ‘‘A Point Calculus for Interlevel Set Homology’’ describes a recent development to extend persistence diagram which is a multiset of points in the extended plane representing the set of all persistent homology groups of a given real-valued tame function (a continuous function with only finitely many critical values and such that every lower level set has only finite rank homology groups). It is used to compute homology, and maps between homology, of all possible combinations of interlevel sets and relative pairs of interlevel sets of real-valued functions. The paper is written with an eye on minimizing the formalism and adding intuitive explanations where the formalism seemed necessary or useful. The second paper, ‘‘Persistent Homology and Partial Similarity of Shapes’’, also deals with the theory of Persistent Homology. In this paper, persistence diagrams are used to address the problem of shape comparison based on partial similarity. In general, two shapes having a common sub-part present a common persistent sub-diagram. Hence, the partial Hausdorff distance between persistence diagrams measures partial similarity between shapes. The third paper, entitled ‘‘How to Define a Locally Adaptive Sampling Criterion for Topologically Correct Reconstruction of Multiple Regions’’, specifies locally adaptive sampling criteria for reconstructing non-manifold surfaces in a topologically correct way. The fourth paper presents a novel algorithm to optimize the reconstruction from non-uniform point sets. This approach offers a valuable method for the evaluation of the reconstruction process without the need of visual inspection of the reconstructed database. In the fifth paper, a fast algorithm to compute cohomology groups generators of cellular decomposition of any orientable 2-manifold is described. The sixth paper, entitled ‘‘Ronse deletability conditions and (N,k)-retractions’’, provides a link between digital retractions and parallel thinning algorithms. More concretely, it gives a full characterization of the thinning algorithms that can be modeled as (N,k)-retractions (a particular kind of multivalued retraction with the property that each point is retracted to its neighbors). A definite theory of discrete surfaces is still an open problem in Digital Topology. In the seventh paper, a new family of discrete surfaces in the grid Z3 which are based on the use of certain discrete patterns (plates) in the role of polygonal faces is given. The last two papers deal with the problem of obtaining discrete Morse functions on cell complexes. The first paper entitled ‘‘Perfect Discrete Morse functions on 2-complexes’’ focuses on the study of discrete Morse functions such that the number of critical simplicies coincides with the Betti number of the complex in each dimension, on a 2D simplicial complex. The second paper introduces the foundations of a homology-based heuristic for finding optimal discrete gradient vector fields (or equivalently, optimal discrete Morse functions) on a general finite cell complex. We like to thank Gabriella Sanniti di Baja, Editor-in-Chief of Pattern Recognition Letter, for giving us the opportunity to edit this special issue and Anjana Jayaram, Journal Manager, from the editorial office, for their support in managing the issue.

Nevertheless, it is possible to identify five breakthroughs that have occurred since the time software development was recognized as a discipline in its own right: • Structured programming, in the early '70s. • The rise of the C culture (including make, pipes, shells, scripting languages), in the late '70s. • The PC revolution, in the mid '80s. • Object technology, in the early '90s. • The Internet upheaval, happening now. These approximate times do not indicate when the ideas were invented (object technology, for example, dates back to Simula in 1967) but rather when they started to affect a large segment of the industry. Also, the list does not imply a personal judgment that these events were intellectually the most important (although I do think they were all beneficial); they are simply the ones that had the most effect on the industry. Using another criterion would have resulted in a different list (Lisp, for example, is not a breakthrough in the sense used here but was an intellectual milestone). Also note that the third and fifth items are not strictly software advances: As Niklaus Wirth remarked many years ago, our field remains driven in large part by progress in hardware. So what will be the sixth break-through? To predict what might come next, it is useful to consider two breakthroughs that did not happen. Software reuse did not happen. Although some reusable software elements have achieved a remarkable degree of success, especially in the Windows world, we have failed so far to realize the vision of refounding the software field as a components-based industry. The common explanation for the failure of reuse is that it requires a better management infrastructure. I disagree with this conclusion , because I think the major issues are in fact technical (see """" The Reusability Challenge, """" Feb. 1996, pp. 76-78). Adoption of formal methods did not happen. Here too we have seen some isolated successes (not to mention incessant discussions in the pages of Computer and IEEE Software), but the effect on the industry as a whole has been little more than a scratch on the surface. To explain the failure of formal methods, many point to the typical programmer's lack of mathematical training and to …"""	approximation algorithm;code reuse;formal methods;ieee software;intellect;lisp;microcomputer revolution;microsoft windows;programmer;scripting language;simula;software development;structured programming	Bertrand Meyer	1997	Computer	10.1109/MC.1997.596640	cd-rom;computer science;software engineering;electronic component	SE	-62.66680092630487	-22.646162255396064	68507

The insight comes from an analysis of the Mathematics Genealogy Project (MGP), which aims to connect all mathematicians, living and dead, into family trees on the basis of teacher–pupil lineages, in particular who an individual's doctoral adviser was 1. The analysis also uses the MGP — the most complete such project — to trace trends in the history of science, including the emergence of the United States as a scientific power in the 1920s and the rise to dominance of different mathematical subfields. """" You can see how mathematics has evolved in time, """" says Floriana Gargiulo, who studies networks dynamics at the University of Namur, Belgium, and who led the analysis. The MGP is hosted by North Dakota State University in Fargo and co-sponsored by the American Mathematical Society. Since the early 1990s, its organizers have mined information from university departments and from individuals who make submissions regarding themselves or people they know about. As of 25 August, the MGP contained 201,618 entries. As well as doctoral advisers and pupils of mathematicians, the MGP contains details such as the university that awarded the doctorate. Previously, researchers had used the MGP to reconstruct their own PhD-family trees, or to see how many 'descendants' a researcher has. Gargiulo's team wanted to make a comprehensive analysis of the entire database and divide it into distinct families, rather than just looking at how many descendants any one person has. After downloading the database, Gargiulo and her colleagues wrote machine-learning algorithms that cross-checked and complemented the MGP data with information from Wikipedia and from scientists' profiles in the Scopus bibliographic database. This revealed 84 distinct family trees with two-thirds of the world's mathematicians concentrated in just 24 of them. The high degree of clustering arises in part because the algorithms assigned each mathematician just one academic parent: when an individual had more than one adviser, they were assigned the one with the bigger network. But the phenomenon chimes with anecdotal reports from those who research their own mathematical ancestry, says MGP director Mitchel Keller, a mathematician at Washington and Lee University in Lexing-ton, Virginia.

First, such classes often ignore the context in which scientific programming is actually done. When the goal is to teach students how to write programs, the temptation is great to tell the students exactly what programs to write. This means, however, that the person who makes up the assignments ends up doing what is often the most interesting part: reducing a real-world problem to a programming problem.		Joseph L.

dccc6d6c56c0d7eadaf2415ecbf2337836f3654e	president's letter to the acm membership		I was extremely well impressed with the size and quality of the Fall Joint Computer Conference in Las Vegas. The physical accommodations were excellent, and the number of attendees was reported as well over 4000. The program and exhibits were very good indeed, and covered a wide variety of topics. As a numerical analyst, however , I am a little sad at the scarcity of papers dealing with scientific computation. Very conspicuous at the FJCC were references to Education and the role of computing. The members of the Epilogue session predicted that future meetings would see a large increase in papers dealing with Education. Dr. Gerard of the University of California's new Irvine campus painted the most glowing picture of the future role of computing in University education. For one thing, these will provide the mechanism to replace the current method of educating students by batch-processing! Dr. Gerard sees three major events in the intellectual history of Man: (1) the development of symbols (speech) ; (2) the development of tested symbols (science); (3) the development of mental prostheses (computers). The meeting of the ACM Council with our chapter chairmen was a happy one, relatively free of the complaints which have marked earlier meetings. I believe that Don Madden and the Headquarters staff have vastly improved relations between officers and membership. The most significant discussions in the ACM Council dealt with how ACM should interface with other organizations in the computing field. For example, the Computer Personnel Research Group (CPRG) is discussing a liaison with ACM. Not all the members of CPRG are ACM members, and some might never want to join ACM as they are psychologists and personnel people. Our By-Iaws now provide that members of our Special Interest Groups must be members of ACM (at least after one year). The problem is: should ACM be more liberal about this Membership Bylaw, to facilitate affiliation with CPRG, or should we insist that ACM membership be a condition of any formal affiliation? The question is not easy, but it is very important. As computing pervades our whoie technological civilization, ACM would hope to receive many overtures like that of CPRG. If we can create mutually acceptable forms of liaison, ACM can exert the broad influence that it should on the applications of computing. If we fail in this, we will remain a body of pure computer types, able to concentrate on …	4000 series;batch processing;classes of computers;computation;computational science;computer;membership software;numerical analysis	George E.

d4af317e371541934ca99746fa70caeb93aa6f58	editorial: ontology challenges: a thumbnail historical perspective	thumbnail historical perspective	Rarely in the history of Computer Science has there been an idea that was so obviously right and that has failed for so long to deliver on its promise. In its simplest form, this idea can be phrased as follows: People use hierarchically organized knowledge about domain objects and relations as a major ingredient of their intelligent behavior. Thus, one might reason abductively, if we equip computers with this kind of knowledge and appropriate processing algorithms, we should get intelligent behavior. The earliest history of Artificial Intelligence concentrated on the processing algorithms. But, after many unexpected difficulties, research turned more and more towards the knowledge part of the Knowledge plus Reasoning Algorithms framework. Yet, paradoxically, even though large amounts of knowledge have been amassed in some areas, notably Medical Informatics, and even though knowledge structures have been studied for over 35 years, the expected big breakthrough towards computational intelligence has not happened. This leaves us with the initially mentioned paradox: Why has an idea that is so obviously right not led to the expected results? In 1968, Quillian (Quillian, 1968) published his famous semantic network paper. His network was essentially an electronic representation of a dictionary of real-world terms. Using that dictionary and spreading activation reasoning, Quillian’s program was able to generate simple natural language expressions of stored semantic relationships. Given the extremely limited hardware (in today’s view) that Quillian had available, his achievement was a major milestone that inspired research in Semantic Networks (Woods, 1975; Lehmann, 1992; Sowa, 1991), Cognitive Psychology (Collins & Quillian, 1969; Collins & Loftus, 1975;	activation function;algorithm;business object;computational intelligence;dictionary;domain-driven design;history of artificial intelligence;history of computer science;history of computing hardware;informatics;john f. sowa;natural language;semantic network;spreading activation;thumbnail	James Geller;Yehoshua Perl;Jintae Lee	2003	Knowledge and Information Systems	10.1007/s10115-003-0134-5	data science;data mining;multimedia	AI	-57.60128727709986	-23.221605730720167	71039

60aa67d7ff1fca0d90ab8304e85d27dfb5ff4f06	artificial intelligence 40 years later	artificial intelligent	In 1957, the Artificial Intelligence Project was started at MIT. Two young assistant Professors, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy launched this bold venture after the successful summer conference at Dartmouth in 1956. In that same environment were Warren McCullough, developing ideas about neural nets, Jerry Lettvin, exploring how frogs eyes and brains worked, Norbert Weiner looking at cybernetic models of machine and human behavior, and Noam Chomsky, developing formal models of language competence. Meanwhile, at what is now Carnegie Mellon University, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon were exploring Complex Information Processing-building models of human problem solving. In those first heady years, Artificial Intelligence showed promise in automating mathematical activity, understanding language, using logic to solve problems, modeling human intelligence in an analogical reasoning task, planning, and learning. Back then we thought, if only machines were a little bigger, and we had just one or two more ideas, we could develop theories and prototypes of intelligence that would both inform us about how humans work, and be our partners in solving hard problems. The bad news is that we were over-optimistic. The scale and difficulty of the problems were not apparent to us then (and may still not be now). The good news is that we have made tremendous strides both in our understanding of the theory, and in applying those theories to real problems. IJCAI-97 took place August 23-29, 1997 in Nagoya. A highlight of that conference was an impressive series of invited lectures that provided excellent examples of how far the field of Artificial Intelligence has progressed, stories of some major accomplishments and its major challenges. We decided to invite each of these speakers to submit a paper on the sub.ject of their talk to a special issue of the journal, providing them the space and the time to expand on their subject. The result is this sterling collection of papers. In continuity with those initial efforts, they show how AI has evolved to deal with problems of automating mathematics, understanding and using natural language, using logic to solve problems, planning, and learning. The first set of papers provide a look at how Artificial Intelligence is being used in “applications”, problems embedded in and defined by a real world environment.

I had given, at an IFIP WG2.3 meeting, in Belgium, a half hour presentation of how we, in Denmark, had developed a compiler for the full Ada programming language. My presentation had evolved around a single slide showing boxes and arrows between these, all properly labeled. Edsger W. Dijkstra had railed during my short presentation against my using diagrams — despite my claiming that boxes denoted certain kinds of algebras and arrows certain kind of morphisms between these. After my talk there was a coffee break. Tony Hoare took me aside. Asked permission to write in my note book.

Bring up the topic at a cocktail party with the right perspective and you can be the most popular person in the room. But bring it up in the wrong way and you can find yourself backed into a corner, watching more pleasant social interaction from afar. Your cocktail party success matters to us. We have designed this issue to contribute to your arsenal of primary sources and plausible solutions. Within are a variety of issues related to diversity in computer sci-ence—addressing not only women, but also other underrepresented groups—as well as progress of the field as a whole. From implicit bias to concrete factors that contribute to the inclusivity problem facing advanced computing, we have taken a step back to consider how we all can do better. WHY DOES DIVERSITY MATTER? When bringing up the topic of diversity , it is important to address concerns about whether it matters in the first place. Diversity matters to me because as a woman—and therefore a minority—in computing I was almost compelled to abandon computer science. This would have been a shame, as I cannot imagine being happier in any other field. There was no major traumatic event, but a steady stream of skepti-cism—skepticism that I am capable; skepticism that I belong. This skepticism can come from well-meaning people: For instance, family friends concerned that a career in computer Women, Hip-Hop, and Self-Teaching The new diversity in computing INIT science would be a """" waste of my femininity. """" This skepticism can sometimes be aggressive: For instance, people telling me, """" You'll never be as good at math as the boys. """" If several undergraduate professors had not sat me down to address my concerns, I would be doing something completely different today. However most people are not as privileged as I was. The child of two computer scientists, I grew up programming: first Logo, then Basic, and then HTML and JavaScript almost as soon as commercial web browsers existed. From elementary school onward, my weekends and summers were filled with math and technology classes and projects. I programmed robots; I programmed software applications. Studying computer science should have been a no-brainer for me, but it was not. WHAT CAN WE DO?

Although Hofstadter is not the first author of all the articles, there is a coherent vision to the whole book, reinforced by the prefaces Hofstadter wrote for each article. Two major ideas appear to underlie much of Hofstadter’s work; although these ideas are related, one is primarily a computational claim, and the other is primarily psychological. The computational claim is that cognition can be modeled using a parallel terraced scan, which builds a representation by parallel investigation of many possibilities with different levels of commitment.

9b4ba9703cc16dcd86e214785eaee2ac25093e83	afcal and the emergence of computer science in france: 1957–1967		Founded in 1957, the Association Française de Calcul (AFCAL) was the first French society dedicated mainly to numerical computation. Its rapid growth and amalgamation with sister societies in related fields (Operations Research, Automatic Control) in the 1960s resulted in changes of its name and purpose, including the invention and adoption of the term informatique in 1962-1964, then of the adoption of cybernétique in 1967. Our paper aims at explicating the motives of its creation, its evolving definition and the functions it fulfilled. We seek to understand how this association, altogether a learned and a professional society, contributed to the emergence and recognition of Computing as an academic discipline in France. The main sources are the scattered surviving records of AFCAL, conserved in the archives of the Observatoire de Paris, of the Institut de Mathématiques appliquées de Grenoble (IMAG) and of the CNRS’ Institut Blaise Pascal in Paris, as well as AFCAL’s first congress and journal, Chiffres.	archive;automatic control;computation;computer science;emergence;numerical analysis;operations research	Pierre-Éric Mounier-Kuhn;Maël Pégny	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40189-8_18	combinatorics;computer science;mathematics education;machine translation;computation;professional association;discipline	Graphics	-61.60439986265259	-12.007011846518633	77044

Rendering the task all the more challenging, the analysis focuses exclusively on the main elements of Chandler's style rather than on his minor but telling stylistic idiosyncrasies. Statistical analysis establishes that indicators of these stylistic elements can successfully detect the pastiches. Statistical stylistics (a.k.a. """"stylometrics"""") was born in 1887, when Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, a physicist, decided to pursue a suggestion he had encountered in the writings of Augustus de Morgan, a mathematician. Pondering the question of how to settle disputes about the authorship of various books, poems, and plays, Morgan advanced the principle that """"one man writing on two different subjects [should agree] more nearly with himself than two different men writing on the same subject"""". As Ellegard (1962, p. 8) later explained, this principle flowed naturally from the twin assumptions that """"some features, or combinations of features, in a particular writer's style or language, remain reasonably constant, or change in a predictable manner, throughout his production"""" and that """"some at least of * Lee Sigelman is Professor and Chair of Political Science at The George Washington University. His research interests range widely throughout the social sciences, including research methods, mass communication, political behaviour, and popular culture. With Ernest Yanarella, he co-edited Political Mythology and Popular Fiction, and has published several articles on political themes in popular literature. t William Jacoby is an associate professor in the Department of Government and International Studies at the University of South Carolina. His work has focused substantively on mass political attitudes and behavior. He has a strong interest in statistical methods, and has written extensively on dimensional analysis. these features are sufficiently rare to set the author apart from all or most of his contemporaries"""". Bycomparing distributions of word lengths in passages from several representative t xts, Mendenhall pioneered a method that stylisticians have used ever since to resolve authorship disputes (Lord, 1956; Williams, 1956). Over the years, this task has engaged not only students of language and literature, but also some of the leading statisticians of the day (e.g., Mosteller and Wallace, 1984; Yule, 1944). An author who deviates significantly from norms established for the context in which he or she is writing is said to possess a distinctive literary style (Osgood, 1960, p. 293). Style is a probabilistic phenomenon. Recognizing, for example, that even a writer who flaunts an abstruse vocabulary will also need to use many mundane words, stylisticians regard style as a general predisposition toward a particular mode of expression rather than an invariant habit or constant. In Dolezel's (1969, pp. 10-11) words, """"The overall character of a style is called forth by the degree of presence (or absence) of a certain mode of expression, rather than by its exclusive use (or complete suppression)."""" More formally: Each text can be represented by a set of measurable, statistical characteristics: T = {C1, C2 ...

This phrase has been popping into my mind as I have been following the recent raging discussions over the topic of MOOCs. For those readers who paid no attention to recent developments, a MOOC is massive open online course; it is a tuition free course taught over the Web to a large number of students. While online education has a long history, the current wave started in the fall of 2011 when about 450,000 students signed up for three computer-science courses offered by Stanford University. Since then, MOOCs have become the hottest topic of discussion in higher education in the U.S. Within months of the Stanford experiments , several start-up companies debuted, including one that immodestly claims to be """" the first elite American university to be launched in a century. """" Many leading U.S. universities now offer MOOCs, either on their own or in partnership with some of these companies, even though no business model has emerged for MOOC-based education. Some describe the current environment as """" MOOC panic """" or """" MOOC mania. """" John Hennessy, Stanford's president, describes the phenomenon as a """" tsunami. """" Early rhetoric about the educational value of MOOCs was quite lofty, talking about the goal of reaching the quality of individual tutoring, but it is difficult to reconcile such rhetoric with massive-ness as an essential feature of MOOCs. A more honest comment from one of the early MOOC pioneers was: """" We were tired of delivering the same lectures year after year, often to a half-empty classroom because our classes were being videotaped. """" In fact, the absence of serious pedagogy in MOOCs is rather striking, their essential feature being short, unsophisticated video chunks, interleaved with online quizzes, and accompanied by social networking. The bitter truth, however, is that academic pedagogy has never been very good. It is well established that a professorial soliloquy is an ineffective way of teaching. We do know what works and what does not work when it comes to teaching. Much has been written in the last few years about """" active learning , """" """" peer learning, """" """" flipping the lecture, """" and the like, yet much of academic teaching still consists of professors monologuing to large classes.

5b3e587c79c96f2cab23cf6e797325425e77adf3	on the legacy of berthold schweizer (1929-2010)	berthold schweizer	In 2010, Professor Berthold Schweizer passed away in Oakland (USA). He was not involved directly in his own research in Fuzzy Sets Theory but all readers of Fuzzy Sets and Systems and researchers in this area have been using a lot of mathematical concepts and results that were developed by him and his collaborators. This is the reason to take now the opportunity to evoke Schweizer’s life and legacy. Berthold Schweizer was born in Germany in a Jewish family that emigrated to the United States of America in 1937. He became interested in Mathematics and studied in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (B.S. 1951) and at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago (M.S. 1954). At this institution he earned his Ph.D. in 1956 under Karl Menger. Berthold Schweizer had a long and successful academic career. He taught at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory (1951–1952), IIT (1956–1957), San Diego State College (1957–1958), UCLA (1958–1960), the University of Arizona (1960–1965 and 1968–1970) and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (1965–1968) and from 1970 until his retirement in 1996. He had several visiting appointments in Vienna (1974), Perugia (1974), Barcelona (1981), Lecce (1981), Bern (1981) and Beijing (1982). He was the adviser of 12 Ph.D. students and also mentored many post-doctoral students and visitors from the United States and various foreign countries. Berthold Schweizer and Abe Sklar were the founders of the theory of probabilistic metric spaces, a concept introduced by Karl Menger in 1942 that Schweizer, Sklar, and their students developed. It was in this mathematical elaboration of the theory of probabilistic metric spaces that Schweizer and Sklar developed a remarkable body of new mathematical machinery, using techniques from the theory of functional equations and inequalities, and making important contributions to the study of the associative functions in real intervals (t-norms, t-conorms) and the theory of copulas (created by Abe Sklar). While Schweizer’s Ph.D. dissertation was on Jacobi series, at the end of the 1950s he had the key idea that the theory of statistical metric spaces (introduced by Karl Menger in 1942) was a field to be developed. His friend Abe Sklar joined him in this proposal and with various research papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960 they started a fruitful and long scientific collaboration. It became clear from the very beginning that, in order to work in that field, it was necessary to develop new mathematical results on semigroups of probability distribution functions that enable a triangle inequality in probabilistic metric spaces to be devised. So doing, it also became evident that many such semigroups could be induced by semigroups in the real unit interval [0,1], so it was necessary to study the functional equation of associativity in real intervals, extending the foundational work of János Aczél: t-norms and t-conorms arose at that time. Several times I had discussions with Schweizer about the name “t-norm”. The “t-” was related to the historical interest on the “triangle inequality” and the word norm was confusing because it had no relation with the norms in normed spaces. But the expression t-norm already had such popularity that he thought it would be better not to change it. Berthold Schweizer wrote many papers and some fundamental books, always working with Abe Sklar or his students. In the last years he was working with Abe Sklar on the publication of Menger’s legacy and a new project concerning what they called the grammar of functions. It is interesting to note that beyond the interest of probabilistic metric spaces, Schweizer’s work had a profound impact on other fields: functional equations, inequalities, fuzzy sets theory, mathematical models in economics, etc. When, in 1965, L. Zadeh founded the theory of fuzzy sets, the associative operations Maximum and Minimum were used to perform generalized unions and intersections, but some years later, in the 1980s these operations were replaced by t-norms and t-conorms.

Hardy attempted to take comfort fro m the fact that number theory, his area of specialty, might never be put to any use, especially use tha t Hardy would not have approved of. Hardy was naive. Stanislas Ulam, the """"pure"""" mathematician turned physicist, is credited with being the co-inventer of the hydrogen bomb-a dubious honor. Yet the path that ideas will lead to, even those initially developed for reasons of unlikely value t o mankind, are difficult to chart. What is perhaps closer to the truth than Hardy's hope is a though t of the topologist Leo Zippin : if some mathematician is clever enough to find what seems to b e hopelessly abstract results, some other mathematician will be clever enough to find a use for th e results. Many theorists in mathematics and computer science today live in a world more define d by the potential of big dollar signs than that their work may sit admired merely for its """"beaut y and elegance"""" in a scholarly journal. Today, theoreticians may be reluctant to publish some o f their """"beautiful """" work in a scholarly journal too soon, lest this action serve as an impediment t o the use of the idea as part of a patent application. Software patents and other emerging trends i n intellectual property law are becoming part of the ivory tower world. Hardy, I suspect, would not have approved. Although the issue of the good and evil that can be a consequence of one's work in mathematic s or computer science is not explicit in the new book Privacy on the Line by Whitfield Diffie an d Susan Landau, it might well be. Researchers have developed a wide variety of mathematical an d computer science tools which, when used in conjunction with other developments in physics an d engineering, are related to a wide array of new digital technologies. These new technologies, such as bar codes, fax, email and voice mail, a wide array of new kinds of pagers, wireless telephony , ATM machines, digital television, the World Wide Web, etc ., are changing the way people all ove r the world lead their lives and do business. Although they do not always require codes for thei r functioning, codes are in many ways directly related to these new technologies because codes ca …"""	atm turbo;barcode;code;computer science;email;fax;hydrogen;leo (computer);software patent debate;susan landau;world wide web	Joseph Maklevitch	1999	SIGACT News	10.1145/309739.1041970	theoretical computer science;computer science;applied mathematics	Theory	-60.430765690213	-23.350375970895293	79070

I argue that three central tenets arise from feminist attention to the dynamics of gender and oppression in the theories and methods of science: 1) a rejection of the science/politics dichotomy; 2) an acknowledgement of the epistemic import of subjective components of knowledge; and 3) a reconfiguration of the subject of knowledge. These three tenets are illustrated and supported through examples from the history of science.	rejection sampling;theory	Nancy Tuana	1995	Synthese	10.1007/BF01064509	genus;politics;feminist philosophy;empiricism;philosophy;epistemology;methodology;mathematics;subjectivity;knowledge;history of science;theory	AI	-52.63957389892529	-20.231265757181774	79150

We want to thank Vijay Nair for the excellent job he has done in serving as guest editor for these articles. We see Technometrics as a natural home for these papers. Over the last 50 years, Technometrics has established itself as a premier journal for the development and application of statistical methods in the physical, chemical and engineering sciences. Although the term engineering sciences is very broad, the journal has traditionally been an outlet for papers that deal with industrial statistics in areas related to manufacturing and to R&D. We continue to attract and publish good papers that make valuable contributions in our traditional application areas, and we will maintain our strong standing there. At the same time, we recognize that in recent years many exciting developments in industrial statistics have been in the information sciences. The journal’s coverage has included an increasing number of papers in this area and we welcome these contributions. Technometrics would like to actively promote submission of papers that present new research and stimulating applications in areas of information science and technology in general. Toward this goal, we have explicitly added the phrase information sciences and technology to our mission statement on the inside cover of the journal. We thus see this special issue of exciting invited articles as providing an overview and sampling of potential areas of interest to Technometrics. We want to encourage authors to consider Technometrics as a venue for publishing papers in these areas. The journal will publish papers that develop new techniques, papers that describe innovative application of statistics, expository papers on statistical methods or on problem areas with wide interest and importance, and papers dealing with the philosophy and problems of applying statistical methods.	code coverage;information science;sampling (signal processing);technometrics;venue (sound system)	Randy R.

Or rather, it wants to provide to scholars who are interested in using computers opportunities to start or continue their studies. The aim in giving the fellowships, then, is simply to support worthwhile research in which computers are used, and, by doing that, to find out what further uses might be made of them. The Council does not consider that it is especially urging or even encouraging scholars in the humanities to use computers; nor is it saying that computers should have a wider use. As we know, though, computers are being used more and more extensively. And the fellowship program helps us to see the range of uses, routine to revolutionary, that they might come to have.	association for computers and the humanities;computer	Irwin C.

6ee42ddc5a7add085d69e65d89eaf4ca1f0f86b5	common sense, the turing test, and the quest for real ai, hector levesque. the mit press (2017)		Hector Levesque, a distinguished AI researcher, an AAAI Fellow, etc., etc., surely well known to all readers of this journal, has written a book for all those other people, roughly 7.5 billion strong, who don’t read this journal and who might be, or at any rate, darn well should be interested in AI. The book is a completely and consistently, almost aggressively, non-technical introduction, not to AI as a whole — what could such a book even look like? — but to a budget, as the British might say, of questions and issues centered on the Turing Test and on the nature of work in AI that might plausibly be held to address the Test. This review is, of course, intended for readers of this journal! Still, I can not pretend to be addressing a technically naive audience. So this review will be silent on many aspects and parts of the book; indeed it will not be or at any rate will not read like a review of the book at all. Instead, I shall focus mostly on conceptual — and even some historical — issues about the nature of the field of Artificial Intelligence that are raised in the book. To that end, I am going to start off with a rather lengthy introduction, almost all of which — maybe all of which — should really go without saying to the intended and foreseen audience of this review. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a young discipline. It has to be young, as it cannot be older than Computer Science and the latter is now 80 years old. It is usually a bit of a fool’s game to try to date such things as the birth of a field or discipline, but (a) the origins of Computer Science really can’t be thought of as hidden in the mists of time and (b) I’m a bit of a fool. So, Computer Science begins with Alan Turing’s 1936/7 paper “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem”. Of course, there were precursors and Turing stood on the shoulders of giants, etc., but still... . Now one might say that AI was born in that same paper, that AI and CS are twins, coeval. Yes, one might, but I won’t. In any case, for now I want to keep looking for the origin story of AI. (The reader might wonder: “what’s up with the whole ’36/37 thing?” Picky, picky! Exactly! Turing was picky and made corrections, published in ’37, to the original published version, which was itself published in two parts, in late ’36.) Many people find that origin in yet another paper by Turing, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, this one from 1950. I think, though I am not sure, that our author is indeed inclined to put the origin there. Not only am I not sure about that attribution to Levesque, I am sure that it matters not a wit, as there can be no serious doubt about the absolutely and uniquely central role played by Turing, in the years between ’37 and the early ’50’s, especially after ’45, in the founding of AI. In any case, in that ’50 paper, itself meant for a “popular” audience, though not published in an especially popular journal, Turing addressed the question, then (as now, I fear) much (?) discussed by the “educated public”, of whether the then new-fangled electronic digital computing machines could (be said to) think. Turing noted that if we address this question “head on”, we get nowhere, so he proposed that we consider operationalizing the question, that is, that we consider ways of testing whether or not machines can think, ways of eliciting observable behavior from them such that (roughly) if they could indeed behave fairly reliably and robustly in such-and-such ways, we would and should be strongly inclined to acknowledge that they were intelligent — more crucially, that they acted intelligently — and hence (?) that they must be thinking. Before going on, I should note my own very strong preference, which I think I share with Turing and with Levesque, for focusing on verbs and especially adverbs, not on nouns, and especially not on abstract nouns. That is, though the name of the field is “Artificial Intelligence” and the name of Turing’s paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, the real focus is on artifacts acting intelligently. And though the question that Turing seems to want to address is whether machines can think, the question he ends up actually addressing, the desired end of the whole of idea of operationalizing the original question, is whether machines can act intelligently, and thus thoughtfully. One last bit on this: I feel more comfortable with the issues of machines acting intelligently than with those — if they are at all different — that arise with questions of acting thoughtfully. The latter suggests to me kindness and compassion, truly admirable traits but, sadly, rather unfair to the poor machines if, that is, we simply assume that people reliably and robustly display them. Turing suggests a number of possible tests, and rather sketchily at that, before settling on what has come to be called the Imitation Game. The original Imitation Game Turing described is a simple party game involving three players: Player A is a man, player B is a woman and player C (who plays the role of the interrogator) can be of either sex.

[editor's remarks]	technological advancement;famous aesop;happy new year;new issue;broad area;lunar calendar;uncertain time;current technological environment	Being the first issue of 2011, I would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year. We have just ushered in the Year of the Rabbit in the Lunar calendar and with this, I am reminded of a famous Aesop’s fable entitled ‘The Tortoise and the Hare’. Like the speed of the Hare, our current technological environment has progressed in leaps and bounds. But let us not forget the broad areas of technological advancements in security and defense as new issues emerge in today’s uncertain times. Challenges such as the need to detect critical situations and adapt to emerging threats with appropriate and rapid reactions are often beyond the scope of traditional problem-solving techniques. With the advancement of Computational Intelligence (CI) technologies, there has been increased interest in applying state-of-the-art CI techniques for solving challenging defense problems with a new perspective, as featured in the theme of this issue on security and defense applications. In this issue’s Society Briefs, the new CIS Vice President for Members Activities, Pablo Estevez outlines the vision statement for members activities. In Career Profile, we interview Chin-Teng Lin of National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan. The new Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems spoke about his immediate plans for the publication. We also congratulate the 2011 IEEE CIS Awards recipients for their outstanding achievements in the field, and present the conference report of 2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI) in the issue. During a trip to China late last year, I was delighted to attend the 5th International Symposium on Intelligence Computation and Applications in Wuhan, and the 2010 International Workshop on Nature Inspired Computation and Applications in Hefei. The events provided good platforms for in-depth discussions and exchange of scientific ideas among delegates from overseas and China, showing increasing interests of computational intelligence research in China.

39be285c8659cff88578f91d405b10f4061f5a38	studying human expertise: beyond the binary paradigm		"""The empirical study of human expertise has grown up largely within the information-processing framework. We contend that assumptions and practices inherited from that framework have signi® cantly hampered the study of expertise. Most studies have been conducted within a binary paradigm that sets novices apart from experts while ignoring any qualitative distinctions in between. End-state description has been preferred over accounts of learning ; accounts of learning as a smoothly continuous process have been preferred over accounts of qualitative change. To overcome the binary paradigm, psychologists need to adopt an explicitly developmental approach, one that identi ® es multiple way stations toward expertise and seeks to explain qualitative changes in knowledge and motivation. We consider two insu ciently developmental conceptions (` theory-change ’ accounts and global stage models) and two others that, in our view, harbour greater promise (the Piagetian framework as elaborated by Feldman and the Vygotskian framework as extended by Scribner). Progress in the study of human expertise doesn’ t just depend on the more widespread adoption of developmental research programmes. There also needs to be more open and frank discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of diŒerent frameworks than has been customary. 1. Expertise and information processing psychology Over the past quarter century, the study of human expertise has burgeoned. It is now an entrenched specialty within cognitive science. As empirical studies have proliferated, the vast majority of them dependent on information-processing (IP) models of human cognition, certain strategies of empirical research and modes of explanation have become habitual. W e are concerned that these strategies and modes of explanation, valuable as they were in launching the ® eld, now constitute an impediment to further growth in psychologists’ knowledge of expertise. Speci® cally, they impede our understanding of the processes by which expertise develops. We describe alternative research strategies that we believe are able to do justice to the developmental questions. Some developmental conceptions, such as the `theorychange ’ approach and global stage models of expertise, are radically incomplete ; they oŒer some insights but in the end are inadequate to account for the acquisition of expertise.

L . Campbell and L. Di Bello they make are often sharply at variance with those that prevail in IP and AI. W e would like to spark some public discussion about the merits of developmental versus IP approaches to human expertise ; at present, there is scarcely any. In this article, we draw many of our examples from computer programming. Maybe we are simply appealing to convenience, as some of our own empirical studies have been in this ® eld. All that matters for our current purposes is that computer programming contains several rich domains of expertise, and that empirical studies have been going on long enough in this ® eld to let us assess what conventional approaches have taught us and what remains inaccessible to them. Empirical work on expertise in computer programming began in the mid-1970s (Brooks 1977, Sheil 1981, Shneiderman 1980). The usual goal of such research has been to exhibit diŒerences between a group of novice programmers and a group of expert programmers. Some typical ® ndings : expert programmers are better than novices at recalling meaningful (but not scrambled) ALGOL programs (McKeithen et al. 1981) ; they are better at ® nding bugs, particularly those that depend on a high-level representation of the programs they read (Gould 1975, Adelson 1984) ; and they are more likely than novices to use standard programming plans (Soloway and Ehrlich 1984). In a rather unusual piece of research that approached acquisition more systematically and sought a process explanation, the transition from novice to expert was taken to consist in the acquisition of a body of syntactic rules, chartable using the Power Law of Practice (Anderson et al. 1989). 2. The binary paradigm All of these empirical studies have operated within the con® nes of the binary paradigm (Campbell et al. 1992). W ork within this paradigm presumes that : (1) Novice ± expert is a binary distinction. (2) Novice knowledge and expert knowledge can be compared statically. (3) Experts are people with a certain amount of experience, rather than people who satisfy speci® c criteria of knowledge or skill. A few thoughts about the range of computer programming ability to be found in the real world instantly cast doubt on the ® rst and third assumptions. Can we do justice to the full spectrum of skill and the long, hard path to its acquisition when we try to describe it all with two categories ? If an `expert ’ in one study has passed several programming courses and an `expert ’ in another is a professional at the top of her ® eld, what do they have in common ? Those who imposed the binary paradigm on expertise in programming did not lack for models. The classic studies of expertise in the IP framework, such as Chase and Simon’ s (1973) examination of memory for chess positions, or Chi et al.’ s (1981) treatment of problem categorizations in Newtonian mechanics by students and instructors, relied on the binary categorization already mentioned. They did this even though some IP researchers insisted, quite early on, that true expertise takes at least 10 years to acquire (Chase and Simon 1973, Ericsson et al. 1993). M oreover, the classic IP studies concentrated on describing the `expert ’ end state rather than the process of acquiring expert knowledge or the way stations along the path toward expertise. 3. The commitment to end state description The preference for describing the end state is not an accidental quirk. It is symptomatic of choices made during the early days of IP research : D ow nl oa de d by [ T he A ga K ha n U ni ve rs ity ] at 0 1: 24 2 1 O ct ob er 2 01 4 Beyond novice ± expert 279 Our emphasis on perform ance 1⁄4 represents a scienti® c bet 1⁄4 we have too imperfect a view of the system ’ s ® nal nature to be able to make predictions from the developm ental process to the characteristics of the structure it produces 1⁄4 If perform ance is not well understoo d, it is som ewhat premature to study learning. Nonethe less, we pay a price for the omission of learning, for we might otherwise draw inferences about the perform ance system from the fact that the system must be capable of modi® cation through learning. (Newell and Simon 1972, pp. 7± 8) It is not surprising, then, that Glaser’s (1989) latter-day summary of what IP studies have taught us about expertise emphasizes `components of competent """" performance ’ : the manner in which expert knowledge is structured ; the manner in which problems are categorized ; a move from declarative to `compiled ’ procedural knowledge and from controlled to automatic processing ; metacognitive skills ; and theory or schema change. # `As learning theorists 1⁄4 we appear to be at the novice stage of less than integrated bundles of knowledge 1⁄4 On the other hand, the picture of the goal states of competence is rich ’ (Glaser 1989, pp. 278± 279). 4. Inadequate accounts of acquisition Even those IP eŒorts that pay heed to the process of acquisition are hemmed in by theoretical preoccupations. The lesson that Ericsson and Staszewski (1989) and Staszewski (1988) wish to draw from a landmark longitudinal study of mental calculation is that acquiring expertise means acquiring skills for managing one’ s working memory. That experts in mental multiplication (or in some other areas, like keeping track of diners’ orders in a busy restaurant) need such skills we do not doubt. It remains to be seen what role working memory management plays in such expert accomplishments as recognizing that a Smalltalk program is inelegant and unmaintainable (Campbell et al. 1992) or sensing that all ® re ® ghters must vacate the building immediately because the  ̄ oor is about to fall in (Klein et al. 1989). In another exhibition of theoretical preoccupation that has now become textbook material, Anderson et al. (1989) and Anderson (1995) set out to reduce progress toward expertise to such operations as chunking, compilation of declarative knowledge into procedures, and the Power Law of Practice. Another researcher has gone so far as to ® t a power function to changes over time in the rating points of tournament chess players (Charness 1989). Such explanations assume that `practice makes perfect ’ (Cooke 1990)Ð or, at least, that deliberate practice does (Ericsson et al. 1993). And they simply can’ t account for qualitative change, or new knowledge. Chunking depends on the production rules already built into the system, and the pre-existing symbols in which their conditions are stated. The Power Law of Practice applies whenever some dimension of performance can be charted on a continuous scale of measurement over time. W hen speed is that dimension, the Power Law is a mathematical description of speedier execution with practiceÐ speedier execution of the same skills. It can’ t explain how previously acquired skills are modi® ed, or new skills are acquired. IP accounts of automaticity imply that what becomes automatic is virtually the same as it was before ; the only important diŒerence is that it no longer requires conscious attention for its execution. What really happens when children get better at answering questions like `What is 5 ­ 4 ? ’ ?

IPSJ SIG-IOT is a similar association to ACM SIGUCCS in Japan. It retains about four hundred members who are mainly managers and operators of ICT infrastructures in universities and colleges, and staff members of companies. The activity of IPSJ SIG-IOT focuses on the technologies for the Internet in general and the techniques for the construction, operation, and administration of the distributed computer/network systems. IPSJ SIG-IOT organizes regularly four workshops and one sym-posium once a year, and also issues a special section in the IPSJ journal every year. All papers submitted for the symposiumsand journals are reviewed. IPSJ SIG-IOT participates in the Multimedia, Distributed, Cooperative, and Mobile Symposium (DICOMO) every year, as one of the organizing SIGs. It also hosts the Workshop on Company, Campus and Community Networking (C3NET) every year. C3NET is a workshop of the International Symposium on Applications and the Internet (SAINT), which is co-sponsored by IPSJ and IEEE CS. The fields of operational technologies may look modest and tend to be shunned, especially by young people. However, it must be an important portion of the fundamentals of the ICT (Information and Communication Technology) infrastructures that continue to grow. We are encouraging the research activities and preparing academic papers for young people and hope the activities of IPSJ SIG-IOT help to convey the importance of the field.	information processing;internet;organizing (structure)	Takashi Yamanoue;Naomi Fujimura;Hideo Masuda;Motonori Nakamura	2012		10.1145/2382456.2382492	library science;engineering management;engineering;operations research	Arch	-61.747501415243754	-15.626085273925566	82070

The fact that many of them are similar in scope and content seems to suggest that the field has reached maturity. The first books on classical control were published shortly before the World War II. It is possible to detect a few early books that had a strong influence on how the field was to evolve, at least in what concerns textbooks. Several topics have been dropped throughout the years, many have converged to a “standard” form of presentation, and others were included on the way. The main aim of this paper was to describe the development in the content of classical control textbooks and to illustrate the great diversity of terms used in the early days of the field. Emphasis is placed on books published in the 1940s and 1950s. This historical point of view is especially relevant to those who teach control at various levels and will provide motivation for students.	linear system	Luis Antonio Aguirre	2015	Annual Reviews in Control	10.1016/j.arcontrol.2015.03.002	mathematics education;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;mathematics	Logic	-58.57945689186768	-20.921606313494255	82601

Emulated body functions range from hormones and drugs acting on cell membranes to high-level responses. As part of the IEEE 1275 standard, Forth helped me create a source-code library of individually compilable nervous system components, per Priami. The library includes human childhood development milestones, epinephrine and oxytocin hormone functions, a pain mechanism and narcotic effects, the fear mechanism, and retrograde neuronal signaling via the endocannab-inoid system. Recent enhancements include a form of autism based on a defective oxytocin receptor, the fibro-myalgia syndrome (with simulated viral activity, immune-system responses, and antiviral antibiotic effects), and Bayesian probabilistic functions. The system reflects intentional software and hardware flexibility. Using tiny six-pin eight-bit PIC10Fxx series microcontrollers, I've designed 35 different digital McCulloch-Pitts and ana-log Hebb artificial neurons. I also added eight-core 32-bit Parallax processors for coordinating brain stem sensorim-otor, cerebellar, and low-level cortical activities. Moreover, the system can extend its original Forth-based, byte-coded AI scripting language via genetic algorithms to provide a form of machine learning and execution. It is also capable of examining its own internal variables, short-and long-term memory , knowledge base, and preferences profile to provide a limited form of self-awareness and personality expression. I look forward to more such intelligent machines created through the kind of algorithmic systems biology explored by Priami.

The style has sometimes been characterized as austere or severe. It may, occasionally be also somewhat elliptic. The ideas are presented in a most economical fashion and the author does expect the reader to be able to fill in the more obvious details. This permits him to present the leading ideas in an uncluttered way. Finally, while the ultimate verdict on the work, like everything human, belongs to history, those of us, who were fortunate enough to have known Harold Davenport, cannot help remembering also the man. While much of what he was-cultured, articulate, logical-is indeed reflected in his work, not everything is. He was generous with his time and enjoyed (or at least seemed to enjoy) showing Cambridge to his guests. While, to judge by his students, his standards must have been very high, he was quite patient with the more common brand of mankind and made genuine efforts to make himself understood by the less sophisticated reader (see, e.g., his book """"The Higher Arithmetic""""). In fact, this reviewer can recall only one outburst of impatience (or indignation?) of Davenport: it was with mathematicians who claim results, but never publish their proofs, either because they don't have any, or in order to keep their methods as private property of a small group of close collaborators. No names were named. The reviewer wants to take this opportunity to thank Professor D. J. Lewis for a very helpful letter concerning Davenport which confirmed many and completed some of the reviewer's own recollections. In the early sixties, stimulated by the discoveries of M. P. Schûtzenberger, a number of researchers at the University of Paris contributed to a new"""	automaton;theory	Arto Salomaa;Matti Soittola	1978		10.1007/978-1-4612-6264-0	formal system;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;formal methods;regular language;formal verification;pure mathematics;automata theory;mathematics	DB	-59.88798538569267	-22.29575053524388	84940

I am grateful to be trusted by the Board of Directors and the Editorial Advisory Board of EMC Society and have this opportunity to further serve our community. TEMC is the flagship publication of our society and has become the most prestigious and professional journal to publish state-of-the-art research in the field of EMC. I am very sure it could not be achieved without the dedicated and excellent effort from past EiCs, Prof. M. d’Amore, Prof. F. Canavero, Dr. P. Wilson, Prof. H. Garbe, Prof. F. Rachidi, and Prof. A. Orlandi. The outgoing EiC, Prof. Orlandi, has done great job in his term. The paper submission number, paper quality, and reviewing efficiency are all steadily increased. Besides the leadership of Prof. Orlandi, the hardwork and collaboration of all associate editors (AE), reviewers, and authors keep the TEMC in high standard and reputation. In my three-year term, I would like to continue pursuing QATS for TEMC, which means Quality, State-of-the-Art, Timeliness, and Scope. High quality of the paper—both in content and reviewing process—is the key to keep leading and influential for the journal in the community. The paper submission number has significantly increased in past few years. I will try my best to work closely with AE team to maintain the quality of TEMC as high as past years. The baseline for each accepted papers would satisfy following two conditions: the research outcome is state-of-the-art and the discussed topic is within the scope of EMC. Both criterions are indispensable factors for	am broadcasting;baseline (configuration management)	Tzong-Lin Wu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility	10.1109/TNSE.2017.2701561	software engineering;control engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	Visualization	-62.15973659578293	-17.501518732018834	85071

c1fd7c3e2b1562d14c12afcfab55989aa3b8225a	special issue on the 12th international conference on geometric modeling and processing (gmp 2018)		The International Conference on Geometric Modeling and Processing (GMP) is an annual conference series that has brought together world leading researchers and practitioners in geometric modeling, simulation, and computing since its inauguration in Hong Kong in 2000. The modeling and processing of geometric data is fundamental to many applications, including computer graphics, computer vision, computer aided design and manufacturing, medical imaging, engineering analysis, robotics, additive manufacturing, and robotics. GMP conferences provide researchers and practitioners with a forum for exchanging new ideas, discussing new applications, and presenting new solutions. Previous GMP conferences were held in Xiamen (2017), San Antonio (2016), Lugano (2015), Singapore (2014), Huangshan (2012), Castro Urdiales (2010), Hangzhou (2008), Pittsburgh (2006), Beijing (2004), Tokyo (2002), and Hong Kong (2000). The papers in this special issue of Computer Aided Geometric Design were presented at the 12th GMP Conference in the beautiful city of Aachen, Germany from April 9–11, 2018. The call for papers attracted a total of 104 submissions. Submitted papers were double-blind reviewed by at least three members of the program committee and underwent a two-stage reviewing process. Based on the recommendation of the reviewers, 26 papers were selected for presentation at the conference and for publication in this issue, and an additional 5 papers were invited to be revised and resubmitted to a regular issue of Computer Aided Geometric Design. The papers in this special issue were organized into eight dedicated sessions at the conference, specifically geometric modeling, surface and volume parametrization, B-spline and Bernstein–Bézier representations, adaptive and innovative spline representations, shape and point cloud analysis, isogeometric analysis, manufacturing and fabrication-aware design, and three-dimensional printing. The conference also featured four keynote lectures, including “Active Modeling through Pro-active Sensing” by Baoquan Chen, “Beneath the Surface: Volumetric Geometry Processing from Boundary Representations” by Justin Solomon, “Analysis-Suitable CAD and Isogeometric Analysis” by Michael Scott, and “Fusing Computation and Advanced Manufacturing” by Bernd Bickel. Finally, the conference featured an invited paper from Computer Aided Geometric Design and two invited papers from the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. For the second consecutive year, Elsevier and Computer Aided Geometric Design sponsored a Best Paper Award contest, and authors of award-winning papers received a certificate and $200 USD prize. The 2018 Best Paper Award winners were Yunku Kang for his paper “Fast and Robust Hausdorff Distance Computations from Triangle Mesh to Quad Mesh in Near-Zero Cases”, István Kovács for his paper “P-Bézier and P-Bspline Curves – New Representations with Proximity Control”, and Jochen Hinz for his paper “Elliptic Grid Generation Techniques in the Framework of Isogeometric Analysis Applications”. Each of these papers are included in this special issue. We extend our congratulations to each of the Best Paper Award winners, and we thank Elsevier for their financial support of the contest and the award committee for their efforts in reviewing each of the submissions. We extend our sincere thanks to all of the authors and international program committee members whose collective effort has produced this outstanding compilation of works on geometric modeling and processing. We are also deeply grateful to the conference co-chairs Leif Kobbelt, Scott Schaefer, and Hiromasa Suzuki for their constant and much appreciated support and advice, and we thank Stefanie Behnke for providing assistance with the reviewing system. Special thanks are due to Rida T. Farouki and Konrad Polthier, the Editors-in-Chief of Computer Aided Geometric Design, and to Suganya Dorai, Qian Jiao, and the entire Elsevier support team for the production of this special volume. Last, but not least, we thank RWTH Aachen University for hosting the conference.	3d printing;b-spline;bernd michael rode;bézier curve;chow–liu tree;compiler;computation;computer graphics;computer vision;computer-aided design;entity–relationship model;gnu multiple precision arithmetic library;geometric design;geometric modeling;geometry processing;hausdorff dimension;hsinchun chen;isogeometric analysis;justin (robot);medical imaging;phil bernstein;point cloud;rsa conference;robotics;simulation;triangle mesh;utility functions on indivisible goods	David Bommes;John A.

Because its significance and flexibility were quickly recognized, there were numerous attempts to apply it to diverse fields outside of its original scope. This prompted Shannon to write his famous essay “The Bandwagon” (Shannon 1956), warning against indiscriminate use of the new tool. Nevertheless, non-standard applications of Information Theory persisted. Very soon after Shannon’s initial publication (Shannon 1948), several manuscripts provided the foundations of much of the current use of information theory in neuroscience. MacKay and McCulloch (1952) applied the concept of information to propose limits of the transmission capacity of a nerve cell.

He said that the whole becomes lively when centers intensify each other and proposed fifteen fundamental properties that describe how centers intensify each other. These properties are geometrical so it is still unknown whether it will work for things that are hard to perceive only by shapes or spatial characteristics, such as human actions or society. In this paper, we present the fundamental behavioral properties of lively human actions, found through the investigation of human activity Pattern Languages on the basis of Alexander's theory of wholeness and center.

The paper from China refers to robust identification of discrete-time stochastic systems. The title recalls the work of Gaines and Witten, but these are not quoted; perhaps a different type of model is sought. The paper from Germany is on derivatives of probability measures, treated in the abstract with reference to Borel fields and Banach spaces, but with an assurance of applicability to the optimization of stochastic systems. The paper from U.S.S.R. deals with a physical problem referred to as the separation of jets. It shows that the mathematics of this is related to the asymptotic properties of random series. It is a little disappointing to find that the term jet is used in a special sense which does no imply a fountain-type emission. Nevertheless the separation phenomenon could be interesting in theoretical neurobiology, where there has recently been much interest in the Ising model from physics because of its multiplicity of stable states. As in other books in Springer Lecture Notes series, these papers are erudite and highly mathematical. They have been prepared in camera-ready form by the respective authors and there are minor variations in layout and type-face, but everything is well-presented with a general air of scholarship and appropriate references to other work.

Hardcover, $69.95, 344 pages, 189 illustrations. Artificial life models in software is a unique book that showcases a variety of freely available software for artificial life simulations. At first glance it may appear to be nothing new, but actually it is quite unprecedented. In these pages readers have a quick overview of what kind of simulation tools are available off the shelf on the Web today and what can be done by using them. It will be valuable for many related to artificial life, especially as an introductory reading for students who are about to plunge into this creative field of research. It will also be a nice informative reference for professional researchers and educators. Moreover, the software models introduced in this book should be quite appealing to nonscientific readers as well, potentially contributing to the outreach of artificial life research to a general audience.

5d8733771d250d163da5ccbb8fd0420935438595	a tribute to martin woodward		As this issue of STVR was going to press, we were all shocked by the sudden death of Martin Woodward on October 27, 2006. As you can see from the Editorial in this issue written by Lee White, a new Chief Editor had been named on the announcement of the retirement of both Martin Woodward and Lee White as Editors of STVR; that new Chief Editor is Jeff Offutt. Martin was planning to write an Editorial for the next issue, 17(1), of STVR to explain his resignation as Editor, and to share other thoughts on his experiences as Chief Editor of the Journal. Since Martin will not have that opportunity, several of us would like to offer a tribute to Martin and to share some of our experiences with him over the last 13 years.	experience;martin woodward;software testing, verification & reliability	Lee White;A.

Clearly, neither of us is Allen Newell, and there is no way that we can do the job he would have liked to have done in responding to these thought-provoking reviews of Unified Theories of Cognition (henceforth, UTC). However, it was very important to Allen-and is very important to us--that the work on Soar and unified theories of cognition carry on. So, here we will do what we can based on our combined understanding of Soar, cognitive science, Allen, and how he would have likely responded to the issues raised by these reviews. In this latter, we have been greatly aided by a prepublication print of [ 12] that was graciously provided to us by the editors of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, and by Newell's follow-on paper to UTC [13]. In general, we will try to be clear about when we are conveying how we think Allen would have responded, and when we are just giving our own views.	cognitive science;soar (cognitive architecture);theory;unified theories of cognition	Paul S.

869dee619f48312d89d54209054fc97748f5c99b	editorial notice		The overwhelming success of TOMCCAP in recent years, made possible, in particular, by the hard work of our friend, Nicolas D. Georganas, has resulted in a rather special situation. We currently have a backlog of articles, which has resulted in a publication delay of almost 18 months. Given that such a delay is really too excessive for a top journal in our cutting-edge field of multimedia, we are taking measures to reduce this delay. Thus, together with the editorial board, we have decided to introduce online-only issues to TOMCCAP as the first step towards addressing this challenge. We are happy to announce that starting this year, we will have a fifth TOMCCAP issue published as a supplementary issue in an online-only manner. This procedure has several advantages; in addition to greater flexibility in managing issues limited by time constraints, such as special issues or special sections, the onlineonly option provides us with the opportunity to publish many articles earlier and reduce the backlog and thus the publication delay. The print subscribers will, of course, continue to receive the four issues containing the high-quality articles they pay for. However, the opportunity to extend the print-only subscriptions to gain access to the additional high-quality articles in the online issues is now more attractive than ever before.1 The first online-only issue of TOMCCAP will be comprised of the articles of the TOMCCAP special issue on “Social Media,” guest edited by Susanne Boll, Ramesh Jain, Xu Dong and Jiebo Luo (former November issue), as well as the extended versions of the ACM Multimedia Conference best papers, guest edited by the respective track chairs of ACM MM (former special section of August issue). The issue is tentatively scheduled for publication in the fall of 2011. One reason for this decision is to give the guest editors a little more flexibility in the review processes, while still publishing the articles in a timely manner. From now on, the special issue articles in addition to the ACM Multimedia best papers will be published this way each year. We hope that this decision proves popular with our readership as well as our authors.	acm-mm;social media	Ralf Steinmetz	2011	TOMCCAP	10.1145/2000486.2000487	law;notice;medicine	Visualization	-62.25155977907191	-18.34395264695598	89465

fc80ce9a012a48754c0ace8b2fd9f961abe21b7c	special issue for xiangshan sciences forum on frontier studies on data technology and knowledge economy	knowledge economy	Xiangshan Sciences Forum has been China’s leading science and technology forum for distinguished researchers to explore cutting-edge ideas and propose innovative research. Xiangshan Sciences Forum was initiated by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1993. It is also sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Academician Division of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Engineering, Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, General Logistics Department of the People’s Liberation Army and State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. The executive chairmanships assume the overall responsibility for the forum. Xiangshan Sciences Forum invites plenary speeches, research presentations, and panels. The objective is to explore the significant problems in the related areas. The 278th Xiangshan Sciences Forum was called the Frontier Studies on Data Technology and Knowledge Economy, which was an International meeting focusing on the theory and technology in data technology and knowledge economy and explores China’s future research direction in this field. It was held on May 22, 2006 at Friendship Hotel, and on May 23–24, 2006, at Fragrant Hill Hotel. Since the research in data technology and knowledge economy in China is still at the beginning stage, we hope that the participants of this forum can share their fresh, creative, and innovative ideas and thoughts, provide the most advanced research results, exchange experience and promote the data technology and knowledge economy in China as well as in the world. The aim of this conference was to provide a platform for researchers from academia, industry, government, practitioners, and data mining user community to propose novel ideas, share their research and experience, exchange techniques and tools, and explore cutting-edge research. It was also to help the Chinese Academy of		Yong Shi	2006	International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making	10.1142/S0219622006002234	knowledge economy;computer science;knowledge management;management science	EDA	-62.73319757640627	-16.27164780373594	89798

5c371610b7dacdc1cb2bb289e0570ea85315b9af	introduction to the special issue podc'2004	general;nonnumerical algorithms and problems	The following six papers originally appeared in preliminary and abbreviated form in the Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGACT-SIGOPS Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC’2004), held in Saint John’s, Newfoundland, Canada, July 25–28, 2004. They were chosen by the program committee from the 39 full–length papers presented at the symposium. In addition to being reviewed, in preliminary form, by the program committee of PODC ’2004, these papers were subsequently refereed according to the standard practices of Distributed Computing. The selection of the papers was based on quality as well as on representation of the range of topics addressed at the symposium. The papers address subjects ranging from areas traditionally of interest to PODC to new and even exploratory topics. While the program committee felt that many papers presented at PODC’2004 were high in quality, the number of papers that can appear in a special issue is very limited. I wish to thank both the referees and the authors of these papers. Their cooperation and prompt responses were vital in ensuring timely publication of this special issue–appearing shortly after PODC’2005, and only about a year after PODC’2004. I would like also to thank Distributed Computing, and its editor, for their help and support. Their continued cooperation enables PODC to showcase the exciting work that is presented in PODC.	acm sigact;distributed computing;podc	Shay Kutten	2005	Distributed Computing	10.1007/s00446-005-0152-5	civil engineering;petroleum engineering;engineering	Theory	-61.09122253652492	-17.82998413397291	90125

It is concluded that the Parity Principle does not, by itself, demarcate cognition and that another mark of the cognitive must be sought. The second section of the paper advances two arguments against the extended view of cognition, one of which - the conservatism-or-simplicity argument - appeals to principles of theory selection, and the other of which - the argument from demarcation - draws on a systems-based theory of cognition. The final section contests the claim, made by Andy Clark, that empirical work done by Wayne Gray and colleagues supports the extended view.	artificial intelligence;extended cognition	Robert D.

a133737a70836ecf885e6643366e8f9d3c42bd50	a real example of jong nang and tomb gate of cyber biology jeju island: its fundamental principle of dna code		"""Jeju province has a long history in the residential communication field. The Jong Nang is such an example of a binary code, dated back over three quarters of a millennium. The Jeju Jong Nang code is considered as one of the earliest human binary coded communication (HBCC) in the world with a definite """"1"""" or """"0"""" binary symbolic analysis of switching circuits. Jong Nang gate (JNG) has been used as an unique folk social custom in every house i.e. the house holder signals whether the host stays at house or not by three timbers closing or opening as in traffic light (red, yellow, green) systems. Sandam (stacked stones around tomb) is another unique cyber space custom and traditional Jeju tomb geometry. It represents a unique life philosophy that the dead and the living co-exist and communicates through Sin-Moon (meaning god gate). Sandam is arranged around the tomb in rectangular frame shape by building up trimmed stones. Each face divides the border between the physical world and the spiritual cyber world, but is opened by Sin-Moon gate. Three stories stacks of stone arrangement in four direction in Sandam indicates heaven (Yang) and earth (Yin) and in between human is laid at the center. With such philosophy in mind and its geometrical structures of Sandam Jeju people believed that death is connected to heaven and wishes that the dead person ascends to heaven. Also the stone walls are easily found in Jeju and connected to each other as the stone cooperation networks, called as the Goendam (or Goendang) and relate to the Social Custom Family Networks (SCFN). Recent advantages in the Internet of Things (IoT), go towards a growing integration of the physical, social and cyber spaces. Therefore, the IoT is used matched to the SCFN of Jeju unique physical cyber spaces custom."""	ascend;afterlife;another world;binary code;closing (morphology);cyberspace;fuzzy concept;internet of things;jpeg network graphics;meltwater entrepreneurial school of technology;norm (social);soul;the binding of isaac: rebirth;yang	Moon Ho Lee	2017	2017 IEEE 15th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 15th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 3rd Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)	10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2017.38	philosophy of life;cyber space;heaven;internet of things;performance art	HCI	-58.16852773258118	-13.447396092315003	91023
abf6040f73655e14bee2e0a82dc4856acd26f997	phi in physiology, psychology and biomechanics: the golden ratio between myth and science		In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the use of the so-called golden ratio (Phi, ϕ), an irrational number with fractal properties, used in artworks since V century BC. and now for modelling complex biological structures and functions. This number, in fact, recursively pops-up in human history, from Ancient Greeks to Renaissance, and to contemporary scientific studies. Nevertheless, recent scientific results often fall between two extremes: those of a priori sceptic researchers accusing the artificial emergence of ϕ in many studies, and those of researchers that find a mystic meaning in the presence of ϕ in human physiology. This review moves between these two extremes to provide a scientifically based discussion about the possible presence of Phi in human physiology, psychology, and biomechanics of heart and locomotion. We provide scientific evidence, analysing reasons for the presence of Phi, reporting the weakness of some studies overstating the potential meaning of this number, and reporting the reasons for which it could be actually found in some biological structures and functions.

304ff8e09e2b24f3d9f2b6897ccf270ec5044cf7	geoprivacy 2014 workshop report: the first acm sigspatial international workshop on privacy in geographic information collection and analysis, dallas, texas, usa - november 4, 2014	spatial data;gpgpu;large scale;data parallel design	Developments in mobile and surveying technologies over the past decade have enabled the collection of Individual level geographic information at unprecedented scale. While this large pool of information is extremely valuable to answer scientific questions about human behavior and interaction, privacy intrusion is an imminent risk when detailed individual travel patterns are used for commercial purposes such as customer profiling, or even for political persecution. The GeoPrivacy workshop focused on discussing methods to protect individual’s privacy in geographic information collection and analysis. GeoPrivacy 2014 (http://stko.geog.ucsb.edu/geoprivacy) was held in conjunction with the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (SIGSPATIAL 2014) on November 4, 2014 in Dallas, Texas, USA. This workshop touched on an area of geospatial science that affects any researcher working with real-world geodata. With the recent rise in geosocial networking applications as well as advances on location-enabled mobile devices, the topic of geoprivacy has become a major discussion point both in location-specific research as well as everyday life. This workshop offered a unique platform from which to really delve into a dialog on issues related to privacy and credibility within the domain of geoscience and computational geography. The goal of this workshop was to bring together researchers, developers and users of geospatial data to explore methods, techniques, datasets and issues surrounding an area of GIScience that has attracted significant interest among researchers and the public. The workshop received 10 submissions of which 7 research papers (5 full and 2 short) were accepted for publication in the proceedings and for presentations (30 minutes for each paper). 1 The one-day workshop opened with a thought-provoking keynote from Dr. John Krumm and the remainder of the day was split in to two sessions, Privacy in Location-based Services andPrivacy Protection. The GeoPrivacy workshop conclused with a group discussion session which involved a round-table dialog on communal goals, ongoing projects and future directions for research. We would sincerely like to thank the authors for publishing and presenting their work at GeoPrivacy 2014, the keynote speaker and the program committee members and external reviewers for their thoughtful evaluation and help in the paper review process. We hope that readers of the workshop proceedings will find it interesting and it will motivate continued discussion on the future of geoprivacy-based research.	customer relationship management;geographic information system;geomatics;geosocial networking;geospatial analysis;information systems;location-based service;mobile device;privacy;dialog	Grant McKenzie;Carsten Keßler;Lars Kulik	2014	SIGSPATIAL Special	10.1145/2766196.2766206	computer science;data science;data mining;spatial analysis;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;statistics	HCI	-56.60766223409441	-17.21897228376639	91972
fe187590fe1fc554906fe7f3333419ecd1bbe2ef	using doctrines for human-robot collaboration to guide ethical behavior		These issues are real. Robots with lethal capabilities are being deployed in several operational theaters. And mistakes are being made. Partly they are due to “fog of war” and the difficulty for remote operators to have a good operational awareness of the situation on the ground. But, as anecdotal evidence in for example Singer (2009) points out, another reason is unclarity in command, control and communication (C3) between operators, robots, and those in the field – an unclarity that gets compounded as all these actors are often geographically dispersed. And then, people die. We would like to argue that these issues concern us all. Most researchers eschew (direct) military research, and that might be a reason for why the issue of ensuring ethical behavior in robots has been largely marginalized in the fields of robotics, and human-robot interaction. Put somewhat over-simplified, “We don’t make robots that kill, we don’t want to, hence this doesn’t concern us.” But this just isn’t correct. Even when we disregard the impact of military robotics on the public perception of robots, risks and ethical considerations of right and wrong robot behavior go well beyond the military domain. We can find ample of examples in domains we (the authors) ourselves are active in: Urban Search & Rescue, and robots for	die (integrated circuit);humans;human–robot interaction;level of detail;military robot;robotics;stochastic process;theory	Geert-Jan M.

a20e73bc27c7c793136004347952f9d55b6ab4ca	obituary frank fallside	frank fallside	Professor Frank Fallside died very suddenly, on 24 March 1993, at work in the Department of Engineering in the University of Cambridge, where he had been Professor of Information Engineering since 1983, and head of the Information Engineering Division from 1988. He was a major international figure in the new discipline of speech technology, and played a very significant role in bringing it to maturity. At Cambridge, he initiated a very successful interdisciplinary MPhil course in speech and natural language processing which has been the model for several others in British universities. He was also the founding editor of Computer Speech and Language, one of the most respected journals in the field. He was born in Edinburgh on 2 January 1932, where he was educated at George Heriot 's School. He studied at the University of Edinburgh (BSc), the University of Wales (PhD) and the University of Cambridge (MA), and began his career in industry. He was elected a Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1962. Initially, his interests lay in control systems, and spanned both fundamental and applied aspects. A principal interest at this time was public water distribution networks, and he was a director of the Cambridge Water Company from 1969. In the early 1970s, his engineering interests turned to speech, and he made an important contribution to the development of training aids for the deaf, and speech synthesis, where he was one of the pioneers in methods of synthesis-from-concept. His interest in pattern processing was extended and broadened in the 1980s, when the research group he led on neural networks achieved an international reputation for their innovative work on speech processing, machine vision, robotics and control. He had a panoramic knowledge of modern developments in speech technology, and national and international bodies frequently enlisted his advice and help, from the European Commission to the United Kingdom's Department of Trade and Industry and the Science and Engineering Research Council. His eminence in his academic field was matched by the quality and appeal of his personality. His integrity was beyond question, and his courtesy was unfailing. His sense of humour moderated many a difficult occasion, and everyone who knew him at all well counted him a friend. He will be very much missed, and the field of speech technology that he so graced is very much the poorer for his loss. He is survived by his wife Maureen, and by their daughter Helen and their two sons David and Hamish.

In this paper, as a first step, we look at the past research and have a correct recognition of the situation before we make progress in our research.People's Life Indicators (PLI) in Japan was made out in order to aim at contributing to the improvement of the quality of people's lives. After several changes and under an investigation committee of National Life Council in Economic Planning Agency PLI was summed up and defined in 1992. Since then PLI was used to show as wealth indicators giving ranking for 47 prefectures in Japan. However, National Life Council discontinued to officially announce the ratings of PLI in 1999 in which some difficulty seems to lie at the root of the changes of economic and social circumstances.In this paper, we reconsider and analyze PLI by adding another indicator with fuzzy concept to be able to fit more realistic lives using the data from National Life Council.

39e9f95d09e9138e97502e975dbac7b34d6442b3	a commentary on developing work and quality improvement strategies ii	quality improvement	I want to thank professors Bergman and Eklund for the opportunity to discuss a very interesting topic in the intersection of three fields of the foremost importance, and clearly related. I also want to thank all the authors for insightful and well-written papers that together have given me a new vision of the relationship between work, technology, ergonomics, human needs and quality. The introduction plus the six articles provide an excellent overview of the topics, but no unique and clear answers to the three important questions that Bergman and Eklund ask in the introduction, especially the one regarding ‘advice to decision makers’. The articles are long, dense and full of interesting ideas, which makes the task of extracting conclusions very difficult. Therefore, I have decided to use the limited space available here to expand on one idea and/ or one question from each article that I’ve found interesting (I can’t justify or explain the selection criteria). I like very much Bergman and Eklund’s introductory chapter and agree with the distinction made between American and European total quality management (TQM). However, isn’t it too optimistic to predict that the TQM concept will evolve towards the total quality of life (TQL) concept? The idea is extraordinarily appealing and interesting, but I’m afraid that it’s not in tune with ultraliberal times. Wilson’s article has an interesting discussion of the possibilities of three different technologies.

It is a central tool for economics and the social sciences, which poses challenging research questions in mathematics, control and optimization, and is applied across a wide variety of fields, including neuroscience, philosophy, and biology. SING7 was the seventh in the series of “Spain–Italy–Netherlands Meetings on Game Theory” and the first one organized in France. It was held in Paris from 18th till 20th of July 2011. This special volume on game theory is dedicated to this SING7 conference. However, the submission invitation was not restricted only to SING7 presenters, but was addressed to all researchers and practitioners from the related disciplines. All submissions followed the high standard refereeing process of the Annals of Operations Research. Ten out of nineteen submitted papers have finally been accepted for publication. They show the variety of research topics of interest to SING participants. Following the traditional concern of cooperative game theory, several papers propose and develop axiomatically solutions or allocation rules of a worth generated through cooperation, and they do so in some specific generalizations of the classical setting that supposes that players can organize themselves in independent coalitions. Nicolas Andjiga and Sébastien Courtin present and develop axiomatically a solution concept in a setting where players organize themselves in concomitant non-necessary disjoint coalitions whose union is the grand coalition, and a player may belong to several coalitions. The solution concept they develop generalizes in this setting the van den Brink and van der Laan share function for coalition structures (partitions). In the paper of Encarnación Algaba, Jesús Mario Bilbao, and René van den Brink, cooperation is restricted to coalitions that belong to union stable systems that encompass as special	game theory;interdependence;mathematical optimization;nicolas cleynaerts;operations research	Jean-François Caulier;Michel Grabisch;Agnieszka Rusinowska	2015	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-014-1764-6	positive economics;game theory;positive political theory;economics;mathematical economics	ECom	-55.75296734641279	-19.256620818630466	93672

Each day, more people question them less frequently, so that they become “everyday truths” or “standards to observe and demand.” I have the feeling that I am minority in this wave of believers and beliefs, and that my viewpoints are highly unpopular. I dare to express them because I fail to see enough faults in my reasoning and reasons, and because perhaps there exist other “believers” not so convinced about these viewpoints, so that, perhaps, we will discover that “the imperator had no clothes, he was naked.” 1. Myths and beliefs about the production of quality software This section lists several “general truths,” labeled A, B..., G concerning quality of software, and tries to ascertain whether they are reasonable assertions (“facts,” sustainable opinions) or myths. 1.1 About measuring software quality A. It is possible to measure the main attributes that characterize good quality software. The idea here is that software quality can be characterized by certain attributes: reliability, flexibility, robustness, comprehension, adaptability, modularity, complexity, portability, usability, reuse, efficiency... and that it is possible to measure each of these, and therefore, characterize or measure the quality of the software under examination. To ascertain whether point A is a fact or a myth, let us analyze three facets of it. 1) It is possible to measure above attributes subjectively, asking their opinion to people who have used the software in question. Comment 1. Opinions by experienced users are reliable. That is, (1) is not a myth, but something real. It is easy to agree that a program can be characterized by above attributes (or similar list). Also, it is convincing that the opinions of a group of qualified users respect to the quality, ergonomics, portability... of a given software are reliable and worth to be taken into account (subjective, but reliable opinions). 2) Another practice is to try to measure above attributes objectively, by measuring surrogate attributes if the real attribute is difficult to measure [Myth B below]. Comment 2. Measuring surrogate attributes. To measure the height of a water tank when one wishes to measure its volume, is risky. Objective (accurate) measurements of surrogate attributes may be possible, but to think that these measures are proportional to the real attribute, is risky. “If you can not measure beauty of a face, measure the length of the nose, the color of eyes...” If you can not measure the complexity of a program, measure the degree of nesting in its formulas and equations, and say that they are directly related. More in my comments to Myth B. 3) Finally, instead of measuring the quality of a piece of software, go ahead and measure the quality of the manufacturing process of such software: if the building process has quality, no doubt the resulting software should have quality, too (Discussed below as Myth C). Comment 3. To measure the process, instead of measuring the product. In old disciplines (manufacturing of steel hinges, leather production, wine production, cooking...) where there are hundred of years of experience, and which are based in established disciplines (Physics, Chemistry...), it is possible to design a process that guarantees the quality of the product. A process to produce good leather, let us say. And it is also possible to (objectively) measure the quality of the resulting product. And to adapt the process, modifying it to fix errors (deviations) in the product quality: for instance, to obtain a more elastic leather. Our problem is that it is not possible to do that with software. We do not know what processes are good to produce good quality software. We do not know what part of the process to change in order, let us say, to produce software with less complexity, or with greater portability. More in my comments to Myth C. B. There exists a reliable measurement for each attribute. For each attribute to be measured, there exists a reliable, objective measurement that can be carried out. The idea is that, if the original attribute is difficult to measure,1 measure another attribute, correlated to the first, and report the (second) measurement as proportional or a substitute for the measure of the original attribute. 1. Reliability (reliable software, few errors): measure instead the number of error messages in the code. The more, the less errors that software has. 2. Flexibility (malleability to different usage, to different environments) or adaptability: measure instead the number of standards to which that software adheres. 3. Robustness (few drastic failures, the system rarely goes down): measure through tests and long use (Subjective measurement). 1 Or we do not know how to measure it. 4. Comprehension (ability to understand what the system does): measure instead the extent of comments in source code, and the size of its manuals. 5. The size of a program is measured in bytes, the space it occupies in memory (This measurement has no objection, we measure what we want to measure). 6. Speed of execution is measured in seconds (This measurement has no objection, we measure what we want to measure). 7. Modularity: count the number of source modules forming it. 8. Program complexity (how difficult it is to understand the code): measure instead the level of nesting in expressions and commands (“cyclomatic complexity”). 9. Portability (how easy it is to port a software to a different operating system): ask users that have done these portings (Subjective measurement). 10.Program usability (it is high when the program brings large added value to our work. “It is essential to have it.”): measure the percentage of our needs that this program covers (Subjective measurement). 11. Program reuse: measure how many times (parts of) this program have been used in other software development projects. (Objective measurement, but only obtained in hindsight). 12. Ease of use (ergonomics) characterizes programs that are easy to learn, tailored to our intuitive ways to carry out certain tasks. Measure instead the quantity of screens that interact with the user, and their sophistication. Comment 4. Measuring surrogate attributes. These “surrogate measurements” can produce irrelevant figures for the quality that we are really trying to measure. For instance, the complexity of a program will be difficult to measure using point 8, for languages that use no parenthesis for nesting. For instance, it is not clear that a software with long manuals is easier to comprehend (point 4). To measure the temperature of a body when one wants to measure the amount of heat (calories) in it, is incorrect and will produce false results. A very hot needle has less heat that a lukewarm anvil. Comment 5. It is true that in the production of other goods, say iron hinges, is easy to list the qualities that a good hinge must possess: hardness, resistance to corrosion... And it is also easy to objectively measure those qualities. Why is it difficult, then, to measure the equivalent quantities about software? Because hinges have been produced before Pharaohnic times, humankind has accumulated experience on this, and because its manufacture is based on Physics, which is a consolidated science more than 2,000 years old. Physics has defined units (mass, hardness, tensile strength...) capable of objective measurement. More over, Physics often gives us equations (f = ma) that these measurements need to obey. In contrast, Computer Science has existed only for 60 years, and thus almost all its dimensions (reliability, ease of use...) are not susceptible (yet) of objective measurements. Computer Science is not a science yet, it is an art or a craft.2 Nevertheless, it is tempting to apply to software characterization (about its quality, 2 Remember the title of the book “The Art of Computer Programming” of Donald C. Knuth. In addition, we should not be afraid that our science begins as an art or a craft. Visualize Medicine when it was only 60 years old: properties of lemon tea were just being discovered. And physicians talked for a long time of fluids, effluvia, bad air, and witchcraft. With time, our discipline will become a science. say), methods that belong and are useful in these more mature disciplines, but that are not (yet) applicable in our emerging science. We are not aware that methods that work in leather production, do not work in software creation. Indeed, it is useful at times to talk of software creation, not of software production, to emphasize the fact that software building is an art, dominated by inspiration, good luck... (see Comment 7). 1.2 Measuring the process instead of measuring the product An indirect manner to ascertain the quality of a piece of software, is to review the quality of the process producing it. C. Measuring the quality of the process, not the product quality. Instead of measuring the quality of the software product, let us measure the quality of its construction process. To have a good process implies to produce quality software. Comment 6. It is tempting to claim that a “good” process produces good quality software, and therefore, deviations of programmers with respect to the given process should be measured and corrected. The problem here is that it is not possible to say which process will produce good quality software. For instance, if I want to produce portable software, what process should I introduce, versus if what I want to emphasize is ease of use? Thus, the definition of the process becomes very subjective, an act of faith. Processes are used that sound and look reasonable, or that 	byte;comment (computer programming);computational complexity theory;computer science;cyclomatic complexity;error message;existential quantification;human factors and ergonomics;list comprehension;modularity (networks);myth ii: soulblighter;operating system;programmer;relevance;robustness (computer science);software construction;software development;software portability;software quality;surrogate model;the art of computer programming;usability	Adolfo Guzmán-Arenas	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-25958-9_1	attitude;education;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;belief;mathematics;computer security;algorithm;software quality	SE	-62.05361726773014	-23.653350319053903	94444

Although extrapolative techniques are used to accelerate the sequence in question, the sequence must first pass a necessary condition of being able to undergo an asymptotic expansion. The author purports that the book corrects a long-standing problem that most of the authors in the field had committed; namely, not acknowledging the work of others in the field. The most dramatic example given is that a famous extrapolative technique, developed in 1927, was identical ineVery wayto a technique published in 1654! This book is divided into two parts, the first one dealing with asymptotic expansion, while the second one is devoted to extrapolation methods. This book cannot be recommended for most chemists and information professionals for two reasons: 1. Not many of the latter scientists have need for analyzing converging sequences. 2. There are no worked examples given, despite the claims of the publisher that a large number of examples are given. Norman J. Santora R. W.

b8e8a0db8dacbb3f1827c33ef483ea9905227f06	a new treatment for back pain?	back pain	From time to time, there appears in a scientific journal a paper which is particularly eye-catching. In this issue, there appears such a contribution, ‘‘A new method for spatially selective, non-invasive activation of neurons: concept and computer simulation’’, by M.K. Konings of the Utrecht University Medical Centre [1]. The aim is ambitious—the relief of back pain by inducing an electric field at specific points in the interior of the body. Of course, one cannot focus an electric field in the way that a light beam can be focused. But is it possible to produce local field maxima without violating the fundamental laws of electromagnetism? Konings produces an ingenious solution by applying rotating magnetic fields. (The reader unfamiliar with this area of physics is recommended to study the unipolar generator.) The system involves banks of rotating magnetic discs, each disc rotating at up to 1,000 revolutions per second, providing a magnetic field of up to 2 T within the body. A sudden switching off of this field produces induced currents and the desired electric fields. The high rotation speeds would be challenging to produce, and the system could be very dangerous if anything were to go wrong. The discs would need to be enclosed in a very strong non-metallic enclosure. (A steel box would not allow the magnetic field to penetrate, and neither would a complete non-magnetic metallic surrounding, because of the eddy currents.) Even if the system can be successfully engineered, there are two points on which I have doubts. Firstly, the large field is produced by a combination of rotating discs and a static small driving field. It is not clear to me that this produces a rotating field, not a static one. The second point is more significant. Konings cleverly avoids direct induction effects (Appendix C) by having alternate banks of magnets spinning in opposite directions and producing opposite field directions, arguing that the desired fields are unaffected, while the undesired fields are cancelled. I am actively thinking about whether this will work or not. The result of having the magnets so arranged will be to give (almost) zero magnetic field in the body. If there is no magnetic field, how can there be any electric field produced? My tentative feeling is therefore that the system may not work as it stands. I hope I am wrong, and this may be the case. After all, they said that the jet engine would never work.	appendix;arabic numeral 0;back pain;bank (environment);central pattern generators;computer simulation;electroconvulsive therapy;electromagnetic radiation;electrophoresis, gel, pulsed-field;enclosure device component;inductive reasoning;magnet <device>;magnetic fields;maxima;electric field	William Gough	2006	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-006-0145-y	medicine;computer science;mathematics;physics	HCI	-53.1243044696219	-23.20012023210765	95029

Therefore complete coverage seems to be impossible in one article. Furthermore, many of the methods used in the U.S.S.R. were described in surveys presented to preceding IFAC Congresses and Symposia. Therefore attention is focused on methods which have not been adequately covered in those papers. Relatively much attention is given to adaptive, dispersional, u0027standardu0027 and distributed models. The essence of each method is described in brief and actual plants are listed where these methods are applied. References are made to papers which describe these methods in more detail. The final part of the paper is a very brief account of other kinds of models and their application.		N. S.

During the white-tie banquet for 1,500 presided over by Sweden's King and Queen, several prizewinners stood to give brief speeches. David Lee of Cor-nell University, a winner in physics, decried the """" doomsayers """" who were claiming that science is ending; the work for which he and his colleagues had been honored showed just how vital physics is. As the audience applauded, several people at my table whispered and jabbed their fingers at me. They knew Lee was alluding to my book, The End of Science (Addison-Wesley, 1996), which had been stirring up trouble since its release six months earlier. The book argued that science—especially pure science, the grand quest to understand the universe and our place in it— might be entering an era of diminishing returns. As the New York Times put it in a front-page review, """" The great days of scientific discovery are over; what science now knows is about all it will ever know. """" 1 The book was denounced by eminences such as Bill Clinton's science advi-sor, the British minister of science, the heads of NASA and the Human Genome Project, the editors of Science and Nature, and dozens of Nobel laureates. These denunciations usually took the form not of detailed rebuttals of my arguments but of declarations of faith in scientific progress. Scientists need a certain degree of faith to bolster their confidence in the arduous quest for truth; lacking such faith, science would not have come so far so fast. But when researchers reflexively deny any evidence and arguments that challenge their faith, they violate the scientific spirit. Perhaps recognizing this fact, some pundits reacted thoughtfully to my book. Moreover, I suspect that more than a few scientists who publicly assailed my views privately acknowledged their merit. David Lee was a case in point. When I introduced myself to him at the Nobel banquet to tell him how flattered I was that he had mentioned my book, he said he hoped that I hadn't been offended. He had enjoyed the book and had agreed with much of it, particularly the argument that achieving fundamental discoveries is becoming increasingly difficult.

The conference is an international symposium on the theory, design, analysis, implementation and application of distributed systems and networks. DISC is organized in cooperation with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS). Since the first symposium (initially called WDAG) in 1985, it was the first time DISC had been organized outside of Europe. This was entirely successful and will certainly happen again in the next few years, maybe in Brazil in 2012. Back to this year, in addition to the main conference, there were also three co-located workshops the days before and after the conference. Since I have personally attended only the first one, there will be no precise description of their contents:	disc;distributed computing;european association for theoretical computer science	François Bonnet	2010	SIGACT News	10.1145/1907450.1907545	applied mathematics;theoretical computer science;computer science	Arch	-60.195129526312776	-17.722570976031957	96438

In view of this, it is not surprising that my interest immediately awoke when I, during the pursuit of my Master's degree in computer science and technology, heard about the course in image analysis given at the Department of Mathematics. This in turn opened my eyes to the subject of mathematics itself and made me realize its value and importance. In the spring of 1998, after focusing my studies in this direction, I presented my Master's thesis on the subject of multi-scale image analysis based on partial differential equations. With my interest in computer vision and image analysis only escalating during the work on my Master's thesis, it felt like a natural step to apply for a PhD position in the Mathematical Imaging Group. I received a position in the project """" Dynamic Vision """" financed by the Swedish Research Council (for Engineering Sciences). This project has been aimed at investigating different aspects of computer vision when used together with control theory in robotics. My work in the project has come to focus on the task of hand-eye calibration and intrinsic camera calibration in the setting of robotic vision. This research has led to a number of conference papers, [HM9,HM8,HM6,HM4,HM3,HM1]. However, in the beginning of my doctoral work I also partly continued the work on multi-scale image analysis and diffusion methods in image processing and had a rewarding collaboration with Johan Hult and Clemens Kaminski at the Department of Combustion physics which resulted in [HM7]. In the autumn of 2001, I had the privilege to be a guest of Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos was introduced to the world of optical illusions and had a stimulating working companion in Dr. Cornelia Fermüller on this subject. The research that I took part in has resulted in [HM5] and [HM2]. The material presented in this thesis is based on the above mentioned research, conducted during my five years as a PhD student. It has been published or submitted to international journals and presented at a number of international conferences. The papers are listed below in reverse chronological order. Acknowledgments First of all I would like to thank my supervisors Anders Heyden and Gunnar Sparr for their helpful comments and support.

Although this new research field is still in its infancy stage, it has started to attract increasing attention from the multimedia-security research community. This lecture addresses the first digit law and its applications to digital forensics. First, the Benford and generalized Benford laws, referred to as first digit law, are introduced. Then, the application of first digit law to detection of JPEG compression history for a given BMP image and detection of double JPEG compressions are presented. Finally, applying first digit law to detection of double MPEG video compressions is discussed. It is expected that the first digit law may play an active role in other task of digital forensics. The lesson learned is that statistical models play an important role in digital forensics and for a specific forensic task different models may provide different performance.		Yun Q.

c4290cfca0e316e48d2e6d411a230e12209f43cd	when the field was young	microprocessors;reflections from our editors;history of computing;computer;ieee computer society	When the IEEE Computer Society (CS) was born on 31 December 1970, Computer was a young publication in a young eld, and it was the product of a young organization— the Society’s predecessor, the IEEE Computer Group. The president of the freshly franchised Society wrote that the time was right for looking back on the accomplishments of the founding IEEE Computer Group before “we start 1971 as the IEEE Computer Society.” The CS was a radical expansion for its parent organization, IEEE, as it accepted “computer professionals who may not be engineers” as members. The new Society assured the IEEE leadership, who were somewhat anxious about the nature of these new professionals, that “suitable professional quali cations will be required of such individuals.” At the time, however, these quali cations weren’t easily de ned. If anything, the CS seemed willing to accept members from a wide variety of backgrounds. As the decade unfolded, CS leadership began to discover the common traits of computer professionals, and the pages of Computer began to describe the nature of those traits. In 1971, computing was about to be radically changed by a new technology, the microprocessor, which was implemented in a large-scale integrated (LSI) circuit. “Microprocessors are ‘relatively new,’” wrote Theodore Laliotis in a 1974 issue of Computer. “They are the one component with the most far-reaching implications, for future developments in digital systems since the transistor.” But the article understated the impact of the microprocessor. Intel announced its rst commercial microprocessor, the 4004, in November 1971. Within four years, these chips formed the basis of a desktop computer for hobbyists, the Altair 8800. Three years later, they were used to produce a personal business computer—the Apple II. While the microprocessor was pushing computing in one direction, software was pushing it another. During the early 1970s, software developers started recognizing that they were unable to produce error-free software.

The RFP was titled Digital Imaging Network—Picture Archiving and Communications System (DIN-PACS). Benchmark testing of the proposed vendors' systems occurred during the summer of 1997. This article highlights the methods for test material and test system organization, the major areas tested, and conduct of actual testing. Department of Defense and contract personnel wrote test procedures for benchmark testing based on the important features of the DIN-PACS Request for Proposal. Identical testing was performed with each vendor's system. The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard images used for the Benchmark Testing included all modalities. The images were verified as being DICOM standard compliant by the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Electronic Radiology Laboratory. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory prepared the Unix-based server for the DICOM images and operated it during testing. The server was loaded with the images and shipped to each vendor's facility for on-site testing. The Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia (DSCP), the Department of Defense agency managing the DIN-PACS contract, provided representatives at each vendor site to ensure all tests were performed equitably and without bias. Each vendor's system was evaluated in the following nine major areas: DICOM Compliance; System Storage and Archive of Images; Network Performance; Workstation Performance; Radiology Information System Performance; Composite Health Care System/ Health Level 7 communications standard Interface Performance; Teleradiology Performance; Quality Control; and Failover Functionality. These major sections were subdivided into workable test procedures and were then scored. A combined score for each section was compiled from this data. The names of the involved vendors and the scoring for each is contract sensitive and therefore can not be discussed. All of the vendors that underwent the benchmark testing did well. There was no one vendor that was markedly superior or inferior. There was a typical bell shaped curve of abilities. Each vendor had their own strong points and weaknesses. A standardized benchmark protocol and testing system for PACS architectures would be of great value to all agencies planning to purchase a PACS. This added information would assure the purchased system meets the needed functional requirements as outlined by the purchasers PACS Request for Proposal.	architecture as topic;benchmark (computing);compiler;compliance behavior;dicom;din connector;differentiated services;digital archive;digital imaging and communications in medicine (dicom);failover;file archiver;functional requirement;google summer of code;health level 7;information system;intraductal proliferative lesion of the breast;name;network performance;next-generation network;p1 bacteriophage artificial chromosomes;picture archiving and communication systems;picture archiving and communication system;radiology;request for proposal;score;server (computer);server (computing);ships;teleradiology;turing test;unix;weakness;workstation;buying;induction by symbiont of defense-related host reactive oxygen species production	Philip D.

We propose and test a number of refinements to the original Massacrator algorithm, originally proposed by Lissoni et al. (The keins database on academic inventors: methodology and contents, 2006) and now applied to APE-INV, a free access database funded by the European Science Foundation. Following Raffo and Lhuillery (Res Policy 38:1617–1627, 2009) we describe disambiguation as a three step process: cleaning&parsing, matching, and filtering. By means of sensitivity analysis, based on MonteCarlo simulations, we show how various filtering criteria can be manipulated in order to obtain optimal combinations of precision and recall (type I and type II errors). We also show how these different combinations generate different results for applications to studies on inventors’ productivity, mobility, and networking; and discuss quality issues related to linguistic issues. The filtering criteria based upon information on inventors’ addresses are sensitive to data quality, while those based upon information on co-inventorship networks are always effective. Details on data access and data quality improvement via feedback collection are also discussed.	algorithm;assisted gps;benchmark (computing);core data;data access;data quality;display resolution;download;feedback;floor and ceiling functions;inverter (logic gate);mind;monica s. lam;precision and recall;projection screen;scientific literature;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;simulation;software bug;upload;user-generated content;word-sense disambiguation	Michele Pezzoni;Francesco Lissoni;Gianluca Tarasconi	2014	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1375-7	computer science;data science;data mining;world wide web	DB	-48.33503339937892	-19.96087163320996	98055

90e68d68d5125bee62c78a8b1a341cbdb36a0e8b	introduction to the inaugural issue of the journal of reliable intelligent environments		As envisioned by Weiser, computing is in the process of being everywhere and becoming invisible. As Milner noticed, the question now is whether we shall understand this ubiquitous computer we are building. This is especially true as designers are more and more using complex techniques for every component of the system and building systems which are made of increasingly heterogenous parts. With this extended editorial, we embark on an exploration journey into the exciting new area of “reliable intelligent environments” (RIEs). Taking the perspective of an RIE engineer, we present a selection of approaches that have been put forward to design, verify, and operate IEs in a manner so that users can rely on Intelligent Environment systems. We outline crucial challenges: the situatedness which exposes IE to challenges similar to those known from robotics and control systems, the embedding of human users and the safety, privacy, and usability requirements thus entailed, and the amounts of data produced by sensors and actuators, which require advanced reasoning and learning mechanisms to handle them in a reliable way in real-time. We also sketch the opportunities reliable IEs provide to developing new markets and products.	as-interface;ambient intelligence;control system;intelligent environment;niche blogging;reactive-ion etching;real-time locating system;reliability (computer networking);requirement;robotics;sensor;situated;ubiquitous computing;usability	Juan Carlos Augusto;Antonio Coronato	2015	Journal of Reliable Intelligent Environments	10.1007/s40860-015-0005-3	psychology;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;software engineering;management;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	-49.26509942514075	-18.280999173361725	98745

790d55c82fe9fe8c5631700cfd9f290e4892de47	affective tutoring systems: enhancing e-learning with the emotional awareness of a human tutor	intelligent tutoring system;cognitive affective theory;learner emotions;journal article;e learning;affective tutoring system;affective computing	This paper introduces the field of affective computing, and the benefits that can be realized by enhancing elearning applications with the ability to detect and respond to emotions experienced by the learner. Affective computing has potential benefits for all areas of computing where the computer replaces or mediates face to face communication. The particular relevance of affective computing to e-learning, due to the complex interplay between emotions and the learning process, is considered along with the need for new theories of learning that incorporate affect. Some of the potential means for inferring users’ affective state are also reviewed. These can be broadly categorized into methods that involve the user’s input, and methods that acquire the information independent of any user input. This latter category is of particular interest as these approaches have the potential for more natural and unobtrusive implementation, and it includes techniques such as analysis of vocal patterns, facial expressions or physiological state. The paper concludes with a review of prominent affective tutoring systems and promotes future directions for e-learning that capitalize on the strengths of affective computing.

There is evidence that emotion has an impact on the speed at which information is processed (Öhman, 2001) and whether it is attended to (Anderson, 2001; Vuilleumier, 2001). Emotion also has a relation to motivation in that evaluations or feelings regarding the current situation will largely determine the action that is taken in response. Therefore, emotions are often precursors of motivations (e.g., Oatley, 1992). Memory is also impacted by emotional state, and again there are many mechanisms by which this can occur. The Processing Efficiency theory (Eysenck & Calvo, 1992) suggests that emotions can utilize cognitive resources that would otherwise be used for processing new information; for example in the case of anxiety, intrusive thoughts may compete with the cognitive task and result in a decrease in performance. Thus, an area which can benefit greatly from affective computing is education. The fact that interaction with computers is a fundamental part of study in most disciplines, coupled with the cognitive and emotional journey that all learners experience makes e-learning an ideal candidate for affective computing developments. Intelligent tutoring systems attempt to emulate a human tutor by providing customized feedback or instruction to students. Whilst intelligent tutoring systems remain an active area of research, they have failed to achieve widespread uptake. A reason for this is the technical difficulty inherent in building cognitive models of learners and facilitating human-like communications (Reeves, 1998). The difference in learning performance between ideal one-toone tutoring conditions and other methods is known as the 2 Sigma problem (Bloom, 1984). Research on expert human tutors indicates that ‘expert human tutors devote at least as much time and attention to the achievement of affective and emotional goals in tutoring, as they do to the achievement of the sorts of cognitive and informational goals that dominant and characterize traditional computer based tutors’ (Lepper & Chabay, 1988, p. 242). Given the apparent link between cognition and affect, it may be argued that for an intelligent tutoring system to emulate a human tutor successfully there should be some consideration of affective processes during learning. The inability of current intelligent tutoring systems to cater for the role of emotion in learning may to some extent explain the 2 Sigma problem in the context of computer based learning. It is hoped that the incorporation of affective components into e-learning development may therefore lead directly to improved pedagogical outcomes. Providing this vital form of affective feedback into intelligent tutoring and other applications should greatly improve their success. Cognitive Basis for Learning The past few decades have seen the rise of the personal computer to fill many varied roles as organizer, communicator, entertainer and of course, educator. Research in the area of learning has predominantly taken a cognitive view in which the mental processes are considered as they are involved in learning. Cognitive theory is a learning theory of psychology that attempts to explain human behavior by understanding the thought processes. Cognitive theory is based on the assumption that human beings are logical and will make rational choices. The field of cognitive psychology provides explanations for many of the underlying mental processes that occur during learning. Prominent in this field is the three stage information processing model (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968) shown in Figure 1. This multi-store model of memory proposes that incoming information from the environment is briefly captured in sensory memory, and that information that is interesting is more likely to go on from sensory memory to short term memory. If a particular piece of information needs to be retained, the learner then makes a conscious decision to work with it and to continue to process it. Information that the learner has deemed important is International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education, 8(4), 75-89, October-December 2012 77 Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.

More recently constructivism has gained ground; constructivists believe that learners’ reality is built upon their existing experiences and perceptions. What someone knows is grounded in perception of the physical and social experiences which are comprehended by the mind (Jonassen, 1991). However, in spite of the way in which learning theories may have evolved over time, they have shared the perspective that the human mind is viewed as an information processing tool, not unlike basic computer architecture. Perkins highlighted the compatibility between traditional cognitive theories and constructivism, stating ‘...information processing models have spawned the computer model of the mind as an information processor. Constructivism has added that this information processor must be seen as not just shuffling data, but wielding it flexibly during learning -making hypotheses, testing tentative interpretations, and so on’ (Perkins, 1992, p. 51). Cognitive theories however do not explain the role that emotions play, in spite of the substantial evidence that emotions influence cognitive processes (Pekrun, 2008). Norman (1981) cited the topic of emotion as one of the major challenges to cognitive theory. Some authors consider the information-processing metaphor as the source of this challenge; for example, Ortony, Collins and Clore (1990, p. 5) stated ‘This approach to cognition has been as noticeable in its failure to make progress on problems of affect as it has been for its success in making progress on problems of cognition.’ People cannot be viewed purely as tasksolving, goal driven agents, they also have other emotive reasons for their choices and behavior that drive the decision making process (Mandler, 1975). Lisetti (1999) claims that a large number of cognitive tasks are influenced by affective state, including organization of memory, attention, perception and learning. The same conclusion was reached by Picard (1997, p. x) who states that ‘emotions play an essential role in rational decision making, perception, learning and a variety of other cognitive functions’. Cognitive-Affective Theory Another important area of research considers the underlying affective or emotional states and how these interact with cognitive processes. The way in which affective states interact with memory, decision making and social behavior creates a challenge for cognitive theory (Andrade & May, 2004). Emotions may disrupt, slow down, organize or initiate cognitive processes, and different emotions can influence these mechanisms in different ways (Pekrun, 2002). There has been a strong bias toward the cognitive and rational within the field of computer science, as a result of the prevailing view that the sciences are the domain of rules and logic with little room for anything else (Picard, 1997). In this view, emotion would be considered more of a distraction than a benefit. This bias has been reflected in the development of e-learning software, as it would generally be developed by programmers rather than learning theorists or educators. Consequently, many of the benefits of research into human affect and emotion are not yet fully realized in e-learning software. In the field of e-learning, a popular theory describing how learners process and learn from computer based multimedia is Mayer’s (2001) Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. This theory draws from the multi-store model Figure 1.

bbe59541f54ae38d20329be21513918a040e8e8d	introduction: interpolations—essays in honor of william craig		On May 13, 2007, the Department of Philosophy at U.C. Berkeley hosted a conference in honor of Professor William Craig. The date coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the celebrated interpolation theorem in the Journal of Symbolic Logic in 1957. The conference, entitled “Interpolations” (see http://sophos.berkeley. edu/interpolations for a description of the event and photos), aimed at bringing together a group of specialists from various areas to reflect on the importance and impact not only of the interpolation theorem but also of other aspects of Craig’s work such as the impact of “Craig’s observation” in philosophy of science and his work in algebraic logic. The list of speakers was indeed impressive: Solomon Feferman (Stanford), Michael Friedman (Stanford), Cesare Tinelli (Iowa), Dana Scott (Carnegie Mellon), Jouko Väänänen (Amsterdam, Helsinki), Johan van Benthem (Amsterdam, Stanford). Obviously everyone knew, before the conference, that Craig’s results had had a major impact in different fields. But what the conference revealed was that the impact was so wide that no single scholar could possibly have suspected, let alone been familiar with, all the ramifications that were presented by the speakers. At the end of the conference, Professor Craig also offered some reflections on the origin of, and background that led to, the interpolation theorem. The conference was co-organized by Branden Fitelson, John MacFarlane, Paolo Mancosu, and Sherri Roush, all faculty members in the Philosophy Department and also in the Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science at U.C.

The PLOS workshop series brings together people from the programming language and operating system communities to discuss emerging work at the intersection of these fields. It is a venue for discussing new visions, experiences, problems, and solutions arising from the application of advanced programming and software engineering concepts to operating systems construction, and vice versa.#R##N##R##N#The program committee for PLOS 2009 received fourteen short papers for consideration, and of these, seven were selected for presentation at the workshop. Each submitted paper was assigned to four members of the program committee for review. In total, 59 reviews were written, many of which contained long and detailed comments. Once all the reviews were in, the program committee met by teleconference to decide upon the workshop program. The discussions during the many-hour teleconference were thoughtful and often intense! Papers were evaluated based on technical quality, originality, relevance, and presentation.#R##N##R##N#The PLOS workshops are highly interactive forums where researchers present their work in development, and in return, receive feedback from their peers. As such, the publication of a paper in the PLOS workshop proceedings is not intended to replace future conference publication.

Though gratified by the proposal  and willing to do my best, I found it fairly difficult to present Michael Gelfond to his students and colleagues, and even  more to the many scientists in the world that are aware of his important contributions to Computer Science. Then, I drew inspiration  from Benjamin Franklin, who, in the incipit of his autobiography,motivates his writing it by saying: “I have ever had pleasure in obtaining little anecdotes of my ancestors”  and assuming that the same might hold for his relatives and friends. Likewise, Michael’s friends and, I hope, Michael himself  may take some pleasure in my telling some anecdotes related to my long-termed acquaintance with Michael. Actually, I realized  that I have quite a bit of stories to tell, and that the subtitle of this essay might be “Pleasures and inconveniences of  traveling abroad”.    	michael gelfond	Stefania Costantini	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-20832-4_22	history;law and economics;psychoanalysis	NLP	-60.52510444855849	-23.40223541418226	100020

But here I want to call the attention to other type of ignorance to which I have been confronted once and again as an Editor, a reviewer or an author of scientific papers in the field of network theory. It is about the ignorance of authors in one discipline to papers published by authors in a different but related area of research. This problem creates an unnecessary duplication of results that contributes to slowing down the healthy development of this field of research. It also contributes to segregate the field into several subfields, in which researchers do the same kind of work, using similar techniques, but without speaking to each other. Network science, the field of our journal, is proud to be a highly interdisciplinary area of research. However, without integration between the different sub-disciplines that contribute to it, the field is not other thing than a fragmented landscape, far from a truly interdisciplinary one. Today, the technology allows us to scan the whole area of research in the blink of an eye. The number of contributions in each topic is huge, and we cannot cover all of them in just a few hours. But, we all, Editors, Reviewers and Authors, have the responsibility of avoiding the ignorance of works that crosses the narrow sub-discipline of the authors and help them to visit the ‘other fields’ that also exists. Just to give one single illustration of what all of this is about I will show a picture (see Fig. 1) of the network of citations of papers containing the phrase ‘Small-World’. It is easy to identify the different subfields that conforms the ‘communities’ in this citation network, but it is not my intention here to make such specific analysis. What it is obvious from this picture, which is worth a thousand words, is that the authors in one sub-discipline hardly cite those in another. Then, when you write your papers, review the papers of others or edit the papers reviewed by others, please be aware that:	blink;citation network;fragmented object;network science;network theory;scientific literature	Ernesto Estrada	2017	J.

The International Conference on Mathematical Methods and Models in Biosciences (BIOMATH, [2]) is an annual event devoted to recent research in biosciences based on applications of mathematics as well as mathematics applied to or motivated by biological applications. It is a multidisciplinary forum for researchers who develop and apply mathematical and computational tools to study phenomena in the broad fields of life sciences, such as biology, ecology, medicine, biotechnology, bioengineering, environmental science, etc. The 2011 International Conference onMathematical Methods andModels in Biosciences and School for Young Scientists (BIOMATH 2011, [3]) held in Sofia, 15-18 June 2011 was truly an international meeting that gathered researchers from four different continents and 16 different countries. BIOMATH 2011 continues a tradition of scientific meetings on biomathematics held at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) in Sofia since 1990. Selected papers presented at the international conference BIOMATH-95 were published in vol. 32 of this journal [4] as well as in J.UCS [5]. The BIOMATH 2011 conference was supported by several research units of BAS and three Bulgarian Universities as well as by the Union of Bulgarian Mathematicians. The Conference was dedicated to the memory of Dr Roumen Tsanev — a prominent biologist and a pioneer of bio-mathematical modeling in Bulgaria. About 70 scientific lectures were presented at BIOMATH 2011. This special issue contains a selection of 19 scientific papers focused on mathematical, numerical and computational tools with particular attention on differential equation models and their numerical analysis (finite difference method, finite element method). All papers have been subjected to the usual peer-review process of the journal based on the reports of at least two independent anonymous reviewers. Papers presented at BIOMATH 2011 focusing on biotechnological processes are published in a special issue of the Journal ‘‘Biotechnology & Biotechnological Equipment’’. According to their biological applications the papers in the present issue can be conditionally classified in four groups, as follows.	academy;british informatics olympiad;broadcast auxiliary service;ecology;finite difference method;finite element method;mathematical model;numerical analysis;scientific literature	Roumen Anguelov;Svetoslav Markov	2012	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2012.03.110		Visualization	-48.37868866963172	-14.315833419177421	100643

f196e278557d57c98641c9107ebfdd64920ea5c1	selecting chance curation strategies: is chance curation related to the richness of a cognitive niche?		"""The aim of this paper is to tackle the following issue: as it is renown that chances can be faked, it seems intuitive to think that the inhibition of chance-faking contexts is a good activity of chance curation. Yet, could this activity sometimes be counterproductive? The question will be answered positively considering the case of bullshit as a case of fake chances, but also as a fertile ground for learning and developing intuitions. Ultimately, this paper will argue that the peculiar context, that is the cognitive niche supporting the (potentially) fake chances, is the discriminating factor: indeed, a rich cognitive niche may benefit from certain kind of fake chances – which should therefore not be inhibited – whereas a poorer niche might not benefit from this situation, and therefore the preclusion of fake chances is an act of chance curation in those contexts.

According to Peirce, an inference is a form of sign activity in which the word sign encompasses several types of sign, for instance, symbol, feeling, image, conception, and other representation (Peirce, 1931-1958, 5.283). Moreover, the process of inferring – and so the activity of chance seeking and extracting – is carried out in a distributed and hybrid way (Magnani, 2009). This approach considers cognitive systems in terms of their environmental situatedness: instead of being used to build a comprehensive inner model of its surroundings, the agent’s perceptual capacities are seen as simply used to obtain “what-ever” specific pieces of information are necessary for its behavior in the world. The agent constantly “adjusts” its vantage point, updating and refining its procedures, in order to uncover a piece of information. This resorts to the need of specifying how to efficiently examine and explore and to the need of “interpreting” an object of a certain type. It is a process of attentive and controlled perceptual exploration through which the agent is able to collect the necessary information: a purposeful moving through what is being examined, actively picking up information rather than passively transducing (Thomas, 1999). In this sense, humans like other creatures are ecological engineers, because they do not simply live their environment, but they actively shape and change it looking for suitable chances, epistemic for example, like in the case of scientific abductive thinking. Generally speaking, the activity of chanceseeking as a plastic behavior is administered at the eco-cognitive level through the construction and maintenance of the so-called cognitive niches (Magnani, 2009). The various cognitive niches humans live in are responsible for delivering those clues and signs informing about a (environmental) chance. So, the mediating activity of inferring as sign activity takes place (and is enhanced) because of the presence of the so-called eco-cognitive inheritance system (Magnani, 2009; Odling-Smee, Laland, & Feldman, 2003). That is, humans can benefit from the various eco-cognitive innovations as forms of environmental modifications brought about and preserved by the previous generations. Indeed, many chance-seeking capacities are not wired by evolution, but enter one’s behavioral repertoire because they are secured not at the genetic level, but at the eco-cognitive one – in the cognitive niches. The second important point to mention is that humans as chance extractors act like eco-cognitive engineers (Magnani & Bardone, 2008; Bardone, 2011). Accordingly, they take part in the process of extracting chances by performing smart manipulation in order to turn an external constraint into a part of their extended cognitive system. Chances are provided by the continuous eco-cognitive activity of humans as chance extractors, but all human agents do not stand at the same level: some individuals, in fact, do not only explore and make use of the chances available in their ecologies, but also take care of them. If chance discovery (and chance utilization) are, as we contend, inferential tasks, then the quality of these inferences heavily depends on the quality of available chances. As suggested by Abe (2010), chance discovery is coupled by an activity of chance curation: deriving the word from the museum jargon, Abe remarks that the “main task of curator is a curatorial task, which is multifaceted. Curator comes from a Latin word ‘cura’ which means cure [and care]. Then originally it was used for a person who takes care of a cultural heritage” (p. 794). The word was subsequently applied to the person who takes care of data in IT settings: They use “data curation” because they think data have value. Not only for keeping data but also usability of data for the public, they use the word “curation”. Actually, most of data are neither art works nor archaeological artifacts. However, it is important to view data from the aspect of what should be preserved (p. 795). Following this extension, Abe defines “curation” as the “task to offer users opportunities to discover chances”. This will be our starting point. If indeed “curation” may describe the intentional offering of chance discovery to 10 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/selecting-chance-curationstrategies/76330?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology.

03d852c91206fd7ede4a0f90accc9ea7ba5ccd59	david smith and amie thomasson, editors, phenomenology and philosophy of mind	philosophy of mind	Phenomenology and Philosophy of Mind collects essays that take up the recent trend of reconsidering and reacquiring the phenomenological movement for the philosophy of mind and the cognitive sciences. The book is divided into five parts. The first part, ‘‘The Place of Phenomenology in Philosophy of Mind,’’ contains essays by Paul Livingston on logical analysis, Galen Strawson on intentionality and Taylor Carmon on the ‘‘inescapability of phenomenology’’. The second part, ‘‘Self-Awareness and Self-Knowledge,’’ has essays by David Woodruff Smith and Amie Thomasson on reflexive content and first-person knowledge, as well as an essay by John Bickle and Ralph Ellis on phenomenology and neurophysiology. In the third part, ‘‘Intentionality,’’ Johannes Brandl deals with the ‘‘immanence theory of intentionality’’ and Richard Tieszen on abstract entities. The fourth part, ‘‘Unities of Consciousness,’’ contains essays by Wayne Martin on ‘‘the logic of consciousness,’’ Sean Kelly on temporal awareness and Kay Mathiesen on collective consciousness. In the fifth part, ‘‘Perception, Sensation, and Action,’’ Clotilde Calabi deals with perceptual salience, Charles Siewert with sensorimotor intentionality and José Bermúdez with bodily awareness. Although the title refers to phenomenology in its entirety the articles focus mainly on Edmund Husserl as the founder and leading figure of phenomenology. One paper deals with Brentano, as a fore-runner of phenomenology. Four papers have a second focus on Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Alfred Schütz is mentioned (as ‘‘Schutz’’) in passing. Sartre plays no role at all. Relating a traditional (philosophical) approach to current state of the art theories may take at least the following six forms. The list from top to down shows a decreasing commitment to a literal reading, but an increasing argumentative strength. The essays in Phenomenology and Philosophy of Mind are mostly placed on the lower half of the list.	bruce ellis;cognitive science;consciousness;entity;intentionality;kelly criterion;literal (mathematical logic);philosophy of mind;self-awareness;theory	Manuel Bremer	2008	Minds and Machines	10.1007/s11023-008-9109-3	philosophy of mind;philosophy;epistemology;computer science;cognitive science	AI	-54.62244406179424	-21.69930012680167	101084

Despite its significant influence, I suggest that it may have a richer story to tell than has been told to date. Motivated by this potential, my essay has two aims: to explicate the theory developed in Zuboff's text, and to determine how fully it has been used and extended by Information Systems researchers, through an analysis of papers citing her text. My findings show that the theory developed in Zuboff's text has been used in a fairly limited and piecemeal fashion. I discuss how this presents a significant opportunity for research because the theory appears to be just as relevant now as it was when the text was published. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed careful and speedy publication of papers by taking full advantage of our experience. We received 14 submissions until the deadline, and then assigned a meta-reviewer to each paper in the first 10 days after the deadline, which was done by the 1st online editorial board. The 2nd editorial board was held on 8th August and the 3rd editorial board was held on 7th November. As a result, 8 papers were accepted. Usually, peer reviewers cannot have perfect referee standards, but based on both peer and meta-reviewer reports, we discussed much at the editorial boards so that at least novelty or usefulness is sufficient to accept. Evaluation of a paper is ultimately whether readers consider it useful or not, and we should not reject any useful papers in editing stage. I believe that these policies were thoroughly implemented. Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to all of the members who submitted, the Editorial Board members who gave consideration to the careful review despite their busyness, and the reviewers.	information processing;next-generation network	Hayato Yamana	2018	JIP	10.2197/ipsjjip.26.224	applied mathematics;theoretical computer science;computer science	HCI	-62.489992876193796	-18.188413575447374	102485

Barwise's quest for an enrichment of the concept of set can in fact be traced back to his pioneering project, jointly with John Perry, in situation theory and situation semantics (STASS) (Barwise and Perry, 1983: 52): To carry out this project we must use, either implicitly or explicitly, a metatheory about what kinds of complexes there are and what their nature is. Like most of modern mathematics, our metatheory is a theory of sets and our complexes are set-theoretic complexes. While Barwise and Perry had no qualms about the kind of metatheory they needed for STASS, they thought that they had to deal with the problem of large collections (Barwise and Perry, 1983: 52–53): Our theory must distinguish between sets and collections too large to be countenanced as sets. [: : : ] [Our] approach is to work in a metatheory like the theory KPU (Kripke–Platek admissible set-theory with urelements), one that admits an interpretation in terms of finite objects. It makes little difference here, but [this] is what we have in mind for developing the theory at a more formal level. KPU was already the subject matter of a technical book Barwise wrote earlier (Barwise, 1975), and hence looked like a tailor-made choice. However, it was soon realized that large collections are only one of the difficulties; a more intricate issue is that of …"""	computer scientist;gene ontology term enrichment;mike lesser;mind;set theory;subject matter expert turing test	Varol Akman	1997	Journal of Logic, Language and Information	10.1023/A:1008295813424		Theory	-59.574868864323236	-22.066316898930882	102751

15643d567eed1e2a9894524acdefaa58abed296f	go without ko on hexagonal grids		This note explains why the ko rule, which is essential for the game of Go, is not needed for hexagonal versions of the game. This known property was recently re-discovered through an evolutionary search for new games. 1. The Ko Rule In order to avoid infinite cycles of play, the board game Go requires a special rule called the ko rule, which states that the player cannot make a move which would repeat the board state of the previous turn. For example, Figure 1 shows a board position (left) in which White captures a black stone by surrounding it (middle). Black cannot then immediately recapture the white piece at the point marked X, as that would return the board state to that of the previous turn and constitute a cycle. Black must play elsewhere before making this move on a future turn. Figure 1. The ko rule; Black cannot immediately recapture at the point marked X. The ko rule has been used in Go since at least 1100 AD, as evident from game 1150C&IPI2.sgf between Li Baixiang and Jin Shiming, in the Games of Go on Disk (GoGoD) database (Hall, 2011). However, the general consensus among players appears to be that the ko rule has probably been used since the game’s invention thousands of years ago, as some form of local cycle control is required to avoid games degenerating into infinite cycles. The ko rule has since been embraced by players as a necessary part of the game, to such an extent that ko battles constitute a significant field of study in their own right. Go is still subject to the problem of triple kos, in which three separate ko occurrences conspire to give an infinite cycle of period 6, which is not handled by comparing the board state of the previous turn alone. An historical example of this is the famous “Triple Ko Game” of 1582 played at a Kyoto monastery in the presence of warlord Nobunaga; the game was abandoned, the monastery attacked, the warlord killed, and triple ko has since been synonymous with bad luck. Such triple ko cases require the enforcement of a stricter superko rule, which states that the player cannot make a move that repeats the board state of any previous turn. Note that this article refers to the less strict ko rule only. 2. Hexagonal Go and Ko Go is undoubtedly one of the great games. It has inspired many players (and researchers), so it is only natural to attempt to map its elegant surround capture mechanism to other contexts, in an effort to find interesting variations. Changing the game’s square basis to a hexagonal one is an obvious step, as the hexagonal grid has topological properties well suited to a number of other abstract board games. TriGo2 is an example of a Golike game played on a hexagonal grid. However, mapping Go to the hexagonal grid has an interesting sideeffect; the ko rule is no longer needed. 1 Computational Creativity Group, Imperial College London, UK.

For example, it is interesting to bear in mind that Descartes denied animals mental states on much the same grounds that many today want to deny computers mental states: their inability to express themselves and the absence of need to explain their behavior with reference to consciousness. Few have followed Descartes’s reasoning concerning animals. Indeed, Stephen J. Toulmin once asked a group of philosophers and scientists: “Does anybody . . . truly believe that dogs don’t have feelings – as opposed to have theoretical reasons for thinking that they have to say dogs don’t have feelings?” (Kayzer, Wim (director), A Glorious Accident, Part 7: A Clash of Minds , Films for the Humanities, Inc.; available from PBS Home Video). We may be at a point in the discussion of artificial intelligence where the converse question is paramount: “Does anyone really believe that a computer can be programmed with emotions – as opposed to have theoretical reasons that compel one to say that it might?” Rosalind Picard’s proposals are clear, provocative, and urgent, and they invite searching scrutiny of this question.	artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;attribute clash;computer;connectionism;consciousness;mental state;mind;musicbrainz picard;rosalind (education platform);tony parisi (software developer)	Kenneth Aizawa	1999	Minds and Machines	10.1023/A:1008345609632	psychology;computer science;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;cognitive science	AI	-56.04369694715401	-22.28108231970292	105260

It consisted of 12 refereed technical presentations and four invited talks. The invited speakers were Nuel Belnap (Pittsburgh University, USA), Andrew Jones (Oslo University, Norway), Krister Segerberg (Uppsala University, Sweden) and Marek Sergot (Imperial College, UK). Only 12 technical presentations were accepted to allow ample time for discussions among the participants—one of the main goals of this interdisciplinary workshop. The technical presentations, collected in (Brown & Carmo 1996), covered topics ranging from the theoretical to the applied. At the theoretical end of the spectrum were presentations on deontic logic and the logic of action, defeasible reasoning, the logical basis for decision, and ethical and legal theories. At the applied end there were presentations on a variety of issues relevant to expert systems in the law, automation of defeasible reasoning, specification of responsibilities and powers in organisations, normative systems specification and confidentiality in database systems.	confidentiality;database;defeasible reasoning;deontic logic;expert system;jones calculus;logic in computer science;theory	Mark A.

62a3e9a9f14b38fd859ef7a59af7cf7f61e1470e	towards building a neural networks community	neural network	December 31, 2010 is my last day as the founding editor-inchief of Neural Networks and also my 71st birthday! Such vast changes have occurred in our field since the first issue of Neural Networks was published in 1987 that it seemed appropriate to my editorial colleagues for me to reflect on some of the changes to which my own efforts contributed. Knowing where we as a community came from may, in addition to its intrinsic historical interest, be helpful towards clarifying where we hope to go and how to get there. My comments will necessarily be made from a personal perspective. The founding of Neural Networks is intimately linked to the founding of the International Neural Network Society (INNS; http://www.inns.org) and of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN; http://www.ijcnn2011.org). These events, in turn, helped to trigger the formation of other groups of scientists and engineers who are interested in our field, as well as other conferences to which they could contribute to share their ideas. There was little in the way of infrastructure in our community thirty years ago. It was not obvious where to submit a modeling article for publication, or what conferences to attend where one could report work to interested colleagues. It was also not clear where one could go to school to learn how to model, or even to learn about was known in the field. How did I come to be in a position to contribute to these developments? That happened in gradual stages over a period of over fifty years.My ownbeginnings in our field started accidentally in 1957, thirty years before Neural Networks was founded, when I was a 17 year-old FreshmanatDartmouthCollege. At that time, like thousands of other Freshmen, I took an introductory psychology course. The accident was my exposure to classical data about how humans and animals learn about theworld. Tome, these datawere filled with philosophical paradoxes. And 17 year-olds of a certain disposition are particularly vulnerable to philosophical paradoxes! For example, data about serial verbal learning in humans – that is, the learning of lists of language or action items through time – seemed to suggest that events can go ‘‘backwards in time’’. Indeed, the non-occurrence of future items in a list to be learned can dramatically change the distribution of performance errors at all previously occurring list positions. The so-called ‘‘bowed serial position curve’’ showed that the beginning and the end of a list can be learned more easily than the middle, with error gradients in performance that point forwards or backwards in time at the beginning or endof a list, and error gradients in themiddle pointing in both directions. In what sort of space and time could events go backwards in time? What type of dynamics could represent the non-occurrence of an event? Exposure to such paradoxes triggered a passionate intellectual excitement that I had never before experienced. Data about reinforcement learning in animals and about cognitive dissonance in humans kindled a similar passion. What sort of space and time representations could describe both a thought and a feeling? How could thoughts and feelings interact to guide our decisions and actions to realize valued goals? Just as in the case of serial learning, the non-occurrence of an event could have dramatic consequences. For example, the non-occurrence of an expected reward can trigger reset of cognitiveworkingmemory, emotional frustration, and exploratory motor activity to discover new ways to get the reward. What is an expectation? What is a reward? What type of dynamics could unify the description of cognition, emotion, and action? Within the reinforcement learning literature, there were also plenty of examples of irrational behaviors. If evolution selects successful behaviors, then why are so many behaviors irrational? Such issues are still of current research interest. And all of them led me to the same theoretical method and modeling framework. The theoretical method, which I called the Method of Minimal Anatomies, showed how analysis of how an individual’s behavior adapts autonomously in real time to a changing world can lead to models of how the brain works. In other words, brains embody a natural computational architecture for autonomous adaptation in real time to a changing world. By bridging the gap between behavioral experience and brain dynamics, the method opened a path towards solving the mind-body problem. This method led me to introduce networks of neurons in which short-term memory (STM), medium-term memory (MTM), and long-term memory (LTM) traces exist. The STM and LTM traces are also known as cell activities, or potentials, and adaptive weights. In such a network, backward effects in time became easy to understand. These traces were described within Additive and ShuntingModels that lie at the core of essentially all contemporary connectionist models of mind and brain. The Additive Model is now sometimes called the Hopfield model based on Hopfield’s popular 1984 article on this topic. When I introduced the model in 1957–58, both the paradigm and the equations were new, and even revolutionary. The LTM laws to which I was led included gated steepest descent learning laws that allow learned increases and decreases in weights, in order to learn spatially distributed weight patterns. From the outset, it was clear that the Hebb hypothesis that learned weights can only increase was incorrect. When in the 1970s von der Malsburg and I introduced self-organizing maps, such a gated steepest descent lawwas used in it, and Kohonen adapted this law in his applications of self-organizing maps in the 1980s. TheMTM lawdescribed how signals can be gated, ormultiplied, by chemical transmitters or post-synaptic sites subject to activitydependent habituation.

Opportunistic ‘thing using’, long before stone tools appeared, was the likeliest cause of bipedalism. It also forced brain development and the emergence of creativity. The neural basis for this creative technical activity later provided the brain functions on which language could develop. This simple unifying hypothesis has interesting implications for the way that we see technology in history, and for determinist theories of the future. It also bears on the way engineers are trained, and more important, the human faculties which need to be fostered in children.		F. T.

Significantly, the model demonstrates the elevation of mental knowledge over corporeal knowledge. Recent attempts to address the problem of embodiment in situated robotics go some way toward overcoming this problem but have yet to address the question of situatedness, which feminist and other social science research suggests should be an integral part of our models of knowers.	artificial intelligence and law;cartesian closed category;computation;cyc;floor and ceiling functions;history of artificial intelligence;problem solving;robot;situated robotics	Alison E.

072e81af5807677cb9dc64eacd0671b3a0cc43c5	an overview of the centre for telecommunications research at king's college, london, england	telecommunications research	The Centre was constituted in 1994, with Professor Aghvami as its Director, to give greater recognition to the successful way in which communication research had been built up, from early beginnings in the 1970s, to become a vigorous, internationally recognised Group from the early 1990s onwards. These early beginnings were at Chelsea College London and consisted mainly of work on microwave circuits, especially amplifiers and mixers; higher level digital modulation, and satellite communications. After Chelsea and King's Colleges were amalgamated in 1985 all communications research was brought together at King's in a distinct Communications Group. The new Group went into purpose-refurbished accommodation at King's which was again refurbished radically in 1998 with the help of a generous grant from the Wolfson Foundation. At the same time, after its outstanding success as by far the most active UK University group on MMIC, our microwave work left the Centre to join other research in microwave engineering, notably superconducting circuits. In the 1980s, as part of our aim to disseminate information to relevant engineers and researchers, we started to run small Short Courses, Seminars and Workshops. Eventually these activities grew to include full International Conferences starting with the first annual Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC) in 1991. Since then we have also established the unique international Conference on Telecommunications (ICT), as well as running Globecom'96 for the IEEE here in London, in cooperation with BT. An essential feature of the way our research is organised is that it is redirected periodically to bring it into line with perceived future needs for the next 5 years and beyond. For example up to 1989 activity was mainly related to Satellite Communications, as well as Microwave Circuits, then until 1994 it was concerned with the Physical and Data Link layers, looking at Modulation, Channel Coding, Multiple Access, TDMA and CDMA. After that more emphasis was placed on wireless ATM and higher layer protocols in wireless Mobile Communication and Networks. With the most recent re-direction in 1998, this changed the emphasis towards the convergence of IP, Mobility and Multi-media. At present the work is divided into the 5 groups given in the next section.	atm turbo;amplifier;communications satellite;forward error correction;international symposium on personal, indoor and mobile radio communications;mobile ip;modulation;monolithic microwave integrated circuit	Hamid Aghwami;Dilshan Weerakoon	2000	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/367045.367064	computer network;engineering management;computer science	Mobile	-59.99067130861817	-16.149005714364495	107881

9da29351bc2a26fb958bd688e0f2de3d9ad40a37	preface (vol 34, issue 6, 7, 8)		Welcome to the special issue of the 35th Computer Graphics International conference (CGI 2018). CGI is one of the oldest international conferences in computer graphics. It is the official conference of the Computer Graphics Society (CGS), a long-standing international computer graphics organization. CGI and CGS were initiated by Professor Tosiyasu L. Kunii, from the University of Tokyo in 1983. Since then, the CGI conference has been held annually in many different countries across the world and gained a reputation as one of the key conferences for researchers and practitioners to share their achievements and discover the latest advances in ComputerGraphics. This year, CGI 2018 is organized byCGS and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and is being held in Bintan, Indonesia, from 11 to 14 June, 2018. CGI is in cooperation with ACM/SIGGRAPH and Eurographics. This special issue of the Visual Computer is composed of the 33 best papers from CGI 2018. We received 136 submissions from 37 countries and regions, with an acceptance ratio of about 27%. To ensure the highest quality of publications, each paper has been reviewed by at least three experts in the field. The International Program Committee is composed of 109 members plus 73 external sub-reviewers invited by the IPC. We would like to express our deepest gratitude to all the IPC members and external reviewers who have provided high-quality reviews timely. We would also like to thank all the authors for contributing to the conference by submitting their work.

ac608235781737b6dc3a89ff579d23d2ffc4f382	report on complexity 1997		Foundations of Computing, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and EATCS, with support ~om Ulmer Universit~its-Gesellschaft, Daimler Benz, the Spar]msse Uhn and the Universitat Polit~cnica de Catalunya. Uuiversit~it Uhn graciously provided the space and facilities for the conference. The conference brought together theoretical computer scientists interested in computational complexity and related fields. The Complexity program committee was composed of Jose Balc~zar (chair), A total of 75 abstracts and draft papers were submitted, of which 27 were accepted for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. In addition, fou~ members of the program committee contributed survey ts]ks. There were 80 registrants to the conference, including 16 students. The proceedings were published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. In the conference call for papers, we invite papers on a variety of subtopics of complexity. This year, we had many papers (over one third) on circuit complexity, which seemed to be a domln~nt theme. A number of papers (a smaI]er third) were on more central complexity (complexity classes, reductions). The other papers were distributed evenly in all other topics. Let's give a sample of results presented. Beigel and Fu showed that PP and PL (probabilistic polynomial time and probabilistic log space) are closed under NCi reductions. Agrawal, A].lender and Datta showed that TC ° can be simulated by constant-depth arithmetic circuits, with a single threshold gate. Karg (winner of the best student paper award) showed that LR(k) testing of context free grammars with respect to random instances is many-one complete for DistNP (the average case analogue of NP). HAmmer, Romashchenko, Shen and Vereshchagin showed interesting connections between Shuunon entropies and Kolmogorov complexity. Bahai and Kimmel showed that for any boolean function, its comm~mication complexity with respect to randomized computations is at least the square root of its original commu.uication complexity. There were other papers on approylmability, on randomi~.ed computation~ on complexity and logic progrumming, reversible computations, resource bou.uded measure, and more. The conference ran in an almost workshop relaxed atmosphere. It was successfully organized by Sch~uing and Tor~n, especially considering they had to deal with people in a number of different hotels, bussing to the University, leading us to the dining area, reception, etc. I don't thi=k anyone got lost. I just wished they turned off that drizzle du~ng the guided tour of old Uhn (just kidding). We now welcome Eric Allender as the new chair of the Conference committee.

I propose to do so by implementing Cultural Computing concept and enriching it with Kansei Mediated Interaction. I present some inspiration for my approach in terms of culture and then discuss them. I relate my work to the Eastern and to the Western world, i.e. I use cultural examples from Japan and England. I propose as a new direction for HCI, cultural computing with its related paradigm I call Kansei Mediated Interaction. Based on a short overview over the different paradigms for human computer interaction I introduce and discuss the most recent paradigm of cultural computing. Cultural computing addresses underlying and almost unconscious cultural determinants that have since ancient times a strong influence on our ontology and epistemology. Different cultures worldwide will have different approaches to address their particular cultural determinants. In the East, the project ZENetic Computer is a first and very promising approach for cultural computing addressing Eastern cultural determinants. In the West, I propose an interactive experience based on the narrative ‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’ to address the main characteristic of the Western culture: analytical reasoning based on formal logic.	computer science;human computer;human–computer interaction;programming paradigm;usability	Matthias Rauterberg	2006				HCI	-53.55223092758499	-20.90528292190239	108619

The present article places Llull’s contributions and discussion in the historical context of elections in the medieval Church and the emergence of majority rule as a new general principle for making enforceable collective decisions in replacement of traditional unanimous requirements. To make the majority principle operational, Llull initially proposed a system of exhaustive binary comparisons that is more efficacious in producing a winner than the Condorcet system, in anticipation to the so called Copeland procedure. In contrast to some previous tentative suggestions, careful reading of Llull’s papers demonstrates that he did not propose a rank-order count system, such as those proposed later on by Cusanus and Borda. A new hypothesis is presented to explain Llull’s later proposal of an eliminatory system of partial binary comparisons. Some performance of Llull’s voting systems is estimated by innovative analysis of results in certain modern sports tournaments.		Josep M.

2b6419d344fc7bbf9d7dd59905905a68c3367747	growing from childhood into adolescence: the science of cyber behavior		In this theoretical review paper, the authors discuss five important issues about the science of cyber behavior as a field of scientific research. First, they argue that the science of cyber behavior as a field of research is entering its adolescence after growing from its childhood, but before spearheading into its adulthood. The paper reviews the current understanding of human behavior in general and state that behavior sciences have generated extensive knowledge about human behavior theoretically, empirically, and methodologically across multiple disciplines. Next, the authors focus on cyber communication as an example to illustrate current knowledge about various types of cyber behaviors. They showcase exemplary research programs on cyber behavior in four disciplines of behavioral sciences, social psychology, cognitive psychology, communication studies, and sociology. Finally, the paper outlines future research programs in five major directions for further development of the field. Taking the opportunity to commemorate the inaugural issue of the International Journal of Cyber Behavior, Psychology and Learning, the authors attempt to draw the first sketch of the science of cyber behavior from the perspective of history of science.

f7c39a58f16b9373a3dd9ba2d9f8b2145114cb61	artificial intelligence - a modern myth	artificial intelligent	Recently there has been a plethora of books questioning the feasibility of strong AI, including works by Penrose (1989), Bringsjord (1992), Moody (1993) and this title from Kelly. All these works have much to offer the interested agnostic, but Kelly’s remains the most comprehensive in scope and the most thorough in content. What gives this work its Trojan edge is that it is written by a Computer Scientist with a comprehensive knowledge of what has been, and is being, achieved by the AI community.	artificial general intelligence;artificial intelligence;book;computer scientist;kelly criterion;trojan horse (computing)	John Kelly	1993				AI	-62.105287765079055	-20.283337971621748	111238

Strong critics such as Asaro (2008), Sharkey (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012) and Sparrow (2007, 2009a, 2009b, 2011) argue that these technologies have multiple moral failings and their deployment on principle must be severely limited or perhaps even eliminated. These authors and researchers along with a growing list of others have founded the International Committee for Robot Arms Control as a means for advancing their arguments and advocating for future talks and treaties that might limit the use of these weapons. Others such as Arkin (2010), Brooks (2012), Lin, Abney and Bekey (2008, 2012), Strawser (2010), have argued that there are some compelling reasons to believe that, at least in some cases, deployment of telerobotic and semi-autonomous weapons systems can contribute to marginal improvements to the state of ethical and just outcomes in armed combat. This presentation will trace the main arguments posed by both sides of the issue. Additionally this paper will suggest certain considerations motivated by the philosophy of technology that might be worthy of addition to future robotic arms control treaties. This position argues that these technologies through the process of reverse adaptation can change our notions of just war theory to the point that caution in their use is recommended until further analysis of these effects can be accomplished. A realistic stance towards robotic weapons arms control will be argued for without losing sight of the positive role these technologies can play in resolving armed conflict in the most just and ethical manner possible.	autonomous robot;coat of arms;consciousness;cyberwarfare;definition;marginal model;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;semiconductor industry;software deployment;telerobotics;the legend of zelda: phantom hourglass	John P.

0ad2118fb36838ba48fd7cd3b6fe58742321fda8	utf: an sgml standard for the news distribution industry		In June, 1992, a working subcommittee was established to create an industry standard for the interchange of textual material between news agencies and their clients (primarily newspapers) that would replace the current standard IPTC 7901 and ANPA 1312 formats. The new standard is called the Universal Text Format (UTF). After significant discussion, SGML was adopted as the encoding language for the new standard. Members of the working subcommittee are now attempting to finalize and prototype the new standard in selected test environments. The purpose of this paper is to describe the context within which the UTF was developed, the standard itself, and plans for future development.	standard generalized markup language	Dave Becker	1994			computer science;world wide web	NLP	-48.857802722033504	-19.569975236674583	111511

Depending on who’s involved in the discussion, business intelligence (or BI, as it’s lovingly called) has many de nitions, so some concern about scope creep could have been justi ed. At the same time, the term “BI” is used more often in industry than academia. So, there could have been a perceived risk of a lack of availability of scholarly articles to form a special issue, as well as an emphasis on overly domain-speci c applications.

49ec9c2fb423d08226985fb0380dd0e6ec372322	review of silent witness by edward yourdon. yourdon press 1982		One major purpose in writing a novel on computer crime is to stimulate thought on the ways in which. such crimes occur and what can be done about them. In his recent novel, Silent Witness , Edward Yourdon, a well-known data processing consultant and author, has given us a helpful means to realize this goal. He writes well, draws interesting characters , and tells an engrossing story. In addition , the author tackles a number of broader issues, such as the 'Problem of privacy and the possibility of starting one's life anew. The tale opens with the two computer criminals meeting surreptiously in a New York City diner at 6 A .M. One, named Max, is a computer programmer at MetropoliDollar bank, the target of the crime ; the onther, Tony, is a computer opera-for at the bank. They are about to cash in on their crime in the amount of $3 million, but Tony, not satisfied with the sum, browbeats Max into going along with his scheme to parlay it into an even larger one through an illicit drug deal in Harlem. (The motivation here is reminiscent of the real Jeremy Rifkin of a few years back, who purchased diamonds with his ill-gotten cash, partly because they were appreciating at the time .) It is through the mishaps arising from this drug connection that several other characters become central to the story : Bernie, a for-lorn, middle-aged accountant who stumbles across the fruits of the crime ; Hogie, an ace 'Programmer/ analyst who works at the firm where the accountant is employed ; Andrea, a young policewoman who takes on the missing person's case opened by the accoun-tant's mysterious disappearance ; and Cooper, a policeman who pursues Max in the mistaken belief that he is a drug dealer. Yourdon takes pains to reveal the thoughts, experiences, and emotions of his leading characters. Max, for instance, is one whose bitterness and desire to get ahead are readily comprehensible, especially in these economically tortuous times. But at the same time, the dominating character of these traits is sufficiently renellent that Max arouses little of our sympathy. Manv readers will find amusement, and others shocks of recognition, in the portrayals of habits New Yorkers develop in order to cone, and may even wonder if the tensions of the big city are an added spur to crime, he it of the computer variety …	automatic computing engine;cybercrime;experience;parlay x;privacy;programmer	Stephen H.

d27b3919feb7d73f625375ad94c0b4708f8c7ac3	the impact of problem space on reasoning: solving versus creating matrices		Creative reasoning in ill-defined problem spaces operates differently from classical reasoning in well-defined spaces. To systematically compare the two in an identical knowledge domain, we applied a classical intelligence test: the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM), in combination with two tests of creativity: the Test for Creative Thinking Drawing Production (TCT-DP) and the newly developed Creative Reasoning Task (CRT), in which participants are asked to create an SPM-like item, to two age groups (N1 = 511, 4-12y old; N2 = 205, 6-10y old). For SPM and CRT the knowledge domain consists of relationships amongst geometrical components in 3 x 3 matrices. We developed a typology for scoring the number and complexity of the relationships used in these matrices. For the SPM, we scored frequencies of relationships solved and for CRT those created, and interpreted the scores in terms of differences and similarities between classical and creative reasoning in cognitive development.	biological anthropology;cathode ray tube;super paper mario;the coroner's toolkit	Saskia Jaarsveld;Thomas Lachmann;Cees van Leeuwen	2013			cognitive psychology;social psychology;raven's progressive matrices;verbal reasoning;matrix (mathematics);convergent thinking;cognitive development;creativity;typology;artificial intelligence;mathematics;cognition	AI	-52.51785217989393	-21.841847345744377	113004
5f17e0a8c9deb0aed6a07e6d681e4f93d263fa11	guidelines for designing artifacts for the dual-process		We have developed an architecture model, MHP/RT, that is capable of simulating people’s daily action selection processes as an implementation of the dual-process theory [1]. MHP/RT describes people’s daily behavior as a cyclic process of action selection and memory formation. In our daily life, we spend a lot of time in interacting with artifacts, and therefore it is obvious that it should affect development of individual memory systems. At the same time, any particular artifacts that exist as they are should embed in themselves their own histories including their predecessors. Occasional innovations might have caused evolution of memory structure of mankind through people’s interaction with the artifacts, and might have resulted in “splicing” evolution in the socio-cultural ecology. MHP/RT suggests that the cyclic processes should define strong constraints on sustainable innovation; as far as the cyclic processes function in utilizing an artifact implemented in a technological innovation, it should survive, otherwise it should fade away. This paper contrasts technique and skill, the two distinct forms of use of artifacts, and derives guidelines for designing sustainable artifacts that should support smooth development of people’s skill necessary for using artifacts from their mere use via technique.	action selection;artifact (software development);ecology;interaction;simulation;windows rt	Muneo Kitajima;Makoto Toyota	2015		10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.201	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;algorithm	Robotics	-54.39952828948174	-23.62156877121865	113024

ed03d0b8741584591039afd66b1a0f27aad57e0f	review of: structure and randomness: pages from year one of a mathematical blog by terence tao		While I am not one to argue with God, George Burns, or George Burns playing God, I do not think Mathematics was a mistake. But I do wish it was easier. Or perhaps it’s easy enough to make so much progress in that it becomes hard. Terence Tao has a math blog that I try to read but find difficult. Often the mathematics itself is beyond me, but other times I have a sense that I really could understand it if I just gave it a bit more time. How to get that time? I can’t really explain it, but having the blog in book form really makes a difference for me. I made the same comment when reviewing both books based on the blog Gödel’s Lost Letter and will likely make the same comment if I review Scott Aaronson’s upcoming blog-book. And I don’t think it’s my inner-Luddite talking, as many non-Luddites I’ve spoken to agree with me. Making the blog entries into a book removes one obstacle. Now the question arises, is the book worth reading? The short answer is yes. The long answer is that there are several types of chapters– some I could read, some I really couldn’t, and some are in between. I review the book by giving some examples of each type.	blog;book;gödel;randomness;ruth aaronson bari	William I.

b9a192acd5174ac74704e7d8be91906160e4abdb	revisiting the publication culture in computing research	publication culture	as the primary means of publishing our research results. In contrast, the prevailing academic standard of ‘publish’ is ‘publish in archival journals.’ Why are we the only discipline driving on the conference side of the ‘publication road?’” In response to my editorial, Lance Fortnow wrote a Viewpoint column (Aug. 2009, p. 33), entitled “Time for Computer Science to Grow Up,” in which he concluded: “Computer science has grown to become a mature field where no major university can survive without a strong CS department. It is time for computer science to grow up and publish in a way that represents the major discipline it has become.” The May 2009 editorial and the August 2009 column attracted a lot of attention in the blogosphere. The reaction has been mostly sympathetic to the point of view reflected in both pieces. For example, Jeanette Wing asked in her blog: “How can we break the cycle of deadline-driven research?”, and Filippo Menczer, in a Letter to the Editor published in the November 2009 issue, said: “I propose the abolition of conference proceedings altogether.” Not everyone, however, agreed with this point of view. For example, in another Letter to the Editor from the November 2009 issue, Jano van Hemert said: “For CS to grow up, CS journals must grow up first.” Mr. van Hemert’s issue with computing-research journals is that they are known to have “slow turnaround, with most taking at least a year to make a publish/reject decision and some taking much longer before publishing.” Such end-to-end times, he argued, “are unheard of in other fields where journal editors make decisions in weeks, sometimes days.” While I have not see concrete data comparing publishing turnaround times for computing-research journals to those in other technical fields, there is abundance of anecdotal data supporting the claim that computingresearch journals are indeed quite slow. (The average time to editorial decision for Communications is under two months; that takes a concerted effort by the editorial board to ensure that the editorial process does not stall.) What is the reason for the unacceptably slow turnaround time in computing-research journals? When considering this question, one must factor the problem into two separate issues: time from submission to editorial decision, and time from positive editorial decision to publication. First let us address the latter issue. All periodical journals have editorial “pipelines.” No publisher wants to face the threat of an empty issue; it’s akin to the dreaded dead air on television! Successful journals that attract many submissions often see their pipelines extend for up to two years. With the advent of electronic publishing, this problem can be eliminated or at least minimized. Communications uses its Virtual Extension (VE) to ensure its pipeline does not get longer than six months. VE articles undergo the same rigorous review process as those in the print edition and are accepted for publication on their merit. These articles are available in ACM’s Digital Library. Let us now consider the editorial process in computing-research journals. Why is it soooo slow? Consider who is in charge of that process. It is not the publishers; it is the editors and referees. In other words, it is us. The process is slow because that is the way we run it. If we want it changed, it is up to us to change it! I suspect that we cannot separate our conference-focused publication culture from our sluggish journal editorial process. Conferences have sharp deadlines, journals do not. We simply do not take our roles as editors and referees as seriously as we do as program committee members because we do not take journals as seriously as other fields. If we, as a community, decide that we need to shift from conference-based publication to journal-based publication, we definitely must address the slow editorial process, but we should not complain about “them journals.” We have found the enemy, and it is us! The 2010 Conference of the Computing Research Association (July 18– 20, Snowbird, UT) will have a plenary panel on “Peer Review in Computing Research.” I look forward to that discussion and hope it will help our community reach consensus on this issue.	adversary (cryptography);blog;blogosphere;computer science;digital library;end-to-end principle;pipeline (computing);point of view (computer hardware company);viewpoint	Moshe Y.

He first sought me out in the early 1960s, ostensibly to find out about the indexing methodology of British Technology Index, then with its birth agonies not too far behind it, but more probably to give moral support. From such a quarter this meant a great deal. I had, for some reason, expected to find him a mechanizing man, to whom I would be required to hand over copious rudimentary enlightenment on subject indication questions, but this was quite wrong. It was I who soon found myself on the receiving end of the enlightenment process.	information retrieval	E. J.

Pak has been a member of our editorial board for more than two years and has been contributing to CG&A for a long time. He served as guest editor of our recent special issue on Extreme-Scale Visual Analytics and as guest editor of two previous special issues: Visual Analytics in 2004 and Visual Data Mining in 1999. The editorial board overwhelmingly supported Pak’s nomination for associate editor in chief. His R&D background in data visualization, visual analytics, information analytics, extreme-scale analytics, and social analytics make him an ideal candidate for the position. Pak received a PhD in computer science from the University of New Hampshire and is a chief scientist and project manager in the Visual Analytics Department at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where he’s led and performed R&D on information technology and scientific computation for over a decade. Pak is also a member of the editorial board of Information Visualization and coeditor of the book Expanding the Frontiers of Visual Analytics and Visualization, published by Springer in 2012. He has cochaired many major conferences in visualization and visual analytics in the US. In particular, he has served on SPIE Visualization and Data Analysis (VDA) from 2001 to the present, IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) from 2006 to the present, IEEE Visualization (VIS) from 1999 to 2006, and IEEE Information Visualization (InfoVis) from 2001 to 2006. It’s with great pleasure that I welcome Pak to his new role. I look forward to a productive collaboration with him.	computation;computational science;computer science;data mining;data visualization;ibm websphere extreme scale;information visualization;rumble pak;springer (tank);visual analytics	Gabriel Taubin	2013	IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications	10.1109/MCG.2013.29	color graphics adapter;visualization;computer science;graphics;information technology;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-59.87757374737983	-17.17326021881338	114858

f44e026e89678165354f524d4f239639d4925307	guest editor's page		This double issue is devoted to the presentation of articles on Fuzzy Control that were first presented and discussed during the third annual workshop on Current Issues in Fuzzy Technologies organized by the University of Trento in 1993. The focus of the workshop for that year centered on broad issues related to Fuzzy Control and in particular to the design, tuning, and applications of fuzzy controllers. The workshop serves as a forum for scientists to report their work and their results, as well as an occasion to sound off their ideas and solutions with other fellow scientists. The articles in this special issue are derived from a subset of the several presentations at the workshop and the ensuing (sometimes lively) discussions. The following selection of articles covers different aspects of the application of fuzzy logic in control, ranging from analysis and design to tuning. The analysis concerns some mathematical issues that must be considered to guarantee that the resulting system will exhibit certain properties. The design of the controller can be simplified by using terms that are naturally used in the context of a specific application, so that the areaspecific experts themselves can participate directly in the design process, without the mediation and restrictions of another (mathematical) language. When the design of a controller is deemed too complex, (semi)automatic techniques are introduced to ease the task: rules can be interpolated from fewer base rules, neural networks can help defining the number and shape of the membership functions, and so on. After the initial definition of a fuzzy controller, its performance is evaluated and a tuning phase is usually needed to reach satisfactory behavior. Once again, this process is hard to formalize in purely algorithmic terms and hence bne looks for intelligent alternatives to trial and error testing to help the tuning process. In his article, L. Koczy provides an overview of the current methods employed in the design of fuzzy controllers. Techniques to reduce the		Alessandro Zorat	1995	Int. J. Approx.

His final mental image he described as """"... a place somehere between the confused mass and the first point"""". In commenting on this in his fascinating but quirky monograph, he asks """"What may be the use of such a strange and cloudy imagery?"""". Hadamard was of the opinion that mathematical thought is visual and that words only interfered. And when he inquired into the thought processes of his most distinguished mid-century colleaugues, he discovered that most of them, in some measure, agreed (a notable exception being George Polya). For the non-professional, the idea that mathematicians """"see"""" their ideas may be surprising. However the history of mathematics is marked by many notable developments grounded in the visual. Descartes' introduction of """"cartesian"""" co-ordinates, for example, is arguably the most important advance in mathematics in the last millenium. It fundamentally reshaped the way mathematicians thought about mathematics, precisely because it allowed them to """"see"""" better mathematically. Indeed, mathematicians have long been aware of the significance of visualization and made great effort to exploit it. Carl Friedrich Gauss lamented, in a letter to Heinrich Christian Schumacher, how hard it was to draw the pictures required for making accurate conjectures. Gauss, whom many consider the greatest mathematician of all time, in reference to a diagram that accompanies his first proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, wrote"""	diagram	Peter Borwein;Loki Jörgenson	2001	The American Mathematical Monthly		number theory;mathematics;geometry;algebra	Theory	-58.91138927735069	-21.098247904990963	115428

c7655f111491743ec11a4aa1fbce63a21c7f4f0b	international conference on vector and parallel computing	parallel computer	"""On June 2-6, 1986, an International Conference on Vector and Parallel Computing (Issues in Applied Research and Development) took place at Loen (Norway). This meeting was organized by Chr. Michelsen Institute (CMI) at Bergen (Norway) and the SIAM/SlAG on Supercomputing. The local organization at Loen was the responsibility of Patrick Gaffney from CMI. The conference was attended by about 270 people from 20 countries all over the world. Those most strongly represented were Norway (80 delegates), the United States (80) and the United Kingdom with about 30 participants. The majority of delegates were from research institutes and universities; only very few industrial people being present. The opening remarks were made by B. Grandal, Director of CMI, who welcomed the delegates to Loen, which is a very beautiful hamlet situated at the Nordfjord north of Bergen. He pointed out that it is a Norwegian tradition to choose such remote places to promote contact between delegates while leaving enough time for technical discussions and indeed the numerous social events afforded ample opportunity for socializing. The scientific program consisted of the following sections: 23 invited papers given by experienced experts in the field of Vector and Parallel Computing (A complete list of the invited speakers together with the title of their talks is given below.) 46 contributed papers, which were presented in two parallel sessions two workshops on industrial problems: one on """"Problems of Supercomputing in Industrial Applications"""" and the other on """"Reservoir Modelling"""" a Supercomputer vendor display, which was given by the following companies: Alliant, Amdahl, Cray, FPS, IBM, Intel Corporation, Norstar A/S and Sequent a poster session with 26 posters. Most of the invited and contributed papers discussed the efficient implementation of linear algebraic algorithms on parallel computers. Algorithms for full, banded or sparse matrices were reported to be parallelized in different ways for different parallel machines. Another research area was the effect of communication and syncronization costs between low speed processors (e.g. microprocessors). The overhead introduced in this manner strongly affects the overall"""	algorithm;alliant computer systems;amdahl's law;central processing unit;computer memories inc.;constraint handling rules;delegate (cli);floating point systems;linear algebra;meridian norstar;microprocessor;overhead (computing);parallel computing;situated;socialization;sparse matrix;supercomputer;symbolic computation;vector graphics	Uwe Harms;Wolfgang Rönsch	1986	Parallel Computing	10.1016/0167-8191(86)90016-5	parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science	HPC	-59.01273488463608	-17.527761111094417	116423

c3c3cc60a40f8a15000725c88cc40689ccc0fc88	organizing the tutorials at aaai-80		Iworked with Raj Reddy during my two years as a research computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. I had been hired by Raj and Allen Newell to play a lead role on the Hearsay-II speech understanding project in 1976. After that, I moved to Rand Corporation and, shortly thereafter, took over the leadership of the research program in information processing systems, where the focus was on AI tools and applications and cognitive science. It was in that context that Raj spoke to me about his conviction that it was time for AI to become a recognized scientific profession, much as the AAAS and IEEE had done for natural science and engineering, respectively. This conversation was an example of Raj’s modus operandi, the gap between vision and current state translated simply into gap-reducing actions. It was therefore obvious to him, before anyone else, what needed to be done: we needed to establish a professional organization and run a series of prestigious annual meetings. I seem to recall a short series of phone conferences, which Raj organized, that included a number of key people from leading labs and universities. Many of these early founders were in Raj’s personal net and found it easy to say “yes” to him. We had little doubt that we could organize a conference and that the growing interest in AI, especially in expert systems, would make for an interesting gathering.

An author creates content, believing that somebody may be interested in it. A publisher invests money in his book project, financing the production, the marketing and the distribution to the bookstores. The readers select the books in the bookstore under a wide range of decision criteria’s. At the end of the chain, the public libraries save the book, storing the information as cultural heritage. Since years with the growing of digital printing technology, Internet and data based publishing also a new type of book production is in the discussions: Book-on-Demand (BoD).

4bab69bc306776d32803284f3e2dbb4ca596b085	report on the seventh acm sigops european workshop	acm sigops european workshop;worldwide application	The Seventh workshop in this series was held in a spectacular, isolated, nearly-impossible-to-get-to site on the rugged West Coast of Ireland. Despite having a conference room with a view of the ocean and New York City far in the distance, more wholesome Irish food than anybody could possibly eat (especially an edible basket of home-made ice cream twice a day), a peat fire in the fireplace, and more attendees in the Youth Division (under the age of 3) than SIGOPS normally attracts, we had innumerable spirited discussions about systems issues on the present and future Internet as well as a lot of fun. The choice of the topic was an intentional break with the past. The program committee felt that SIGOPS has been devoting too much effort to ever smaller and smaller kernels, and was in danger of missing the important new research on systems issues related to emerging worldwide systems. This workshop was designed to help redirect SIGOPS. Judging from the number of submitted papers (76, a 40% increase over last time), and their high quality, we are moving in the fight direction. There were seven classical sessions, each consisting of three 20 minute papers, with 5 minutes of discussion at the end of each paper. At the end of each session, the three speakers came up to front of the room to function as a panel and participate in a general discussion on the session topic for 15 minutes. In addition to these sessions, we also had an evening panel, an evening debate, and a breakout session with small groups pondering what we had learned, followed by a report back to the whole group. Below is a short summary of the papers, selected questions, and the other events. For each paper, the title and authors are listed; the speaker's name is italicized. For more details and the full papers, please see our U.S. web site, http://mosquitonet.stanford.edu/sigops96/ graciously hosted by Mary Baker or our European web site: http://www-sor.inria.fr/sigops96, graciously hosted by Marc Shapiro. As program chair, I 'd like to take this opportunity to thank the general chairman (Andrew Herbert), the local arrangements chairman (Vinny Cahill), the program committee and all the participants for their help, work, and enthusiasm in making this workshop a resounding success.	breakout box;display resolution;future internet;giant bomb;marc (archive);permanent brain;redirection (computing);rugged computer;the fight: lights out	Andrew S.

The symposium was held in Stockholm, Sweden from June 27 to July 2, 2009. We also report on other Student Council events that were organized at ISMB/ECCB 2009. Introduction The Student Council (SC) of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) is a world-spanning organization for students in the broad field of computational biology and bioinformatics. The major aims of the Student Council are to organize events and facilitate networking opportunities for students. The main contribution of the SC is to nurture soft skills, such as working in a team, organizational and networking skills, to complement the normal academic program. Since its inception, the Student Council has organized an annual student symposium for the benefit of the student community. This year the fifth Student Council Symposium was held in conjunction with the joint ISMB and ECCB conferences on June 27th. Over 120 delegates took part in this first anniversary edition of the Student Council Symposium. The symposium featured three keynote lectures, a research partner session with two speakers, a tutorial, a panel discussion, nine student presentations and a poster session. This year's keynotes were delivered by three very wellestablished and acclaimed scientists. The symposium started with a keynote lecture by Peer Bork (EMBL Heidelberg, Germany) on the topic of """"Integration of heterogeneous data in Biology: from chemicals to ecosystems"""". The afternoon session was initiated by Michal Linial (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel) with a presentation titled """"In search of overlooked functions: hidden connections among proteins, toxins and viruses"""". The day was concluded by Overton Prize winner Trey from Fifth International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Student Council Symposium Stockholm, Sweden. 27 June 2009 Published: 19 October 2009 BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 13):I1 doi:10.1186/1471-2105-10-S13-I1 <supplement> <title> <p>Highlights from the Fifth International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Student Council Symposium</p> </title> <editor>Thomas Abeel</editor> <note>Meeting abstracts – A single PDF containing all abstracts in this Supplement is available <a href=""""http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/files/pdf/1471-2105-10-S13-full.pdf"""">here</a>.</note> <url>http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2105-10-S13-info.pdf</url> </supplement> This article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S13/I1 © 2009 Abeel et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."""	abstract summary;bmc bioinformatics;biomed 101;complement system proteins;computation;computer virus;conferences;delegate (cli);ecosystem;european conference on computational biology;file spanning;genetic heterogeneity;iscb overton prize;intelligent systems for molecular biology;lectures;portable document format;scientific publication;student health services;toxin;mecarzole	Thomas Abeel;Jeroen de Ridder;Lucia Peixoto	2009	BMC Bioinformatics	10.1186/1471-2105-10-S13-I1	computational biology;biology;dna microarray;computer science;bioinformatics;physiology	Embedded	-57.70329642660265	-16.79927297039245	118801

The session, under the auspices of IWA, ISWA Italy, GE Water & Process Technologies and many other local institutions, was attended by over 150 participants and included 24 extended oral presentations, 6 short orals and 9 posters. It is my pleasure to acknowledge the cooperation of Giuseppe d'Antonio, Professor of Environmental and Sanitary Engineering at the University of Naples ''Federico II'' and President of ANDIS (National Association of Sanitary Engineers), who with great open-mindedness agreed to include this Special Session in the SIDISA annual general meeting. I am equally grateful to the Conference Chairman Professor Claudio Lubello, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Florence, for the opportunity of organizing and chairing the session. The wide and qualified participation confirmed the growing interest of the sanitary engineering world towards new technologies which can successfully complement and enhance their profession, with automation figuring prominently among the new disciplines required to improve the performance of modern water processing systems. The fusion of these disciplines was advocated in two pioneering books (Olsson and Newell, 1999; Dochain and Vanrolle-ghem, 2001), whose prophetic value was confirmed by subsequent specialized conferences (Olsson, 2002; Olsson, 2006), a specific technical publication (Olsson et al., 2005) and this session. The Environmental Modelling and Software journal welcomed the opportunity to publish such a set of papers that convey innovative and interdisciplinary modelling approaches to meaningful instances of advanced sanitary engineering. 2. Topics and the core theme The topics presented in the session ranged from advanced kinetics modelling to the use of artificial intelligence tools, either neural networks or fuzzy systems, for process control to new methods for a better model calibration. From the operational viewpoint , many papers considered conventional activated sludge processes, to which unconventional and innovative control strategies were applied. But there were also other interesting contributions regarding respirometry, constructed wetlands, and drinking water purification systems. Many papers showed a considerable effort to extend the analysis from the single plant unit to a wider context, in line with the current approach of plant-wide bench-marking (Olsson and Jeppsson, 2006), including sewage systems and surrounding land use. From the methodological viewpoint, the session was particularly rich showing a mature use of many cutting edge techniques, such as the systematic identifiability approach (see e.g. Marsili-Libelli and Giusti, 2008; Cunha Machado et al., …	artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;automation;book;fuzzy control system;integrated windows authentication;item unique identification;kinetics internet protocol;mind;organizing (structure);purification of quantum state;unconventional computing	Stefano Marsili-Libelli	2010	Environmental Modelling and Software	10.1016/j.envsoft.2009.11.002	environmental engineering;computer science;process engineering;sewage treatment;mathematics;biochemical engineering	AI	-56.597307349755255	-15.93706988232686	119049

93187b8bb9b7e201d01fbf7e267f65ebedac1e07	the italian association for artificial intelligence celebrates its 25th anniversary		“We needed a house, a salon where we could meet and discuss, a kitchen where we could make new dishes; maybe fumbling a little, but in total freedom and without the barriers that universities, as well as part of the scientific world around us, required us to respect”. Thus Luigia Carlucci Aiello, founder and first president, summarizes the founding of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence (Associazione Italiana per l’Intelligenza Artificiale, AI*IA), which took place in Rome in February 1988. As a scientific discipline with its own connotation and autonomy, artificial intelligence had already existed for about thirty years. In the summer of 1956, in Dartmouth, New Hampshire, scientists from different fields gathered for a seminar that lasted almost two months. There they put together and shaped those studies that for some years had imagined future computers, not from the point of view of electronics, but from the point of view of language, of computing architecture, of the ability to manage abstract concepts and to develop creative answers. Such machines made of metal and plastic could partially imitate human brain: it was artificial intelligence. “We were all fascinated by this new frontier and in the past we had devoured writings by McCarthy, Minsky, Samuel, Turing”, recalls professor Carlucci Aiello, “and we wanted to put ourselves on the line and take up the challenges issued overseas. The Italian Association of Automatic Computing (Associazione Italiana di Calcolo Automatico, AICA) was now too narrow and many felt the need for a riverbed of our own, where all	artificial intelligence	Andrea Vico	2013	Intelligenza Artificiale	10.3233/IA-130049	salon;turing;computer science;connotation;architecture;autonomy;artificial intelligence	AI	-57.34488943770562	-20.10823160810531	119443

3fee5d844b7117ad72faf6418676fc5737295085	in defense of the 'human prejudice'		"""Those who favor genetic enhancement of human beings (‘trans-humanists’) tend to hold that there is nothing special about being human, if by ‘human’ people mean ‘being member of the species homo sapiens’. They reject the arguments of bio-conservatives as prejudicial toward the concept of humanity, and they argue that species-membership in general is morally irrelevant. In ‘The Human Prejudice’, Bernard Williams defends what he calls ‘humanism’ (and what others call ‘speciesism’) and argues that species-membership is a morally relevant fact about us. Williams’s argument has been criticized by many, and in this paper, the author, focuses on the most thorough attack by Julian Savulescu. They provide a diagnosis of why accounts such as his seem to be so misguided to trans-humanists (like Savulescu) and the author then defend Williams’s account. In short, the paper argues that there is nothing obviously wrong with being a speciesist.

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. to the ethical question of what it means to be human and to look at issues in bioethics from this point of view. Thus, Kass (1972) famously claimed that ‘new biomedical technologies are challenging many of the formulations which have served since ancient times to define the specifically human’ (p. 18; emphasis added). In particular, in today’s discussions of genetic modification of human beings the divide between the liberal and the conservative approaches to ethical questions in technology is both stark and clear. Those who favor genetic enhancement (‘trans-humanists’) tend to hold that there is nothing special about being human, if by ‘human’ we mean ‘being member of the species homo sapiens’. They reject the arguments of ‘bio-conservatives’ as prejudiced toward humanhood, and they argue that speciesmembership in general is morally irrelevant. In what follows, I focus on one prominent aspect of this discussion – the question whether speciesmembership is morally relevant to issues such as genetic modification of human beings. The most detailed and influential defense of the thesis that species-membership is morally relevant was developed by Bernard Williams (2006): in ‘The Human Prejudice’, he argues for a position that he calls ‘humanism’ (and that others call ‘speciesism’). Williams’s argument subsequently has been criticized by many, and I will look at the most thorough attack on it, one made by Julian Savulescu (2009). I will provide a diagnosis of why accounts such as Williams’s seem to be so misguided to trans-humanists and I will offer a defense of Williams’s humanism. In doing this, I aim to highlight the richness of the conceptual framework adopted by conservative arguments such as Williams’s. This, in turn, should allow us to understand better how to go about evaluating the ethics of today’s technological advances. As a preliminary note, let me say that I will be using the terms ‘speciesism’ and ‘humanism’ to refer to the same position. The former is a term that has a negative connotation while the latter is rather positive, yet they denote the same theory or set of claims. I will use the term ‘speciesism’ when talking, for instance, about Peter Singer’s criticism of positions like Williams’s, since this is the way he refers to Williams’s view. On the other hand, when discussing Williams I will switch to ‘humanism’, again, because this is the way Williams refers to the position that he is defending. SPECIESISM AND RACISM Consider a common objection to speciesism, which is well-known from Peter Singer’s work. According to Singer (2009), speciesism is essentially akin to racism and sexism. In fact, when Singer launches this attack on positions such as Williams’s, he explicitly acknowledges that the term ‘speciesism’ is meant to flag this kinship. ‘I use the term “speciesism” deliberately’, he says ‘to make a parallel with other “isms” that we are familiar with, particularly racism and sexism’ and he cites ‘The Human Prejudice’ as an example of a speciesist point of view (p. 572). The aim of Singer’s ‘Speciesism and Moral Status’ is largely to undermine ‘speciesism’. In his comments on Williams, Singer says: I do not see that the argument [in ‘The Human Prejudice’] is really different from a white racist saying, when it comes to a question about how one should treat people of different races, “Well, whose side are you on? We’re the ones doing the judging here, why don’t we simply prefer our kind because it is our kind?” (p. 572) Thus, much like a racist who believes that membership in her race is morally significant and that it justifies treating members of other races as inferior, a speciesist takes membership in her species to be morally significant. Both are guilty of the same mistake in practical reasoning. Singer’s earlier ‘All Animals Are Equal’ (1964) provides a better clue as to what he takes this mistake to consist in. ‘All Animals are Equal’ starts with a comment on what we can learn from the liberation movements that have ‘expanded our moral horizons’ (p. 1).

The terms “component,” “decomposition,” “structure” and “architecture” have been associated with methods and techniques proposed over the years to defeat the crisis, from structured programming to object/component-based programming and, more recently, serviceoriented architectures. As the “software crisis” seems to keep making headlines, it is time that we ask ourselves whether we have made any progress in tackling “complexity”.... In this talk, we suggest that the crisis of “yesterday” is not necessarily that of “today,” and that it is useful to distinguish between two different notions of complexity—physiological and social—that arise in software design. We then discuss some of the mathematical techniques and methodological principles that are available to address them.	component-based software engineering;history of software engineering;social complexity;software crisis;software design;structured programming	José Luiz Fiadeiro	2006		10.1109/ICECCS.2006.68	magic;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;software design;software engineering;management science;topic model;object-orientation;management;sociofact	SE	-54.82120839748822	-20.38818330705077	119902
31b2b83eeb31d5138933b130d50c62239d5c784d	introduction to text visualization		Text is one of the greatest inventions in our history and is amajor approach to recording information and knowledge, enabling easy information sharing across both space and time. For example, the study of ancient documents and books are still a main approach for us to studying the history and gaining knowledge from our predecessors. The invention of the Internet at the end of the last century significantly speed up the production of the text data. Currently, millions of websites are generating extraordinary amount of online text data everyday. For example, Facebook, the world’s largest social media platform, with the help of over 1 billion monthly active users, is producing billions of posting messages everyday. The explosion of the data makes seeking information and understanding it difficult. Text visualization techniques can be helpful for addressing these problems. In particular, various visualizations have been designed for showing the similarity of text documents, revealing and summarizing text content, showing sentiments and emotions derived from the text data, and helping with big text data exploration. This book provides a systematical review of existing text visualization techniques developed for these purposes. Before getting into the review details, in this chapter we introduce the background of information visualization and text visualization. 1.1 Information Visualization In 1755, the French philosopher Denis Diderot made the following prophecy: As long as the centuries continue to unfold, the number of books will grow continually, and one can predict that a time will come when it will be almost as difficult to learn anything from books as from the direct study of the whole universe. It will be almost as convenient to search for some bit of truth concealed in nature as it will be to find it hidden away in an immense multitude of bound volumes. – Denis Diderot About two and a half centuries later, this prophecy has come true. We are facing a situation of Information Overload, which refers to the difficulty a person may have in understanding an issue and making decisions because of the presence of too much information. However, Information Overload is not mainly caused by the growth of books but mainly by the advent of the Internet. © Atlantis Press and the author(s) 2016 C. Nan and W.

Mellon Foundation, engaged five postdoctoral fellows placed in five different institutions to explore issues related to data curation for medieval studies. In May 2015, these fellows convened a two-day workshop on the sharing and publishing of Linked Open Data (LOD). Funded by a CLIR/Mellon microgrant, the workshop brought together librarians, technologists, and scholars to brainstorm on the challenges posed to medievalists in sharing data on digital platforms.2 The workshop offered a forum in which to discuss the complexity of medieval data and the challenges of sharing and publishing it. It enabled participants to appreciate LOD's potential to express complicated data sets in our area of study and aid the navigation of those data sets, as well as understand how LOD can facilitate scholars to share and publish research outcomes more effectively. In this article, we take the lessons learned from the workshop and...	linked data	Tamsyn Rose-Steel;Ece Turnator	2016	IJHAC	10.3366/ijhac.2016.0158	humanities;digital humanities;history;french;computer science;artificial intelligence;archaeology;music;genealogy;linguistics;sociology;world wide web;cartography	NLP	-59.00699290577858	-19.345811953456607	120113

f8efae2c2d216d0dc125c7945d65f290e1abe238	special issue: selected paper from the 8th acm/spec international conference on performance engineering (icpe 2017)		We are delighted to present in this special issue of TOMPECS three of the highest-rated papers of the Research Track of the 8th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) that took place in L’Aquila, Italy, April 22–26, 2017. The goal of ICPE is to integrate theory and practice in the field of performance engineering by providing a forum for sharing ideas and experiences between industry and academia. The conference grew out of the ACM Workshop on Software Performance (WOSP since 1998) and the SPEC International Performance Engineering Workshop (SIPEW since 2008). In the ICPE 2017 edition, the research track attracted 65 submissions with 22 accepted for presentation as full papers. The program covered traditional ICPE topics such as design for performance and problem diagnosis, online performance management, analytic models, empirical studies, model building, and benchmarking, as well as application of performance engineering theory and techniques to several practical fields, including distributed systems, cloud computing, storage, energy, big data, virtualized systems, and hardware. In this special issue, we present the extended versions of three of the highest-rated papers in the conference. Three members of the ICPE 2017 program committee served as reviewers for each extended version, and each paper went through the regular TOMPECS review/revision cycle. The first article by Cheng Wang (VMware Inc.), Qianlin Liang (Ele.me Inc.), and Bhuvan Urgaonkar (Penn State University), titled “An Empirical Analysis of Amazon EC2 Spot Instance Features Affecting Cost-Effective Resource Procurement,” focuses on ways to optimize the usage of Amazon’s popular EC2 spot markets. The article defines four features that can result in a better tenant bid: instance lifetime, average spot price during lifetime, simultaneous revocations, and startup delay. For these features, they illustrate how current prediction practices are inadequate and propose new and more accurate prediction alternatives. The proposed predictors are extensively evaluated using real-world workloads and show that their approach results in better performance (measured in diminished bid failures and lower tail latency) with the same cost as prior work. Results are corroborated with two sets of trace data: a 3-month period in 2015 and another 3-month period in 2017. The work is a case study in traditional ICPE topics: problem diagnosis and performance prediction in cloud computing.	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);bhuvan;big data;cloud computing;distributed computing;performance engineering;performance prediction;procurement	Anne Koziolek;Evgenia Smirni	2018	TOMPECS	10.1145/3186329	software engineering;spec#;distributed computing;performance engineering;computer science	HPC	-60.621795504511894	-18.161359673464197	120385

Our colleagues from Oulu did a magnificent job of creating a truly romantic environment for our annual meeting. Another quite romantic element in that IRIS was the workshop organized by Markku Nurminen, Tone Bratteteig, and Kristin Braa on a proposal for a new discipline: Infurgy. Obviously, this was good entertainment. The presenters did a good job, the ideas were challenging, and some of the audience reacted quite strongly (including myself). But there was also an element of seriousness present. When you thought of Markku’s earlier work on human-centered information systems and when you knew of the Laboris project you couldn’t help feeling, that this was not just for fun. We were confronted with ambitions and quite concrete ideas on how to organize ourselves into a new scientific endeavor. I sympathize with the intentions of the manifesto (published in this forum in Vol. 8, No. 1). We should as professionals be concerned with the harmful implications that a purely mechanistic approach to our field can have on ourselves, our students, users of IT and society at large. We should not primarily see computers as substitutes for human activity but rather as tools and media we can work and play with as humans to improve our lives.

Our conference, launched in 1992, has become a vibrant forum where psychophysicists, engineers, and designers come together to share advances, spark new collaborations, and envision a future that benefits from rich physical interactions between humans and computers. As it did in 2012, the Haptics Symposium now features a longer format: a full day of tutorials and workshops, followed by three full days for the main conference in a single track. The Haptics Symposium is an independent, stand-alone conference, part of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society portfolio of conferences. The benefits of this move to independence have included greater autonomy and flexibility in selecting our timing, duration and program, setting, and, we believe, in providing a truly invigorating atmosphere for sharing the latest developments in the field of haptics.	automation;computer;fundamental interaction;haptic technology;robotics	Marcia Kilchenman O'Malley;Seungmoon Choi	2014	2014 IEEE Haptics Symposium (HAPTICS)	10.1109/HAPTICS.2014.6775416		Embedded	-59.69923819200387	-17.450530872348377	120425
640ccf1b6acec9b7fca8b290354a61b0195499f0	in memory of torrence parsons, 1941-1987		The Journal of Graph Theory (JGT) lost one of its most helpful and enthusiastic editors in the untimely passing of Tory Parsons on 2 .4pril 1987. Amongst his other attributes, he was totally unsurpassed in his reliability as a referee for JGT. He always analyzed each paper sent to him in detail; he simplified proofs, clarified concepts, suggested new lines of research to authors, and with his remarkable breadth of knowledge was often able to provide exact references to the literature where either some theorems of the authors of some similar results had already been published. Tory was tapped for administrative duties even while still a graduate student at Princeton when he served as an assistant dean in the graduate school during the middle one of the three years which elapsed between his B.A. and his doctorate. In addition, he served on many departmental and university committees at both Pennsylvania State University and California State University, Chico. It was this time consuming selfless behavior which held down his list of publications to forty papers. Our paths crossed many times. We first met at Bowdoin College in the summer of 1971 at a national conference on combinatorics. We both attended the leap-year meetings in Kalamazoo, “International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Graphs,” in 1976, 1980 and 1984. the Graph Theory Seminar in Oberwolfach in 1973, and the Seventh British Combinatorial Conference at Cambridge University in 1979. During these events, I found him to be a gifted lecturer. My most memorable meeting with him, however, was not at a conference or a university, but in his home. As it happened one Saturday afternoon in the Spring of 1987, I was driving through State College on the way back to Ann Arbor (from New Jersey) and was invited by Tory and his wife Noelle to spend the night. This event made possible a six-hour nonstop (well. almost) spirited conversation on graph and combinatorics. The astounding depth and breadth of Tory’s knowledge of graph theory which was so evident in that marathon session made an indelible impression on me that 1 have never forgotten. All of us at JGT will miss Tory Parsons.	google summer of code;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;journal of graphics tools;marathon;torrence parsons	Frank Harary	1988	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.3190120202		Graphics	-61.797678264125004	-18.84004706439917	120428

537e812a8029464dc228fd672d497a7fa406b64c	20th workshop on logic, language, information and computation - wollic 2013		This special issue of JCSS brings a selection of papers presented at the 20th Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation (WoLLIC 2013), which was held on August 20–23, 2013, at Fachbereich Mathematik, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany. Short versions of twenty-three papers presented at the Workshop were published in Logic, Language, Information and Computation – 20th International Workshop, WoLLIC 2013, edited by Leonid Libkin, Ulrich Kohlenbach, and Ruy de Queiroz, Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8071, a volume in the FoLLI-LNCS series. For the present issue, six of those papers were selected and appear here in fuller versions. All papers have been selected and refereed by a fresh panel of referees according to the usual JCSS standards. Held over the course of four days, WoLLIC 2013 included both extended tutorial sessions and general lectures, given by an international panel of the world’s top experts in the fields of theoretical and applied logic, linguistics, and computer science. The composition of the speakers and the other participants of the workshop reflected the diversity of the event: included were members of theoretical computer science, mathematics, philosophy, and linguistics communities from several geographical locales. The close contact between the speakers and the other participants ensured, within the intensive workshop environment, an intimate setting in which the free and fruitful exchange of ideas could take place.

As David Hemmendinger said in a thought piece that appeared recently in ACM Inroads: “Teaching computational thinking [to students in disciplines other than computer science] ... is to teach them how to think like an economist, a physicist, an artist, and to understand how to use computation to solve their problems, to create, and to discover new questions that can be fruitfully explored.” [1].	computation;computational science;computational thinking;computer science;sigcse	James Caristi;Valerie Barr;Joe Sloan;Eric Stahlberg	2011		10.1145/1953163.1953167	computational science;computer science;minor	Theory	-59.85358058018461	-20.659372873731435	122238

Christopher Jones's article reviews current work and makes predictions for the future. At Wolfram Research both of us have been engaged on the Mathematica® project[6] for most of its life. Through our work, we have gained much experience and insight into the development of integrated mathematical software. Many of the lessons that we have learned can be directly applied to the applications Jones foresees. In his article, Jones reviews some of the ways in which visualization is crucial to operations research (OR). The simplest of these involves the effective presentation of OR results while, for more complex uses, visualization is a key element of the solution process itself. A more specialized use involves the role of visualization in developing new OR algorithms. As visualization techniques are developed and become more widespread on existing computer systems, the use of visualization in OR will become more widely used and more soph...	program optimization	Jerry Keiper;Tom Wickham-Jones	1994	INFORMS Journal on Computing	10.1287/ijoc.6.3.273	simulation;computer science;mathematics	HPC	-49.18354858844607	-17.194184914246325	122388

Beatriz Ferreyra (see Figure 1) was born 21 June 1937 in Córdoba, Argentina. She studied piano with Celia Bronstein in Buenos Aires (1950–1956), harmony and musical analysis with Nadia Boulanger (1962), electroacoustic music with Edgardo Canton (1963), and composition with Earle Brown and György Ligeti (1967). Between 1963 and 1970, she worked in the research department of the Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française (ORTF), participating in the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM), under the leadership of Pierre Schaeffer. She contributed to Henri Chiarucci’s and Guy Reibel’s exploratory work “Rapport entre la hauteur et la fondamentale d’un son musical,” published in March 1966 in Revue Internationale d’Audiologie (Chiarucci and Reibel 1966). While at the GRM, Ms. Ferreyra aided in the realization of recordings for Pierre Schaeffer’s Solfège de l’Objet Sonore (Schaeffer 1967), also working as a teacher and giving lectures at the Conservatoire National Supérierur de Musique de Paris. Since 1970, she has been working as a freelance composer. She worked with Bernard Baschet and his Structures Sonores in 1970, and in 1975 she became a Member of the Collège des Compositeurs created by the Groupe de Musique Expérimentale de Bourges (GMEB). She became interested in the field of music therapy (1973–1977) and wrote several related compositions. Ms. Ferreyra was granted a residency in electronic music by Dartmouth College to work in their new digital music studio (1976), and again in 1998 to work on film music. She has been a member of several international music juries, including the Fourth International Competition of Experimental Music in Bourges (1976), the International Competition of Radiophonic Music Phonurgia Nova in Arles (1978), the International Competition sponsored by “Musiques et Recherches,” “Metamorphoses 2000” in Brussels (2000), and the Royal Conservatory of Mons Music 2000 in Belgium. She created the concert series “Rendez-vous de la musique concrète” at the Centre d’Etudes et de Recherches Pierre Schaeffer (1998–1999). Ms. Ferreyra has received commissions from several organizations, including the GRM, the Institut International de Musique Electroacoustique de Bourges (IMEB), and the Association pour la Collaboration entre les Instrumentistes et Compositeurs (ACIC). She composes music for concerts, festivals, ballets, and films. Table 1 lists her principal compositions and awards. Since 1961, Ms. Ferreyra has resided in France. This interview, which was conducted in English, took place by telephone on February 16, 2001, and was later augmented by electronic mail.	box counting;computer music journal;conservatory (greenhouse);déjà vu;email;linear algebra;list of code lyoko characters;maniac mansion	Kim S.

I was determined to enjoy this one, after having organized last year's conference in Pennsylvania. My son and I took a bus tour of Berlin on Sunday taking in all the usual sights--Checkpoint Charlie, the Wall, the Alexanderplatz, the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. The amount of construction was amazing. I had been to Berlin once before in the early 70's and had experienced Checkpoint Charlie firs thand in East Berlin--then under control of the Communists. We got back to the hotel about 5:00 p.m. and went to the car6 in front where we met Lynne Shaw and Mike Kent with his wife and daughter. It started to rain heavily, but fortunately it stopped just before 7:00 p.m., when we USA, Germany. and Russia get walked over to the Car6 Filmtogether at a pre-conference visit biihne nearby for a pre-conat the Caf6 Filmbahne ference get-together. Ray Polivka was there, as well as Jim Brown and Garth Foster. I also ran into Alan Graham, who had come all the way from Riga, Latvia, to attend the conference. Everybody was surprised to see me; apparently the previous conference chairman does not often attend the next conference.	apl;application checkpointing;cliff shaw;graham scan	Stephen M.

0ab6c78f35355fdad77578db4456de0adf16d1e6	review of algorithmic puzzles by anany levitin and maria levitin	algorithmic puzzle;maria levitin;anany levitin	In Math there is a some distinction between between recreational and serious mathematics. The main distinction seems to be how much prior knowledge you need. If a problem requires you to know Algebraic Geometry then it is probably not recreational. Beyond that it hard to say— there are some math problems that only require one clever trick, but that’s only known once that trick has been found. And some fields of math stem from so-called recreational problems (e.g., probability). Since computer science has been around for a much shorter period of time than mathematics the distinction between recreational and serious (is there such a thing?) computer science is far less clear. One criteria: the answer must be understandable by someone without too much prior knowledge. If the solution begins first take a z-transform then the problem is not recreational. The book Algorithmic Puzzles is mainly a collection or 150 algorithmic puzzles, hints on how to solve them, and then full solutions. Are these recreational or serious? Very hard to say. Some of them I’ve seen before in puzzle books. For example the Wolf-Goat-Cabbage problem. Others seem like a good way to introduce a serious topic. For example: Jack bets Jill that she can do the following trick. Jack will recite 99 different numbers from 1 to 100 in a random order and she Will be able to name the only number in that range that he will have missed. What is the best way for Jill to do the trick? Of course, she will have to perform the task in her head, without taking notes. This problem is an excellent introduction to the important field of streaming algorithms.	book;computer science;streaming algorithm	William I.

95cc378be6ce01e082d620aea75b7036ea8dfd31	special issue on challenges in knowledge discovery and data mining		Ten years have passed since Jan Zytkow passed away in the midst of rapid progress in data mining. Jan Zytkow started his research career in physics, where he became interested in the philosophical nature of scientific discovery. Then, he posed a question on how a computational machine could reason and discover knowledge, and performed research in Artificial Intelligence, more specifically on “scientific discovery” as proposed by Herbert Simon. He was involved in starting the area of knowledge discovery and data mining, now simply called “data mining”. However, what he had in mind were the sophisticated relationships among philosophy, science and data; he envisioned computer-based scientific discovery, which would contribute to science and other disciplines in the 21st century. We dedicate this Special Issue to Dr. Jan Zytkow, so as to honor his pioneering work. In this special issue, we reflect on the questions posed by Jan Zytkow, focusing on recent challenges in data mining, and envisioning the future of data mining from his perspective. Let us look at the status of data mining research in 2012. The Guest Editor has examined data mining manuscripts submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) since 2002; he tracked the trends in data mining research by using several techniques (IEEE ICDM 2002). The results obtained by trend-detection text-mining methods (Abe and Tsumoto 2012) are shown below. The following 20 keywords of abstracts in accepted papers are shown in increasing order of number of appearances: social, learning, matrix, network(s), prediction, factorization, graphs, sparse, robust, feature, topic, graph, online, detection, novel, anomaly detection, multiple applications, multi-task, and influence maximization.

a0229dd9edf546a574adc60cd15475b13b068c7a	"""editorial """"in honor of gustav feichtinger"""""""		The objective of this special issue is to demonstrate the influence of Prof. Gustav Feichtinger on OR in Austria. He became professor emeritus in 2008, but he is still highly active and also through his students, assistants, co-authors, and collaboration partners his work lives on. Many authors of this special issue have been former students and assistants of Gustav. Meanwhile, many of them became full professors in Austria or Germany. Furthermore, several national and international co-authors as well as collaboration partners from ÖGOR contributed to this special issue, with which we congratulate Gustav to his 70th birthday. It has been always important to him that his research is applied to crucial economic problems of public interest.

In particular, we consider machines supporting higher-level programming languages used in AI, mainly LISP. The emphasis will be on gaining a global perspective on the emerging field of AI machines rather than on a detailed treatment of specific issues. Thus, readers who are specialists in one of the fields touched (e.g., in parallel and associative machines) will not learn anything new about their particular field (on the contrary, they may contribute additional AI-relevant material to later versions of the survey). However, particularly for AI researchers worrying about the efficiency of their systems, this survey may provide a quick access to this important new research areas. For more specific questions the references in the extensive topic-indexed bibliography should be consulted.	abstract machine;artificial intelligence;lisp;personal computer;programming language	Harold Boley	1980	SIGART Newsletter	10.1145/1056447.1056449	applications of artificial intelligence;progress in artificial intelligence;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;abstract machine;programming language	AI	-56.95273428503381	-21.36461402185635	125020
924856abbfe7a6123f79d714a0a81c99ca54389a	biological data extinction	biological data	AS BIOINFORMATICIANS, we think of biological data in terms of an experiment and as a snapshot of some biological process. As such, we store and process large quantity of this data, and we seek to preserve the “sanctity of this data in perpetuity.” However, our users, the biologists, never look back at old data once they have reconciled the data by an appropriate biological model. In truth, data in biology become extinct and replaced by an understanding of the biological processes that generated them. The data of interest to our biologists are always the newer data that expand upon or challenge that understanding. This generation and expiration of data, that is, a life cycle, runs counter to the bioinformatician’s philosophy of data existence and permanence. What is this life cycle, and why is it important? To answer that, we need to follow the lifetime of a typical piece of biological datum. It is first born from an experiment conducted by a researcher. That experiment, in turn, is based on a hypothesis generated from a model for some biological processes. This data is stored, processed, retrieved many times during the course of research. It is accumulated until, collectively, they confirm or refute the hypothesis. However, once they achieved their purpose, their particular contributions will be integrated into the biological models that spawned them, that is, “replaced” by a better understanding of biology. Afterwards, the data is forgotten as the researcher progresses to the next hypothesis and the next experiment. If the generation, utilization, and expiration of biological data happen in a controlled, predictable, or designed fashion, we might have call this a “life cycle.” However, these events in the real world often reflect the Darwinian competition of scientific thought itself, that is, only the fittest survives. In this case, only the most perplexing data stay to challenge the next generation of models, while the rest unceremoniously become extinct as they are absorbed by refinements of the scientific process. Without recognition of this fact, long-running bioinformatics systems will suffer the same fate, as they are clogged with extinct data, they ultimately will be replaced by newer systems without such baggage. How do bioinformatics systems avoid the fate of extinction? Because of the inherent nature of the data, the data must be stored and manipulated with its context of the experiment, the hypothesis, and the model. As data, experiments, hypotheses, and models are reconciled, they are updated, archived or removed from the system appropriately. This is easier said than done. This expansion of information about a piece of data increases the complexity of our bioinformatics systems (databases, algorithms, UIs). Consequently, we don’t consistently capture this information: sometimes partially, sometimes implicitly, and sometimes not at all. Without complete background information, we are unable to reconcile and remove data from our systems, despite that much of it have become obsolete in the minds of our users through the course of scientific achievements. One might counter that, in a “hypotheses from data mining” paradigm, the experiments and the data are considered permanent so that new hypothesis can be continuously mined from the increasing stockpile of data. However, experimental data will change as the scientific process improves: newer instrumentation, techniques, and procedures expand and refine the experimental data. The newer and “cleaner” versions should deprecate older copies, but we rarely do that.

2b8186c79140573ef9f303a0f4b12cd77acf9e53	aaai fall symposium reports		Is it possible to build a conscious machine? Is trying to design and build a conscious machine helpful to understanding the nature of consciousness? These questions have been at the core of AI since its beginnings. Recently there was an upsurge of interest in whether AI could address the issue of consciousness. The primary goal of the symposium was to bring together experts from different disciplines who were interested in the relationships between AI and consciousness. The symposium was the first official place where scholars— coming from different fields as far as neuroscience and philosophy, psychology and computer science—addressed the issue of consciousness in a traditional AI environment. Furthermore, there was a good balance of American and European participants. The participants’ talks centered on the topic of the symposium and generated lively discussions of their research. Talks were balanced between implementation aspects and theoretical issues. The adopted relaxed scheduling let everybody present his or her own idea in a clear and pleasant way. The symposium included two invited talks. The first talk, given by Giulio Tononi (University of Wisconsin– Madison School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry), focused on an insightful theory of integrated information as the foundation of conscious experience. The second talk, given by Aaron Sloman (University of Birmingham, School of Computer Science), summarized many crucial issues in the understanding of AI research inspired by the study of consciousness. There was an almost generally accepted consensus among symposium participants on the following issues: (1) consciousness can be a source of inspiration for building better (more adaptive, more robust, more autonomous, more resilient) AI systems; (2) building AI systems aspiring to consciousness could be a testbed for psychological, philosophical, and neuroscientific theories of consciousness; (3) it is possible to address consciousness not only from neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, but also from AI; and (4) the role of embodiment and situatedness is almost universally recognized. A recurrent topic was the fact that the field of consciousness seems to be still far from a generalized consensus since it is rather unclear how to measure the advancements of various approaches, and further, it is often vague whether the work done really addresses the issue of consciousness or is just traditional AI. One of the most crucial and controversial aspects was, not surprisingly, the dichotomy between phenomenal Reports	aaron sloman;artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;computer science;consciousness;lively kernel;scheduling (computing);testbed;theory;vagueness	Jerry Ball;Chris Arney;Samuel Gerald Collins;Mitchell Marcus;Sergei Nirenburg;Antonio Chella;Kai Goebel;Jason H.

99c0cf3da7ebb0f1ef44e94fd791132b8c95940d	my introduction to top-trading cycles	top trading cycles	It is my great pleasure to be asked to make a few remarks at this dinner in honor of David Gale. While David and I did not overlap as graduate students at Princeton, we have seen each other frequently over the years, and while we have never actually written a paper together, we have shared many interests and have had many common intellectual concerns. I have to confess that I am often neglectful in my professional reading habits; I prefer to hear about my colleagues’ research by word of mouth. Over time I have developed a procedure that suits me well. Some papers that I intend to read I don’t finish, like papers in algebraic geometry where I simply don’t understand the terminology and never will. Other papers I read and then forget about in a week or two. But every once in a while, I am so taken by a piece of research that it becomes a permanent part of the syllabus of my course in mathematical economics. There are a number of papers authored by members of this evening’s audience that fall into this category. But for me the highest category is that set of articles that I wish that I had written myself. For example, I wish that I had written Debreu’s paper on the generality of market excess-demand functions, but the basic construction of his argument is one that I never would have thought of myself. Of all of the mathematical economists whom I know, David has the greatest number of papers in this category. I wish that I had written the paper with Lloyd on stable matchings. I wish that I had written his paper on revealed preference and the paper on instability of the competitive equilibrium. His work on duality theory is in this category as is his early proof of the existence of a competitive equilibrium in 1955, developed independently of Arrow, Debreu and McKenzie. The list is long: Gale diagrams, neighborly polytopes, and many others that I could cite. Lloyd Shapley, whom I had known as a graduate student at Princeton and as a colleague at RAND, visited Cowles in 1973. Several years earlier, I had demonstrated a theorem stating that a balanced N-person game had a non-empty core. The theorem applied to games without transferable utility and, as such, was a generalization of a previous result by Bondareva and Shapley on games with transferable utility. At the time of Lloyd’s visit, I had no applications of my theorem other than its use in demonstrating that a model of exchange with the customary convexity assumption gave rise to a game with a non-empty core. But this result follows easily from the fact that a competitive equilibrium is in the core; a result with its own classical proof. I was very eager to find a cooperative game without transferable utility, whose core could be shown to be non empty using my theorem and not by any other method. Lloyd and I started working on a game subsequently known as the house model. There are n players, each of whom owns a single house, and nothing else. Each player has a ranking of the n houses. A coalition S can permute the houses they own in an arbitrary way; each such permutation will provide a utility vector for that coalition. I still find it quite remarkable that this game is balanced, without any additional assumptions on the preferences, and therefore has a non-empty core. I gave a talk at Berkeley on this subject several months later, and spoke with great pleasure on the use of my theorem on balanced games. David was in the audience and came up to chat with me after my talk was over. He said to me, rather diffidently, “I think that I have another argument that the core is not empty.” And he told me about the notion of “top trading cycles,” and their use in providing a simple algorithm which always found a permutation in the core. I didn’t quite understand his argument immediately and told him that I would have to think about it a bit. I did think about his argument on the plane back to New Haven. When I returned, I sent David a letter with the phrase “I’m terribly sorry to have tell you that there is nothing wrong with your argument.” Of course, the house problem is similar in some respects to the matching problem, which Lloyd and David had written about a number of years earlier. Perhaps there is an analogy between “top trading cycles” and techniques that had previously arisen in this earlier work. But I suspect that this is not correct, and what I was exposed to was David’s extraordinary ability to penetrate to the heart of a mathematical topic immediately.	algorithm;bsd;competitive programming;data haven;diagram;instability;linear algebra;matching (graph theory);nash equilibrium;offset binary;online chat;top trading cycle;while	Herbert E.

Electric vehicle was used as a keyword to search parts of titles, abstracts, or keywords. Publication trends were analyzed by the retrieved results in publication outputs, subject categories and publication pattern, international productivity. The document co-citation analysis was done in CitespaceII to find out the intellectual base and research fronts of electric vehicle. The articles about electric vehicle increased fast in the last 20 years. 11 document types were found in all electric vehicle-related papers and proceedings paper was the most frequently used document type. Language analysis showed that English was the most dominating language. “Engineering electrical electronic”, “Energy fuels” and “Transportation science technology” were the top three most popular subject categories. Journal of Power Sources, IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology and IEEE Transaction on Industrial Electronics were the representative journals in the field of electric vehicle. The USA, China and Japan were the most productive countries. University of Michigan, Harbin Institute of Technology and Ohio State University were the most productive countries. Vehicle-to-grid technology, control strategy, combination of power management and traffic information from GPS, plug-in electric vehicle, architectures and modeling, battery and policy about electric vehicle are the research fronts of electric vehicle.	citation analysis;co-citation;control theory;global positioning system;plug-in (computing);power management;scientometrics;transportation science;web of science;world wide web	Yue Hu;Jun Sun;Weimin Li;Yunlong Pan	2013	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-013-1067-8	social science;computer science;data mining;operations research;world wide web	Visualization	-57.179120233375315	-13.879846966703356	126414

To assess the accuracy of this charge the works of earlier writers are examined for the presence of such features, and brief accounts of those found are given for Herbert Spencer, William James and the learning theorists Thorndike, Pavlov and Hull. The idea that cognition depends on associative connections among large networks of neurons is indeed one with precedents, although the implications of this for psychological issues have been interpreted variously — not all versions of connectionism are alike.	artificial neural network;cognition;computation;connectionism;jackson;theory	S.

The best source for open source software of all kinds is Source forge which is a warehouse of applications of all types, some more completely developed than others. CAVASS is an extension of the older 3DVIEWNIX developed by the Imaging Processing Group at the University of Pennsylvania. CAVASS is directed at the visualization, processing and analysis of 3-dimensional and higher-dimensional medical imaging. It runs on Windows, Unix, Linus, and Mac OS and supports parallel processing via clusters of computers. The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Validation Toolkit is useful for anyone working with multiple vendors who may interpret the DICOM standard differently. It was developed as a clinical engineering tool to aid DICOM integration at clinical sites. The DCM4CHE DICOM archive is an effort from the Department of Radiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine. The archive, now called DCM4CHEE to indicate that it could be an enterprise archive, was designed around Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) and is essentially a free, open-source, cross-platform DICOM archive. The DCM4CHEE can be used as an archive, a teaching system, or a testing system. MIRTH is an open source solution for healthcare interoperability. It is specifically designed for Health Level 7 message integration and provides the tools for developing, testing, deploying, and monitoring interfaces. Osirix has long been a standard in open source image display and navigation. It is currently supported on the Mac OS platform with an app for the iphone. This software is so well designed and so useful that many sites use it for clinical workstations. The Extensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit is a platform to facilitate management and productivity tasks for neuroimaging and associated data. In addition to data entry forms, it includes a DICOM interface as well as an interface to analyze for including images and analysis results.

ffe21a701c18128cd9dddbe711c73aa88bec7f1b	philosophically speaking		"""I like nothing so much as a good philosophical discussion. For one thing, it just feels so delightfully scientific to be bandying about high minded terms like """"epistemology,"""" """"ontology,"""" """"realism,"""" """"relativism,"""" and """"paradigm"""" with great abandon. For another thing, it is simply essential in my view of the world of science to which I enjoy belonging that one should be fully engaged in the ethical and normative underpinnings of scientific practice. That, to me, operationally characterizes philosophy of science. Our scientific philosophies facilitate the debating, codifying, and explicating of our """"agreed-to rules of the road"""" for doing our work. They are our scientific code of conduct, so to speak. In my way of thinking, the rules of the road are important for all good researchers to understand and share if we are to hew faithfully to our paradigms and do good normal science research.  The problem for me is that I see the emerging debate over whether our field is a science or not through two distinct lenses, and I'm getting some parallax out of it. I've earned two doctorates at two different stages of my career; one in marketing when I was much younger, and one more recently in information systems. That does not make me any smarter than the average bear, and it could certainly be argued that it's a sure sign of not being smarter, since one could say I had to do it twice to get it right. Yet, it has afforded me a very unique perspective on the emerging ontological debate about our discipline because, quite literally, I Have Been There Before! I've studied the Philosophy of Science two fulsome times in my career, and I've gotten some interesting perspectives each time as each was in the midst of an existential debate over status, and both of these experience bear upon my agenda-setting here, as an editor.   While learning my scientific craft as a first-time doctoral student in marketing, I reveled in the debate that much of academic marketing was enmeshed in during the 80s on whether marketing was a science or a technology and if a science, how best to be practiced. We future scientists all read Kuhn (1970) in our philosophy of science seminar, as well as Dubin (1978) and a flock of excellent philosophical essays collected in a tome edited by the redoubtable Jagdish Sheth (Sheth & Garrett, 1986) - a philosophy of science volume that many in marketing and elsewhere still use, aged though it might be. We marketers also saw a collection of philosophical essays by thought leaders of the field under such titles as """"Marketing, Scientific Progress, and the Scientific Method"""" (Anderson, 1983), """"On Making Marketing Science more Scientific"""" (Arndt, 1985), """"Paradigms Lost"""" (Deshpande, 1983), and """"Metatheory and Metamethodology in Marketing"""" (Leong, 1985). The debate in marketing continued well past that point and has extended into recent years (e.g., Brown, 1996; Easton, 2002), indicating that the debate we have now in information systems has years yet to go. It is not a simple question we deal with, and the answers take time and fulsome consideration."""	emotions;essays;information systems;ontology;philosophy;rule (guideline);speaking (activity)	Thomas F.

After a brief exchange of the usual initial greetings, our conversation turned to a discussion of his research work in relativity. I soon learned that his research was on a generalization of general relativity along the lines of Kaluza-Klein theory. Instead of the usual spacetime metric tensor, he was focusing on a metric tensor that not only involved spacetime, but also included four velocity and Andrei Sakharov’s maximum acceleration hypothesis. This in turn led to a spacetime manifold based on Finslerian Geometry. We decided to continue our conversation in the ARL cafeteria. Over a cup of coffee, he queried me about my research interests. So I in turn talked about my research program in algebraic and differential topology and higher-dimensional knot theory. Much to my surprise, he was intensely interested, frequently interrupting my explanation with delving questions. And so a long-term friendship was born.	interrupt;linear algebra;numerical relativity;signal processing;velocity (software development)	Samuel J.

16732a0dfd7a42dde11de50dded3ede7ff3a9713	the annals of computing: the greek testament	computational linguistic	Fifteen years ago, at a historical exhibition of computers and computer techniques, I was introduced to the audience as a historical monument. I was rather offended until I thought it over and realized it was true, undeniably true. As far back as 1947, I first suggested to my teacher in Glasgow, Professor G.H.C. Macgregor, that New Testament studies might be much improved by a little scientific discipline, but it was only in 1957, after struggling with punched cards, that we decided to use a computer. The first foundation to which we applied for funding wrote back that they gave no money for office machinery. When we explained a bit more, they found the idea stimulating and offered us two pounds, then exactly five dollars. Real support arrived in 1960 when Professor A.D. Booth of London offered to help. He was tn computing very early, built iris first three machines himself, and had the standing required to attract grants. He also has access to the London Mercury machine, then the only one available for British universities. Booth's department was housed in another ancient monument, a large water tank that had been made from prefabricated concrete sections during the Blitz. After the war it had been drained, some sections had been replaced by doors and windows, and a roof had been stuck on. Those who operated out of the Torrington Square water tank now constitute one of the most exclusive computing clubs. With Booth to help, Macgregor and I got a grant of s 800 in 1960 from Carnegie to buy a teletypewriter with a Greek character set, a tape reader, and a con-	after the war;character encoding;computer;mercury;microsoft windows;money;punched card;testament	A.

These include CCS, pi-calculus, timed and stochastic process algebra, VDM, Z, B, Automata and Timed Automata, Petri Nets, Statecharts, Logics, TLA, Message Sequence Charts, ADT's, OBJ, Larch, formal Object-Oriented approaches, the international standards Estelle, LOTOS, SDL, ASN.1 and TTCN, and others.#R##N##R##N#Formal specification languages have been designed to support the description of system structure and behaviour in terms of concepts such as event occurrence, observation and experiment, temporal ordering, causality, cooperation and synchronisation among entities, non determinism, concurrency and parallelism, state changes and invariants, and others. While considerable experience has been gained in the application of formal methods to the areas for which they were initially conceived, the high abstraction level of these concepts suggests that they could play an important role in several other disciplines such as chemistry, biology, physics and even arts, humanites and social sciences.#R##N##R##N#After two decades of ‘traditional’ applications, during which the initial gap between the excessive optimism of academic supporters and the skepticism of industrial detractors have been substantially reduced, often leading to a positive and constructive attitude towards their adoption, formal methods are perhaps ready to spread out of their native territory and, at the turn of the decade and millenium, invade new exciting areas of research, thus providing a much wider exploitation of the huge intellectual investment behind their definition. In fact, it is often the case that a technique designed with a particular application in mind, turns out to perform better and to be more useful in a context other than the originally intended one.#R##N##R##N#For more information on the spectrum of topics within the remit of the FM-Elsewhere initiative, see this web page. A list of existing “Elsewhere” applications of formal methods can also be accessed at this web page.#R##N##R##N#The FM-Elsewhere workshop, co-located with FORTE-PSTV-2000 in Pisa, was a forum for researchers interested in the application of formal methods, as identified above, to virtually any area of research, except communication protocols and software engineering. The talks included in the workshop covered the spectrum of FM-Elsewhere areas.

2bfcf885e14f95796a5171e9b5f88a07e8742e41	applications of soft computing - some personal reflections	soft computing;fuzzy logic	Some experiences of the cooperation of the Fuzzy Logic Laboratorium Linz-Hagenberg (Austria) with industrial partners are described. Special emphasis is given to the intelligent combination of various mathematical methods. 1 Industrial cooperation Cooperating with the industry, as it is done quite sucessfully by the FLLL (Fuzzy Logic Laboratorium Linz-Hagenberg), a division of the Department of Mathematics of the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, for a number of years with Austrian and international companies, is quite different a task as compared with doing research, even with doing applied research. This little note therefore intends to discuss some of our experience in such cooperations in a way which may be useful for other colleagues in the field. The main goal of an industry-university cooperation is usually f to solve a real world problem f in the best possible way, f but also at the lowest possible cost, therefore making usable the scientific knowledge and power of a research institution to a commercial company. A strong motivation (and, therefore, almost a necessary condition) for a company to look for university support is that the problem they have hurts them severely (in terms of high costs or low quality or both), and that it cannot be solved within the company itself. There are many other conditions to be met in such a projects which shall be discussed below. Issues such as tractability and robustness of the solution provided play an important role. Issues which are crucial for discussions within the scientific community such as theoretical elegance, priority, or simply how to name an object, play a much smaller role. This is the reason why we shall not enter here the (albeit necessary) discussion what soft computing should be ideally or whether it should better be called computational intelligence. 2 FLLL experience Since 1993, the FLLL has been involved in a number of projects, most of which resulted in software packages for quality control (see, e.g., [1]—[10]). In each of these expert systems, the intelligent interpretation of signals was the key issue. The signals we dealt with so far are of very different type, including f optical data (images), f music data, f acoustic data, f data from various measurements. The industrial partners include international companies such as SONY or the Swedish paper company SCA, but also smaller Austrian enterprises. More recently, we also started a control project with an electric power plant on the Danube river.	acoustic cryptanalysis;amiga reflections;computation;computational intelligence;expert system;fuzzy logic;kepler;robustness (computer science);soft computing	Erich-Peter Klement	1998	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s005000050028	fuzzy logic;fuzzy electronics;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;soft computing;algorithm	Robotics	-58.40002187900468	-21.759638613645485	130287

He became aware of the birth of AI when he was an undergraduate at Carnegie Tech (later, Carnegie Mellon University). Continuing to graduate school there, he was mentored by Herbert Simon, and he also collaborated with Allen Newell. His career has taken him from Carnegie to the University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, RAND, and the Pentagon. Feigenbaum has also authored and coedited several seminal AI books: Computers and Thought (1963), The Fifth Generation (1983), and the four-volume Handbook of Artificial Intelligence (1980s). In this interview, David Alan Grier and Feigenbaum talk about his career, his mentor Herbert Simon, and the development of AI.	feigenbaum constants	David Alan Grier	2013	IEEE Annals of the History of Computing	10.1109/MAHC.2013.49	history;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;engineering physics;management	Visualization	-58.83864028972648	-17.088483947140997	130778

In 18 years of attending the conference, I’ve seen it grow, shrink, re-grow, and shrink yet again. The focus has shifted from extremely technical, to human oriented, and back. But what I’ve really been observing for all these years has been the growth of an industry. That’s something that has both upsides and downsides.

Without Glenna’s efforts, the TRANSACTIONS would not be as error-free and expeditious as it has been. I also have enjoyed excellent cooperation with Michelle Meeh and Bill Colacchio, highly-trained and professional staff members at IEEE Headquarters, who are responsible for producing the TNN at a bimonthly rate. My gratitude also goes to Dr. Darrel L. Chenoweth, Chairman of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, who has allowed Glenna and me, but ultimately also every TNN author, to use the departmental infrastructure for the benefit of the IEEE. Thanks to Darrel’s understanding of editorial efforts, and his recognition of how important IEEE publications are for faculty research and for graduate students’ future careers, he has been very generous in allowing us to share the university’s 4 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOL. 15, NO. 1, JANUARY 2004 scarce resources towards the benefit of our Editorial Office established at the University of Louisville in late 1997. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Anna, my bride of 30 years, for her patience when I had to constantly run the TRANSACTIONS at the expense of other of life’s activities. Indeed, the workweek was often not long enough for my combined commitments as an endowed professor, active researcher, efficient advisor, responsive editor, NNS volunteer, and the head of the household, and we often had to wait weeks for addressing ordinary household tasks that required my attention. I also believe that our two children, Joanna and Mark, now both young adults and in college, must also have learned something from their father’s editorial experience. My belief is that they have learned more about giving. They hopefully have learned that giving means more in life than taking, and giving as opposed to taking is at the true root of fulfillment. And with this feeling of fulfillment of an accomplished mission, I would like to pass the baton to my talented successor, Dr. Polycarpou. Best wishes of success for you and the TRANSACTIONS! JACEK M.

After a whirlwind tour of CHI 2016 in sunny San Jose, where I reminisced with a great many old friends even as I encountered new ones for the first time . . . . . . and presented my latest work (with Seongkook Heo of KAIST, and others) on pre-touch sensing for mobile interaction—a fancy-pants way of saying that we played around with a phone that is aware of, and can respond to, approaching fingers (as well as how the user is gripping the device)—the video for which, astoundingly, has already garnered over half a million views . . . . . . and I hosted our esteemed editorial board for the annual TOCHI luncheon, where we had many provocative discussions, and I then rushed from the afternoon session and braved the fumes of jet fuel to catch my flight back home . . . . . . where I am now buried up to my elbows in TOCHI manuscripts that (most deservedly) demand my full attention . . . . . . and not to mention, in my occasional sidelight as an author of visions of a fictional bent, two acceptances that have also rolled into my inbox in the last couple of weeks for esteemed British venues Interzone and Nature (yes, the scientific journal; they publish a highly entertaining fiction column, called Futures, on the last page of each issue) . . . —and— . . . not to further mention, on top of THAT, my employer finally, finally shipping simultaneous pen and touch in the operating system, as announced at \\build, which has been a dream of mine since those halcyon days (circa 2009) when tablets first started to take the world by storm. . . (!) Ooof. Gotta stop and catch my breath here. Because, of course, the most exciting thing on my plate at this very moment is that the time has snuck up on me to send yet another sterling issue of TOCHI out the door. To seek its fortune in the scientific literature, where I’m sure that each and every article will set a foundation. And create a lasting impact that will long exceed my tenure at the journal. ∗ ∗ ∗	chi;circa;dbpedia;futures studies;halcyon days: interviews with classic computer and video game programmers;inbox by gmail;mobile interaction;operating system;scientific literature;yet another	Ken Hinckley	2016	ACM Trans.

e983f37aa157af3d389dad60b9b1166285e72da9	the third international conference on human-robot interaction	human robot interaction	Human-Robot Interaction (HRI-2008) was held March 12–15, 2008, in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The conference was jointly sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) through SIGCHI and SIGART and by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. The conference was organized in cooperation with AAAI, the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, and the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society. The Naval Research Laboratory, the National Science Foundation, and the European Network for the Advancement of Artificial Cognitive Systems (EU Cognition) provided grants. More than 250 representatives from academia, government, and industry attended HRI2008. HRI is the premier forum for the presentation and discussion of research results in human-robot interaction. HRI is designed as a singletrack, highly selective annual conference that seeks to showcase the very best research and thinking in humanrobot interaction. Human-robot interaction is inherently interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, and the conference sought papers from researchers in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, ergonomics, human-computer interaction, psychology, robotics, and other fields. The theme of HRI-2008, “living with robots,” highlights the importance of building core science in HRI so that robots can be employed in everyday environments over the long term. In particular, understanding and identifying the key social and technical issues for robots operating in settings such as home, office, shopping, and museum environments is crucial for developing effective systems. HRI2008 placed special emphasis on informing the development of companion and assistive robots. It also featured a panel on “robo-ethics” intended to start a discussion of the ethical and societal implications of autonomous robots and a panel on “what is HRI?” that examined the constitutive components of human-robot interaction. Of the 134 submissions, the program committee accepted 48 full papers and 24 short papers spanning a wide range of topics, including field experiments and user studies, HRI foundations, multimodal interaction, and ethics. A total of 10 videos (out of 27 submissions) were featured in a special session. HRI-2008 included three workshops and a tutorial. The workshops addressed metrics (an examination of proposed guidelines for evaluating HRI), coding behavioral video data (discussion of methods, problems, and Reports	artificial intelligence;automation;autonomous robot;cognition;cognitive science;experiment;file spanning;human factors and ergonomics;human–computer interaction;human–robot interaction;ieee systems, man, and cybernetics society;international conference on human-robot interaction;multimodal interaction;robotics;sigchi;usability testing	Terrence Fong;Kerstin Dautenhahn;Matthias Scheutz;Yiannis Demiris	2008	AI Magazine		human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;operations research	Robotics	-55.589910501494856	-20.663526516504326	133101

Users of the system can store in the computer an updated file of their current knowledge, and on selecting a paper to read, they can obtain from the computer the minimum subtree of theorems required to bring them from what they already know to the background knowledge which the paper assumes. Under certain conditions, means are also provided for the contribution of useful comments by the readers of a work and for interaction between commentators and with the author. This paper describes how the system can be organized and the role required of readers, writers, and commentators.	computer;multiseat configuration;tree (data structure)	David Pager	1972	Commun.

As Smith (in press) has pointed out, critics have systematically evaded the questions of literary value and evaluation for the past fifty years. They have concentrated almost exclusively on questions of literary interpretation and understanding. In so ignoring questions of value or preference, they have made it impossible to attack the question of literary change.

73e63a8c30f61f37e5ca0bdd0888f76a86522e97	the life and work of victor l. selivanov		Victor L. Selivanov was born on the 25th of August, 1952, in Oktyabr’sky, a small industrial city in the Republic of Bashkortostan (Russian Federation), near the border with Tatarstan. He was the fourth (and youngest) child in his family. His parents Lev N. Selivanov and Lidya G. Selivanova both worked as mathematics teachers at a college in Oktyabr’sky. He graduated with honours from Kazan State University (1974) and became a postgraduate student of M.M. Arslanov and R.G. Bukharayev in Kazan. In 1979 he was awarded a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Novosibirsk University. The title of the thesiswas “On computable numberings”. Victor defended his habilitation thesis “Hierarchical classi cation of arithmetical sets and index sets” at the Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Devision of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk in 1989. After spending a few years (1978–82) as Assistant Professor, rst at Ulyanovsk Polytechnic Institute and then at Kazan Institute of Chemical Technology, he moved to Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University, where he was Senior Lecturer (1982–86), Docent (1986–90), Professor (1990–91) and Head of the Chair of Informatics and Discrete Mathematics (1991–2009). In 1993 he was appointed Full Professor. Since 2009 he is Chief Research Fellow at the A.P. Ershov Institute of Informatics Systems of the Siberian Devision of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Selivanov’s research started in 1974 when he became a postgraduate student at Kazan State University. It is devoted to Mathematical Logic, Computer Science, and Didactics of Mathematics and Informatics. The main focus of his research is computability, ranging from general computability theory to automata theory. In the beginning his main contributions were in numbering theory. Later he shifted to the study of hierarchies, which is still his central interest.	academy;automata theory;cr rao advanced institute of mathematics, statistics and computer science;computability theory;computable function;discrete mathematics;informatics;victor a. vyssotsky;victor animatograph corporation	Dieter Spreen	2014		10.1515/9781614518044.1		Theory	-57.63957812436188	-16.437023720168817	133776

1ba33734bf596140fdd8ecdef747b391c882e358	editorial: farewell 2013, welcome 2014		THE IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC) had a great year in 2013 and will have an even better year in 2014. In 2013, TSC expanded in a number of dimensions, including scope, editorial board, and contributing communities. First, TSC expanded its scope by introducing the new taxonomy of services computing (http://www.computer.org/ portal/web/tsc/taxonomy). This new taxonomy broadens the scope of TSC from the foundations of services computing to cover cloud computing services, big data technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), social computing, and business management. This new taxonomy refl ects the continued advancements of services computing from both services science and services engineering perspectives. Second, TSC has expanded its editorial board to 43 associate editors in response to the broadening scope of TSC and the growing community of researchers and practitioners as authors and readers. More importantly, the TSC community continues to expand and attract both technical professionals and business management professionals. In recognition of its important role, TSC has been indexed by major indexing systems, such as Thomson Reuters (ISI), EI Compendex, and Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-e). TSC welcomes 2014 with a number of new projects on the way. First, we are introducing survey papers as a featured section in TSC regular issues, in addition to special topic sections where guest editors are invited to solicit submissions on hot and emerging topics of special interests. The survey papers section will be dedicated to publishing survey articles on all areas of services computing covered by the TSC taxonomy. In addition, we are planning to work with the steering committees of the IEEE International Conference on Web Services and the IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing to create TSC special sessions. Authors of TSC accepted papers are offered an opt-in opportunity to present their work at one of these two conferences. Furthermore, I am working closely with the TSC advisory board to explore new dimensions to attract higher readership and authorship from the business and management community. Finally, I will continue to work with the TSC editorial board through multiple threads to maintain the average review cycle of three months and the average queuing time of less than one year for accepted papers to appear. One new thread of such effort is to continue TSC’s participation in the newly introduced Reviewer Appreciation Program by the IEEE Computer Society. As Editor-in-Chief, I am very pleased with the growth of TSC in 2013. I would like to take this opportunity to express appreciation for the continued contributions from authors, readers, associate editors, reviewers, TSC advisory board members, as well as the IEEE Computer Society staff and TSC assistants. Finally, I hope that you will enjoy reading the fi rst issue of TSC in 2014.

2c2bdb74c827b2d23918f1f9eb1adebdee3e6eb3	"""""""field reviews"""": a new style of review article for artificial intelligence"""	artificial intelligent	In this issue, we have two reviews of machine learning books. The first is a relatively conventional review of two “classical” machine learning text books which we believe provides a useful comparison between the two books. In this kind of review the focus is on the book(s) and how well it addresses a field. The second review is rather different, and in some ways takes a dual approach—it considers a whole field and looks at books which address it. Our motivation for this was that we were struck by the huge variety of approaches to machine learning now to be found, and the corresponding diversity of books. We thought it would be useful to have a rather more far reaching review, which attempted to survey the field, using recently published books as “vantage points” from which to discuss the various approaches and to compare and contrast them. This is not an easy task and we were fortunate to be able to persuade Peter Flach to take on this brief. We hope readers of Artificial Intelligencewill find this style of review useful, and would welcome suggestions for other areas to be treated in this way, and volunteers to take on such missions.	artificial intelligence	Anthony G.

In this letter he raised the claim that nature provides evidence for intelligent design and criticizes evolutionary biologists for being unable to recognize the design. The letter reads: “Any system of thought that denies or seeks to explain away the overwhelming evidence for design in biology is ideology, not science.” and “Scientific theories that try to explain away the appearance of design as the result of ‘chance and necessity’ are not scientific at all, but ... an abdication of human intelligence.” Thereby, the Cardinal rejects the concept of evolution driven by random variation and selection, apostrophized as “chance and necessity” in the Neo-Darwinian spirit. The two quoted sentences are remarkable not only because the Cardinal aims at the recognition of intelligent design in nature but also because he accuses evolutionary biologists of adhering to an ideology. Almost all scientists who answered the letter reacted sharply because they felt that science has its own well-established rules for the dialog of the researcher with nature, and this dialog so far has not led to the necessity to assume a plan or a designer for understanding the evolution of the biosphere. The reaction of the nonscientific public, however, was ambiguous: Some answers were liberal and said: “Let the scientists do their job and define what science is about, and accordingly the Cardinal should care about belief and religion.” An appreciable fraction of letters to newspapers in response to the letter in the New York Times, however, welcomed the Cardinal’s position because they found that time has come to regulate scientific thought. Without digging into the deeper reasons of the somewhat burdened relation between science and laymen in the public, it seems in place to address some facts concerning the issues on which the most frequently invoked arguments for design are built. In the following six paragraphs an attempt is made to present these facts in the light of biology of today, which is more than 50 years after the formulation of the synthetic or Neo-Darwinian theory of evolution.

98cc1ef1debe54eb2f55b52b9ddbd04378f50943	a message from the outgoing editor-in-chief		I T IS my pleasure to announce that the new Editor-in-Chief (EiC) of our Transactions is Prof. Tzong-Lin Wu. He has already taken brilliantly the office of EiC. In almost last three years, many things have been done to make significant improvements to this Journal. They range from the introduction of regulations that helped to make clear and more transparent the management and actions of all the officials (EiC, AEs, reviewers, etc.), a new definition of the time frame in which all the actions of the review process of a paper should be done, an EMC-oriented taxonomy of the reviewers’ competencies in order to facilitate their proper selection by the Associate Editors. Particular care has been given to the future of the publication by nominating young and competent new AEs that with their fresh energies and relevant scientific skills project the Transactions on the new frontiers of EMC. The T-EMC Advisory Board has been enriched by two members with a strong industrial background in order to offer their experience and views in steering the Transactions toward relevant and real-world topics. The Distinguished Reviewers Award has been continued and a new regulation for the Best Transaction Paper Award has been proposed and approved for a more selective and scientifically consistent choice of the winner. But all these successfully implemented initiatives (that are a part of many others, such as the definitive cleaning of the T-EMC User database, the paginated online publication of the issues with an average of three months in advance with respect to the nominal date, a good number of well-received Special Issues and Sections, the introduction of the category of Review Papers, etc.) converge toward the achievement of a constant increasing trend of the bibliometric figure of merits, such as the impact factor (IF).

It is characterized as the project of a science of the systemic interpretation of the “real”, renamed here “general systemology”. The contexts and modes of its elaboration, publication and implementation are discussed. The paper mostly focuses on the works of its instigator: Ludwig von Bertalanffy. However, general systemology was a collective project: the main contributions of other “systemologists”, from the 1950s until the 1970s, are hence also considered. Its solidarity with the history of the Society for General Systems Research is notably discussed. A reconstruction of the systemological hermeneutics is undertaken on this basis. It finds out the potential systematic unity underlying the diversity of the contributions to this both scientific and philosophical project. Light is thus shed on the actual scope of von Bertalanffy’s works.	cybernetics	David Pouvreau	2014	Int. J.

dd551d546e1c14b3e6f9023cead068f822a82a93	lexiclone lexical cloning systems		Ilya S. Geller igeller@lexiclone.com Abstract. In this article I substantiate my position that a human being is a point of accumulation – that is, an object. And based on this assumption I provide a foundation for my ontological justification of Differential Linguistics: I then introduce the understanding that ‘becoming better and the best’ is what motivates an object to movement (and change). Then I link this position with Egoism, and to achieve an understanding of what Egoism is I find it necessary to bring in the foundations I had previously elaborated for the New Mechanics and Differential Philosophy of Cynicism. Then I affirm that an object seeks information in order to ‘become better and the best’, and I show that information is required egoistically and that the finding of information is made possible by asking two classes of questions: factoid and definition questions.	tree accumulation	Ilya S.

Today even the largest philosophy departments cannot claim to cover the entire discipline. The traditional solution to the problem of attaining an overview of the profession as a whole, of “representing philosophy,” has been to print encyclopedias, dictionaries, handbooks, and indexes of philosophy. Encyclopedias promised the most comprehensive coverage, and for Anglophone readers, the publication of Macmillan’s The Encyclopedia of Philosophy in 1967 was a landmark effort in that direction. It took another thirty years for other encyclopedias of philosophy to be produced that attempted to cover even more unmanageable amounts of published literature. By this time, futurists inspired by the amazing growth of the World Wide Web (WWW) were already predicting the demise of the traditional book and its replacement by on-line publication in ever-increasing volumes. Whatever happens to traditional books, it is clear that digital technologies have changed the terrain in which all academic disciplines operate. The development of computers and philosophy have been intertwined from the beginning of computing, and philosophical ideas—such as the application of logic and formal ontology (in a sense that is now fully co-opted by computer scientists) to the organization of information—continue to be a driving force in the development of the WWW. Philosophers have also spearheaded numerous digital projects, and by the mid 1990s they were among the first humanities scholars to recognize the potential of the WWW for organizing their discipline.

e44e2551a08276b7c32454cf406bcff1c9247360	peer review and churchill		I’ve written a large number of articles over the last forty years, but rather few research papers going through the peer review or refereeing process. One of them came to mind when I read a paper we’re publishing in the current issue, by Claudiu Heteliu and others, on possible ‘coercive citation’—if that’s an unfamiliar expression [1], it will become clear soon... One of the reviewers of my paper basically thought it was ok, but very much thought it needed a couple of citations to other work. The editor (correctly) thought this made it so obvious who the reviewer was, he revealed his name—unnecessarily, since it was of course the author of the works to be cited. I didn’t mind since, while I didn’t think they were necessary, they weren’t irrelevant either, and I had no real objection to giving him a little extra publicity. You could call this a very modest or moderate version of ‘coercive citation’ since the reviewer may have felt it was at least possible that the article should be rejected if I didn’t comply. Now fast forward a decade or two, to the beginning of the time when Impact Factor (IF) became the most important metric supposedly determining the quality and status of journals. One or two major publishers were quick to see how this could be ‘gamed’ such that they persuaded some of their editors to ask authors, as part of the review process, for more citations in their papers to other papers in the same journal. Although it is possible to filter out such self-citations, it nevertheless boosts the IF—a more direct and slightly cynical, if not sinister, example of coercive citation. Still, that’s at the journal level. Heteliu’s article raises the possibility, now that we use a number of metrics to ‘rate’ individuals, that it may be happening at that level too, e.g. to boost the h-index of some editors and other individuals. As it happens, that’s not the only potential peer review problem we feature in the current issue. John Wyndham (no not the famous science fiction author—he’s long dead) has written about some of the editing and reviewing issues in obtaining publication of evidence of alternative explanations of how 9/11 occurred [2]. Of course, problems with peer review are nothing new. There is now a vast literature on the topic—books, papers, and international conferences, and many studies indicating various types of bias—institutional, gender and more as well as discussion on the various types—single or double-blind, post publication etc. Many proposals have been made on other systems and some have been and are being tried. It’s worth pointing out that the vast majority of researchers will nevertheless, and almost certainly correctly, retain their faith in the value of peer review. As I have said many times, peer review is important for the reviewer as well as the reviewed. So what does all this have to do with Sir Winston Churchill? Well, you may have guessed, but it’s worth pointing out that he had a number of both important and unimportant connections to publishing and communication, not least in being awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize for literature.

GRANDIHC-Br presents five major research challenges for the period of 2012 to 2022. Aiming to verify how the local HCI community have been embracing such challenges, we present a statistical analysis considering the challenges, the annual Brazilian HCI Symposium topics of interest, and the keywords on the accepted papers from 2013 until 2015. The results show that there is still a feeble connection between the challenges and the Brazilian HCI research topics. From our analysis we point out the need for an update on the topics of interest for the HCI national Symposium, we believe as necessary to stimuli the Brazilian HCI community to face such challenges for the current decade."""	compiler;human–computer interaction	André O.

c04c7c840f5f113b9b8ed85f8532272819c2151c	gualtiero piccinini: physical computation: a mechanistic account		Piccinini’s Physical Computation. A Mechanistic Account asks a simple question with important ramifications: What is a concrete computational system? The answer is that concrete computational systems are kinds of functional mechanisms. Specifically, the distinctive feature of concrete computational systems is that one of their functions is ‘‘the manipulation of vehicles based solely on differences between different portions of the vehicles according to a rule defined over the vehicles’’ (p. 1). Piccinini articulates this mechanistic account of concrete computation over sixteen chapters, weaving together ideas and evidence from several fields— including philosophy of science, computer science, AI, biology, and cognitive neuroscience. The arguments are clear and meticulous, and the writing style is crisp. Piccinini does an admirable job at guiding readers through the different steps of his account. To illustrate the ramifications of Piccinini’s book, consider the chess match of Deep Blue v. Kasparov. In 1997, the Russian chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov played a six-game match against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. Deep Blue was a massively parallel, RS/6000 SP Thin P2SC-based system with 30 nodes, with each node containing a 120MHz P2SC microprocessor, enhanced with 480 special purpose VLSI chess chips. Its chess playing program was written in C and ran under the IBM AIX operating system. Deep Blue had trained by observing and analysing thousands of chess master games. It used one gigabyte of random access memory on each of its 30 nodes, for a total of 30 gigabytes of data about thousands of opening and endgame positions. Although Kasparov bragged he would never lose to a machine, the Russian Grandmaster was finally defeated.	aix;cognitive science;computational physics;computer science;deep blue (chess computer);deep blue versus garry kasparov;gigabyte;ibm scalable powerparallel;manhunters;microprocessor;model of computation;operating system;rs/6000;random access;random-access memory;supercomputer;very-large-scale integration	Matteo Colombo	2016	Minds and Machines	10.1007/s11023-016-9397-y	artificial intelligence;computer science;computational biology;computation;mechanism (philosophy)	Logic	-57.060341985125326	-22.844407835847957	136648

It is integrated in the Moltke workbench 2 for technical diagnosis, which was developed at the university of Kaiserslautern over the past years (cf. e.g. 4, 5, 23]), Moltke contains other parts as well (cf. e.g. 16]), in particular a model-based approach (cf. 21, 22]); in Patdex 3] where essentially the heuristic features are located. The use of cases also plays an important role for knowledge acquisition. In this paper we describe Pat-dex from a principal point of view and embed its main concepts into a theoretical framework. This research has a number of mainly indirect connections to the work of Woody Bledsoe. We mention his interest in analogy, his early connectionist work and his innuence in merging mathematics and artiicial intelligence. For the rst author the main point was that Woody Bledsoe brought him in contact with AI at an early stage. More than twenty years ago we started a lively discussion which still goes on and will hopefully last for many more years.	artificial intelligence;case-based reasoning;connectionism;dex;expert system;heuristic;knowledge acquisition;lively kernel;workbench	Michael M.

Isaac Asimov's Laws of Robotics, first formulated in 1940. were primarily a literary device intended to support a series of stories about robot behavior. Over time, he found that the three Laws included enough apparent inconsistencies, ambiguity. and uncertainty to provide the conflicts required for a great many stories. In examining the ramifications of these laws. Asimov revealed problems that might later confront real roboticists and information technologists attempting to establish rules for the behavior of intelligent machines. As information technology evolves and machines begin to design and build other machines, the issue of human control gains greater significance. In time, human values tend to change; the rules reflecting these values, and embedded in existing robotic devices, may need to be modified. But if they are implicit rather than explicit, with their effects scattered widely across a system, they may not be easily replaceable. Asimov himself discovered many contradictions and eventually revised the Laws of Robotics. >	laws of robotics	Roger Clarke	1994	IEEE Computer	10.1109/2.248881	behavior-based robotics;robot;simulation;uncertainty;sci-fi;computer science;artificial intelligence;software engineering;motion planning;software testing;scattering;management;information technology;computer security;heart	Robotics	-56.70433047201471	-23.080395607454303	137374

In this paper we look at the email archives of two open source projects and answer questions like the following: How many emails contain patches? How long does it take for a patch to be accepted? Does the size of the patch influence its chances to be accepted or the duration until it gets accepted? Obviously, the answers to these questions can be helpful for the authors of patches, in particular because some of the answers are surprising.	archive;committer;concurrent versions system;email;open-source software;patch (computing);software repository	Peter Weißgerber;Daniel Neu;Stephan Diehl	2008		10.1145/1370750.1370767	engineering;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web	SE	-62.6219494561291	-23.272474098985494	138300

I begin by briefly surveying and critiquing three influential accounts of thought experiments: James Robert Brown’s Platonist account, John Norton’s deflationist account that treats them as picturesque arguments, and a cluster of views that I group together as mental model accounts. I use this analysis to motivate a set of six desiderata for a new approach. I propose that we treat thought experiments primarily as aesthetic objects, specifically fictions, and then use this analysis to characterize their content and ultimately assess their epistemic success. Taking my starting point from Kendall Walton’s account of representation (Mimesis as make-believe, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1990), I argue that the best way to understand the content of thought experiments is to treat them as props for imagining fictional worlds. Ultimately, I maintain that, in terms of their form and content, thought experiments share more with literary fictions and pictorial representations than with either argumentation or observations of the Platonic realm. Moreover, while they inspire imaginings, thought experiments themselves are not mental kinds. My approach redirects attention towards what fixes the content of any given thought experiment and scrutinizes the assumptions, cognitive capacities and conventions that generate them. This view helps to explain what seems plausible about Brown’s, Norton’s, and the mental modelers’ views.	authorization;experiment;image;mental model;possible world;relevance;test engineer	Letitia Meynell	2014	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-014-0519-x	philosophy;epistemology;mathematics	Web+IR	-54.791299026113705	-21.778535953306655	138304

Several factors influence this choice. To date, the only factors that have been studied extensively, are the accuracy and the susceptibility of electromagnetic tracking systems to distortions caused by ferromagnetic materials. In this paper we provide a holistic overview of the factors that should be taken into account when choosing an EMTS. These factors include: the system’s refresh rate, the number of sensors that need to be tracked, the size of the navigated region, system interaction with the environment, can the sensors be embedded into the tools and provide the desired transformation data, and tracking accuracy and robustness. We evaluate the Aurora EMTS (Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) and the 3D Guidance EMTS with the flat-panel and the short-range field generators (Ascension Technology Corp., Burlington, Vermont, USA) in three clinical environments. We show that these systems are applicable to specific procedures or in specific environments, but that, no single system is currently optimal for all environments and procedures we evaluated.	aurora;distortion;embedded system;flat panel display;holism;refresh rate;sensor;tracking system	Emmanuel Wilson;Ziv Yaniv;David Lindisch;Kevin Cleary	2008		10.1117/12.770509	simulation;engineering;electrical engineering;operations management	HCI	-50.90142585862984	-23.078286227981472	138921

Email collections are now an important part of these archives– the Academic Advisory Board Members in the Paradigm project ranked them the most valuable from among images, speeches, press releases, personal websites and weblogs, campaign materials, engagement diaries, presentations, etc [3]. The detailed record embedded in email provides access to the donor’s thoughts and actions at a level that has rarely been available in the past and enables researchers to probe questions like: What was the process the donor used to come up with a particular breakthrough? What were they reading at the time and how may it have influenced them? [4] Further, these archives are being accumulated not just by famous people; with about 2 billion users, email reaches just about every section of wired societies. Indeed, the British Library has collected sample email messages from ordinary Britons as a way of capturing a sense of life in the 21st century [5].	archive;blog;email;embedded system;library (computing);paradigm;personal web page	Sudheendra Hangal;Peter Chan;Monica S.

This panel session was instigated by Yves Kodratoff in order to cover an issue that was raised in 1987 at the first workshop on knowledge acqusition for knowledge-based systems held at Reading (UK). It was at this meeting that those involved in machine learning and knowledge acquisition came to realise that a cultural gulf existed between two groups of people; people who seemed to be working in the same area. It has been the objective over the years at the meetings of both the European Working Sessions on Learning (EWSL) and the European Knowledge Acquisition Workshops (EKAW) to bridge the gap between these two cultures. This panel is intended to be a further step towards achieving this objective.		Thomas R.

And siding with me, I know, are other old hands in the field. B. C. Griffith for instance in his paper at the same conference, conveyed in a cool way a similar message. However, when I am in a more optimistic mood, the situation does not seem to me to be as gloomy as G & S think it is. First of all, there are other fields of science, respected by many, in which an analogous situation exists. Consider for instance 'economics'. The discipline has existed for many years and nobody expects it to vanish in the near future. There are certainly outstanding economists who have advanced our insight into the economic behaviour of people, groups, nations and even the global village. They are lauded by their peers and many of their findings have become general public knowledge. On the other hand, second rank economists, economic politicians, bankers, business tycoons etc. have made many statements about the economy which, although widely repeated and cited, strongly deviate from firmly established economic theories, or even from the facts. In 1985/6 I collected some 70 statements made by 'top ranking' economists about the future trend in interest rates. Upon checking these statements with the real figures half a year and one year later, I found that the predictive value of such statements was nil. Nevertheless, nobody believes that the field of economics is in a crisis. Often policy-makers ask for answers to questions which, given the inaccuracy of existing data and the inadequacy of the theoretical framework, cannot be answered with confidence. The result is literature containing a lot of crap and only a few pearls. Scientometrics is a field in which investigators try to understand h~ a quantitative way the behaviour of researchers, the way science proceeds, in short scientific	bibliometrics;futures studies;global village (telecommunications);informetrics;scientometrics;theory;vanish (computer science)	Cornelius Le Pair	1994	Scientometrics	10.1007/BF02018133	data mining;interest rate;nobody;mood;scientometrics;bibliometrics;informetrics;positive economics;feeling;ranking;computer science	DB	-61.53087883682172	-22.122128826936255	139042

7e55dbdaf0834a71a3040540f686597ef0434052	2007 m&som best paper award	paper award	It is a pleasure to announce that the first Manufacturing u0026 Service Operations Management Best Paper is “Strategically Seeking Service: How Competition Can Generate Poisson Arrivals” by Martin Lariviere and Jan Van Mieghem (2004) of Kellogg School at Northwestern University. This annual award is given to one paper, published in one of the prior three volumes of Mu0026SOM, deemed by the Mu0026SOM Editorial Board as most deserving for its contribution to the theory and practice of operations management. For their accomplishment, Professors Lariviere and Van Mieghem will share $2,000, which was generously contributed by the Manufacturing and Service Operations Management Society of INFORMS to support this award. In short, this paper is about managing service systems in which consumers strategically choose when to seek service. In the base model, consumers do not care about when they receive the service nearly as much as how long they have to wait to be served. Hence, consumers try to enter the service system when they think it will not be crowded, knowing that all other customers are doing the same thing. Interestingly, this situation harbors an enormous number of equilibria, but one of them is simple and intuitive, therefore focal and straightforward to implement. This equilibrium continues to hold under numerous extensions, including customer segments with different waiting costs (some of us are more patient than others), timevarying preferences (we all like to eat lunch around noon), and limited capacity (an unfortunate reality for most service systems), among others. This paper asks two new and fundamental questions that have somehow been missed by queuing theorists and economists1—if consumers want to avoid		Gérard P.

The range and variety of modeling approaches in use today are remarkable, and for many, bewildering. Yet to come to anything approaching adequate insights into the infinitely complex fields of mind, brain, and intelligent systems, an extremely wide array of modeling approaches is vital and necessary.	cognitive science;mind;published comment	Richard M.

c240012546edc5a5706ed0e16b9519be20ae1505	the berkeley memorial		I would like to welcome all of you – family, friends, and colleagues of David Gale – to this ceremony in celebration of David’s life. I am Alan Weinstein, chair of the Mathematics Department, and, with my wife Margo, have been happy to count myself among the wide circle of friends of David and his partner Sandra Gilbert. I’d like to thank Sandra, David’s family, and everyone else who has worked to organize today’s event, with the help of our Department Manager, Mary Pepple. David Gale was born in 1921 and studied at Swarthmore College, the University of Michigan (where he started in physics but saw the light after taking a course from Norman Steenrod), and Princeton University, where he received his PhD in 1949. He taught at Brown University for about 15 years and then came to Berkeley in 1965, where he taught until his retirement in 1991. During the last 17 years, he remained very active both in research and in the dissemination of mathematics, with a column called Mathematical Entertainments in the Mathematical Intelligencer magazine and an interactive mathematics museum known as MathSite, which he created and which was honored with the 2007 Pirelli Internetional Award for Science Communication in Mathematics. David’s second home for the last 15 years or so has been Paris, where he visited regularly at École Polytechnique and owned an apartment on the rue de Sévigné. It was he who by leasing his apartment to Margo and me in 1994 introduced us to the charms of the Marais, for which we owe him untold thanks. Of course, David did not just go to Paris for the mathematics, and this leads me to the final brief remarks which I’d like to make. Actually, I’d like to read some of David’s own words from The Automatic Ant, a compendium of his Mathematical Entertainments columns. (Copies will be available for sale in the lobby – just kidding.) David wrote that “mathematics is all around us,” but although David saw mathematics everywhere, he knew that there was much more to life. David loved children, and appreciated their own brand of wisdom. In his book (p. 5) he writes about a four-year-old who was “playing a game in which she was the conductor on a train and her mother was a passenger. ‘Wait a minute,’ said Nancy, ‘we have to get some paper to make tickets.’ ‘Oh,’ said her mother, who had probably had a long day, ‘Do we really need them? After all, it’s only a pretend game with pretend tickets.’ ‘Oh no, mommy, you’re wrong,’ replied Nancy, ‘They’re pretend tickets, but it’s a real game.’ ” In his efforts to communicate mathematics, David wanted his readers to think, not just absorb, but he was well aware that not everyone had the power to concentrate as a professional mathematician. In his book he “tried to choose topics from which readers could reap the rewards of discovery with at most a moderate expenditure of energy, in other words, to maximize the ratio of pleasure to effort (p. vii).” Although David did not shy from effort, he appreciated pleasure in its many forms. Finally, David loved puzzles so I will end this talk with a puzzle from one of David’s columns, chosen for today’s audience consisting of many people not at all conversant with mathematics. David was quite keen on the idea that mathematics was not just about numbers. Here is one from his book (p. 44): “Name the only midwestern state of the United States that does not have an Indian name (midwestern means between the Appalachian and the Rocky Mountains and excludes the southern states on the Gulf of Mexico).” There’s a risk at posing such a puzzle on an occasion like this, but I’m sure that what you are about to hear from David’s friends and family will quickly distract you from pondering it. Once again, thank you all for coming.	bsd;column (database);compendium;david turner (computer scientist);gilbert cell;goto;gulf of execution;mary tsingou;norman margolus;permanent brain;pirelli internetional award;science communication;vii	Alan Weinstein;Harold Kuhn;Leo A.

Some years ago, I had the privilege to attend a graduate course on social choice and voting given by Professor Saari at this same university. I remember that Professor Saari taught in English students whose knowledge of English, for most of them, was quite limited. Nevertheless these students all perfectly understood the explanations thanks to Saari’s remarkable didactic gift and in particular thanks to his recourse to geometrical intuition and clever use of the blackboard. Before describing the contents of the five chapters, I must outline that the main thesis proposed by Donald Saari is that the so-called paradoxes one encounters in social choice and voting are related to dimensional complexities and quoting the author ‘Finding an appropriate mathematical framework to analyze social choice, to conquer that dimensionality curse, has been my main objective since I stumbled on this fascinating academic area.’ In Chapter 1, the author presents an interesting historical account of the BordaCondorcet debate and an outline of the whole book. Chapter 2 is the core chapter of the book. The classical impossibility theorems of Arrow and Sen are stated as expected, but also, Chichilnisky’s topological dictatorship result. For Arrow’s theorem, the author outlines that the condition of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) imposes that we ‘cannot use any information about whether voters have, or do not have, transitive preferences.’ The problem regarding the limited information assumption imposed by IIA has been also recognized by	moore school lectures;relevance	Feng Zhang	2009	Social Choice and Welfare	10.1007/s00355-009-0365-9	social choice theory;economics;sociology;microeconomics;welfare economics	AI	-59.74101717666478	-22.313000843640285	141013

Turing’s contributions are presented through his most important events and achievements, particularly through the concept of the hypercomputer; that is, computers that are stronger than the Universal Turing Machines. The paper analyzes several essential AI and human-intelligence concepts that Turing introduced. Part of the paper discusses Donald Michie, Alan Turing’s co-worker and contemporary and an honorary member of the Jozef Stefan Institute. Even though 2012 marks a century since Turing’s birth, he remains largely unknown around the world. This paper makes an appeal for Turing’s full recognition and acknowledges contributions to Turing’s career.	artificial intelligence;computer science;hypercomputation;informatics;universal turing machine	Matjaz Gams	2013	Informatica (Slovenia)	10.31449/inf.v37i1.427	turing machine examples;computer science;turing machine;wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol turing machine;artificial intelligence;multitape turing machine;non-deterministic turing machine;algorithm	AI	-56.62640384070108	-21.649147194989187	141051

afb12ceeb02aac936918a3a507e40968e7d0effb	a primer on cluster analysis: 4 basic methods that (usually) work [book review]		This book examine the concept of clustering. Clustering was important in the past, has become more important in the present era of internet, social networks, and big data, and will continue to remain so in future. We need clustering to find subgroups of cancers, clusters of stars in our galaxies, to answer web queries, to understand group dynamics in social networks—the list goes on. The book develops the necessary concepts such as similarity, distance, clusters, computer view point, human view point, and cluster validation in a very logical and lucid manner with plenty of easy-to-follow examples and creative pictures. Although the book primarily focuses on four types of popular clustering algorithms, it provides adequate materials and pointers for interested readers to sail through a much wider family of clustering algorithms. This book will be very useful (and of course enjoyable to read) to a wide spectrum of readers including beginners, researchers, and practitioners. It consists of 11 chapters divided into two parts: Part I: The Art and Science of Clustering, which has five chapters and Part II: Four Basic Models & Algorithms that contains the remaining six chapters.	algorithm;big data;cluster analysis;image;internet;lucid;primer;social network	Nikhil R.

Since then, rapid developments in advanced manufacturing technology have posed new challenges and requirements, among them faster machining (high-speed machining), higher feed-rates, more accurate parts and better surface finish. Not only are sophisticated computerenabling technologies needed to cope with these challenges, but also significantly improved and more sophisticated mathematical tools. These emerging challenges and requirements underscore the growing importance of mathematical methods and algorithms. On the other hand, new challenges, optimization functions and constraints, arising in the field of advanced manufacturing have also stimulated the development of new branches of industrial and applied mathematics. Mathematics and Algorithms for Computer-Aided Manufacturing, Engineering and Numerical Control (MAMENC) is an annual workshop organized by the National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences of China (NCMIS). The workshop’s topics focus on how mathematical methods and algorithms interact with computer-aided manufacturing, computer-aided engineering and computer numerical control. MAMENC 2012 is the second workshop in the series. The first was held in Beijing in 2011, and the proceedings were published in the September 2012 issue (number 3) of the Mathematics in Computer Science journal under the title Special Focus on Mathematics and Algorithms for CAM and CNC. This special issue is a compilation of research papers submitted to MAMENC 2012, held on October 25–26, 2012 in Beijing. The issue is devoted to two main topics: tool-path planning and tool-path interpolation.

We lost the World Cup on our own turf, yet one of our mathematicians received the highest scientific honour ever to be awarded to a Brazilian. Scientists now stand a chance of competing with footballers as role models for Brazil's youngsters. Artur Avila, who also has French nationality, won the Fields Medal, the most prestigious prize in maths (see Nature http://doi.org/vn4; 2014). This triumph has sent a wave of motivation through students and boosted the morale of educators and scientists. Science, as well as football, can offer a route out of poverty.

The first one is, of course, the invention of machine learning. Statistics and optimization deliver their theories to the machine learning. The combination of the big data and the massively parallel computing enables the machines to “learn” from the data existing on the web, the network and the database, though there is only small hope that machine learning technologies help the machine to solve the design problem like design automation. Another rather inconspicuous origin is the sophistication of the traditional logical approach. The virtue of the logical approach is in its ability to express complex input-output relations, such as the mapping form natural language text to its meaning and the logical relation between a premise and its consequence, in a way that a human can understand. In this talk, I introduce AI grand challenge, “Todai Robot Project” (Can an AI get into the University of Tokyo?), initiated by National Institute of Informatics in 2011, and discuss the impact of near-term AI technologies on design automation.	big data;grand challenges;informatics;machine learning;mathematical optimization;natural language;parallel computing	Noriko Arai	2015	The 20th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference	10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7059066	applications of artificial intelligence;embedded system;progress in artificial intelligence;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;data science;programming language;algorithm	AI	-56.14092572536265	-19.32256259256204	142307

While the plan is an ideal one, it does not seem to be followed in case studies in these books. Indeed, there is very little experimental data, if any, used to support or motivate models. Furthermore, a primary emphasis appears to be on the mathematical theory, rather than on its implementation. For this reason, the author’s statement that biologists are one group for which this set ofbooks is directed, and even the selection of the title is slightly inaccurate. On the positive side, the usefulness of this material for applied mathematics students is unquestionable. The author states that simplification of examples in the book is deliberate since readers not interested in a specific biological application are unlikely to read through several pages of such material. believe that this assessment is unduly pessimistic, and that readership depends more closely on the degree of interest and enthusiasm instilled by the author. An unfortunate result of this deliberate dilution is a large number of somewhat unconvincing unreferenced examples. (The small print further suggests that these are incidental to the main theme.) A greater variety of motivated, detailed examples, followed up by problems, suggestions for further work, and liberal citations of current research publications could have made this a truly excellent set of books. In his introduction, Eisen concentrates exclusively on the type of math-bio interaction in which a given biology experiment is planned in consultation with a modeler who formulates equations and fits parameters. This approach, however, is only one type of mathematical biology. There is little or no mention ofthe crossfertilization of mathematical theories (such as reaction-diffusion systems, excitable systems, coupled oscillators) and biological disciplines (e.g., developmental biology, cardiology, and central pattern generators) for which the recent advanced text by Murray (1989) excels. This neglect of some of the most beautiful cases of interdisciplinary thinking is, to my mind, rather sad.	book;british informatics olympiad;excitable medium;fits;mind;text simplification;theory	Derek Elsworth	1991	SIAM Review	10.1137/1033031	boundary element method;mathematics	Comp.	-62.1288584708151	-21.53829811587228	142825
6a25691edeb2715655ef5693c3039bec2810a83f	eveline t. feteris: fundamentals of legal argumentation		Argumentation has been at the heart of the AI and Law enterprise since its very beginning. One of the earliest AI and Law programs, Taxman (McCarty 1976), attempted to model the majority and minority arguments in a leading case, Eisner v Macomber, computationally. Since then many AI and Law researchers have explored legal argumentation, using both formal techniques (see Prakken and Sartor (2015) for a survey) and more empirical techniques (see Bench-Capon 2017). Equally long standing is the investigation of legal argumentation from the perspective of argumentation theory, in particular that of the pragma-dialectics group at the University of Amsterdam, from which this book originates. Eveline Feteris has been a long standing member (since 1986) of this group, and has published extensively on legal argumentation including (Feteris 1994, 1996, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008) and (Feteris 2016). The book under review is a completely updated, revised and extended second edition: the first edition was published in 1999, so updating was very much required. Given this commonality of interest, and proximity (University of Amsterdam has also hosted an AI and Law group, currently known as the Leibnitz Centre for Law, throughout this period), it is perhaps surprising that there has not been more interaction between the two communities, In fact the two communities have remained relatively distinct with their own journals (Artificial Intelligence and Law as against Argumentation and Informal Logic) and their own conferences (ICAIL and JURIX as against OSSA	artificial intelligence and law;formal methods;test bench	Trevor J.
