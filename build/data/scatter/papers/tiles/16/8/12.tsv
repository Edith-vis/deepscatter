7189a796ec0c57cc81b1fdcb8c6f25f3c105439b	performance comparison of data reduction techniques for wireless multimedia sensor network applications		With the increased use of smart phones, Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) will have opportunities to deploy such devices in several contexts for data collection and processing. While smart phones come with richer resources and can do complex processing, their battery is still limited. Background subtraction (BS) and compression techniques are common data reduction schemes, which have been used for camera sensors to reduce energy consumption in WMSNs. In this paper, we investigate the performance of various BS algorithms and compression techniques in terms of computation and communication energy, time, and quality. We have picked five different BS algorithms and two compression techniques and implemented them in an Android platform. Considering the fact that these BS algorithms will be run within the context of WMSNs where the data is subject to packet losses and errors, we also investigated the performance in terms of packet loss ratio in the network under various packet sizes. The experiment results indicated that the most energy-efficient BS algorithm could also provide the best quality in terms of the foreground detected. The results also indicate that data reduction techniques including BS algorithms and compression techniques can provide significant energy savings in terms of transmission energy costs.	action message format;algorithm;android;background subtraction;belief revision;computation;data compression;fits;fastest;ground truth;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;lossy compression;mobile computing;network packet;performance evaluation;region of interest;requirement;sensor;simulation;smartphone	Pinar Sarisaray Boluk;Kemal Akkaya	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/873495	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	-2.086782725536185	60.72719152647376	58197

Fault tolerance and performance can be improved using double-loops. Because of different hop distances and cross-connections within one network highly reliable double-loop topologies are hardly extendable and adaptable to localities like buildings and floors. Another inconvenience is the modest performance improvement over single-loops. This paper presents an improved network architecture which incorporates high reliability, high performance and optimal accommodation to environmental topologies. The investigated network is tree-shaped where the leaves represent host computers or loop subnetworks and the vertices are ring adapters attaching hosts or bridges interconnecting subnetworks. For ease of modeling only balanced and homogeneous structures are considered where loop subnetworks have the same topology. Multi-level hierarchical loop networks have minimal diameter when the number of nodes in the subnetworks is proportional to the root of the number of all attached stations. In this case the diameter grows only with the logarithm of the number of stations. This implies that network reliability and performance are significantly improved using the proposed multi-level hierarchical architecture based on loop subnetworks. Our performance analysis assumes the protocol of buffer insertion.	computer;extensibility;fault tolerance;for loop;network architecture;profiling (computer programming)	Klaus D.

Establishing reliable end-to-end communication among robots in such environments are inevitable. Many real-time challenges in robotic communications are mainly due to the dynamic movement of robots, battery constraints, absence of Global Positioning System (GPS), etc. After recognizing these challenges, building a communication framework among the robots demands the prior knowledge of network connectivity. In this paper, we explore the idea of developing real-time link prediction mechanism between robots by Assisted Link Prediction (ALP) protocol. This is a novel method with intelligent decision process, which can be implemented on the real robots. It resolves many real-time challenges like multiple link ambiguity, accuracy of prediction, improving Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) and reducing energy consumption in-terms of lesser retransmissions. Keeping in view the easy portability of this protocol, we develop the entire software package in Robot Operating System (ROS) framework with the help of Gazebo Simulator and port on the real test-bed using Rpi-3 boards.	communications protocol;eigen (c++ library);end-to-end principle;experiment;global positioning system;library (computing);mike lesser;opencv;production rule representation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;robot operating system;testbed;unavailability	Sipra Behera;Hemant Kumar Rath;Jyotirmoy Karjee;Anantha Simha	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292372	real-time computing;robot;energy consumption;global positioning system;ambiguity;computer science;software portability;software;network packet	Robotics	4.151209593983783	73.13841107467087	58719
ec3f4457ba7836d1a4eedfbd57f82b4ed5162e56	fault-resilient noc router with transparent resource allocation		The current trend of aggressive technology scaling results in a decrease in systemu0027s reliability. This motivates investigation of fault-resilient architectures which provide graceful degradation of systemu0027s functionality. In this paper, three novel fault-resilient Network-on-Chip (NoC) router architectures are proposed. These architectures, exploit the regularity of the router and reallocate available existing and spare units to maintain functionality of certain turns. The resource reallocation is performed transparently from systemu0027s resource manager and is based on predefined priorities. A new metric for architecture reliability comparison based on reliability block diagrams is introduced. In contrast to Silicone Protection Factor (SPF) metric, the proposed metric also takes into account the areas of different units. Area overhead and reliability of proposed architectures are compared with Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) and Unit-Duplication mechanisms. All proposed architectures showed remarkable reliability improvement compared to original, TMR and Unit Duplication architectures; while at the same time, their area overhead is less than or equal to unit-duplication mechanisms.	baseline (configuration management);diagram;elegant degradation;fault tolerance;image scaling;multiplexing;network on a chip;overhead (computing);router (computing);triple modular redundancy	Tsotne Putkaradze;Siavoosh Payandeh Azad;Behrad Niazmand;Jaan Raik;Gert Jervan	2017	2017 12th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)	10.1109/ReCoSoC.2017.8016161	resource management;fault tolerance;real-time computing;parallel computing;router;architecture;triple modular redundancy;exploit;computer science;resource allocation;reliability block diagram	Arch	5.124760087712506	61.13878667878988	58969

In this network class nodes are grouped into clusters. Each cluster employs a separate pair of broadcast and select couplers. The clusters are interconnected via fiber links according to a regular topology. This approach efficiently combines time and/or wavelength division with direct space division. One important issue for this network class is the conflict-free channel set assignment that maximizes spatial re-use of channels. This paper studies the conflict-free channel set assignment for the hypercube cluster interconnection topology. The approach in this paper is novel and is conjectured to be optimal.	broadcasting (networking);classful network;color;graph coloring;interconnection;scalability;wavelength-division multiplexing	Peng-Jun Wan	1997	J.

b94ebc4aa2bcdf052eacdeabcb607bdd68beca5f	framework for qos performance assessment on biomedical wireless sensor networks		A Biomedical Wireless Sensor Network (BWSN) is a special Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) with a small number of nodes designed for medical applications. These networks must ensure that medical data is delivered reliably and efficiently, in order to fulfil a set of pre-established Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this way, the research community have been proposing new solutions to improve QoS in WSN, namely in routing protocols and power consumption efficiency. However, there still a need for appropriate QoS guaranties in BWSN. In this paper, possible QoS requirements of BWSN are discussed, together with a framework to automatically evaluate the performance of such QoS techniques. That framework was used together with simulators and operating systems appropriate for WSN, COOJA and Contiki OS, and proved to be a valuable tool for a proper evaluation of QoS parameters and metrics.	contiki;debugging;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;operating system;quality of service;requirement;routing;simulation;software deployment;software development	Carlos Abreu;Manuel Ricardo;Paulo Mendes	2012			real-time computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	6.304950601819419	74.49654428215615	59896

This corresponds to a rate of one error every 40 billion random single precision divisions. The same general pattern appears at double precision, with an error rate of one in every 9 billion divisions or 75 minutes of division time. These rates assume randomly distributed data. The distribution of the faulty pairs themselves however is far from random, with the effect that if the data is so nonrandom as to be just the constant 1, then random calculations started from that constant produce a division error once every few minutes, and these errors will sometimes propagate many more steps. A much higher rate yet is obtained when dividing small (< 100) integers “bruised” by subtracting one millionth, where every 400 divisions will see a relative error of at least one in a million. The software engineering implications of the bug include the observations that the method of exercising reachable components cannot detect reachable components mistakenly believed unreachable, and that handchecked proofs build false confidence.	approximation error;division algorithm;double-precision floating-point format;integrated circuit;least significant bit;most significant bit;pentium fdiv bug;randomness;single-precision floating-point format;software engineering;unreachable memory	Vaughan R.

The CSC with a small number of sensors is desirable because the small CSC can reduce network energy and communication costs. In the present paper, we propose an algorithm for CSC using an artificial bee colony optimization, which is an optimization technique based on behaviors of honey bees, on GPGPU. The experimental result shows that the execution on GPGPU is 5 times faster than the execution on CPU in case that the number of bees in the optimization algorithm is enough large.	artificial bee colony algorithm;bees algorithm;central processing unit;distributed algorithm;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;mathematical optimization;sensor;simulation	Yukihide Sasamura;Akihiro Fujiwara	2014	2014 Second International Symposium on Computing and Networking	10.1109/CANDAR.2014.69	embedded system;parallel computing;computer hardware;computer science	Arch	9.994488656419291	72.82150541886753	60300

Previous efforts have mainly focused on improving the reliability of the cache data arrays. Due to its crucial importance to the correctness of cache accesses, the tag array demands high reliability against soft errors while the data array is fully protected. Exploiting the address locality of memory accesses, we propose to duplicate most recently accessed tag entries in a small Tag Replication Buffer (TRB) thus to protect the information integrity of the tag array in the data cache with low performance, energy and area overheads. A Selective-TRB scheme is further proposed to protect only tag entries of dirty cache lines. The experimental results show that the Selective-TRB scheme achieves a higher access-with-replica (AWR) rate of 97.4% for the dirty-cache line tags. To provide a comprehensive evaluation of the tag-array reliability, we also conduct an architectural vulnerability factor (AVF) analysis for the tag array and propose a refined metric, detected-without-replica-AVF (DOR-AVF), which combines the AVF and AWR analysis. Based on our DOR-AVF analysis, a TRB scheme with early write-back (EWB) is proposed, which achieves a zero DOR-AVF at a negligible performance overhead.	cpu cache;cache (computing);correctness (computer science);locality of reference;memory address;microprocessor;overhead (computing);simulation;soft error;tag cloud;terminating reliable broadcast	Shuai Wang;Jie S.

The study uses results of two fault injection methods, simulated fault injection and software-implemented fault injection (SWIFI), to analyze the application-level impact of transient faults injected into the network interface hardware. These results include a number of errors such as dropped or corrupt messages, host interface or host resets, and local or remote host interface hangs. The paper presents the study in two parts: First, the results from the SWIFI method in the real system are used as a basis to validate the simulation and identify the major factors leading to diierences between the methods. A comparison between the two injection methods shows that they agree for 83% of the fault injections. The results, however, vary greatly depending on the fault type considered. The study presents an analysis of the eeects of varying workload intensity, host platform, and interface function targeted by the injection. An example of this analysis is to show that the function targetted has a signiicant impact on the fault activation rate. Finally, the study identiies two mechanisms by which faults may propagate from the interface to other parts of the network; in one example, this propagation caused the interface's host computer to reboot while another caused a remote interface in the network to hang.

Since,different applications impose various communicationrequirements in NoCs, a number of research studieshave revealed that the performance advantages ofrouting schemes are more noticeable on powerconsumption under different traffic patterns. However,the power consumption issues of NoCs have not beenthoroughly investigated in the presence of faultyregions. To the best of our knowledge, this research isthe first attempt to examine the effects of most populartraffic patterns (i.e., Uniform, Local, and Hot-Spot) onpower consumption of NoCs in the presence ofpermanent faults.	deterministic algorithm;fault tolerance;genetic algorithm;hot spare;network performance;routing;system on a chip	Farshad Safaei;A.

Ould-Khaoua, An approximate performance model for partially adaptive routing algorithm in hypercubes, Microprocessors and Microsystems 23 (1999) 185-190] dealing with partially adaptive routing. It is not accurate enough especially in heavy traffic regions due to the rough approximation of assuming equal traffic rate over network channels. We show, however, such an approximation can greatly affect the accuracy of the model. This paper proposes an accurate analytical model to predict the average message latency in wormhole hypercube networks using partially adaptive routing. Our model accurately formulates the traffic rate over individual network channels and the results obtained from simulation experiments confirm that the proposed model exhibits a significant accuracy for various network sizes and under different operating conditions even in moderate to heavy traffic regions, the regions for which the model in [M. Ould-Khaoua, An approximate performance model for partially adaptive routing algorithm in hypercubes, Microprocessors and Microsystems 23 (1999) 185-190] fails to exhibit acceptable accuracy.	routing	Ahmad Patooghy;Hamid Sarbazi-Azad	2008	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	10.1016/j.mcm.2007.06.027	routing;static routing;multiprocessing;simulation;adaptive routing;applied mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;approximation;mathematical model;mathematics;distributed computing;hypercube;statistics	Arch	-2.630270705784525	69.27898522172926	61203

The implemented features of the application framework include - sensor data acquisition and display, network activity detection of deployed motes, over-the-air programming for software re-visioning, as well as node localization and mapping. The application framework also extends to incorporate the software defined radio based gateway deployed using GNU Radio platform and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) which enables the testbed to bridge to other heterogeneous systems.	apache flex;application framework;data acquisition;firmware;gnu radio;multitier architecture;python;software deployment;testbed;tinyos;universal software radio peripheral;user interface	C.

PCDAS is the subsystem, which interfaces with the data streams to and from the payload systems, converts data from digital interfaces into data packets for transmission to the ground-station. Control packets and telemetry are converted into appropriate digital sequences to the onboard computer. The localized payload management approach tends to design PCDAS as a stand alone subsystem, i.e. to be independent from the On-Board Computer (OBC) and all on-board payload systems. For realization, the PCDAS is implemented in VHDL, and evaluated on an SRAM-Based FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chip. The PCDAS simulated and functionally verified using a payload with four simultaneous channels, each with data rate of 60 Mbps.	data acquisition;data rate units;debugging;download;field-programmable gate array;internet branding;network packet;on-board data handling;static random-access memory;telecommunications link;uncompressed video;vhdl	Ahmed O.

A distributed routing mechanism based on Baranu0027s u0027hot potatou0027 heuristic routing algorithm is discussed. This mechanism is applied to a multicomputer system (VTM—Variable Topology Multicomputer system) proposed to be reconfigurable according to the application requirements. An analysis of the algorithm regarding the initialization of a distributed computer system is given and the preliminary system performance results in applying this algorithm are shown. The results of a run time implementation are also compared with those of a traffic-load balancing algorithm which is basically a static fixed routing algorithm, suggested by the authors for densely and uniformly distributed computer systems.	hardware description language	M.

This paper presents performance models of single and multiple ring networks based on token ring, slotted ring, and register insertion ring protocols. The multiple ring networks have the advantages of being reliable, expandable, and cost effective. An approximate and uniform analysis, based on the gated M/G/l queueing model, has been developed to evaluate the performance of both existing single ring networks and the proposed multiple ring networks. Our approximations are good for low and medium load. The analyses are based on symmetric ring structure with nonexhaustive service policy and infinite queue length at each station. They essentially involve modeling of queues with single and multiple walking servers. The results obtained from the analytical models are compared to those obtained from simulation.	analytical engine;approximation algorithm;dataflow;distributed control system;interconnection;multiprocessing;network packet;packet switching;queueing theory;simulation;token ring	Laxmi N.

However, architectures based on mesh topology have a node-degree of N, which prevents these architectures from large node numbers. This consideration motivates us to study the properties of node degree and its impact on the corresponding load-balanced architectures. In this paper we first show the asymptotically minimal node degree for any topology to achieve a constant ideal throughput under uniform traffic pattern when the channel bandwidth is fixed. We further introduce a unidirectional direct interconnection topology, named Plus 2^i (P2i), with this minimal node degree and prove that it has an ideal throughput of no less than twice the channel bandwidth under uniform traffic pattern. Based on the property, we provide the P2i load-balanced (PLB) architecture. Using this architecture, we show that scalability, 100% throughput and packet ordering can be all achieved and the scheduling algorithm is easy to implement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first load-balanced architecture constructed on multi-hop direct interconnection topologies without packet reordering problem.	algorithm;asymptote;computational complexity theory;degree (graph theory);interconnection;internet;load balancing (computing);mesh networking;network packet;scalability;scheduling (computing);throughput	Zhenhua Liu;Xiaoping Zhang;Youjian Zhao;Hong-Tao Guan	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.454	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Arch	-0.45381707404871435	69.60045308398836	63207
e4871f049412d9d0caf6d6178fd19460a0d772a1	protecting instruction set randomization from code reuse attacks		Instruction Set Randomization (ISR) prevents code injection by randomizing the instruction encoding used by programs, thus preventing an attacker from preparing a payload that can be injected in a victim. In this paper we show that code-reuse attacks can be used to circumvent existing ISR techniques and we demonstrate these attacks on an ARMv7 CPU that has been extended with ISR support. To counter this treat, we propose a new ISR that does not have the same vulnerabilities as the existing solutions, imposes moderate decryption cost, does not require additional memory per instruction, and affords efficient random access to the encrypted code. These properties enable efficient hardware implementation of our solution. In order to evaluate our proposal, we implement the new ISR in a hardware simulator and we compare its overhead with respect to existing ISR.	code reuse	Roberto Guanciale	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-03638-6_26	embedded system;code reuse;encryption;encoding (memory);instruction set;arm architecture;payload;code injection;random access;computer science	Logic	9.454569045021545	64.40353172764593	63231

They can be deployed for habitat modeling, temperature monitoring and industrial sensing. They also find application in battlefield awareness to sense chemicals and other gases used in chemical and biological warfare. An application that has become increasingly attractive in the post 9/11 era is the use of wireless sensor networks for emergency (first) response in mass casualty incidents. Reliability of data and event transfer is of critical importance to emergency response applications. In this work we propose a reliable event transfer mechanism making use of an overlay network of relay nodes. The overlay network removes the burden of data relaying from the sensor nodes and results in increasing the lifetime of the network. Simulation results prove the benefits of such an architecture. Reliability is increased 10-30% with reduction in event traffic of 60-80%.		R. Chellappa Doss;D.

The hardware part filters out and descrambles the necessary MPEG-2 transport stream (TS) packets, then sends them to PC. Some useful peripheral functions such as PCI interface, I2C bus controller and smart card 7816 interface are also developed to provide a cost-effective solution. Meanwhile, multi-protocol decapsulation related to data broadcasting protocol is analyzed and implemented mainly by software. In order to improve the throughput and hardware utilization, we adopt chaining mode direct memory access (DMA) scheme and a double buffer approach both in hardware and in software. Moreover, the parameters of chaining mode DMA and the depth of buffer are further optimized by theoretical analysis. The result indicates the throughput of chaining mode DMA is up to 475.8 Mb/s, which is 24 times as much as non-chaining mode DMA strategy	datacasting;digital video broadcasting;direct memory access;general-purpose input/output;mpeg transport stream;mpeg-2;megabyte;multiple buffering;multiplexer;peripheral;process identifier;scrambler;smart card;throughput	Guanghui He;Ningyi Xu;Wei Yu;Zucheng Zhou	2006	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2006.1706511	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;digital video broadcasting;computer network	EDA	-3.742554296898082	64.5704235579396	63902

Legacy 2G networks with their ubiquitous coverage are apt to provide a fallback solution for the latest LTE networks. On the other hand, they provide a reliable data link for emerging M2M or IoT applications. IR data processing and controlling is specified in several layers of the GSM/EDGE protocol stack. In many state-of-the-art designs this leads to decentralized data processing, and thus to costly data movements between memories and hardware accelerators. This is prohibitive for emerging M2M designs, which demand lowest possible hardware resources. In this work, IR is implemented as part of a dedicated hardware baseband signal processing unit in order to unburden higher layer processing units from IR, reduce area, power consumption, and costs. The open source baseband framework MatPHY is extended for packet switched operation to facilitate the development of efficient IR hardware architectures. With the design parameters obtained from performance evaluations computed with MatPHY an IR architecture in a 130 nm CMOS technology is presented. Said architecture proves the suitability of an ASIC IR unit instead of a software solution distributed over various layers and components.	application-specific integrated circuit;hybrid automatic repeat request	Benjamin Weber;Harald Kröll;Christian Benkeser;Qiuting Huang	2015	Signal Processing Systems	10.1007/s11265-014-0949-1	gsm;embedded system;edge;parallel computing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;operating system;machine to machine;internet of things	Arch	5.630729085506216	69.50455731785449	64488

e7e5ceacc7de587f6ba80dea17985d89318240e2	energy and quality scalable wireless communication	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	"""Nodes for emerging, high-density wireless networks will face the dual challenges of continuous, multi-year operation under diverse and challenging operating conditions. The wireless communication subsystem, a substantial consumer of energy, must therefore be designed with unprecedented energy efficiency. To meet this challenge, inefficiencies once overlooked must be addressed, and the system must be designed for energy scalability, the use of graceful energy vs. quality trade-offs in response to continuous variations in operational conditions. Using a comprehensive model framework that unifies cross-disciplinary models for energy consumption and communication performance, this work explores multi-dimensional trade-offs of energy and quality for wireless communication at all levels of the system hierarchy. The circuit-level """"knob"""" of dynamic voltage scaling is implemented on a commercial microprocessor and integrated into a power aware, prototype microsensor node. Power aware abstractions encourage collaboration between the hardware, which fundamentally dissipates the energy, and software, which controls how the hardware behaves. Accurate models of hardware energy consumption reveal inefficiencies of routing techniques such as multihop, and the models are fused with information-theoretic limits on code performance to bound the energy scalability of the hardware platform. An application-specific protocol for microsensor networks is evaluated with a new, interactive Java simulation tool created expressly for energy-conscious, high density wireless networks. Close collaboration between software and hardware layers, and across the research disciplines that compose wireless communication itself, are crucial enablers for energy-efficient wireless communication.

For bounded Petri nets the corresponding state graphs are finite, and stationary probabilities of states can be obtained by standard techniques used for analysis of Markov chains. An immediate application of such a model is performance analysis of systems of asynchronous concurrent processes, and in particular communication protocols. Places of Petri nets model queues of messages, transitions represent events in communication networks, inhibitor arcs are used to indicate priorities of simultaneous events, and probabilities associated with free-choice classes correspond to relative frequencies of random events. A simple protocol based on unnumbered messages and acknowledgements is used as an illustration of analysis.	communications protocol;markov chain;petri net;profiling (computer programming);stationary process;telecommunications network	Wlodzimierz M.

1b691ba64c354b49db1c4aa5b30a119fab2f9c5e	distributed computation on unreliable radio channels	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	An important topic in wireless networking is the development of reliable algorithms for environments suffering from adversarial interference. This term captures any type of channel disruption outside the control of the algorithm designer—from contention with unrelated devices to malicious jamming. In this thesis, we provide four contributions toward a comprehensive theoretical treatment of this topic. First, we detail a formal modeling framework. This framework is general enough to describe almost any radio network studied to date in the theory literature. It can also precisely capture the often subtle details of adversarial behavior. In addition, we prove a pair of composition results that allow a layered strategy for designing radio network algorithms The results can be used to combine an algorithm designed for a powerful channel with an implementation of this channel on a less powerful channel. Next, we formalize adversarial interference with the definition of the t-disrupted channel. We then define the more powerful (t, b, p)-feedback channel, and provide both a randomized and deterministic implementation of the latter using the former. To emphasize the utility of this layered approach, we provide solutions to the set agreement, gossip, and reliable broadcast problems using the powerful feedback channel. Combined with the implementation algorithms and composition results, this automatically generates solutions to these problems for the less powerful, but more realistic, t-disrupted channel. Finally, we define a variant of the modeling framework that captures the attributes of an ad hoc network, including asynchronous starts and the lack of advance knowledge of participating devices. Within this new framework, we solve the wireless synchronization problem on a t-disrupted channel. This problem requires devices to agree on a common round numbering scheme. We conclude by discussing how to use such a solution to adapt algorithms designed for the original model to work in the ad hoc variant.

Recently, many enhancements were presented on OTIS topologies including the Extended OTISn-Cube interconnection networks. Therefore, all performance improvement characteristics of such a promising architecture need to be investigated; one of which is load balancing technique. This paper focuses on developing an efficient algorithm for load balancing on the promising Extended OTIS-n-Cube interconnection networks. The proposed algorithm is called Factor-Optical-Factor Exchange Model. Furthermore, this paper presents theoretical and experimental study on the proposed algorithm in terms of various parameters including execution time, load balancing accuracy, number of communication steps, and speed. Results show superiority of the proposed algorithm over the well-known Clustered Dimension Exchange Method (CDEM) algorithm in terms of execution time, number of communication steps, and speed, while maintaining the same level of accuracy.

We first show that for either the conservative or optimistic synchronization protocols the simulation of such networks can prematurely block owing to event buffer exhaustion. Buffer exhaustion can occur in the simulator whether or not the simulator is stable, and, unlike simulators of feedforward networks, cannot be prevented by interprocessor flow control alone. We propose a simple technique (which we call compactficatiori), which, when used in conjunction with interprocessor flow control, prevents buffer exhaustion. This leads to a general algorithm, for both conservative and optimistic synchronization, that allows one to simulate the queueing network within the finite amount of memory available at each processor. For each algorithim presented we also provide the proof that it cannot get deadlocked owing to buffer exhaustion.	algorithm;buffer overflow;feedforward neural network;flow control (data);irreducibility;queueing theory;routing;simulation;synchronization (computer science)	Manish Gupta;Anurag Kumar	1998		10.1145/278008.278012	synchronization;parallel computing;real-time computing;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;discrete event simulation;concurrency control;flow control;layered queueing network;distributed computing;markov process;queueing theory;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-4.135259660746695	68.9444814714514	67465

In such cases, a recon guration algorithm must be exe cute dto restore the network connectivity and thus achieve high system reliability. However, most of the solutions are based either on redundant network paths or on regular network topologies. The purp oseof this paper is to specify NetRec, a novel algorithm for dynamically recon guring an arbitrary network topology when a permanent no de fault occurs. Unlike other recon guration algorithms, NetR ec is applicable for all high-speed computer networks and is compatible with all modern routing techniques, including wormhole-based system area networks. It restores the network connectivity by building a tree that spans all immediate neighbors of the faulty node that are still connected to the network.

The basis of the algorithm is the logical ring structure employed in token-based mutual exclusion algorithms. Specifically, there exists dynamic properties of the logical ring that, given certain restrictions regarding message traffic flow, passively give useful information about the location of the token. Effectively, the algorithm demonstrates a type of “intelligent routing” that identifies useful shortcuts in the routing of the token. The result is a reduction in the total number of messages exchanged prior to the execution of the critical section as compared to the algorithm proposed by Fu and Tzeng [3]. Furthermore, the algorithm allows for an increased degree of fairness in a lightly loaded system than that allowed by Fu and Tzeng's algorithm. The paper also addresses failure recovery issues.	algorithm;critical section;execution unit;fairness measure;fault tolerance;mutual exclusion;routing	Kia Makki;John Dell;Niki Pissinou;Melody Moh;Xiaohua Jia	2000	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1023/A:1008137614672	maekawa's algorithm;distributed algorithm;fault tolerance;parallel computing;real-time computing;mutual exclusion;computer science;theoretical computer science;traffic flow;distributed computing;critical section;suzuki-kasami algorithm	HPC	-2.442901866288742	70.73475927144841	68816

Consequently, several energy-efficient solutions, such as multi-speed disks and disk spin down methods, have been proposed to conserve power in storage systems and improve disk access. Some researchers have assessed their proposed solutions via simulations, while others have used real-world experiments. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. Simulations can more swiftly assess the benefits of energy-efficient solutions, but various measurement errors can arise from procedural shortcomings. For instance, many power simulation tools fail to consider how heat increases the power overhead of disk operations. Some researchers claim that their modeling methods reduce the measurement error to 5% in the single disk model. However, the demand for large-scale storage systems is growing rapidly. Traditional power measurement using a single disk model is unsuited to such systems because of their complex storage architecture and the unpredictability of numerous disks. Consequently, a number of studies have conducted real machine experiments to assess the performance of their solutions in terms of power conservation, but such experiments are time consuming. To address this problem, this study proposes an efficient simulation tool called Benchmark Analysis Software for Energy-efficient Solution BASE, which can accurately estimate disksu0027 power consumption in large-scale storage systems. We evaluate the performance of BASE on real-world traces of Academia Sinica Taiwan and Florida International University. BASE incorporates an analytical method for assessing the reliability of energy-efficient solutions. The analytical results demonstrate that the measurement error of BASE is 2.5% lower than that achieved in real-world experiments involving energy-estimation experiments. Moreover, the results of simulations to assess solution reliability are identical to those obtained through real-world experiments.

We present Selective Packet Interleaving (SPI), a flit transmission scheme that reduces power consumption in NoC links. SPI decreases the number of bit transitions in the links by exploiting the multiplicity of virtual channels in a NoC router. SPI multiplexes flits to the router's output link so as to minimize the number of bit transitions from the previously transmitted flit. Analysis and simulations demonstrate a reduction of up to 55% in the number of bit transitions and up to 40% savings in power consumed on the link. SPI benefits grow with the number of virtual channels. SPI works better for links with a small number of bits in parallel. While SPI compares favorably against bus inversion, combining both schemes helps to further reduce bit transitions.	forward error correction;multiplexing;network on a chip;router (computing);simulation	Amit Berman;Ran Ginosar;Idit Keidar	2010	2010 18th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip	10.1109/VLSISOC.2010.5642624	embedded system;benchmark;routing;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;bismuth;efficient energy use;very-large-scale integration;network on a chip;encoding;computer network	HPC	4.0768587688202444	61.63531976861982	70762

This paper proposes and evaluates a methodology that adds reliability to NoC routing algorithms with minimal power and performance overheads. The key idea behind this methodology is to use the concept of complement routing in which two routing algorithms with disjoint sets of allowed turns are incorporated. According to this methodology, while a packet is routed by a routing algorithm, a redundant copy of that packet is routed by the complement of that routing algorithm. This is done by exploiting channels with lower utilization to route redundant packets. To find the complement of the used NoC routing algorithm, an analytical approach based on the channel dependency graph is presented. The methodology is applied to two NoCs using the dimension order and the Duato's routing algorithms. These networks are simulated using an HDL-based NoC simulator along with the Synopsys Power Compiler tool. Results extracted by different traffic generation rates and by different error injection rates confirm that the proposed methodology provides similar reliability improvement in comparison with the flood-based routing algorithms. This methodology also decreases the performance and power consumption overheads as compared to the flood-based routing algorithms.

dc7b679ba83fa5ca067ef0daf8d3930a78fe2221	adaptive least-expected time paths in stochastic, time-varying transportation and data networks	intelligent transportation systems;shortest path	In congested transportation and data networks, travel (or transmission) times are time-varying quantities that are at best known a priori with uncertainty. In such stochastic, time-varying (or STV) networks, one can choose to use the a priori least-expected time (LET) path or one can make improved routing decisions en route as traversal times on traveled arcs are experienced and arrival times at intermediate locations are revealed. In this context, for a given origin–destination pair at a specific departure time, a single path may not provide an adequate solution, because the optimal path depends on intermediate information concerning experienced traversal times on traveled arcs. Thus, a set of strategies, referred to as hyperpaths, are generated to provide directions to the destination node conditioned upon arrival times at intermediate locations. In this paper, an efficient label-setting-based algorithm is presented for determining the adaptive LET hyperpaths in STV networks. Such a procedure is useful in making critical routing decisions in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and data communication networks. A side-by-side comparison of this procedure with a label-correctingbased algorithm for solving the same problem is made. Results of extensive computational tests to assess and compare the performance of both algorithms, as well as to investigate the characteristics of the resulting hyperpaths, are presented. An illustrative example of both procedures is provided. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.	algorithm;average-case complexity;computation;john d. wiley;list of sega arcade system boards;routing;telecommunications network;tree traversal	Elise Miller-Hooks	2001	Networks	10.1002/1097-0037(200101)37:1%3C35::AID-NET4%3E3.0.CO;2-G	stochastic process;routing;intelligent transportation system;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;shortest path problem;telecommunications network;data transmission	Theory	-0.25612346056365354	73.0515742268391	71710
bfa803e8a30fe86389cec28b830076595ea033a6	towards a universal approach for the finite departure problem in overlay networks		A fundamental problem for overlay networks is to safely exclude leaving nodes, i.e., the nodes requesting to leave the overlay network are excluded from it without affecting its connectivity. There are a number of studies for safe node exclusion if the overlay is in a well-defined state, but almost no formal results are known for the case in which the overlay network is in an arbitrary initial state, i.e., when looking for a self-stabilizing solution for excluding leaving nodes. We study this problem in two variants: the Finite Departure Problem$$\mathcal {FDP}$$ and the Finite Sleep Problem$$\mathcal {FSP}$$. In the $$\mathcal {FDP}$$ the leaving nodes have to irrevocably decide when it is safe to leave the network, whereas in the $$\mathcal {FSP}$$, this leaving decision does not have to be final: the nodes may resume computation when woken up by an incoming message. We are the first to present a self-stabilizing protocol for the $$\mathcal {FDP}$$ and the $$\mathcal {FSP}$$ that can be combined with a large class of overlay maintenance protocols so that these are then guaranteed to safely exclude leaving nodes from the system from any initial state while operating as specified for the staying nodes. In order to formally define the properties these overlay maintenance protocols have to satisfy, we identify four basic primitives for manipulating edges in an overlay network that might be of independent interest.	overlay network	Andreas Koutsopoulos;Christian Scheideler;Thim Strothmann	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21741-3_14	mathematics;distributed computing;computer security;engineering drawing	Theory	3.5703384372123383	70.77179661425752	72090

The increasing delay and high dissipated power of global interconnects in advanced 2D technologies is not alleviated by replacing these long wires (~mm) with shorter TSVs (~ tens of µm). In 3D systems-on-chip (SoCs), the functional (Intellectual Property IP) blocks are distributed across the layers of the stack. The interconnect fabric on which the system's IP blocks communicate must ensure high performance and flexibility of designs by implementing communication protocols at different abstraction layers. 3D networks-on-chip (NoCs) are among the proposed solutions for scalable high performance and low power communication. 3D NoCs consists in routing nodes attached to the IP blocks that have intra-die and inter-die links.	3d television;electrical connection;fault tolerance;integrated circuit;routing;scalability;stacking;switched fabric;system on a chip	Vladimir Pasca;Lorena Anghel;Claudia Rusu;Mounir Benabdenbi	2010	2010 15th IEEE European Test Symposium	10.1109/ETSYM.2010.5512735	embedded system;fault tolerance;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;network on a chip	EDA	3.517944064511293	61.31123893228271	72126

The remote sites may be located far away; thus, traditional connectivity, such as fiber, is not possible. This paper proposes to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide connectivity to ground sensor clusters on a suburban industrial area. Very small, commercial scale UAVs can be used to monitor a bunch of ground sensor nodes without the dependency of a physical connection to the remote sites. This technique can be used to create modular sensor grids with very low cost. The proposed research is to define the best ad-hoc network parameters for supporting the maximum number of programmable logic controllers (PLC) from a reasonable altitude using very small size, commercial UAVs. As a result, using IEE 802.11 with Dynamic MANET on Demand (DYMO) routing protocol can support five PLC clusters, which have 10 nodes each, from a 100-meters altitude with less than 350-milliseconds delay.	aerial photography;fiber to the x;hoc (programming language);routing;unmanned aerial vehicle	Burak Yanar;Weilian Su	2016	2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733562	wireless ad hoc network;embedded system;real-time computing;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;routing protocol;computer network	Robotics	7.2553565501031345	72.85961008447477	72521

In this paper, we present a new simulator, namely EasiSim, specifically for evaluating sensor net-works on a large scale. EasiSim is featured by organizing its core components, including nodes, topology and scenario, in a hierarchically structured approach. The hierarchically structured organization enables nodes to process all the concurrent events in one batch, hence reducing the running time by an order of magnitude. Moreover, we propose a visualization scheme based on a Client/Server model which separates the graphical user interface (GUI) from the simulation engine, and therefore the scalability of the simulator will not be decreased by complex GUI. Extensive simulations show that EasiSim outperforms ns-2 in terms of real running time and memory usage.	graphical user interface;organizing (structure);scalability;simulation;time complexity	Haiming Chen;Li Cui;Changcheng Huang;He Zhu	2009	Wireless Sensor Network	10.4236/wsn.2009.15056	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	3.917797769383745	74.16012495169511	73063

It was believed that the global properties (e.g., total energy) of simulated particles are unlikely to be affected by a small number of such errors. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis of the impact of transient faults in GPU devices on a global property of simulated particles. We experimentally show that a single-bit error in non-control data can change the final total energy of a large-scale N-body program with ~2.1% probability. We also find that the corrupted total energy values have certain biases (e.g., the values are not a normal distribution), which can be used to reduce the expected number of re-executions. In this paper, we also present a data error detection technique for N-body programs by utilizing two types of properties that hold in simulated physical models. The presented technique and an existing redundancy-based technique together cover many data errors (e.g., >97.5%) with a small performance overhead (e.g., 2.3%).	bit error rate;cluster analysis;computation;computer;dynamical simulation;error detection and correction;experiment;graphics processing unit;initial condition;overhead (computing);simulated annealing;smart data compression;unsupervised learning	Keun Soo Yim	2014	2014 IEEE 28th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2014.55	parallel computing;real-time computing;error detection and correction;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;n-body problem;distributed computing;algorithm;statistics	Embedded	6.200463242975801	61.82427719581195	73182

In k-local mutual exclusion, it is assumed that the k identical copies of a resource are shared among the geographically close nodes. The paper proposes a solution to the k-local mutual exclusion problem in MANETs. The algorithm uses a leader-based approach and the leader is equipped with a token. It is suited to handle mobility that triggers the dynamism in topology of ad hoc networks. The algorithm satisfies safety, starvation freedom and l-deadlock avoidance properties. The best case message complexity of our algorithm is O(1) whereas the worst case message complexity is O(N). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first algorithm to solve k-local mutual exclusion problem in MANETs. The solution to token loss problem is also included in the present exposition.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;deadlock;hoc (programming language);mutual exclusion	Ashish Khanna;Awadhesh Kumar Singh;Abhishek Swaroop	2014	J.

In order to fulfill the requirement of this analysis, 114 different fault targets are used in various points of main components which are described in VHDL language; each experiment was repeated 50 times, resulting in 5700 transient faults in this simulation model. The experimental results demonstrate that, depending on the fault injection targets and the benchmark characteristics, fault effects vary significantly. On average, up to 35.2% of injected faults are recovered in simulation time, while 52.6% of faults lead to system failure, and the remaining 12.2%, treat as latent errors. Different benchmarks show different vulnerability for various components; but on average, Arbiter and Message passing interface are the most vulnerable components outside the tiles, while PC and Bus Handler have highest failure rate among in-tile components. Fault injection on each region has noticeable impact on the result of the other core. In general, fault injection in Shared regions has highest contribution in system failure.	arbiter (electronics);benchmark (computing);categorization;failure rate;fault injection;fault tolerance;linked list;matrix multiplication;message passing interface;microprocessor;multi-core processor;simulation;vhdl	Iman Faraji;Moslem Didehban;Hamid R.

9714a9307ecb670a5924c700fe8170426a17067b	topological properties and algorithms for two-level hypernet networks		Although many networks have been proposed as the topology of a large-scale parallel and distributed system, most of them are neither expansible nor of equal degree. A network with these two properties will gain the advantages of easy implementation and low cost when it is manufactured. The hypernet, which was proposed by Hwang and Ghosh, represents a family of recursively scalable networks that are both expansible and of equal degree. In addition to the two merits, the hypernet has proven efficient for communication and computation. But, unfortunately, most topological properties and the problem of shortest-path routing for the hypernet are still unsolved. The reason is that the structure of the hypernet is complex and asymmetric, and, especially, no mathematical description was given before. In this paper, considering current hardware restrictions, we concentrate our effort on the hypernet of moderate size. We first give a concise mathematical definition for the hypernet and then solve the following problems for the hypernet of two levels: (1) shortest-path routing, (2) diameter, (3) connectivity, (4) minimum-height spanning trees, and (5) embedding of rings, tori, and hypercubes. © 1998 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Inc.

Therefore, routing schemes with varied candidate paths and fair selection strategy are required to relieve congestion. We propose an alterable priority arbitration for the fair granting of packet transmission from all possible directions permitted by the odd-even turn model. To achieve fairness, the proposed arbitration strategy alters the priority orders based on an optimized pointer, its granting decisions are made according to fixed mechanism under varied priority orders. Under a cycle-accurate simulator based on System C, the proposed alterable priority arbiter is verified to achieve better fairness than the RR arbiter. Simulation results show that the average packet latency of the odd-even turn model is reduced by 26.46%, and the saturation throughput is improved by 29.79% with the introduction of proposed arbitration scheme. Furthermore, the proposed arbiter achieves ignorable increasing of the hardware implementation overhead.	network on a chip;routing	Lu Liu;Zhangming Zhu;Duan Zhou;Yingtang Yang	2017	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2017.04.002	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;network on a chip;computer security;computer network	EDA	2.0955501279967366	64.20897691689323	74396

Depending on the number of routing options available for each packet, routing algorithms are classified into two different categories: deterministic (one available path) and adaptive (several ones). It is well-known that adaptive routing outperforms deterministic routing. Usually, adaptive routing uses virtual channels to provide routing flexibility and to guarantee deadlock freedom. On the other hand, deterministic routing is simpler and therefore has lower routing delay and does not introduce out-of-order packet delivery. This is why, in this paper, we take the challenge of developing new routing algorithms for direct topologies that exploit virtual channels in an efficient way while still maintaining the good properties of deterministic routing. This is accomplished by tackling one of the main performance degradation contributors of interconnection networks, which is the HoL-blocking effect. To do that, this paper analyzes several simple mechanisms to perform an efficient distribution of packets among virtual channels based on their destination. The resulting deterministic routing mechanisms obtain similar or even better performance than adaptive routing while keeping the simplicity of deterministic routing and guaranteeing in-order delivery of packets by design.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);bitwise operation;blocking (computing);computer;deadlock;deterministic routing;elegant degradation;exclusive or;hot spare;interconnection;interference (communication);network packet;out-of-order execution;parallel computing	Roberto Peñaranda;Crispín Gómez Requena;María Engracia Gómez;Pedro López;José Duato	2014	2014 IEEE Intl Conf on High Performance Computing and Communications, 2014 IEEE 6th Intl Symp on Cyberspace Safety and Security, 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Embedded Software and Syst (HPCC,CSS,ICESS)	10.1109/HPCC.2014.9	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;algorithm design;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;head-of-line blocking;equal-cost multi-path routing;network switch;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;network topology;routing information protocol;computer network	Arch	-1.4879212262918895	69.06373848896894	74650

The key idea behind the architecture is the incorporation of spare units and associated commutation logic into strategic partitions of the switching system. The definition of a replaceable unit is flexible, and based on packaging considerations. The commutation logic can switch in a spare unit in place of a failed one at cell rate, and is distributed entirely in the existing switch control units. So the additional overhead is almost entirely in the spare modules provided. The technique is far superior to a duplex configuration in terms of reliability improvement vs. component redundancy, and can be applied to established architectures for ATM switches, including multistage sort and shared memory based architectures. Its scalability also makes it applicable to system sizes from a few tens of lines to a few thousand.	atm turbo;best, worst and average case;duplex (telecommunications);error detection and correction;faust;fault tolerance;mean time between failures;multistage interconnection networks;network switch;on the fly;overhead (computing);period-doubling bifurcation;scalability;sensor;shared memory;tor messenger	Krishnan Padmanabhan	1995	IEEE/ACM Trans.

c4cca8cd9d351ffb4c5a3fbde7cb540b6f88a026	wireless sensor networks and the risks of vigilance	wireless sensor network	When Wendell Phillips (an American abolitionist and reformer) told a Boston audience in 1852 that “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,” he did not anticipate the advent of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs are a new technology that will help us be vigilant. Wireless networks and sensors are not new. However, deploying very large numbers of very small sensing devices (motes) is new. WSNs are distributed systems programmed for specific missions, to capture and relay specific data. For example, WSNs can check a vehicle’s registered identity, location, and movements. Data recorded by sensors embedded in the vehicle can be cross-correlated with data recorded by sensors embedded in sidewalks and roads. With a vast WSN of this type available to them, authorities could monitor driving conditions and instantly recognize traffic problems. Drivers could benefit from such vigilance and the rapid response that it facilitates. The obvious downside in this example is a further erosion of our privacy. The cross-correlated data can be a bounty for law enforcement. If roads are seeded with sensors enforcing speed limits, we might expect to receive a ticket every time we exceed them. Authorities will benefit from such vigilance, too. There would be less need for patrolling highways or for pulling anyone over for speeding, because automatically generated fines could be issued to vehicle owners. Cars and roads are merely the tip of the iceberg for WSN applications. There are already commercially available sensor systems for habitat oversight, environmental surveys, building and structural integrity testing, spotting containers and other shipping cargo, border patrol support, fire and flooding alerts, and many other vigilance situations. Industry analysts predict the market for WSNs will surpass $7 billion by 2010. Potential uses and benefits of WSNs are difficult to gauge; so are the risks associated with their proliferation. Personal computers 30 years ago and cell phones 15 years ago can serve as templates for what we can reasonably expect. Today, motes are costly and big. Early PCs and mobile phones were heavy and expensive. Eventually sensors will be small enough to go unnoticed and inexpensive enough to be scattered almost anywhere. Power, storage, and communication range will be challenges for WSNs, just as they are for laptop computers and mobile phones. Security is also a serious concern. Power drain in sensors spawned many clever, cost-effective workarounds, skirting security difficulties. Synchronizing sleep and wake cycles maximizes battery life, but exposes sensors to attacks that can force sensors to sleep (stop working) or stay awake (waste energy). Sensors are more vulnerable to attack than PCs or cell phones. A standard off-the-shelf serial board can be used to change data via sensors’ debugging interface. Data diddling could render a WSN unreliable. WSNs may give governments new tools to watch us, but hackers will relish new ways to spam and phish. Revenue-producing WSNs such as those monitoring traffic must be maintained, periodically tested, and upgraded. Maintaining WSNs deployed in rough terrains or hazardous conditions may not be possible. Motes may have to operate unattended, and those without power may remain unreplaced. Abandoned motes will be opportunities for new forms of data theft. Recovering dead motes to prevent staggering pollution problems will require “sensors sensing sensors”—with as yet unknown techniques. Although power and security problems are not yet solved, it is prudent to begin examining the risks that would be posed by widespread deployment of WSNs. As with all advanced technologies, WSNs compel us to balance what’s helpful (enhanced ability to observe) with what’s harmful (abuse of this ability or undue expectation of its reliability). Performance of large and complex WSNs may be affected by a few malfunctioning sensors, which might be difficult to discover. The risks of deployment must be compared with the risks of non-deployment. For some locations, the costbenefit analysis may be simple and decisive. WSNs will appear wherever it makes economic sense to deploy them, or when political goals justify their deployment. Anti-terrorism efforts will add round-the-clock attention to our already well-documented lives. Phillips warned that if we want to be free, we had to be vigilant. He could not imagine we would risk trading freedom for vigilance; with WSNs, it can happen surreptitiously.	data theft;debugging;distributed computing;embedded system;expect;habitat;laptop;personal computer;phishing;privacy;relay;rough set;sensor;software deployment;spamming;structural integrity and failure;workaround	Xiaoming Lu;George Ledin	2008	Commun.

Due to the large number of components used, the traditional bus-based interconnect scheme becomes cumbersome and restrictive. Hence, the Network-on-Chip (NoC) interconnect paradigm becomes appealing due to its many advantages such as scalability and superior performance. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of two major NoC components: a flexible adapter compatible with the Altera Avalon interconnect standard and a parameterizable wormhole router. The Avalon compatible adapter will be very useful to NoC designers using IP cores provided by Altera to implement NoC-based systems on Altera FPGAs. The design space of these components was explored by synthesizing them for an Altera Stratix II FPGA for different values of channel width. The effects of varying channel width on area, power and clock frequency of these components were explored. Experimental results show that a channel width of 16 bits gives the best tradeoff for optimizing area, power and clock frequency.	avalon;benchmark (computing);clock rate;fits;field-programmable gate array;high-level programming language;integrated circuit;multilayer switch;network on a chip;network packet;open research;programming paradigm;router (computing);scalability;stratix;system on a chip;throughput;vhdl;wishbone (computer bus)	Matthew Murawski;R.

There are many researches about the intelligent home environment or the development of residential space. However, they still have several issues to be resolved. In a situation of interconnecting complex network environment, various devices, and different services, the efficient and accurate revolving of fault is one of important issues that need to be addressed during defect occurs. In this paper, home resource management system is proposed which manages various information from home as resources, provides analyzed relational information between resources.

Thereby, application programmers gain the capability to trade throughput for reliability according to application requirements. To protect parallel loop computations against errors, we propose to apply the well-known fault tolerance schemes dual modular redundancy (DMR) and triple modular redundancy (TMR) to a whole region of the processor array rather than individual processing elements. At the source code level, the compiler realizes these replication schemes with a program transformation that: (1) replicates a parallel loop program two or three times for DMR or TMR, respectively, and (2) introduces appropriate voting operations whose frequency and location may be chosen from three proposed variants. Which variant to choose depends, for example, on the error resilience needs of the application or the expected soft error rates. Finally, we explore the different tradeoffs of these variants in terms of performance overheads and error detection latency.	compiler;computation;data parallelism;dual modular redundancy;error detection and correction;experiment;fault tolerance;goodyear mpp;iteration;overhead (computing);parallel computing;processor array;program transformation;programmer;redundancy (engineering);requirement;self-replicating machine;soft error;throughput;triple modular redundancy;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alexandru Tanase;Michael Witterauf;Jürgen Teich;Frank Hannig;Vahid Lari	2015	2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)	10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245734	triple modular redundancy;dual modular redundancy;embedded system;parallel processing;computer architecture;parallel computing;real-time computing;longitudinal redundancy check;schedule;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;redundancy;programming language	HPC	7.122243052624084	60.956839261609026	76069

For instance, in the case of paddy field monitoring, such outdoor issues as antenna placement, node density, node positioning, energy constraint, base station design, and data collection have to be considered. This paper highlights the implementation challenges of WSNs for paddy field monitoring and proposes practical solutions to these challenges. In particular, solar panels are employed to address the energy constraint of the WSN. Experiments were conducted in a paddy field of size 12,000m2 within a period of seven months. The experimental data are shown and analyzed in this paper to justify our design.

Routers and switches in wire-line networks require guaranteed line rate as high as 20Gbp/s as well as advanced quality of service (QoS). Hybrid SRAM and DRAM architecture previously presented with the benefit of high-speed and high-density requires complex memory management. As a result it, it has hardly supported large numbers of queue, which is an effective solution in QoS. This paper proposes an intelligent memory management unit (MMU) in the bases of hybrid architecture, wherever 16k multi queues are integrated. The performance examined by the system board is zero-packet loss under the seamless traffic with 60-1.5k Byte packet-length. (deterministic manner) Noticeable feature in this paper's architecture is eliminating any premium memories but uses only low-cost commodity SRAMs and DRAMs. The intelligent MMU involves head buffer architecture, which is suitable to support a large numbers of FIFO queues. The experimental board based on this architecture is embedded into a Router system to evaluate the performance. Using 16k queues at 20Gbps, zero-packet loss is examined with 64-Byte to 1, 500-Byte packet-length.	byte;data buffer;dynamic random-access memory;embedded system;fifo (computing and electronics);memory management unit;motherboard;network packet;network switch;quality of service;router (computing);seamless3d;static random-access memory;streaming media	Hisashi Iwamoto;Yuji Yano;Yasuto Kuroda;Koji Yamamoto;Shingo Ata;Kazunari Inoue	2012	2012 IEEE 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2012.87	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;memory management unit;quality of service;computer science;operating system;field-programmable gate array;computer network	HPC	-4.369624306801385	65.59690036046419	76867

To address this problem, we propose a new workload-scalable transcoding scheme which converts a pre-recorded video bitstream into a new video bitstream that satisfies the device's workload constraint, while keeping the transcoding distortion minimal. The key of this proposed transcoding scheme lies on a new workload prediction model, which is fast, accurate and is generic enough to apply to different video formats, decoder implementations and target platforms. The main contributions of this paper include 1) a workload prediction model for decoding MPEG video based on an offline bitstream analysis method; 2) a transcoding scheme that uses the proposed model to control the decoding workload on the target device. To facilitate our transcoding scheme, we have proposed a compressed domain distortion measure (CDDM) that takes effects from both frames per second (fps) and bits per frame (bpf) into consideration. CDDM ensures the transcoded video bitstream to have the best playback quality given the device's workload constraint. Both the workload prediction model and the transcoding scheme are evaluated experimentally.	bitstream;distortion;embedded system;experiment;mobile device;moving picture experts group;online and offline;peak signal-to-noise ratio;performance per watt;scalability;systems design;video file format	Yicheng Huang;An Vu Tran;Ye Wang	2007		10.1145/1291233.1291443	real-time computing;transcoding;computer hardware;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;mobile device;predictive modelling;multimedia;video post-processing;frame rate;satisfiability	Vision	-2.552484265312949	60.780651134563534	78152

Most traditional iterative scheduling schemes are based on a request-grant-accept process, such as PIM and iSLIP, and suffer from poor scalability due to the large latency in control message transmission. iRGRR overcomes this limitation by simplifying the execution process and reducing the scheduling overhead. It dramatically reduces the complexity of control messages from an order of O(N) to O(log N), and is thus a scalable solution for high port density switches. The simulation results show that iRGRR can achieve nearly the same performance as iSLIP under various traffic models, including uniform and non-uniform destination distributions. In addition, iRGRR provides better fairness and has lower implementation complexity than iSLIP.	crossbar switch;network switch;scheduling (computing)	Laixian Peng;Chang Tian;Shaoren Zheng	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-25969-5_17	complexity;real-time computing;scalability;simulation;systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;iterative method;scheduling;equity;algorithm;telecommunications network;smoothing	Arch	-3.021641219305292	69.5103723425772	78177

The traditional line visualization method based on geographical position usually contains such problems that the nodes density distribution is uneven and the lines are too complex to understand. Some other methods completely neglect the real geographic location information. In this paper, we propose a new visualization method by adjustment of the nodes' location and optimization of drawing lines. Initially, the scheduling substation node is designed as the central node, the other nodes are divides into different groups by k-means++ cluster algorithm. Next, the location of the nodes is adjusted and optimized after clustering, and the data density is balanced. Finally, the nodes are connected with the colored lines of ring or radial structure. Experimental results show that our visualization method can more clearly show the topological structure of the current power transmission lines and retain the main geographical location information.	algorithm;areal density (computer storage);cluster analysis;geographic coordinate system;geolocation;graph drawing;k-means++;location (geography);mathematical optimization;radial (radio);scheduling (computing);traction substation;transmission (bittorrent client);transmission line	Shuwei Pei;Xiaofu Huang;Bin Sheng;Lizhuang Ma;Dan Wu;Ping Li	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Big Data	10.1109/BigMM.2015.11	electronic engineering;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	Visualization	4.4338095964462285	70.58946211386854	78316

In some previous works, 12 block-ciphers have been benchmarked on an ATMEL AVR ATtiny45 8-bit microcontroller and the best candidates to use in the context of small embedded platforms have been deduced. This article proposes to study on the TI 16-bit microcontroller MSP430 most of the recent lightweight block cipher proposals as well as some conventional block ciphers. First, we describe the design of the chosen block ciphers with a security and an implementation summary and we then present some implementation tests performed on our dedicated platform.

We demonstrate the advantages of such a MAC layer by presenting simple asynchronous deterministic algorithms to solve LE and MIS and proving their correctness. First, we present an LE algorithm for static single-hop networks in which each process sends no more than three messages to its neighbors in the system. Next, we present an algorithm to compute an MIS in a static multi-hop network in which each process sends a constant number of messages to each of its neighbors in the communication graph.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;correctness (computer science);high- and low-level;hoc (programming language);independent set (graph theory);leader election;maximal independent set;maximal set	Nancy A.

699d82aa82acad84ac326549e91c4b586625cad6	a scalable and resilient microarchitecture based on multiport binding for high-radix router design		High-radix routers with low latency and high bandwidth play an increasingly important role in the design of large-scale interconnection networks such as those used in super-computers and datacenters. The tile-based crossbar approach partitions a single large crossbar into many small tiles and can considerably reduce the complexity of arbitration while providing throughput higher than the conventional switch implementation. However, it is not scalable due to power consumption, placement, and routing problems. In this paper, we propose a truly scalable router microarchitecture called Multiport Binding Tile-based Router (MBTR). By aggregating multiple physical ports into a single tile a high-radix router can be flexibly organized into a different array of tiles, thus the number of tiles and hardware overhead can be considerably reduced. Compared with a hierarchical crossbar, MBTR achieves up to 50%∼75% reduction in memory consumption as well as wire area. Simulation results demonstrate MBTR is indistinguishable from the YARC router in terms of throughput and delay, and can even outperform it by reducing potential contention for output ports. We have fabricated an ASIC MBTR chip with 28nm technology. Internally, it runs at 700MHz and 30ns latency without any speedup. We also discuss how the microarchitecture parameters of MBTR can be adjusted based on the power, area, and design complexity constraints of the arbitration logic.	application-specific integrated circuit;computer;crossbar switch;interconnection;microarchitecture;overhead (computing);place and route;placement (eda);router (computing);routing;scalability;simulation;speedup;supercomputer;throughput	Yi Dai;Kefei Wang;Gang Qu;Liquan Xiao;Dezun Dong;Xingyun Qi	2017	2017 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)	10.1109/IPDPS.2017.15	distributed computing;latency (engineering);latency (engineering);scalability;throughput;parallel computing;computer science;real-time computing;speedup;router;microarchitecture;crossbar switch	Arch	2.091136425466202	61.702948894239825	79187

For each origin-destination pair, it is assumed that there are multiple sessions. We consider the problem of choosing a path for each session so as to minimize the average packet delay in the network. We formulate this problem as a nonlinear multicommodity flow problem with integer decision variables. An iterative scheme that is similar to local search is developed to solve this problem. In each iteration, we apply Lagrangean relaxation and a multiplier adjustment procedure to solve a restricted problem. We show that the Lagrangean dual problem can be solved exactly by solving a convex program. In computational experiments, our algorithm determines solutions that are within 1% of an optimal solution in minutes of CPU time for networks with 26-61 nodes. In addition, we show that our proposed algorithm is better both theoretically and computationally than K(0)-ordering, single-path routing, or round-off Frank-Wolfe heuristics.	central processing unit;computation;convex optimization;duality (optimization);experiment;flow network;frank–wolfe algorithm;heuristic (computer science);iteration;iterative method;linear programming relaxation;local search (optimization);network packet;nonlinear system;relaxation (approximation);round-off error;routing;virtual circuit	James R.

Cached Sensornet Transform (CST for short) is a methodology for design and implementation of self-stabilizing algorithms for sensor networks. It transforms a self-stabilizing algorithm in the abstract computational model to a program for sensor networks. In the literature, only CST transformation of silent self-stabilizing algorithms have been investigated, while non-silent ones have not been investigated. Our contribution in this paper is threefold. We present a counterexample of a non-silent algorithm transformed by CST that does not behave correctly despite the original algorithm is correct. We show a sufficient condition for original algorithms and networks such that a transformed algorithm by CST behaves correctly. We present a token circulation algorithm that behaves correctly by CST, and derive upper bound of its expected convergence time.	algorithm	Hirotsugu Kakugawa;Yukiko Yamauchi;Sayaka Kamei;Toshimitsu Masuzawa	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-05118-0_30	real-time computing;computer science;artificial intelligence;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Robotics	3.5373099806134514	71.14613123966797	79708

We study this paradigm, which we call chatting, on multiprocessors that do not allow messages once dispatched ever to be delayed on their routes. By insisting on oblivious routes for messages, we convert the communication problem to a pure scheduling problem. We introduce the notion of a virtual chatting schedule, and we show how eecient chatting schedules can often be produced from eecient virtual chatting schedules. We present a number of strategies for producing eecient virtual chatting schedules on a variety of network topologies.	cache-oblivious algorithm;multiprocessing;network topology;programming paradigm;routing;scheduling (computing)	Sandeep N.

A major influencing factor is the dominance of interconnect delay, and its associated effects such as excessive power consumption, signal integrity issues, and so on. 3D architectures were proposed as an alternative to the classical 2D architectures with certain specific advantages such as reduced interconnect lengths, and hence the delay. However, negative issues like through-silicon vias (TSVs), excessive heating effects etc also come into play. Routing problem in 3D ICs becomes even more complicated in presence of obstacles across the routing layers. In this paper, in an attempt to gain a better insight of the use of interconnects in 3D architectures,we propose a method for routing of nets in the 3D architecture with the presence of obstacles across the routing layers, and perform empirical study in terms of total interconnection lengths across the layers as well as the inter-layer cost involved in TSV.	integrated circuit;routing	Prasun Ghosal;Hafizur Rahaman;Satrajit Das;Arindam Das;Parthasarathi Dasgupta	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-29280-4_53	embedded system;electronic engineering;static routing;real-time computing;engineering;multipath routing	EDA	3.1359915012990265	62.86261922112134	79731

Most three-stage Clos network switches assume either all modules are space switches without memory (bufferless), or employ shared memory modules in the first and third stages (buffered). The former is also referred to as the space-space-space (S/sup 3/) Clos network switch, while the latter is referred to as the memory-space-memory (MSM) Clos network switch. We provide a survey of recent literature concerning switching schemes in the S/sup 3/ Clos network switch. The switching problem in the S/sup 3/ Clos network switch can be divided into two major parts, namely port-to-port matching (scheduling) and route assignment between the first and third stages. Traditionally, researchers have proposed algorithms to solve these issues separately. Recently, a new class of switching algorithms, called matching algorithms for Clos (MAC), has been proposed to solve scheduling and route assignment simultaneously.

Instead of adding redundant ECC information to each cache line, our ECC FIFO mechanism off-loads the extra information to off-chip DRAM. We augment each cache line with a tier-1 code, which provides error detection consuming limited resources. The redundancy required for strong protection is provided by a tier-2 code placed in off-chip memory. Because errors that require tier-2 correction are rare, the overhead of accessing DRAM is unimportant. We show how this method can save 15--25% and 10--17% of on-chip cache area and power respectively while minimally impacting performance, which decreases by 1% on average across a range of scientific and consumer benchmarks.	benchmark (computing);cpu cache;computer memory;dynamic random-access memory;ecc memory;error detection and correction;fifo (computing and electronics);overhead (computing)	Doe Hyun Yoon;Mattan Erez	2009	Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis	10.1145/1654059.1654109	bus sniffing;pipeline burst cache;cache-oblivious algorithm;parallel computing;real-time computing;cache coloring;error detection and correction;page cache;cpu cache;computer hardware;cache;computer science;write-once;cache invalidation;smart cache;mesi protocol;cache algorithms;cache pollution;statistics	HPC	7.35467611531877	61.20479598954658	81216

However, the worst-case behavior of the Network-on-Chip (NoC) for both core-to-core and core-to-Input/Output (I/O) communications of critical applications must be established. The mapping over the NoC of both critical and non-critical applications has an impact on the network contention these critical communications exhibit. So far, all existing mapping strategies have focused on core-to-core communications. However, many-cores in embedded real-time systems will be integrated within backbone Ethernet networks, as they mostly provide Ethernet controllers as I/O interfaces. In a previous work we have shown that Ethernet packets can be dropped due to an internal congestion in a Tilera-like NoC. In this work, we describe and evaluate a mapping strategy for such Tilera-like NoCs that minimizes the contention of core-to-I/O critical flows in order to solve this problem. Experimental results on real avionics applications show significant improvements of core-to-IO flows transmission delays, without significantly impacting transmission delays of core-to-core flows.	avionics;benchmark (computing);best, worst and average case;blocking (computing);embedded system;input/output;internet backbone;manycore processor;massively parallel processor array;network congestion;network on a chip;non-blocking algorithm;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;round-robin dns;synthetic intelligence	Laure Abdallah;Mathieu Jan;Jérôme Ermont;Christian Fraboul	2016	2016 28th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS)	10.1109/ECRTS.2016.9	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;network on a chip;computer network	Embedded	1.5820011719409202	61.505253226739235	81569

Whereas a standard switch ASIC provides sophisticated mechanisms for switching of non real-time frames, an attached FPGA implements cut-through switching of real-time frames. The proposed FPGA architecture supports configuration of port numbers, bandwidth reservation for real-time frames and utilizes flow-control mechanisms of the ASIC in order to keep frame buffer sizes low. Mapping exemplary RTE extensions of PROFINET IRT onto a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA demonstrates the capability of providing band-width reservation and cut-through-forwarding of real-time frames. Therefore, the approach benefits from the innovations made by the switch manufacturers, whereas only a small amount of functions has to be mapped onto an FPGA.	application-specific integrated circuit;clock synchronization;control system;field-programmable gate array;framebuffer;item response theory;multilayer switch;real-time clock;real-time transcription;rollercoaster tycoon 2;scheduling (computing);spartan	Holger Flatt;Sebastian Schriegel;Jürgen Jasperneite;Frank Schewe	2012	Proceedings of 2012 IEEE 17th International Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2012)	10.1109/ETFA.2012.6489776	local area network;embedded system;electronic engineering;logic synthesis;real-time computing;network switch;computer science;engineering;operating system;application-specific integrated circuit;fpga prototype;field-programmable gate array	Embedded	-1.6051802313815162	63.62840257105799	81758

A simple rule for intercluster connectivity (node j in cluster i connected to node i in cluster j) leads to regularity, modularity, packageability, fault tolerance, and algorithmic efficiency of the resulting networks. We prove that an OTIS (swapped) network with a connected basis network possesses maximal fault tolerance, regardless of whether its basis network is maximally fault tolerant. We also show how the corresponding maximal number of node-disjoint paths between two nodes of a swapped network can be algorithmically constructed in a manner that is independent of the existence and construction of node-disjoint paths within its basis network. Our results are stronger than previously published results and they replace a number of proofs and constructions in the literature for specific basis networks. Additionally, we use our parallel path constructions to establish that the fault diameter and wide diameter of an OTIS network is no more than 4 units greater than its diameter.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;fault tolerance;interconnection;maximal set	Weidong Chen;Wenjun Xiao;Behrooz Parhami	2009	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2008.98	fault tolerance;parallel computing;computer science;distributed computing;programming language;computer network	Theory	0.3352075032369711	68.19129082159816	81890
116b66bbc3c991009b4b646a80181a53edf1b3c1	cache assisted randomized sharing counters in network measurement		This paper proposes a new counter architecture for network measurement called Cache Assisted and randomizEd ShAring counteRs (CAESAR). One of the greatest challenges for per-flow traffic measurement is designing an online measurement module to keep up with the rapid growth of link speed. To address this challenge, we use a fast on-chip memory as the cache before the slow off-chip SRAM counters, thereby decreasing the accesses per flow to off-chip counters to improve time efficiency without any packet loss. We use randomized sharing counters among multiple flows in SRAM to achieve a compact data structure with high storage efficiency. By removing the impact from other flows sharing counters with a specific flow, we theoretically analyze the expectation and confidence interval of its estimated flow size accurately. In this paper, we use the real-world network traces for software simulations and FPGA experiments on the Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA chip to validate our theoretical findings. The results show that CAESAR is up to 92.4% and 90% faster than prior work CASE and RCS respectively, and CAESAR reduces the average relative error of CASE and RCS by more than half.	approximation error;data structure;experiment;field-programmable gate array;network packet;randomized algorithm;revision control system;simulation;static random-access memory;storage efficiency;tracing (software)	Qian Liu;Haipeng Dai;Alex X.

At the same time, many applications require guarantees on both message arrival probability and response time. We address the problem of transient link failures by means of temporally and spatially redundant transmission of messages, such that designerimposed message arrival probabilities are guaranteed. Response time minimisation is achieved by a heuristic that statically assigns multiple copies of each message to network links, intelligently combining temporal and spatial redundancy. Concerns regarding energy consumption are addressed in two ways. Firstly, we reduce the total amount of transmitted messages, and, secondly, we minimise the application response time such that the resulted time slack can be exploited for energy savings through voltage reduction. The advantages of the proposed approach are guaranteed message arrival probability and guaranteed worst case application response time.	best, worst and average case;experiment;fault tolerance;heuristic;network on a chip;response time (technology);responsiveness;slack variable;temporal logic	Sorin Manolache;Petru Eles;Zebo Peng	2005	Proceedings. 42nd Design Automation Conference, 2005.	10.1145/1065579.1065648	chip;system on a chip;embedded system;synchronization;intelligent network;electronic engineering;real-time computing;voltage;directed graph;network analysis;telecommunications;computer science;deadlock;operating system;software testing;network operations center;network on a chip;computer network;integrated circuit design	EDA	4.642228598095325	60.85841082838756	82259

Conventional routers use distinct logic blocks for routing data and handling arbitration. At higher radices, connections between these blocks become a bottleneck, limiting router scalability and degrading performance. Recently, two switch topologies merged the data routing fabric with arbitration control, avoiding this bottleneck. However, relies on centralized control for channel allocation, limiting performance, while restricted to a small set of fixed priorities, rendering input ports prone to starvation. In addition, ever larger CMPs will require continued increases in bandwidth over previous designs. To address these issues, we present a 64x64 single-stage swizzle-switch network (SSN) with 128b data buses (8192 total input/output wires). The SSN can connect any input to any output, including multicast. It has a peak measured throughput of 4.5Tb/s at 1.1V in 45nm SOI CMOS at 25°C. The SSN's key features are: 1) a single-cycle least-recently granted (LRG) priority arbitration technique that reuses the already present input and output data buses and their drivers and sense amps; 2) an additional 4-level message-based priority arbitration for quality of service (QoS) with 2% logic and 3% wiring overhead; 3) a bidirectional bitline repeater that allows the router to scale to >;8000 wires. These features result in a compact fabric (4.06mm2) with throughput gain of 2.1 x over at 3.4Tb/s/W efficiency, which improves to 7.4Tb/s/W at 600mV.	cmos;centralized computing;current sense amplifier;dmz (computing);input/output;low-power broadcasting;message passing;multicast;overhead (computing);quality of service;router (computing);routing;scalability;silicon on insulator;subscriber identity module;throughput;wiring	Sudhir Satpathy;Korey Sewell;Thomas Manville;Yen-Po Chen;Ronald G.

0584b3b9e03beef7d965298fee1950593e905669	implementing an isr defense on a mips architecture		Code injection attacks are an undeniable threat in today's cyberworld. Instruction Set Randomization (ISR) was initially proposed in 2003. This technique was designed to protect systems against code injection attacks by creating an unique instruction set for each machine, thanks to randomization. It is a promising technique in the growing embedded system and Internet of Things (IoT) devices ecosystem, where the lack of complex memory management make these devices more vulnerable. However, most of ISR implementations up to day are entirely software based. In this work, we implement hardware support for an ISR defense on an 32 bits, 5 pipeline stages MIPS processor (which is an embedded system compatible architecture). Two obfuscation schemes were implemented, one based on XOR encryption and the other on transposition. The hardware implementation was tested under synthetic code injection attacks and results shows the effectiveness of the defense using both encryption circuits.	32-bit;code injection;dhrystone;ecosystem;embedded system;encryption;exclusive or;information systems research;internet of things;memory management;randomized algorithm	Loriana Sanabria Sancho;Elena Gabriela Barrantes	2017	2017 XLIII Latin American Computer Conference (CLEI)	10.1109/CLEI.2017.8226448	real-time computing;architecture;implementation;instruction set;software;encryption;memory management;code injection;randomization;computer science	EDA	9.291924085890972	64.5286668935885	83910

Reliability evaluation of interconnection networks is still a challenge owing to high complexity. Need of reliability evaluation for MINs is quite evident as these measures provide user-oriented performance. Terminal pair reliability (TPR) is the most commonly used reliability performance index of MINs. This paper provides a global view of different reliability measures and approaches for evaluation of these measures. Based on the critical literature review, shortcomings are identified and analyzed. Then the multi-variable inversion algorithm is applied to evaluate the reliability of one of the most common MINs, namely, Omega network, in a compact form. Terminal, broadcast, and network reliability for the Omega, Omega with an additional stage (Omega+), and Omega with two additional stages (Omega+2) systems are analyzed and compared. Then we extend our work to trace the minimal path sets of various MINs, and terminal pair reliabilities are evaluated and compared. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Ltd.		S.

This is a simple and powerful analytic tool based on the fluid approximation. It has been widely used in the area of packet broadcast systems. It is shown that we can study quite general multiprocessor systems by this technique with amazing simplicity. For example, we deal with systems made up of many classes of processors and memory modules with arbitrary static memory reference patterns, systems with dynamic memory reference patterns, and systems with bus connections between processors and memories. In most cases, the approximation of the analysis is shown to be sufficiently good. One of the nice properties of this technique is that the error is smaller for larger systems for which we have had no appropriate analytic tools thus far.	approximation algorithm;central processing unit;dimm;interference (communication);memory management;multiprocessing;network packet;statistical interference	Akira Fukuda	1988	IEEE Trans.

af49c6d245ef0301ab82af98e4db4a9c0a03b2d5	investigating the viability of maximum flexibility selection function in bufferless 2d meshes	maximum flexibility;selection function;bufferless noc	Bufferless NoCs have emerged as a solution to reduce power and area by eliminating buffers used for routing. Such networks handle contention using packet dropping or deflection. In this paper, we study the effect of MaxFlex selection function on 2D bufferless meshes for both a fixed and a variable step size.  For fixed step size, we perform an analytical study for the effect of using MaxFlex with different step size on the performance of 2D bufferless meshes. The analysis indicates that, as the step size increases the traffic in the central part of the network bisection relaxes. Simulation results show that, both average packet latency and average deflection count decrease as the step size used increases. Additionally, over different sizes of meshes, the results show that the network performs best if the step size is equal 60--80% of the mesh dimension. Then, we consider using variable step size in which a packet is routed using a step size dependent on the Manhattan distance, d, between the source and destination.

The fault-tolerant processor tested is characterized by per-cycle voting of microarchitectural and the flop-based architectural states, redundancy at the pipeline level, and a distributed voting scheme. Its fault-tolerant behavior is characterized for three different workloads from the automotive application domain. The study proposes statistical methods for both the single and dual fault injection campaigns and demonstrates the fault-tolerant capability of both processors in terms of fault latencies, the probability of fault manifestation, and the behavior of latent faults.	32-bit;application domain;authorization;byzantine fault tolerance;central processing unit;double fault;embedded system;flops;failure cause;fault injection;fault model;ieee xplore;leon;mpsoc;microarchitecture;microprocessor;multiprocessing;overhead (computing);pipeline (computing);single event upset;software bug;system on a chip	Emmanuel Touloupis;James A.

Besides developing advanced micro fabrication technologies means are being devised to reduce energy consumption to bring the network setup and operational costs down. With increasing applications amount of energy consumed in these networks is enormous. Even a small savings in energy consumption will result in huge benefits in energy consumption globally.

Due to the increasing demand for scalability and capability of working in harsh environment, the use of wireless communication is gaining in importance. In the past, some efforts were pursued to encapsulate wired standards over wireless link, but their diffusion is limited by reliability and predictability requirements. In addition, event-driven protocols borrowed from the consumer world (as IEEE802.11 or IEEE802.15.4) are not well suited for some industrial applications. In this paper, authors present the design and the experimental evaluation of a wireless real-time communication protocol that tries to overcome these limits. It exploits standard hardware to lower cost and implements a hybrid medium access strategy. Time Division Multiple Access scheduling is used to ensure time deadlines respect, while Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance is used for acyclic communications, as those involved in network management. It has been successfully adopted for temperature monitoring in plastic machineries. The prototype network adopts star topology and can manage up to 16 nodes with a refresh time of 128 ms.	automation;communications protocol;directed acyclic graph;event-driven architecture;fieldbus;prototype filter;real-time clock;requirement;scalability;scheduling (computing);star network	Alessandra Flammini;Daniele Marioli;Emiliano Sisinni;Andrea Taroni	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.2011602	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;automation;computer network	Embedded	6.090129284555788	73.41899440660079	85437

We propose a waterfall (WTF) allocator targeting homogeneous resource allocation, which provides single-cycle maximal matching while guaranteeing strong fairness based on the round-robin principle. It can be implemented with a loop-free structure. In 90 nm technology, the allocator operates at about 1 GHz clock frequency. We compare WTF with wave-front, separable-input-first, and separable-output-first allocators and find that it is at least 10% smaller, has 50% less delay under high load, and uses 3% less power than any of these alternatives. Also, WTF is at least as fair or clearly fairer. We also find that in a 4×4 circuit switched NoC the use of WTF gives up to 20% higher network performance.	allocator (c++);circuit switching;clock rate;combinational logic;fairness measure;matching (graph theory);maximal set;network on a chip;network performance;round-robin scheduling;simulation;the daily wtf;waterfall model	Shaoteng Liu;Axel Jantsch;Zhonghai Lu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2284563	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	Arch	1.71885896675576	61.04621545308421	85549

The NoC routing guarantees that the sensitive traffic communicates only through trusted nodes, which belong to a security zone. As the shape of the zones may change during operation, the sensitive traffic must be routed through low-risk paths. The experimental results show that this proposal can be an efficient and scalable alternative for enforcing the data protection inside a Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC).	dynamic data;encapsulation (networking);interop-vlab;information privacy;mpsoc;multiprocessing;network on a chip;routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;system on a chip	Martha Johanna Sepúlveda;Ramon Fernandes;César A.

To exploit this parallelism efficiently, a parallel processing system must be designed to considerably reduce the communication overhead between the processor and the memory modules. One of the many technologies is multistage interconnection networks(MIN). The major advantage of MINs lies in their scalability with modular construction. Moreover MINs among many interconnection types have been used in most of large scaled multiprocessor systems since MINs have good diameter of log 2 N and employing simple distributed self-routing. However the latency increases with log: ;,r the number of stages in the network [1 ], [2]. Therefore they can not exploit locality, because all processors take the same amount of time. This loss of locality hurts its performance. Also, costs due to increases wiring and switching complexity are another constraint.

In this paper, we propose new topology MIN, Hybrid which is combination of the topology design of a binary tree and the traditional MINs similar to Hyperbanyan Network [3]. Since the Hybrid MIN combines the advantages of the static type network with the dynamic type network, it has the features of a Hypercube, binary tree as well as the traditional MINs. Moreover Hybrid MIN is constructed with only 2N 3 SEs which is much fewer than that of the traditional M1Ns. Though there are fewer SEs than that of the traditional MINs, the Hybrid MIN has alternative paths and since there is the short cut path for the locality of reference, Hybrid MIN takes advantage of exploiting the locality of reference. Recently Y. R. Potlapali and D. P. Agrawal has studied HMIN [7] to take the locality of reference. However the HMIN presented in the literature are loosely coupled system. The number of I/O port of the HMIN is non-power-of two which is not desirable in MIN and it is also difficult to extend the network. The uneven distribution of communication load over the network leads to congestion at interface node. Few nodes in a cluster serves as interface. All the reference out of an own cluster have to lead to long distance. 2 I N T E R C O N N E C T I O N IN B I N A R Y TREE We will combines the best features of binary tree with the MIN topology using mechanism similar to Hypertree [4]. To keep up generality of MINs, we will use the graph representation model [11] of the traditional MINs to construct the Hybrid MIN. Each node has the degree of 2-input and 2-output. Since the MINs in the shared memory system are the structure of Processor-to-Memory, the processors can be placed at the left side and the memory modules can be placed at the right side of the network. To combine the graph models of static network with dynamic network, first of all we consider the binary tree on which the Hypertree was constructed. We define the binary tree of which the left half side contains the processors and the right half side contains the memory modules. We call this structure Processor-to-Memory tree. The connection pattern scheme like Hypertree should then apply to the Processor-to-Memory tree to reduce the average distance between nodes and to provide a more uniform message density in all links. However the method of connecting the nodes at the same level of the tree have to modified to be suitable for the Processor-to-Memory tree structure since the Hypenree is PE-to-PE communication connection structure. In the followings we assume that the nodes are numbered, as shown in Figure 1. The root has node address 0. Address or"""" left and right children are formed by appending a """"0'"""" and """"'1-. respectively, to a binary address of the parent node, i.e. the children of node x are numbcred 2x and 2x+l. Thus each Icxel of the Processor-to-Memory tree contains the nodes numbered by the binary expression• Additional links in the Processor-to-Memory tree are horizontal links connecting two nodes at the same level of the tree. The horizontal links have to connect between two nodes in the Processor-toMemory tree not to preponderate the number of path for the specific leaf-nodes through the horizontal links. We have to select a node at the same level which is connected by horizontal link to guarantee even connection. In binary tree, however, only the root node has 1-input and 1output degree. All the nodes except the root node have 2-input and 2-output degree. To reconstruct the Processor-to-Memory tree without loss of the generality of the MIN graph model, the nodes at level 1 in the tree should be eliminated from the binary tree. A Processorto-Memory tree with 2-input and 2-output degree tree can be produced like Figure 1 as a result. The horizontal links in this tree provide the network with redundant paths and fault tolerance as well as short cut path, which are not also forced the messages to pass the root node as well.

A set of spanning trees in the same network is node independent if two conditions are satisfied. First, all trees are rooted at node r. Second, for every node u in the network, all trees’ paths fromr to u are node-disjoint, excluding the end nodes r and u. Independent spanning trees have applications in fault-tolerant communications a d secure message distributions. Gaussian networks and two-dimensional toroidal networks share similar topological characteristics. They are regul ar of degree four, symmetric, and node-transitive. Gaussian networks, however, have relatively lesser network diamete r that could result in a better performance. This promotes Gaussian networks to be a potential alternative for twodimensional toroidal networks. In this paper, we present constructions for node independent spanning trees in dense Gaussian networks. Based on these constructions, we design routing algorithms that can be used in fault-tolerant routing and secure message distribu ion. We also design fault-tolerant algorithms to construct thes e trees in parallel.	algorithm;apollonian network;computation;fault tolerance;file spanning;independent set (graph theory);mike lesser;overhead (computing);routing;simulation;spanning tree;toroidal graph	Zaid Hussain;Bader F.

3b3dc8622855ebdf8751c80359d9bafe21d523ba	a generic architecture for robust asynchronous communication links		This paper proposes a new generic architecture for build- ing robust communication links for globally asynchronous locally syn- chronous (GALS) circuits. The general idea is to use delay-insensitive codes along with error detecting codes to provide resilience against tran- sient faults as well as robustness against delay variations. The presented link architecture is completely generic with respect to the chosen hand- shake protocols (2-phase/4-phase) and the used codes. Thus a specific implementation can be individually optimized regarding features such as performance, power consumption, area complexity or the number of faults that can be tolerated. In order to demonstrate the flexibility of our approach we present several solutions based on 2-phase and 4-phase dual-rail codes combined with either single parity bits or Hamming codes for error detection. In the former case the link provides resilience against single faults, in the latter double faults can be mitigated.

In such systems, the fault-tolerant ability is an important issue. Many researchers have proposed ways to enhance the reliability of MINs, among them a low-cost and efficient way is to use multipass routing schemes in MINs in which thedynamic full access(DFA) property exists. The performance of multipass routing, however, has been largely ignored by researchers in the past. In this paper, we show that multipass routing may degrade the system performance if the communication loads are not well balanced among processors; congestion may appear in some processors and the useful communication bandwidth is badly affected. We propose methods to design DFA routing schemes that are load-balanced and thus can utilize system resources (i.e., the bandwidth) more efficiently.		Sying-Jyan Wang	1996	J. Parallel Distrib.

Recently, some mutual exclusion algorithms successfully use logical structures to construct coteries with small quorums sizes. In this paper, we introduce a geometric approach on dealing with the logical structures and present some useful geometric properties for constructing coteries and k-coteries. Based on those geometric properties, a logical structure named three-sided graph is proposed to provide a new 'scheme for constructing coteries with small quorums: The smallest quorum size is q f i ) in a homogeneous system with N nodes and O(1) in a heterogeneous system. In addition, we also extend the three-sided graph to the n-sidedgraph for constructing kcoteries.	algorithm;mutual exclusion;system of linear equations	Yu-Chen Kuo;Shing-Tsaan Huang	1997	IEEE Trans.

17ef7501f818d75b1ab708d51fc0f6f70db01806	troubleshooting wireless coexistence problems in the industrial internet of things		The ever-growing proliferation of wireless devices and technologies used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as patient monitoring, military surveillance, and industrial automation and control, has created an increasing need for methods and tools for connectivity prediction, information flow monitoring, and failure analysis to increase the dependability of the wireless network. Indeed, in a safety-critical Industrial IoT (IIoT) setting, such as a smart factory, harsh signal propagation conditions combined with interference from coexisting radio technologies operating in the same frequency band may lead to poor network performance or even application failures despite precautionary measures. Analyzing and troubleshooting such failures on a large scale is often difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, we share our experience in troubleshooting coexistence problems in operational IIoT networks by reporting on examples that show the possible hurdles in carrying out failure analysis. Our experience motivates the need for a userfriendly, automated failure analysis system, and we outline an architecture of such system that allows to observe multiple communication standards and unknown sources of interference.	automation;coexist (image);dependability;failure analysis;frequency band;implicit shape model;industrial pc;industry 4.0;interference (communication);internet of things;network performance;semantic network;software propagation;systems architecture	Ulf Wetzker;Ingmar Splitt;Marco Zimmerling;Carlo Alberto Boano;Kay Römer	2016	2016 IEEE Intl Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE Intl Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC) and 15th Intl Symposium on Distributed Computing and Applications for Business Engineering (DCABES)	10.1109/CSE-EUC-DCABES.2016.167	automation;wireless network;wireless sensor network;computer network;troubleshooting;wireless;architecture;network performance;computer science;dependability	Embedded	5.597623513692965	73.14705008600792	87640

The interconnection networks proposed for these systems vary so that there has been no common or optimal solution proposed to these problems. This paper defines and describes the objectives, design, implementation and use of a network controller for a reconfigurable array computer, the Texas Reconfigurable Array Computer (TRAC). The objectives for the network controller are defined by management of the system state, the requirements of the operating system for functionality and the interface the network presents to the operating system. These objectives may be expected to have at least some commonality across most reconfigurable network architectures. The structure of the network controller given herein may offer guidance for development of controllers for other reconfigurable network architectures.	computer;interconnection;network interface controller;operating system;reconfigurable computing;requirement;trac	Roy M.

Most of these models, however, have been discussed for adaptive routing algorithms based on deadlock avoidance, e.g. Duato's routing. Several research studies have empirically demonstrated that routing algorithms based on deadlock recovery offer maximal adaptivity that can result in considerable improvement in network performance. Disha is an example of a true fully. adaptive routing algorithm that uses minimal hardware to implement a simple and efficient progressive method to recover from potential deadlocks. This paper proposes a new analytical model of Disha in wormholerouted k-ary n-cubes. Simulation experiments confirm that the proposed model exhibits a good degree of accuracy for various networks sizes and under different traffic conditions.	algorithm;deadlock;experiment;maximal set;network performance;olap cube;routing;simulation	Ahmad Khonsari;Alireza Shahrabi;Mohamed Ould-Khaoua	2007	Parallel Processing Letters	10.1142/S0129626407002971	computer simulation;routing;static routing;parallel computing;simulation;systems modeling;adaptive routing;computer science;deadlock;cube;distributed computing;m/g/1 queue;algorithm	Arch	-2.6510572043370497	69.39701889398594	88492

Although analytical techniques may be used to bound the worst-case performance of traffic scheduling and congestion control algorithms, these are often inadequate for modeling the switch algorithms at the needed level of detail. Simulation is often the only alternative for evaluating the actual performance of the network. However, owing to the small size of the ATM cell and the high link-speeds, simulation of ATM switches and networks in a computationally demanding problem. To address this problem, we have developed a flexible hardware testbed for simulation of ATM-based networks. The testbed, called FAST (FPGA-based ATM simulation testbed), uses high-density field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to allow implementation of the key algorithms in an ATM switch in hardware. The first version of the testbed (FAST-1) consists of a set of boards, each providing a total of 336,000 usable gates and 17 Mbytes of static RAM. Each board can be used to simulate an ATM switch, and multiple boards may be interconnected to simulate networks of ATM switches. Software tools have been developed for specifying the components of the switch model and algorithms, configuring the testbed for simulation, and monitoring the simulation process. This article provides an overview of the architecture of the FAST-1 board, describes its key components, and discusses some example simulation models of traffic scheduling algorithms using the board.	atm turbo;algorithm;best, worst and average case;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;level of detail;network congestion;network switch;programming tool;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;static random-access memory;testbed	Dimitrios Stiliadis;Anujan Varma	1997	ACM Trans.

To promote safety-assured, mobile communication environments, efficient, reliable maintenance, and information integrity need to be designed, especially in highly possibly interfered places. For busy traffic areas, regular degree-3 dedicated short range communication (DSRC) networks are safety and information featured with availability, reliability, and maintainability in paths of multi-lanes. For sparsely populated areas, probes of wireless sensors are rational, especially if sensor nodes can be organized to enhance security, reliability, and flexibility. Applying alternative network topologies, such as spider-webs, generalized honeycomb tori, and cube-connected cycles, for comparing and analyzing is proposed in DSRC and cellular communications to enhance integrity in communications.	cube-connected cycles;network topology;population;sensor	Li-Yen Hsu	2013	Algorithms	10.3390/a6030459	embedded system;computer science;computer security;maintainability	Mobile	6.916290811689752	74.21473278855737	89092

This paper describes a mechanism for recirculating messages in a simple router so that the added functionality of a combining network, for arbitrary access patterns, can be achieved by it with provable e ciency. The method brings together the messages with the same destination address in more than one stage, and at a set of components that is determined by a hash function and decreases in number at each stage.

However, to exploit this available capacity, we need a suitable software platform that allows effective parallel packet processing and resource management. In this paper, we at first introduce an improved forwarding architecture for software routers that enhances parallelism by exploiting hardware classification and multi-queue support, already available in recent commodity network interface cards. After evaluating the original scheduling algorithm of the widely-used Click modular router, we propose solutions for extending this scheduler for improved fairness, throughput, and more precise resource management. To illustrate the potential benefits of our proposal, we implement and evaluate a few key elements of our overall design. Finally, we discuss how our improved forwarding architecture and resource management might be applied in virtualized software routers.	algorithm;central processing unit;commodity computing;electrical connection;fairness measure;forwarding plane;multi-core processor;network interface controller;network packet;parallel computing;router (computing);scheduling (computing);server (computing);throughput	Norbert Egi;Gianluca Iannaccone;Maziar Manesh;Laurent Mathy;Sylvia Ratnasamy	2011	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-011-0579-3	parallel processing;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling	Networks	-2.6105478837203377	64.14348095656646	89476

TM-FAR retains the deadlock-free property of traditional turn-model based routing algorithms (e.g., XY, Odd-Even), while alleviating restrictions on turn and path selections. Just like the current Virtual-Channel based Fully-Adaptive-Routing (VC-FAR) algorithm, TM-FAR allows full exploitation of all available minimal paths, yet TM-FAR does not use virtual channels. This fully adaptive routing capability of TM-FAR promises improved routing adaptivity and enhanced level of fault-tolerance. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the TM-FAR achieves an averaged delay reduction of 30.08% and a throughput rate increase of 4.54% compared to the state-of-the-art NoC routing algorithm based on the Odd-Even turn model.	algorithm;deadlock;fault tolerance;network on a chip;router (computing);routing;throughput;vc dimension;virtual channel	Wen-Chung Tsai;Kuo-Chih Chu;Sao-Jie Chen;Yu Hen Hu	2010	2010 18th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip	10.1109/VLSISOC.2010.5642629	system on a chip;routing table;routing;static routing;parallel computing;real-time computing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;engineering;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;routing protocol;network on a chip;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	EDA	2.3095680503547795	63.83697479479102	89540

There are N nodes on the ring and control is passed sequentially from one to the next. Messages with random lengths arrive at each node and are placed on the ring when the control arrives at that node. Exhaustive service means that the queue at a node is empty before the token is released and gated means that only those messages in the queue at the arrival of the token are served at that cycle. Generating function recursions for the terminal service time (the total sojourn time of a token at a node) and, from this, joint cycle and intervisit times are derived. Using known results relating the marginal generating functions of the waiting time and the cycle and intervisit time, it is shown that the N mean waiting times at the nodes require the solution of N(N - 1) and N 2 equations for the exhaustive and gated cases, respectively. The arrival processes are assumed to be Poisson with different rates and the service processes are general and different at each node. In addition the token overhead is allowed to have an arbitrary but independent distribution at each node. Explicit, simply programmed equations are given. It is shown, arguing from the form of the equations, that there is a conservation law in effect in this system. If the nodal mean waiting times are weighted by the relative intensity, defined here as the intensity weighted mean, then the sum takes on a particularly simple form and is independent of the placement of the nodes on the ring. When the service means at each node are equal, this quantity is just the system mean waiting time.	token ring	Michael J. Ferguson;Yehuda J. Aminetzah	1985	IEEE Trans.

Unlike the Spidergon network, the SD network which extends the Spidergon network into the second dimension, significantly reduces the network diameter, well below the popular 2D Mesh and Torus networks for one extra node degree and roughly 25 percent more links. A detailed construction of the SD network and a method to reshuffle the SD network's nodes for layout onto the 2D plane, and simple one-to-one and broadcast routing algorithms for the SD network are presented. The various configurations of the SD network are analyzed and compared including detailed area and delay studies. To interconnect a thousand cores, the paper concludes that a hybrid version of the SD network with smaller SD instances interconnected by a crossbar is a feasible low-diameter network topology for interconnecting the cores of a thousand core system.	algorithm;android donut;crossbar switch;interconnection;manycore processor;network on a chip;network topology;one-to-one (data model);queueing theory;real-time clock;routing;suicidegirls;wiring	Fadi N.

BF is a simple space-efficient randomized data structure used to represent a data set in order to support membership queries. However, BF generates false positives, and cannot count the number of distinct elements. A counting Bloom Filter (CBF) can count the number of distinct elements, but CBF needs more space than BF. We propose an alternative data structure of CBF, and we called this structure an Adaptive Bloom Filter (ABF). Although ABF uses the same-sized bit-vector used in BF, the number of hash functions employed by ABF is dynamically changed to record the number of appearances of a each key element. Considering the hash collisions, the multiplicity of a each key element on ABF can be estimated from the number of hash functions used to decode the membership of the each key element. Although ABF can realize the same functionality as CBF, ABF requires the same memory size as BF. We describe the construction of ABF and IABF (Improved ABF), and provide a mathematical analysis and simulation using Zipf's distribution. Finally, we show that ABF can be used for an unpredictable data set such as real network traffic.	algorithm;bloom filter;network packet	Yoshihide Matsumoto;Hiroaki Hazeyama;Youki Kadobayashi	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietisy/e91-d.5.1292	embedded system;real-time computing;hash function;data structure;computer science;operating system;programming language;algorithm	Vision	-4.495924877331664	73.58214973364244	90806

This paper studies the difference in communication requirements between two Lee distance Gray codes when moving data from processors in normal radix k order to those in Gray code order in k-ary n-cube networks. Algorithms for k-ary to Gray code conversion, and vice versa, in k-ary n-cube networks are described under various channel constraints, i.e., one-port and all-port communication assumptions. The minimum length path routing algorithm for nonreflective Gray code requires roughly M(k/4) and (n − 1) M(k/4) steps for data element transfers under all-port communication and one-port communication, respectively, for M elements per node. It is also shown that using a nonminimum length path routing algorithm, the number of steps for data element transfers can be halved. Lower bounds for the number of element transfers are derived, and the proposed algorithm using nonminimum length paths under one-port communication is shown to be near optimal.	algorithm;central processing unit;code;data element;lee distance;olap cube;port (circuit theory);requirement;routing	Myung M.

The existing repair methods are based on column replacement. Consequently, the number of single-bit hard errors induced by malfunctioning storage cells is linear with respect to the number of redundant columns. We propose restricted single-error correction (RSEC) codes to enable the correction of an exponential number of single-bit errors. The RSEC codes are characterized by programmable parity-check matrices which allow the correction of different sets of errors. Depending on the accessed memory bank or segment, these matrices can be generated out of the (built-in) test result bits which indicate the columns with defective storage cells. The resulting RSEC-based method improves the memory repair capacity with limited performance overhead. Memory protection schemes are proposed in which each redundant column is used either to store RSEC check-bits or to replace completely defective regular columns.	address space;canonical account;column (database);error detection and correction;memory bank;memory protection;overhead (computing);parity bit;qr code;random-access memory;semiconductor memory;time complexity	Samuel Evain;Yannick Bonhomme;Valentin Gherman	2010	2010 IEEE 16th International On-Line Testing Symposium	10.1109/IOLTS.2010.5560216	maintenance engineering;compaction;semiconductor memory;parallel computing;error detection and correction;computer hardware;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;software testing;multiplexing;difference set;statistics;memory management	Arch	8.701123554569953	61.96215932134721	91302

An optimal routing policy is a policy that maximizes the probability of a message reaching its destination without delays. Optimal routing policies have been proposed for several regular networks, including the mesh and the hypercube. An open problem in interconnection network research has been the identification of an optimal routing policy for the torus. In this paper, we show that there is no optimal routing policy for the torus. Our result is demonstrated by presenting a detailed example in which the best choice of output channel is dependent on the probability of each channel being available. This result settles, in the negative, a conjecture by Wu concerning an optimal routing policy for the torus.  2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Most of these monitoring and warning systems require real-time communication in wide area networks that have a low density of nodes. The underwater communication medium involved in these networks is very harsh and imposes strong restrictions to the communication process. In this scenario, the real-time transmission of information is done mainly using acoustic signals, since the network nodes are not physically close. The features of the communication scenario and the requirements of the communication process represent major challenges for designers of both, communication protocols and monitoring and warning systems. The lack of models to represent these networks is the main stumbling block for the proliferation of underwater ubiquitous systems. This paper presents a real-time communication model for underwater acoustic sensor networks (UW-ASN) that are designed to cover wide areas with a low density of nodes, using any-to-any communication. This model is analytic, considers two solution approaches for scheduling the real-time messages, and provides a time-constraint analysis for the network performance. Using this model, the designers of protocols and underwater ubiquitous systems can quickly prototype and evaluate their solutions in an evolving way, in order to determine the best solution to the problem being addressed. The suitability of the proposal is illustrated with a case study that shows the performance of a UW-ASN under several initial conditions. This is the first analytic model for representing real-time communication in this type of network, and therefore, it opens the door for the development of underwater ubiquitous systems for several application scenarios.	acoustic cryptanalysis;asparagine;carrier frequency;cautionary warning;central processing unit;communications protocol;earliest deadline first scheduling;ecosystem;fifo (computing and electronics);glossary of computer graphics;heuristic;heuristics;initial condition;integer (number);integer programming;iterative design;iterative method;linear programming;mandatory - hl7definedroseproperty;modulation;network model;network performance;node - plant part;petroleum pollution;policy;pramlintide;programming, linear;protocols documentation;prototype;real-time clock;real-time transcription;real-time web;relevance;requirement;routing;schedule (document type);scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;short;shortest path problem;simulation;solutions;stumbleupon;tsunamis;ubiquitous computing;vasoactive intestinal peptide;disease transmission;message	Rodrigo M.

In this paper we study the performance of Youssef’s routing algorithms for faulty Clos networks in the presence of multiple faults in multiple columns with and without fault detection. We show that with fault detection and diagnosis, randomized routing algorithms provide scalable, very efficient and fault tolerant routing mechanisms. Without fault detection and diagnosis, randomized routing provides good fault tolerance for faulty switches in either the first or the second column. The delays become large for faults in the third column or for faults in more than one column. In conclusion, randomized routing enables the system to run without periodic fault detection/diagnosis, and if and when the performance degrades beyond a certain threshold, diagnosis can be performed to improve the routing performance.	clos network;column (database);elegant degradation;fault detection and isolation;fault model;fault tolerance;network switch;one-to-one (data model);profiling (computer programming);randomized algorithm;routing;scalability;universality probability	Manjit Bhatia;Abdou Youssef	1998	Telecommunication Systems	10.1023/A:1019115016388	fault tolerance;real-time computing;fault coverage;computer science;clos network;multipath routing;operating system;distributed computing;fault detection and isolation;computer network;low latency	Arch	1.5745573272419087	67.58786084358752	92231
1872a876d7068e708ae23c122fab50a301912622	torus-connected cycles: a simple and scalable topology for interconnection networks		Supercomputers are today made up of hundreds of thousands of nodes. The interconnection network is responsible for connecting all these nodes to each other. Different interconnection networks have been proposed; high performance topologies have been introduced as a replacement for the conventional topologies of recent decades. A high order, a low degree and a small diameter are the usual properties aimed for by such topologies. However, this is not sufficient to lead to actual hardware implementations. Network scalability and topology simplicity are two critical parameters, and they are two of the reasons why modern supercomputers are often based on torus interconnection networks (e.g., Fujitsu K, IBM Sequoia). In this paper we first describe a new topology, torus-connected cycles (TCCs), realizing a combination of a torus and a ring, thus retaining interesting properties of torus networks in addition to those of hierarchical interconnection networks (HINs). Then, we formally establish the diameter of a TCC, and deduce a point-to-point routing algorithm. Next, we propose routing algorithms solving the Hamiltonian cycle problem, and, in a two dimensional TCC, the Hamiltonian path one. Correctness and complexities are formally proved. The proposed algorithms are time-optimal.

ce42fe8e996bf9e69fe094816b078a9bc0fc1abb	a crosstalk avoidance scheme based on re-layout of signal tsv	会议论文	TSV (Through-silicon Via) is applied to 3D integrated circuits, which meets the demands of high speed and low power consumption. However, high density of TSV implementation exacerbates crosstalk noise which will reduce the transmission reliability. Due to temporal and spatial locality of signal transmission, some signal TSVs can be used for shielding. In this paper, we propose a crosstalk avoidance scheme based on re-layout of signal TSV. Two parameters, crosstalk index and unshielded index, are proposed in this paper to describe the shielding effect of signal TSV re-layout. Both of the indexes are optimized by using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). We implemented our scheme based on SPEC2006 trace-driven simulation. Result shows that the number of transmission patterns that cause worst crosstalk decreases by 28.8%. And transmission time is reduced by 14.8%. Compared with other algorithms, our work achieves the same or even better results without redundancy TSVs.	crosstalk;genetic algorithm;integrated circuit;locality of reference;principle of locality;simulation;sorting;three-dimensional integrated circuit;through-silicon via;transmission curve	Jiayi Hu;Qin Wang;Jian-Fei Jiang;Jing Xie;Zhigang Mao	2015	2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)	10.1109/ASICON.2015.7517149	embedded system;electronic engineering;parallel computing;engineering	EDA	3.3995615002252086	63.2388346596065	92697

Precision time synchronization supports a variety of extensions of applications. The IEEE 1588 precision time protocol (PTP) provides a standard method to synchronize devices in a network with sub-microsecond precision. This paper includes the design and implementation of a PTP bridge to extend IEEE 1588 over Ethernet to Zigbee networks. To achieve precision between both networks, we analyze the characteristics of both networks with the aim of minimizing the differences and error factors. In addition, this paper presents the experiments and performance evaluation of time synchronization using a PTP bridge between Zigbee networks via Ethernet. The results show that time synchronization using the PTP bridge can result in a deviation as low as 300 nanoseconds from the time reference.	entity;experiment;mean squared error;performance evaluation;precision time protocol	Hyuntae Cho;Youngwoo Jin;Jusik Heo;Yunju Baek	2010	2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2010.440	embedded system;synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Visualization	4.45745422734574	72.08739381168806	92706

Several nonconstant and constant degree interconnection networks have been used as topologies of many peer-to-peer networks. The Kautz digraph is one of these topologies that have many desirable properties. Unlike interconnection networks, peer-to-peer networks need a topology with an arbitrary order and degree, but the Kautz digraph does not possess these properties. In this paper, we propose MOORE: the first effective and practical peer-to-peer network based on the quasi-Kautz digraph with O(logd n) diameter and constant degree under a dynamic environment. The diameter and average routing path length, respectively, are shorter than that of CAN, butterfly, and cube-connected cycle, and are close to that of the de Bruijn and Kautz digraphs. The message cost of node joining and departing operations are at most 2.5d\logd n and (2.5d+1)\logd n, and only d and 2d nodes need to update their routing tables. MOORE can achieve optimal diameter, high performance, good connectivity, and low congestion, evaluated by formal proofs and simulations.	cube-connected cycles;de bruijn graph;diameter (protocol);directed graph;formal proof;interconnection;locality of reference;network congestion;overlay network;peer-to-peer;routing table;simulation	Deke Guo;Jie Wu;Yunhao Liu;Hai Jin;Hanhua Chen;Tao Chen	2011	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2010.161	heuristic;cube-connected cycles;routing;consensus;directed graph;index term;mutual exclusion;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;collision detection;network topology;computer network	Networks	-0.47481248600672954	69.45829367384508	93029
a91941aa4ebbfaf2477f4679952384b4d268b0f8	an efficient crosstalk-free routing algorithm based on permutation decomposition for optical multi-log2 n switching networks	optical crosstalk;permutation;optical switching;multi log2n networks	Optical switching networks OSN based on optical directional couplers DC may be the most promising candidate to provide a high switching rate when the speed mismatch problem between links optical fibers and switches is increasingly serious. Although such switches have many advantages, the DC suffers from an inherent crosstalk problem that can greatly aggravate the switching performance. Based on semi-permutations, a parallel decomposition algorithm,which is called multi-decomposition, is proposed in this paper for solving the optical crosstalk problem in optical multi-log2N switching networks. According to the number of planes in a multi-log2N network, the multi-decomposition is performed in parallel to partition a permutation into several sub-permutations, each of which is established without crosstalk within each plane. We demonstrate that our algorithm can completely remove the crosstalk in optical multi-log2N networks when n is even, and that it may be generated only in the stage n-1/2 i.e., the middle stage when n is odd, but the corresponding probability of generating crosstalk is to be less than or equal to    $\frac{1}{2^{n+1/2}-1}$    . In addition, our algorithm can achieve a low complexity for decomposition a permutation due to its parallelism so that any permutations can be realized in multi-log2 N networks under the constraint of avoiding crosstalk.	algorithm;binary logarithm;crosstalk;routing	Xiaofeng Liu;Youjian Zhao;Yajuan Wu	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40820-5_18	optical burst switching;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;permutation;optical switch	Theory	-1.2393311938601623	71.39361098130772	93032

Recent works on the permutation admissibity problem of shuue-exchange networks (SEN) of size N N, deal with (n + k) stages, where n = log2N, and k denotes the number of extra stages. For k = 0 or 1, O(Nn) algorithms exist to check if any permutation is admissible, but for k 2, a polynomial time solution is not yet known. The more general problem of nding the minimum number (m) of shuue-exchange stages required to realize an arbitrary permutation , 1 m 2n ? 1, is also an open problem. In this paper, we present an O(Nn) algorithm that checks whether a given permutation P is admissible in an m stage SEN, 1 m n, and determines in O(Nnlogn) time the minimum number of stages m of shuue-exchange, required to realize P. Thus, a single-stage shuue-exchange network will be able to realize such a permutation with m passes, by recirculating all the paths m times through a single-stage, i.e., with minimum transmission delay, which, otherwise cannot be achieved with a xed-stage SEN. Furthermore, we present a necessary condition for permutation admissibility in an m stage SEN, where n < m 2n ? 1.	admissible heuristic;algorithm;delay-gradient congestion control;integrated circuit layout design protection;interconnection;multistage amplifier;polynomial;routing;time complexity	Nabanita Das;Bhargab B.

In doing so, this work discusses the different parameters which can affect the performance of clock synchronization over the wireless channel, such as timestamping quality, clock adjustment, and synchronization overhead.

The generalized Fibonacci cubes include the hypercubes, the recently proposed Fibonacci cubes (W.-J. Hsu, Proc. Int. Conf. on Parallel Processing, p.1722-3 (1991)), and some other asymmetric interconnection topologies bridging between the two mentioned above. The generalized Fibonacci cubes can serve as a framework for studying degraded hypercubes due to faulty nodes or links. Previously known algorithms for hypercubes do not generalize to this class of interconnection topologies. The authors present distributed routing and broadcasting algorithms that can be applied to all members of this class of interconnection topologies. It is shown that their distributed routing algorithm always finds a shortest and deadlock-free path. The broadcasting algorithms are designed and evaluated based on both the all-port and the 1-port communication models. The all-port broadcasting algorithm is provably optimal in terms of minimizing routing steps. An upper bound for the 1-port broadcasting algorithm is determined, which is shown to be optimal for certain cases. >		Jen-Shiuh Liu;Wen-Jing Hsu	1992		10.1109/IPPS.1992.222963	parallel computing;computer science;distributed computing;fibonacci cube;computer network	Arch	0.07678241053368745	68.9428078281818	94026
7ab533869521973348a0b8420754b664f1fd946a	a new node-to-set disjoint-path algorithm in perfect hierarchical hypercubes	disjoint paths	The perfect hierarchical hypercube (HHC) interconnection network, also known as the cubeconnected cube, was introduced as a topology for large parallel computers. One of its interesting properties is that it can connect many nodes while retaining a small diameter and a low degree. The first node-to-set disjoint-path routing algorithm in perfect HHCs was previously introduced by Bossard et al. [(2011) Node-to-Set Disjoint-Path Routing in Perfect Hierarchical Hypercubes. Proc. 11th Int. Conf. Computational Science, Tsukuba, Japan, June 1–3. Elsevier, Amsterdam]. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the node-to-set disjoint-path routing problem in HHC. Inside a (2 + m)-dimensional HHC, we shall describe an algorithm that can find disjoint paths between a source node and at most m + 1 destination nodes of maximum length O(2), significantly shorter than the maximum path length O(m2) of Bossard et al.

Dur ing the routing, the movemen t of the packets follows a set of rules. These rules specify the routing model. Rout ing models might differ on the way edges are t reated, the number of packets each node can r e c e i v e / t r a n s m i t / h o l d in a single step, the number of packets tha t are allowed to queue in a node (queue-size), etc. W h e n all packets axe available at the beginning of the routing, we have a static rout ing problem, while, when it is possible to generate packets during the course of the rou t ing we have a dynamic rout ing problem. W h e n each node is the origin of at most hi packets and the dest inat ion of at most h2 packets, we have an (hi, h2)-routing (or many-to-many ) problem. In the case where hi = 1 and h2 :> 1 we have a many-to-one rout ing problem (many nodes send packets to one node); when hi -h2 -1 and the number of packets is (less t han or) equal to the number of nodes of the graph we have a (partial) permutation. The matching model was defined by Alon, Chung and G r a h a m when they s tudied the rout ing of pe rmuta t ions [1]. In the match ing model, each node initially holds exactly one packet and the only opera t ion allowed dur ing the rout ing is the exchange of the packets at the endpoints of an edge. The exchange of the packets at the endpoints of a set of disjoint edges can occur in a single rou t ing step. These edges are said to be active during the rou t ing step. W h e n a packet reaches its dest inat ion node it is not consumed. Instead, it cont inues to par t ic ipa te in the rout ing unti l the t ime all the packets in the graph s imul taneously reach their dest inat ion nodes. * The work of Dr Pantziou was partly supported by the EEC ESPRIT Projects GEPPCOM (contract No. 9072) and ALCOM IT.

A wireless network for indoor intrusion detection is based on several sensors that are deployed over the monitored area for detecting possible risky situations and triggering appropriate actions in response. The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application. A proprietary medium access control is developed based on the low-power SimpliciTI radio stack. Network performance is assessed by experimental measurements using a test-bed operating at 868MHz in an indoor office environment with severe multipath and non line-of-sight propagation conditions.	access control;communications protocol;experiment;home automation;intrusion detection system;line-of-sight (missile);low-power broadcasting;machine to machine;multipath propagation;network performance;prototype;real-time locating system;sensor;software propagation;testbed	Milo Spadacini;Stefano Savazzi;Monica Nicoli;S.

Testing of WSNs is challenging due to distributed functionality, lack of test and debug interfaces, and limited communication, computation and memory resources. This paper presents the design and implementation of a practical network monitoring and analysis tool for identifying the causes of misbehavior. The tool consists of a sniffer node that passively captures WSN traffic, and multiple user interfaces that can run e.g. on a PC or mobile phone. Unlike the related proposals, our tool neither needs setting up an additional monitoring network alongside the actual WSN nor uses any node resources. Practical testing experiences with mul-tihop mesh WSN deployments show that the tool reveals design and implementation defects that are hard to discover with other testing methods such as in-network monitoring systems or debug prints.	autonomous robot;computation;distributed computing;embedded system;mobile phone;user interface	Markku Hänninen;Jukka Suhonen;Timo Hämäläinen;Marko Hännikäinen	2011	Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Design & Architectures for Signal & Image Processing (DASIP)	10.1109/DASIP.2011.6136894	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;computer network	Mobile	5.91221790471822	71.49161631865303	94366

Importantly, the proposed methods apply even to best-effort NoC architectures, with no extra hardware dedicated to QoS support. By applying our methods to several realistic NoC designs, we show substantial improvements (on average, more than 30% in bandwidth and 50% in latency) in bound tightness with respect to existing approaches.	bandwidth (signal processing);best, worst and average case;best-effort delivery;network on a chip;quality of service;real-time computing	Dara Rahmati;Srinivasan Murali;Luca Benini;Federico Angiolini;Giovanni De Micheli;Hamid Sarbazi-Azad	2009	2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers	10.1145/1687399.1687507	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;operating system;network on a chip;computer network	EDA	1.5252270129186785	60.78010334973781	94537

It can also be used to significantly reduce the refresh power consumption without decreasing reliability and timing performance.	code word;column (database);dynamic random-access memory;ecc memory;elegant degradation;embedded system;encoder;error detection and correction;exclusive or;forward error correction;generator matrix;high bandwidth memory;interval arithmetic;overhead (computing);parity bit;parity-check matrix;program optimization;puncturing;qr code;redundancy (engineering);reed–solomon error correction;shadow volume;smart data compression;through-silicon via	Hsing Min Chen;Carole-Jean Wu;Trevor N.

The existing TTEthernet technology is developed for wired networks. A natural step for improving and extending the current application field is the introduction of a mixed wired and wireless network. However, this step requires research both about possible adaptation of existing systems as well as implementation of new technologies. A central research question is the security aspects of real-time sensor networks using wired and wireless technologies based on TTEthernet. In this paper, we identify and classify the most important aspects to consider in order to provide secure communications in such safety-critical industrial applications and propose a potential solution to address identified issues.	fault tolerance;real-time clock;real-time locating system;secure communication	Elena Lisova;Elisabeth Uhlemann;Johan Åkerberg;Mats Björkman	2014	Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Emerging Technology and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2014.7005310	embedded system;communications protocol;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;information security;automation;computer security;communications system;wireless;computer network	Embedded	5.984459318643097	72.81837244176343	94590

The results show the instant and average current consumption of the devices during the execution of these applications. The experimental measurements provide a good insight into the power mode in which the device components are running at every moment, and they can be used to compare the performance of different operating systems executing the same tasks.	benchmark (computing);contiki;mantis;operating system;tinyos;executing - querystatuscode	J.

Previous results, which use either fault-tolerant embedding or an automorphism approach, can be expensive in terms of either the required number of spare nodes or reconfiguration time. Using the free dimension concept, we combine the above two approaches in our schemes which can tolerate about n faulty nodes under the worst case while keeping task migration time small. With expansion-2 initial embedding, three distributed reconfiguration schemes are presented in this paper. The first scheme, applied to chains and rings, can tolerate any ? ? n ? 2 faulty nodes in an n-dimensional hypercube. The second and third schemes are applied to meshes or tori. For a mesh or torus of size 2m1 ? ··· ? 2md, the second scheme can tolerate any ? ? mi ? 1 faulty nodes, where mi is the largest direction of the mesh and n = m1 + ··· + md + 1. By embedding two copies of meshes or tori in cube, the third scheme can tolerate any ? ? n ? 1 faulty nodes with the dilation of embedding after reconfiguration degraded to 2. The third scheme is quite general and can be applied to any task graph.		Pei-Ji Yang;Sing-Ban Tien;Cauligi S. Raghavendra	1994	J. Parallel Distrib.

All packets have unit size and arrive from the exterior according to independent batch Bernoulli arrival processes. The service discipline of each node is work-conserving and the service discipline of node 0 has to be HoL-based, which is an additional assumption that is satisfied by, a.o., mi-limited service, exhaustive service, and priority disciplines. Let a type i packet be a packet that visits queue i of node 0. We establish a distributional relation between the number of type i packets in the network and in a single station system, and we show equality of the mean end-to-end delay of type i packets in the two systems. Essentially this reduces an arbitrary tree network to a much simpler system of one node, while preserving the mean end-to-end delay of type i packets.	approximation;bernoulli polynomials;end-to-end principle;network packet;polling (computer science);routing;server (computing);tag (game);tree network	Paul Beekhuizen;Dee Denteneer;Jacques Resing	2008	Queueing Syst.	10.1007/s11134-008-9071-z	ring network;discrete time and continuous time;polling system;real-time computing;computer science;end-to-end delay;mathematics;distributed computing;node;queueing theory;reduction;queuing delay;statistics;computer network	Metrics	3.6134088275516345	69.45603800994247	95784

In this paper we present a low overhead solution to improving the reliability of commodity DRAM systems with no change in the existing memory architecture. Specifically, we propose five erasure and error correction (E-ECC) schemes that provide at least Chipkill-Correct protection for x4 (Schemes 1, 2 and 3), x8 (Scheme 4) and x16 (Scheme 5) DRAM systems. All schemes have superior error correction performance due to the use of strong symbol-based codes. Synthesis results in 28 nm node show that the decoding latency of these codes is negligible compared to the DRAM access latency. In addition, we make use of erasure codes to extend the lifetime of the DRAM systems. Specifically, once a chip is marked faulty due to persistent errors, all E-ECC schemes correct erasures due to that faulty chip and also correct an additional random error in a second chip. Evaluation with SPEC2006 workloads show that compared to x4 Chipkill-Correct schemes, Scheme 5 has the highest IPC improvement (mean of 7 percent) and Scheme 4 has the largest power reduction (mean of 18 percent) and the largest increase in energy efficiency (mean of 25 percent).	chipkill;dynamic random-access memory;erasure code;error detection and correction;overhead (computing);qr code;server (computing)	Hsing Min Chen;Supreet Jeloka;Akhil Arunkumar;David Blaauw;Carole-Jean Wu;Trevor N.

In the modern manycore system, mesh based Networks-on-Chip (NoC) is widely adopted as on chip communication infrastructure. It is critical to provide an effective fault tolerance scheme on mesh based NoC. A faulty router or broken link isolates a well functional processing element (PE). Also, a set of faulty routers form faulty regions which may break down the whole design. To address these issues, we propose an innovative router-level fault tolerance scheme with spare routers which is different from the traditional microarchitecture-level approach. The spare routers not only provide redundancies but also diversify connection paths between adjacent routers. To exploit these valuable resources on fault tolerant capabilities, two configuration algorithms are demonstrated. One is shift-and-replace-allocation (SARA) and the other is defect-awareness-path-allocation (DAPA) that takes advantage of path diversity in our architecture. The proposed design is transparent to any routing algorithm since the output topology is consistent to the original mesh. Experimental results show that our scheme has remarkable improvements on fault tolerant metrics including reliability, mean time to failure (MTTF), and yield. In addition, the performance of spare router increases with the growth of NoC size but the relative connection cost decreases at the same time. This rare and valuable characteristic makes our solution suitable for large scale NoC design.	bitap algorithm;dependability;fault tolerance;manycore processor;mean time between failures;microarchitecture;multi-core processor;network on a chip;router (computing);routing;software bug;speaker wire;system on a chip;very-large-scale integration	Yung-Chang Chang;Ching-Te Chiu;Shih-Yin Lin;Chung-Kai Liu	2011	16th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2011)		fault tolerance;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;network on a chip;computer network	EDA	4.116409451437221	61.26390049611339	95981

Side-Channel Attacks (SCA) exploit the information such as power consumption, electromagnetic radiation and acoustic leaking through the device to uncover the secret information. Attackers can mount successful attacks with very modest resources in a short time period. Therefore, many methods have been proposed to increase the security against SCA. Randomizing the execution order of the instructions that are independent, i.e., random shuffling, is one of the most popular among them. Implementing instruction shuffling in software is either implementation specific or has a significant performance or code size overhead. To overcome these problems, we propose in this work a generic custom hardware unit to implement random instruction shuffling as an extension to existing processors. The unit operates between the CPU and the instruction cache (or memory, if no cache exists), without any modification to these components. Both true and pseudo random number generators are used to dynamically and locally provide the shuffling sequence. The unit is mainly designed for in-order processors, since the embedded devices subject to these kind of attacks use simple in-order processors. More advanced processors (e.g., superscalar, VLIW or EPIC processors) are already more resistant to these attacks because of their built-in ILP and wide word size. Our experiments on two different soft in-order processor cores, i.e., OpenRISC and MicroBlaze, implemented on FPGA show that the proposed unit could increase the security drastically with very modest resource overhead. With around 2% area, 1.5% power and no performance overhead, the shuffler increases the effort to mount a successful power analysis attack on AES software implementation over 360 times.	acoustic cryptanalysis;built-in self-test;central processing unit;cryptography;embedded system;experiment;field-programmable gate array;high- and low-level;openrisc;out-of-order execution;overhead (computing);pseudorandomness;random number generation;side-channel attack;smart card;superscalar processor	Ali Galip Bayrak;Nikola Velickovic;Paolo Ienne;Wayne P.

The method is suited to hardware implementation using parallelism to achieve a very short execution time. This allows path allocation to be performed anew in each time slot. A detailed description of the necessary hardware is presented. This hardware counts the number of cells requesting each output module, allocates a path through the intermediate stage of the switch to each cell, and generates a routing tag for each cell, indicating the path assigned to it.	atm turbo;network switch;parallel computing;routing;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Martin Collier;Thomas Curran	1993		10.1109/INFCOM.1993.253274	crossover switch;electronic circuit;routing;real-time computing;fast path;network switch;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;software testing;bandwidth;computer network	HPC	-0.6148928738280025	62.182511495850655	96704

The goal is to maximize the Value of Information (VoI) for WSN users. We discuss three different levels of WSN architecture. The lowest level focuses on individual nodes and their basic functions of sensing and routing. We give an example showing how the use of auctions at individual nodes can help to efficiently perform these functions. The middle level focuses on services that are abstractions of applications running on sensors. Complex applications are composed automatically from basic ones. We discuss the use of switch options to address some of the challenges arising in such dynamic service composition. Finally, we consider the highest level - network deployment and sharing - and conjecture that options may be valuable in creating proper incentives for rational deployment and sharing of WSNs.	network congestion;routing;sensor;sensor node;service composability principle;software deployment	Boleslaw K.

These architectures must be controlled by a packet scheduling algorithm, which solves contentions in the transfer of data units to switch outputs. Several scheduling algorithms were proposed in the literature for switches operating on ®xed-size data units. In this paper we consider the case of packet switches, i.e., devices operating on variable-size data units at their interfaces, but internally operating on ®xed-size data units, and we propose novel extensions of known scheduling algorithms for input queued and combined input/output-queued architectures. We show by simulation that, in the case of packet switches, input queued and combined input/output-queued architectures can provide performance advantages over output-queued architec-tures. 1. Background: input vs. output-queued switches A key component of a packet network is the switching node: switches in Ethernet LANs, ATM switches in the B-ISDN, IP routers in the Internet. Given the diversity of user applications and the ever-growing bandwidth demands, nodes must keep increasing their performance and improving their ability to contribute to the provision of quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. In the recent past, signi®cant research eorts were devoted by both the academic and the industrial communities to the design of ecient ATM switches for the B-ISDN [2]. Those research activities initially concentrated on issues related to the design of the switching fabric (i.e., of the part of the switch that is in charge of the transfer of data units from input to output line interfaces) normally assuming an output-queued architecture. More recently, much attention was paid to the design of input/output interfaces (or line cards), with the development of ecient table look-up schemes to implement label swapping and routing algorithms [3±5], and of fair queueing	atm turbo;algorithm;fair queuing;heuristic;input/output;integrated services digital network;internet;lookup table;maximal set;network congestion;network packet;network switch;packet switching;paging;quality of service;router (computing);routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;switched fabric	Marco Ajmone Marsan;Andrea Bianco;Paolo Giaccone;Emilio Leonardi;Fabio Neri	2001	Computer Networks	10.1016/S1389-1286(01)00228-6	real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Networks	-4.384724874672064	65.736351894989	97091

Deployment of sensor networks to monitor physical environment is one of the most important applications for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In this paper, we model and simulate flood monitor case in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Using OMNET++ simulator , we employ Direct Diffusion DD routing protocol to operate flood case.. We first have developed one of the well-known sensor network protocols which is DD. Then, we evaluate the performance of our simulated case by computing several statistics including power consumption, end-to-end delay, throughput to measure the availability and scalability of the network and decide the best possible configuration that well monitor our case. Our results determined that the best sensor network configuration for flood monitor system in the area of interest is 135 sensors with memory capacity of 80 to 120 message entries.

Sensor nodes range around a few millimeters or smaller in size [11, 12]. Sensor nodes have low processing, memory and wireless communication capabilities. Processor and bus clock speeds of a few Mhzs, RAM sizes of a few KB, flash memory sizes of a few MB, and wireless bandwidths of a few hundred Kbps are typical [14, 15]. These ranges are often determined by application domain constraints such as cost, power consumption, and deployment space. Thus, they are likely to stay in spite of improvements in fabrication techniques. For example, retinal sensor sizes depend on ganglial nerve separation [11]. Space limits on the wireless antenna restricts maximum frequency and range of transmission. Availability of power is limited due to the difficulty or impossibility of recharging nodes in inhospitable terrains, e.g., military applications [12]. On the other hand, sensor nodes are becoming easier to produce in large numbers [14, 15]. An autonomous system consisting of a large number of sensor nodes deployed over an area and integrated to collaborate through a network (wireless or wired) network, would encourage several novel as well as existing applications. Examples include high fidelity image processing in retinal prosthesis chips [11], battlefield applications such as vehicle tracking, environmental observation and forecasting systems (EOFS) [13], etc.	application domain;autonomous system (internet);data rate units;flash memory;holism;image processing;image sensor format;microprocessor;peer-to-peer;random-access memory;semiconductor device fabrication;sensor node;smart transducer;software deployment;vehicle tracking system;visual prosthesis	Indranil Gupta;Kenneth P.

Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) has attracted more attentions nowadays. Benes topology is a good choice for ONoC for its rearrangeable non-blocking character, multistage feature and easy scalability. Routing algorithm plays an important role in determining the performance of ONoC. But traditional routing algorithms for Benes network are not suitable for ONoC communication, we developed a new distributed routing algorithm for Benes ONoC in this paper. Our algorithm selected the routing path dynamically according to network condition and enables more path choices for the message traveling in the network. We used OPNET to evaluate the performance of our routing algorithm and also compared it with a well-known bit-controlled routing algorithm. ETE delay and throughput were showed under different packet length and network sizes. Simulation results show that our routing algorithm can provide better performance for ONoC.	blocking (computing);clos network;dijkstra's algorithm;multistage interconnection networks;network on a chip;network packet;non-blocking algorithm;optical network on chip;optical interconnect;routing;scalability;simulation;throughput	Jing Zhang;Huaxi Gu;Yingtang Yang	2011	CoRR		chip;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;scalability;network architecture;telecommunications;image processing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;hardware architecture;network on a chip;link-state routing protocol;algorithm;optical communication	Networks	1.393085289339933	64.27987010168795	97979

These circuits are commonly referred to as residue computing circuits (RCCs). As ECCs originated primarily to protect data transfers over binary channels, their design methodology has been mostly oriented towards a binary case. A non-binary design technique has only been considered for a special type of compaction modulus. In this work, we consider a design technique for a multiple-bit arithmetic compaction circuit with an arbitrary compaction modulus. It is assumed that the data being compacted are fuzzy. This in turn distorts the result of compaction increasing the aliasing rate. Even though the fault free system's distortion is small, the compaction circuit may aggravate it beyond the acceptable levels making the method impractical. We design a low cost compactor that does not increase the distortion. The circuit can be used for off-line and on-line mixed-signal testing, as well as fault-tolerant data processing and noise-tolerant data transmission.	aliasing;data compaction;digital signature;distortion;fault tolerance;least significant bit;mixed-signal integrated circuit;modelsim;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;online and offline;simulation	Vadim Geurkov	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)	10.1109/DFT.2012.6378221	reliability engineering;compaction;fault tolerance;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;theoretical computer science;software testing;very-large-scale integration;adder	Arch	9.626429043330306	62.33432530787538	98205

A Berger code is a special member of this proposed class of codes where each output bit is assigned a weight of one. This paper describes the application of these codes for the efficient on-line error detection of arbitrary multilevel circuits. The overall probability of detecting any number of erroneous bits at the output caused by a single internal fault is shown to be higher for weightbased codes than standard error detecting codes. Further, a very efficient design exists for the checker. The checker is area and speed efficient, has low power consumption, and can be tested by a small set of incoming code words. There is always a tradeoff between the fault detection capability and area overhead requirement of an error detecting code. Weight-based codes present a controlled way of increasing the number of check bits to achieve a desired fault detection capability.	berger code;code word;error detection and correction;fault detection and isolation;online and offline;overhead (computing);parity bit;sensor	Debaleena Das;Nur A.

However, the performance of these parallel simulators could be severely degraded if proper synchronization algorithms are not utilized. In this paper, we compare the performance and scalability of synchronous and asynchronous algorithms for conservative parallel network simulation. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of certain variations of the well-known null message algorithm, and present experimental data to verify the accuracy of this model. This analysis and initial performance measurements on parallel machines containing hundreds of processors suggest that for scenarios simulating scaled network models with constant number of input and output channels per logical process, an optimized null message algorithm offers better scalability than efficient global reduction based synchronous protocols.	algorithm;central processing unit;input/output;parallel computing;router (computing);scalability;simulation;telecommunications network;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alfred Park;Richard M.

The network topology or the notion of connectedness among the network nodes defines the system communication architecture and is an important design consideration for fault tolerant systems. A number of fault tolerant designs for specific multi-processor architecture exists in the literature, but none of them discriminates between stateless and stateful failover. In this paper, we propose a reliable network topology and a high availability framework which is tolerant up to a maximum of k node faults in a network and is designed specifically to meet the needs of stateful failover. Assuming the nodes in the network are capable of handling multiple processes, through our design we have been able to prove that in the event of k node failures the load can be uniformly distributed across the network - ensuring load balance.

When routing locality is exploited, it enables the internal crossbar of a router to be partitioned into smaller and faster units without sacrificing true-fully-adaptive routing capabilities. Extensive evaluation of partitioned crossbar designs which exploit routing locality shows that the increased adaptivity offered by deadlock recovery-based routing algorithms can be implemented in routers without sacrificing router speed. The partitioned crossbar designs reduce average message latency by up to 65% and increase maximum network throughput by up to 51%.		Yungho Choi;Timothy Mark Pinkston	2001	J. Parallel Distrib.

Wireless sensor networks are attractive to remote power line monitoring, due to their rare geography restrictions, simple engineering design, and flexible equipment expansion. Considering the ZigBee’s characteristic of low transmission rate, almost commercial sensors adopt the high-speed communication, such as Cellular and WiFi, to implement the real-time wireless monitoring. However, among all wireless technologies, ZigBee, characterizing high security, ultra-low power consumption, reliable network, low cost, and ease of design, is widely used in many industries. This paper proposes a new ZigBee-based communication for multifunctional electronic current transformers (ECTs), which are used in overhead and underground line monitoring. To tackle ZigBee’s low transmission rate, the proposed method involving a transmission strategy can make the ZigBee-based communication satisfy both measurable and protective purposes of multifunctional ECTs. Finally, the new ZigBee-based wireless communication is implemented and integrated with an ECT, which is based on the coreless Hall-effect current transformer (HCT), and the proposed ZigBee-based wireless multifunctional HCT is called ZiHCT. The measurement results show that the ZiHCT can achieve accuracy not only to Class 0.5 for measuring CTs, but also to Class 5P20 for protective CTs according to IEC standard 60044-8.	electroconvulsive therapy;engineering design process;hall effect;multi-function printer;overhead (computing);real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);sensor;transformer;transformers;waveform;windows hardware certification kit	Kun-Long Chen;Yan-Ru Chen;Yuan-Pin Tsai;Nanming Chen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2015.2510325	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	7.048645974489678	71.56100427345325	99206

We perform an analytical evaluation and comparison of different configurable interconnect architectures (mesh NoC, tree, shared bus and point-to-point) emulating variants of two neural network topologies (having full and random exponential configurable connectivity). We derive analytical expressions and asymptotic limits for performance (in terms of bandwidth) and cost (in terms of area and power) of the interconnect architectures considering three communication methods (unicast, multicast and broadcast). It is shown that multicast mesh NoC provides the highest performance/cost ratio and consequently it is the most suitable interconnect architecture for configurable neural network implementation.

85865c36290e4541bbc3f8cece3a1ff4043d99f4	towards lightweight error detection schemes for implementations of mixcolumns in lightweight cryptography		In this paper, through considering lightweight cryptography, we present a comparative realization of MDS matrices used in the VLSI implementations of lightweight cryptography. We verify the MixColumn/MixNibble transformation using MDS matrices and propose reliability approaches for thwarting natural and malicious faults. We note that one other contribution of this work is to consider not only linear error detecting codes but also recomputation mechanisms as well as fault space transformation (FST) adoption for lightweight cryptographic algorithms. Our intention in this paper is to propose reliability and error detection mechanisms (through linear codes, recomputations, and FST adopted for lightweight cryptography) to consider the error detection schemes in designing beforehand taking into account such algorithmic security. We also posit that the MDS matrices applied in the MixColumn (or MixNibble) transformation of ciphers to protect ciphers against linear and differential attacks should be incorporated in the cipher design in order to reduce the overhead of the applied error detection schemes. Finally, we present a comparative implementation framework on ASIC to benchmark the VLSI hardware implementation presented in this paper.	algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;benchmark (computing);byte;cipher;code;cryptography;differential cryptanalysis;differential fault analysis;error detection and correction;fault injection;fault model;mds matrix;overhead (computing);sbcs;sensor;throughput;very-large-scale integration	Anita Aghaie;Mehran Mozaffari Kermani;Reza Azarderakhsh	2018	CoRR		application-specific integrated circuit;theoretical computer science;cipher;error detection and correction;very-large-scale integration;implementation;cryptography;computer science;matrix (mathematics)	Crypto	9.877282117266663	63.09966718355771	100570

Moreover, the algorithm has been applied to automatic speech recognition and storage devices. In this paper, efficient error detection schemes for architectures based on low-latency, low-complexity Viterbi decoders are presented. The merit of the proposed schemes is that reliability requirements, overhead tolerance, and performance degradation limits are embedded in the structures and can be adapted accordingly. We also present three variants of recomputing with encoded operands and its modifications to detect both transient and permanent faults, coupled with signature-based schemes. The instrumented decoder architecture has been subjected to extensive error detection assessments through simulations, and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) [32 nm library] and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) [Xilinx Virtex-6 family] implementations for benchmark.

In the fault-tolerant 2D-MNoCs, fault-tolerant deadlock-free routing control without assistance of hardware (such as lookup table and virtual channel) is desirable due to simple router architecture, low power consumption and easy fault diagnosis. For such fault-tolerant 2D-MNoCs, existing task mapping methods are not efficient because task assignment process and route decision process, which are closely interdependent, are performed separately. In this paper, we propose a new route-aware task mapping method based on a generic algorithm. Our method considers the effect of overlapped routing paths provided by a fault-tolerant routing control in assigning tasks to nodes and obtains a quasi-optimal solution by the genetic algorithm. Experimental study compares overall performances of our method with a random mapping method under the random and cluster fault models, and shows that our method consistently leads to reduction in the total execution time of mapped applications.	computer simulation;deadlock;deterministic routing;fault model;fault tolerance;generic programming;genetic algorithm;interdependence;lookup table;mesh networking;network congestion;performance;router (computing);run time (program lifecycle phase);software release life cycle;throughput;virtual channel	Hiroshi Kutami;Yusuke Fukushima;Masaru Fukushi;Ikuko Eguchi Yairi;Takeshi Hattori	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems	10.1109/DFT.2011.61	parallel computing;real-time computing;genetic algorithm;computer science;distributed computing;network on a chip	Embedded	2.4503910443217105	64.8035827258687	100838
7836eb9d8475de85e13a851bfcbaf1344583b87d	a photonic-based sensor data distribution approach for a real-time multi-processor system		Reaching the physical boundaries of the electronics-based communication approach has enabled photonic-based systems, which promise high-bandwidth and low power consumption, especially in multiprocessor systems, to be an alternative to electronic systems on chips. Real-time systems are specialized systems where tasks that cannot be completed in time cause high costs, and particularly communication with sensors and actuators have high importance. In this study, a sensor data distribution model is presented for multi-processor real-time systems that communicate with the photonic network on the chip. The study provides the distribution of the sensor data to the processors on the chip with the photonic infrastructure, and the results show that the proposed model is an effective approach for real-time systems.	multiprocessing;real-time clock;real-time computing	Larnee Flannery;Kayhan M.

Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) offer this scalability and other advantages like modularity, quality-of-service (QoS), possibly smaller area footprint and lower power dissipation. Although many papers describe the advantages of NoCs and describe techniques to apply NoCs on certain application domains, few have actually employed the complete design chain to make a netlist level implementation and area comparison (Steenhof et al., 2006) and (Angiolini et al., 2006).

Through arbitrating the acknowledgement signals of virtual channels, the virtual channels can attend the arbitration–allocation process actively. Thus reduces the virtual channel allocation time. Furthermore, the proposed multi-resource arbiter has integrated the function of virtual channel allocation, which improves the performance and simplifies the design process simultaneously. Null convention logic units are used to make the circuit quasi-delay insensitive and high robustness. The proposed multi-resource arbiter is implemented based on SMIC 0.18 μm standard CMOS technology. Results have shown that the arbitration–allocation time of the arbiter is only 824.1 ps, which reduced 25.1% compared with the conventional one. The power consumption and the area are slightly larger than the conventional ones. The proposed high speed multi-resource arbiter is suitable for high performance and high robustness interconnections of on chip networks.	arbiter (electronics);virtual channel	Xuguang Guan;Zhangming Zhu;Duan Zhou;Yingtang Yang	2010	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126610006931	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;asynchronous circuit;computer science;engineering;network on a chip	EDA	2.911480125832908	61.86970097397637	101676

Xu Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures have been adopted by chip multi-processors (CMPs) as a flexible solution to the increasing delay in the deep sub-micron regime. However, the shrinking feature size limits the performance of NoCs due to power and area constraints. In this paper, we propose three 3D floorplanning methods for a Triplet-based Hierarchical Interconnection Network (THIN) which is a new high performance NoC. The proposed floorplanning methods use both Manhattan and Y-architecture routing architectures so as to improve the performance, reduce the power consumption and area requirement of THIN. A cycle accurate simulator was developed based on Noxim NoC simulator and ORION 2.0 energy model. The proposed floorplanning methods show up to 24.69% energy and 8.84% area reduction at best compared with 3D Mesh. Our analysis concludes that THIN is not only a feasible but also a low-power and area-efficient NoC at physical level. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The patterns we consider are anomalous temporal correlations between signals recorded at sensor nodes in a network. We use robust matrix completion and second order analysis to detect distributed patterns that are not discernible at the level of individual sensors. When viewed independently, the data at each node cannot provide a definitive determination of the underlying pattern, but when fused with data from across the network the relevant patterns emerge. We are specifically interested in detecting weak patterns in computer networks where the nodes (terminals, routers, servers, etc.) are sensors that provide measurements (of packet rates, user activity, central processing unit usage, etc.). The approach is applicable to many other types of sensor networks including wireless networks, mobile sensor networks, and social networks where correlated phenomena are of interest.	algorithm;central processing unit;network packet;router (computing);sensor;signal processing;social network	Philip du Toit;Ryan Nong;Louis L.

In addition, destinations remain fixed over a larger number of steps in the proposed algorithms, thus making them amenable to optimizations. Finally, the data structures used are simple, hence making substantial savings of message-rearrangement time.

Current electronic network-on-chip (NoC) designs face serious challenges, such as bandwidth, latency and power consumption. Optical interconnection networks are a promising technology to overcome these problems. In this paper, we study the routing problem in optical NoCs with arbitrary network topologies. Traditionally, a minimum hop count routing policy is employed for electronic NoCs, as it minimizes both power consumption and latency. However, due to the special architecture of current optical NoC routers, such a minimum-hop path may not be energy-wise optimal. Using a detailed model of optical routers we reduce the energyaware routing problem into a shortest-path problem,which can then be solved using one of themanywell known techniques. By applying our approach to different popular topologies, we show that the energy consumed in data communication in an optical NoC can be significantly reduced. We also propose the use of optical burst switching (OBS) in optical NoCs to reduce control overhead, as well as an adaptive routing mechanism to reduce energy consumption without introducing extra latency. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Being the major data holding component in contemporary microprocessors, the register file has been an important part of the processor on which researchers offered many different schemes to protect against soft errors. In this paper we build on the previously proposed schemes and start with the observation that many register values already have a replica inside the storage space. We use this already available redundancy inside the register file in combination with a previously proposed value replication scheme for soft error detection and correction. We show that, by employing schemes that make use of the already available copies of the values inside the register file, it is possible to detect and correct 39.0 percent of the errors with an additional power consumption of 18.9 percent.	approximation error;bit error rate;digital electronics;error detection and correction;microprocessor;overhead (computing);pointer (computer programming);rdm;register file;soft error	Abdulaziz Eker;Oguz Ergin	2016	IEEE Computer Architecture Letters	10.1109/LCA.2015.2435705	benchmark;parallel computing;real-time computing;error detection and correction;soft error;computer hardware;computer science;operating system;reliability;microcomputer;processor register;register file	Arch	7.26819777720146	61.118107199219615	102353

The platform targets streaming DSP and embedded applications that have a high degree of task-level parallelism among computational kernels. The test chip was fabricated in 65nm CMOS consisting of 164 simple small programmable cores, three dedicated-purpose accelerators and three shared memory modules. All processors are clocked by their own local oscillators and communication is achieved through a simple yet effective source-synchronous communication technique that allows each interconnection link between any two processors to sustain a peak throughput of one data word per cycle. A complete 802.11a WLAN baseband receiver was implemented on this platform. It has a real-time throughput of 54 Mbps with all processors running at 594 MHz and 0.95 V, and consumes an average 174.76 mW with 12.18 mW (or 7.0%) dissipated by its interconnection links. We can fully utilize the benefit of the GALS architecture and by adjusting each processor's oscillator to run at a workload-based optimal clock frequency with the chip's dual supply voltages set at 0.95 V and 0.75 V, the receiver consumes only 123.18 mW, a 29.5% in power reduction. Measured results of its power consumption on the real chip come within the difference of only 2-5% compared with the estimated results showing our design to be highly reliable and efficient.	baseband;cmos;central processing unit;circuit switching;clock rate;dimm;data rate units;digital signal processor;embedded system;interconnection;manycore processor;network on a chip;oscillator (cellular automaton);parallel computing;real-time clock;shared memory;source-synchronous;task parallelism;throughput	Anh Thien Tran;Dean Nguyen Truong;Bevan M.

If knowing the loss model of a link, we, in fact, deal with a parametric estimate problem with incomplete data. Maximum likelihood estimates are often used in this situation to identify the unknown parameters in the loss model. Almost all methods proposed so far rely on the iterative approximation to identify the parameters that requires a long execution time. In addition, the parameters identified by those methods may not be the true values of those parameters since the iterative procedure may trap into a local maximum. In this paper, we propose an estimate that is based on the correlation between a link and its sibling brothers to identify the loss rate of the link. The proposed method, instead of using an iterative approach to approximate the maximum, employs a bottom-up approach to identify the loss rates of the links of a network. Comparing to the previous methods, the proposed method is simple and fast because it is an analytical solution. q 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.	approximation algorithm;bottom-up parsing;end-to-end principle;feasible region;iterative method;local optimum;maxima and minima;multicast;network topology;rapid refresh;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;tomography;top-down and bottom-up design	Weiping Zhu;Zhi Geng	2005	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2004.08.014	closed-form expression;network tomography;expectation–maximization algorithm;top-down and bottom-up design;iterative method;maximum likelihood;statistics;data collection	Metrics	-1.7741635321016442	74.44629889494827	102903

It has appeared a great potential in numerous industrial applications. In this paper a wireless sensor network based on ZigBee protocol for the measurement system in grain storage was developed and tested as an alternative to the cable system, which showed better efficiencies of the cost and time in the installation and maintenance than a cable system. Based on above study a new ZigBee sensornode was built to measure the grain temperature and the temperature, moisture and pressure drop of the air through a bulk grain system.

A wireless sensor network consists of large numbers of sensors, which are tiny, low-cost, low-power radio devices dedicated to performing certain functions such as collecting various environmental data and sending them to infrastructure processing nodes. The field of wireless sensor networking is also gaining greater interest among not only researchers but also diverse groups such as environmental, public safety, medicine, and military. This tutorial starts with an overview of the wireless sensor networks. A review of the current technologies used for these types of wireless networks is provided next.

In this paper, we propose a new mesh of trees (MoT) implementation of the interconnection network and evaluate it relative to metrics such as wire complexity, total register count, single switch delay, maximum throughput, tradeoffs between throughput and latency, and post-layout performance. We show that on-chip interconnection networks can provide higher bandwidth between processors and shared first-level cache than previously considered possible, facilitating greater scalability of memory architectures that require that. MoT is also compared, both analytically and experimentally, to some other traditional network topologies, such as hypercube, butterfly, fat trees and butterfly fat trees. When we evaluate a 64-terminal MoT network at 90-nm technology, concrete results show that MoT provides higher throughput and lower latency especially when the input traffic (or the on-chip parallelism) is high, at comparable area. A recurring problem in networking and communication is that of achieving good sustained throughput in contrast to just high theoretical peak performance that does not materialize for typical work loads. Our quantitative results demonstrate a clear advantage of the proposed MoT network in the context of single-chip parallel processing.	32-bit;bbn butterfly;brainfuck;cpu cache;central processing unit;cray xmt;data rate units;experiment;file allocation table;grid network;heuristic;high-throughput computing;interconnection;maximum throughput scheduling;memory architecture;memory hierarchy;multiprocessing;network architecture;network topology;parallel computing;pipeline (computing);processor register;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;simulation;system on a chip;systems architecture;tape-out;verilog;virtual channel;wire wrap	Aydin O.

A high-level model of the space (area) and time (delay) requirements for these networks is developed and relative performance comparisons are made based on a space-time product measure. The results differ significantly from those obtained with more traditional analyses which are usually based on switch aggregate comparisons and SSI-based delay calculations. The analysis presented shows that the area required by both networks grows as 0(N2). Time delay grows as 0(N) for the crossbar, and approximately 0[ Na(log2N)2] for the banyan where 0 < a < 1. This contrasts with traditional results which yield 0(N log N) and 0(log N) switch and delay growth for banyan networks.	aggregate data;apollonian network;circuit switching;communications protocol;crossbar switch;high- and low-level;requirement;telecommunications network;very-large-scale integration	Mark A.

In this paper, we propose a new NoC architecture, referred as the Quartered Recursive Diagonal Torus (QRDT), which is constructed by overlaying diagonal torus. Due to its small diameter and rich routing recourses, QRDT is determined to be well suitable to construct highly scalable NoCs.  In QRDT, data packets can be routed through a proposed minimal routing algorithm based on the Johnson codes that have traditionally been used in finite state machine designs. It has been shown that this proposed routing algorithm with minor modifications is capable of handling the single link/node failure. The hardware cost of the proposed QRDT architecture and its associated routing algorithm is revealed by designing two QRDT routers which have been synthesized using TSMC 0.18¼m CMOS technology.	algorithm;cmos;code;complex system;fault tolerance;finite-state machine;network on a chip;network packet;recursion (computer science);routing;scalability;system on a chip	Xianfang Tan;Lei Zhang;Shankar Neelkrishnan;Mei Yang;Yingtao Jiang;Yulu Yang	2008		10.1145/1366110.1366184	chip;embedded system;fault tolerance;electronic engineering;static routing;parallel computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;network operations center;network on a chip;intellectual property;computer network	EDA	0.53901868384035	67.94997953011841	103894

RFnest™ is the first network emulator that allows virtual simulated nodes and real RF nodes to interact and have a shared wireless feeling. In other words, the real RF nodes in RFnest™ receive the signals sent by the virtual simulated nodes on their real radios and vice versa. This capability allows both high fidelity and scalable network simulation and emulation within the same controlled and repeatable environment. This allows RFnest™ to be used for protocol testing, replaying field tests, and model validation. RFnest™ has a modular design with three main components: 1) FPGA based emulation hardware with RF front ends to allow nodes with real radios to send their RF signal over an emulated channel without any modification to the radio, 2) modeling of time-varying channel impulse responses within the emulation hardware, with channel properties based on mobility defined with a scripted or interactive GUI environment, and 3) integration with network emulators and monitoring functionality allowing the user to instantiate, manage, and monitor real and virtual network nodes within the scenario.	communications protocol;emulator;field-programmable gate array;graphical user interface;interference (communication);modular design;radio frequency;scalability;simulation;system integrity	Justin Yackoski;Babak Azimi-Sadjadi;Ali Namazi;Jason H.

Because of the impracticality of calculating all terminal network reliability for networks of moderate to large size, Monte Carlo simulation methods to estimate network reliability and upper and lower bounds to bound reliability have been used as alternatives. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to estimate all-terminal network reliability for networks with both homogeneous link reliability. Two forms of design methods for generating training data sets for networks with homogeneous and heterogeneous link reliability are compared. These experimental design and randomized design.

The main theoretical contributions are (a) design of new wormhole algorithms using store-and-forward algorithms, (b) a sufficient condition for deadlock free routing by the wormhole algorithms so designed, and (c) a sufficient condition for deadlock free routing by these wormhole algorithms with centralized flit buffers shared among multiple channels. To illustrate the theory, several wormhole algorithms based on store-and-forward hop schemes are designed. The hop-based wormhole algorithms can be applied to a variety of networks including torus, mesh, de Brujin, and a class of Cayley networks, with the best known bounds on virtual channels for minimal routing on the last two classes of networks. An analysis of the resource requirements and performances of a proposed algorithm, called negative-hop algorithm, with some of the previously proposed algorithms for torus and mesh networks is presented.	algorithm;centralized computing;deadlock;emoticon;magma;mesh networking;network topology;performance;requirement;routing;store and forward	Rajendra V.

Like conventional memories, a CAM can be affected by the occurrence of single event upsets (SEUs) that can alter the content of one of more memory cells causing different effects such as pseudo-HIT or pseudo-MISS events. It is well known that, because of the parallel search performed by a CAM during the query of a word, a standard error correction code could not defend it against SEU events. In this paper, we propose a method that does not require any modification to a CAM's internal structure and, therefore, can be easily applied at system level. Error detection is performed by using a probabilistic structure called """"Bloom filter,&#x201D; which can signal if a given data is present in the CAM. Bloom filters permit to efficiently store and query the presence of data in a set. But, while a CAM suffers from SEU induced errors, the probabilistic nature of Bloom filters has as a consequence the so called false-positive effect. This paper shows that, by combining the use of a Bloom filter with a CAM, the complementary limitations of these modules can be compensated. The combined use of a CAM and a Bloom filter is analyzed in different cases, showing that the proposed technique can be implemented with a low penalty in terms of area and power consumption."""	algorithm;bloom filter;content-addressable memory;error detection and correction;experiment;microprocessor;parity bit;simulation;single event upset;static random-access memory;translation lookaside buffer	Salvatore Pontarelli;Marco Ottavi;Adelio Salsano	2010	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/DFT.2010.56	parallel computing;real-time computing;error detection and correction;computer hardware;computer science;statistics;computer-aided manufacturing	Visualization	8.489576784351366	61.15881578636893	104657

We refer to the mode as pipelined SCFB mode or PSCFB. In this paper, we consider the implementation characteristics and show that PSCFB is able to achieve speeds that are very close to pipelined block cipher implementations configured for counter mode. Such speeds are achieved with modest latency through the system and a small amount of memory required for the system queues with a provable guarantee of no queue overflow. Further, we examine the characteristics of PSCFB mode in response to bit errors and synchronization losses in the communication channel. Specifically, we show that the error propagation factor is modest and comparable to conventional SCFB and that synchronization recovery delay is reasonable given the expectation that synchronization loss is infrequent. Given the high efficiency and good communication characteristics of the mode, it is concluded that PSCFB is an excellent choice for high-speed network applications requiring stream-oriented encryption with self-synchronizing capabilities.	block cipher mode of operation;channel (communications);encryption;pipeline (computing);propagation of uncertainty;provable prime;software propagation;stream cipher	Howard M.

For store-and-forward routing, in which nodes have buffers for packets in transit, there are routing algorithms with performance that matches the lower bound &OHgr;(C+D). Motivated from optical networks, we study the extreme case of hot-potato routing in which the nodes are bufferless. In hot-potato routing, packets may be unable to follow the preselected paths towards the destination nodes; thus it may take more time for packets to be routed. An interesting question is how much is the performance of routing algorithms affected from the absence of buffers.Here, we answer this question for the general class of leveled networks, in which the nodes are partitioned into L+1 distinct levels. We present a randomized hot-potato routing algorithm for leveled networks, which routes the packets in Õ(C + L) time with high probability. For routing problems with dilation O(L), this bound is within polylogarithmic factors from the lower bound &OHgr;(C+L). Our algorithm demonstrates that the benefit from using buffers is no more than polylogarithmic; thus, hot-potato routing is an efficient way to route packets in leveled networks.Our algorithm is online, that is, routing decisions are taken at real time at each node, while packets are routed in the network. A novel characteristic of our algorithm is that during the course of routing, packets may deviate from their preselected paths. To our knowledge, this is the first hot-potato algorithm designed and analyzed, in terms of congestion and dilation, for arbitrary leveled networks.	dilation (morphology);hot spare;hot-potato and cold-potato routing;network congestion;network packet;polylogarithmic function;randomized algorithm;store and forward;with high probability	Costas Busch	2002	Theory of Computing Systems	10.1007/s00224-004-1136-8	routing table;algorithm design;routing;static routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;mathematics;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;upper and lower bounds;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;algorithm;routing information protocol	Theory	-0.13636377585169138	71.11975694878743	104850

A model for ISDN application tasks is introduced to simulate the processing of ISDN user-network interface protocols. A simple approach is developed to arrive at an estimate for this overhead. Measurement of the processing is calculated for two ISDN applications tasks, the Q.931 basic call control and the TEL assignment. The overhead cost is measured in relation to the total memory references and to the total machine instruction processing time. Results presented show that this overhead is significant, and is particularly so if the number of ISDN messages being processed during task execution is small.	integrated services digital network;overhead (computing);paging	Ali Elkateeb;Tho Le-Ngoc	1992	Computer Communications	10.1016/0140-3664(92)90045-G	embedded system;communications protocol;real-time computing;computer hardware;computer science;integrated services digital network;overhead	OS	-1.214773934831483	61.707774560970805	105365

When a sensor receives a flood message, the sensor needs to check whether it has received this message for the first time and so this message is fresh, or it has received the same message earlier and so the message is redundant. In this paper, we discuss a family of four flood sequencing protocols that use sequence numbers to distinguish between fresh and redundant flood messages. These four protocols are: a sequencing free protocol, a linear sequencing protocol, a circular sequencing protocol, and a differentiated sequencing protocol. We analyze the self-stabilization properties of these four flood sequencing protocols. We also compare the performance of these flood sequencing protocols, using simulation, over various settings of sensor networks. We conclude that the differentiated sequencing protocol has better stabilization property and provides better performance than those of the other three protocols.	communications protocol;flood;free protocol;self-stabilization;sensor;simulation	Young-ri Choi;Chin-Tser Huang;Mohamed G.

In order to increase reliability, cells often split their traffic via multiple hubs--this ensures partial survivability in the face of equipment failures. One version of this problem was presented in Dutta and Kubat [4] where it was solved heuristically. In this paper, we show how this problem can be reduced to a significantly smaller one--one which can be solved to optimality almost instantaneously even for instances much larger than those presented in Dutta and Kubat [4]. Results from extensive computational tests are presented on various channel capacities, ranging from DS-1 to OC-192. The optimal approach is observed to provide better solutions in less time than the heuristic approach, thereby rendering the use of heuristic approaches unnecessary.	telecommunications network	Syam Menon;Ali Amiri	2005	Information Technology and Management	10.1007/s10799-005-5883-2	cellular network;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;dynamic programming;channel capacity;computer network	ML	0.14875952913291973	73.28483354349098	106044

ffc1a3a7281697ddb2069d158735f4d3e0543efb	robust data mule networks with remote healthcare applications in the amazon region: a fountain code approach		Providing healthcare to the remote and isolated communities in the Brazilian Amazon poses a significant challenge. In those places, healthcare examinations are mainly run by sporadic visits from medical teams from the main city in the region, Belém. An alternative would be to have local nurses or technicians perform routine clinical examinations, such as ultrasounds on pregnant women, elec whose records could be sent to the doctors in Belém for evaluation. However, due to the lack of modern communication infrastructure in these communities, we propose the use of regularly scheduled boats as data mules to ensure fast and timely delivery of the examination records from those communities to physicians in the city for remote analysis. Unpredictable boat delays and break-downs, as well as high transmission failures due to the harsh environment in the region, mandate the design of robust delay-tolerant routing algorithms. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we propose the use of fountain codes in order to improve the robustness of opportunistic data routing. Second, we develop a simulation model that incorporates the high unpredictability of the Amazon riverine scenario, accounting for boat delays/breakdowns environmental conditions and individual packet losses, and present extensive simulations results to evaluate our proposed approaches. While the results in this paper focus on remote healthcare applications in the Brazilian Amazon, we envision that our approach may also be used for other remote applications, such as distance education, and other similar scenarios.	algorithm;amazon simple storage service;data mule;electrical engineering;fountain code;heisenbug;network packet;routing;simulation	Mengxue Liu;Thienne Johnson;Rachit Agarwal;Alon Efrat;Andréa W.

18d735e8f11d2fc5622134145f40a3df8971b8ba	low-reliable low-latency networks optimized for hpc parallel applications		High-end network standards, such as 400GbE, have been introduced Forwarding Error Correction (FEC) for maintaining the same bit error rate (BER) as that in traditional low-bandwidth interconnection networks. However, FEC operation latency overhead surprisingly becomes higher than the sum of all the other switch operation overheads, e.g., routing computation and switch allocation. FEC operation latency overhead significantly degrades the performance of parallel applications in HPC systems. Instead, in this study, we exploit the low-latency network design using a Hamming code that does not provide rigid error-free communication. Since it is consistent with existing frame format based on standard Reed-Solomon RS(544,514) with DC(64b/66b) direct linecode and TC(256b/257b) transcode, respectively, the influences upon the other network layer design are limited. Interestingly, a large number of parallel applications can accept the BER in such a Hamming code. Since lowering such a BER improves switch operation latency, the proposed network using the Hamming code improves the execution time of NAS Parallel Benchmarks by 56% on average when compared to the counterpart RS-FEC networks.

However, there are few formal models for verification and analysis of sensor networks in the literature. In this paper, we present a graphical simulation system for modeling and analysis of sensor networks. A formal model of sensor networks is proposed based on Space Time Petri Net (STPN). STPN is a formal model language which is extended from time Petri Nets (TPN) and colored Petri nets (CPN). The idea is to add space information to the places of the original TPN to model the space information in sensor networks, such as the locations of sensor nodes. And based on this modeling idea, a set of new concepts are proposed, such as space place, broadcast transition, and dynamic topology. The STPN not only can model the various characteristics of sensor networks, such as temporal and spatial information, but also can simulate the different behavior of sensor networks. A prototype system has been implemented to model and analyze the behavior of sensor networks systems.	algorithm;broadcasting (networking);coloured petri net;formal language;graphical user interface;mathematical model;prototype;simulation	Yan Luo;Jeffrey J.

76ce8045531b0dc53472b25999df200d2b09708c	multi-objective hierarchical algorithms for restoring wireless sensor network connectivity in known environments	node deployment;wireless sensor network;connectivity repair	A Wireless Sensor Network can become partitioned due to node failure, requiring the deployment of additional relay nodes in order to restore network connectivity. This introduces an optimisation problem involving a tradeoff between the number of additional nodes that are required and the costs of moving through the sensor field for the purpose of node placement. This tradeoff is application-dependent, influenced for example by the relative urgency of network restoration. We propose a family of algorithms based on hierarchical objectives including complete algorithms and heuristics which integrate network design with path planning, recognising the impact of obstacles on mobility and communication. We conduct an empirical evaluation of the algorithms on random connectivity and mobility graphs, showing their relative performance in terms of node and path costs, and assessing their execution speeds. Finally, we examine how the relative importance of the two objectives influences the choice of algorithm. In summary, the algorithms which prioritise the node cost tend to find graphs with fewer nodes, while the algorithm which prioritise the cost of moving find slightly larger solutions but with cheaper mobility costs. The heuristic algorithms are close to the optimal algorithms in node cost, and higher in mobility costs. For fast moving agents, the node algorithms are preferred in total restoration time, and for slow speed moving agent, the path algorithms are preferred.		Thuy T. Truong;Kenneth N. Brown;Cormac J.

In the design of power-efficient embedded many-core processors, the architecture of the on-chip network plays a central role. Many designs have relied on a 2D mesh architecture as the underlying communication fabric. With the emergence of 3D technology, new on-chip network architectures are possible. In this paper, we propose a novel layer-multiplexed (LM) 3D network architecture that takes advantage of the short interlayer wiring delays enabled in 3D technology. In particular, the LM architecture replaces the one-layer-per-hop routing in a conventional 3D mesh with simpler vertical demultiplexing and multiplexing structures. When combined with a layer load-balanced oblivious routing algorithm, it can achieve the same worst-case throughput as the best known oblivious routing algorithm on a conventional 3D mesh. However, in comparison to a conventional 3D mesh, the LM architecture consumes 27% less power, attains 14.5% higher average throughput, and achieves 33% lower worst-case hop count on a 4 times 4 times 4 topology.	3d computer graphics;best, worst and average case;cache-oblivious algorithm;central processing unit;embedded system;emergence;load balancing (computing);manycore processor;multiplexing;network architecture;network on a chip;routing;throughput;wiring	Rohit Sunkam Ramanujam;Bill Lin	2009	IEEE Embedded Systems Letters	10.1109/LES.2009.2034710	polygon mesh;chip;wireless mesh network;system on a chip;embedded system;routing;throughput;parallel computing;network architecture;electrical efficiency;computer science;load balancing;mesh networking;integrated circuit;application-specific integrated circuit;network on a chip;network topology;computer network	Arch	2.316613488861568	61.59442130214379	108281

To increase communication efficiency, Three-Dimensional Networks-on-Chips (3D NoCs) are developed, which can shorten the wire length and improve the system performance. In this paper, we present a novel deadlock-free adaptive routing algorithm for 3D mesh NoC interconnections. The routing rules of traditional XY routing and YX routing are relaxed and used for intra-layer routing. Via multiple layers, balanced adaptiveness can be achieved.

On top of that, those sensing devices are in multiple modalities with the need of fusing diverse inputs into unified formats to provide answers to query tasks. We addressed issues under network resource constraints on exploiting multiple distinctive sensing modalities. Then, we proposed a fusion framework to aggregate various types of sensing inputs, and an updating algorithm to adaptively schedule resource, e.g. bandwidth, to most contributing devices. With the adjustment of mapping functions which get bandwidth consumption bounded by the threshold, our algorithm keeps updating the combination of bandwidth shares to suit for streaming events as well as different query tasks. Taking multimodal sensing into account, our elementary fusion framework may shed light on deeper exploration on the correlation among variety of sensing inputs, especially under resource-constrained circumstances.	aggregate data;algorithm;authorization;display resolution;mathematical optimization;multimodal interaction;sampling (signal processing);transmitter	Muchen Wu;Nasser M.

Memory self-repair using redundancies to increase the yield of memories is widely used. Because high density memories are vulnerable to soft errors, memory error correction code (ECC) plays an important role in memory design. In this paper, methods to exploit spare columns including replaced defective columns are proposed to improve memory ECC. To utilize replaced defective columns, the defect information needs to be stored. Two approaches to store defect information are proposed—one is to use a spare column and the other is to use a content-addressable-memory.

Distributed systems have become commonplace due to the wide availability of low-cost, high performance computers and network devices. However, the management infrastructure often does not scale well when distributed systems get very large. The considerations in building a distributed system are the choice of the network topology and the method used to construct the distributed system so as to optimize the scalability and reliability of the system, lower the cost of linking nodes together and minimize the message delay in transmission, and simplify system resource management. We have developed a new distributed management system that is able to handle the dynamic increase of system size, detect and recover the unexpected failure of system services, and manage system resources. The topologies used in the system are the tree-structured network and the ring-structured network.	computer;distributed computing;network topology;scalability;supercomputer;telecommunications network	Min Huang;Brett Bode	2005	19th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2005.57	distributed algorithm;availability;design;real-time computing;scalability;distributed data store;performance;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;reliability;management system;distributed computing;tree structure;implementation;distributed database;network topology;telecommunications network;replication;computer network	HPC	-0.986665917451934	67.63826295273758	109487

For a target graph G (linear array or mesh in this paper), a graph G' is called a k-fault-tolerant graph of G if when we remove any k nodes from G', it still contains a subgraph isomorphic to G. The major quality measures for a fault-tolerant graph are the number of spare nodes it uses and the maximum degree it has. The degree is particularly important in practice as it poses constraints on the scalability of the system. In this paper, we aim at designing fault-tolerant graphs with both a small degree and a small number of spare nodes. The fault-tolerant graphs we obtain have degree O(1) for arrays and O(log/sup 3/ k) for meshes. The number of spare nodes used are O(k log/sup 2/ k) and O(k/sup 2//log k), respectively. Compared to the previous results, the number of spare nodes used in our construction has one fewer linear factor in k.	fault-tolerant computer system	Li Zhang	2002	IEEE Trans.

Several state-of-the-art architectural synthesis flows have already adopted the distributed register architecture to cope with the increasing wire delay by allowing multicycle communication. In this paper, we formulate channel and register allocation within a refined regular distributed register architecture, named RDR-GRS, as a problem of simultaneous data transfer routing and scheduling for minimizing global interconnect resources. We also present an innovative algorithm with both spatial and temporal considerations. It features both a concentration-oriented path router gathering wire-sharable data transfers and a channel-based time scheduler resolving contentions for wires in a channel, which are in spatial and temporal domain, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly outperform existing related works.	algorithm;register allocation;restrictive design rules;router (computing);routing;scheduling (computing);very-large-scale integration	Yu-Ju Hong;Ya-Shih Huang;Juinn-Dar Huang	2009	2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference		embedded system;routing;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer performance;statistics;computer network	EDA	3.4505501871653292	61.20644814650724	109945

In high-reliability network applications such as aerospace and defense systems, soft-error tolerant TCAMs are indispensable to prevent data corruption or faults caused by radiation. This paper proposes a novel soft-error tolerant TCAM for multiple-bit-flip errors using partial don't-care keys (X-keys), called k-TX. k-TX corrects up to k-bit flip errors and significantly enhances the tolerance of the TCAM against soft errors, where k is the maximum number of bit flips in a word of a TCAM. k-TX consists of a TCAM, a preprocessed don't-care-bit index look-up memory (X look-up), and an ECC-SRAM. First, k-TX randomly selects a search key. After that, k-TX detects multiple-bit-flip errors by the generated X-keys using the X look-up. If the keys match the different locations, then a soft error is suspected and k-TX refreshes the TCAM words by using a backup ECC-SRAM. Experimental results show that the soft-error tolerance capability of k-TX outperforms other schemes significantly. Moreover, the hardware overhead of k-TX is small due to the use of only a single TCAM. k-TX can be easily implemented and is useful for fault-tolerant packet classifiers.	backup;bitmap index;content-addressable memory;error-tolerant design;fault tolerance;firewall (computing);lookup table;mouse keys;network address translation;network packet;overhead (computing);randomness;router (computing);soft error;static random-access memory;telecommunications access method	Infall Syafalni;Tsutomu Sasao;Xiaoqing Wen	2016	2016 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)	10.1109/ISVLSI.2016.77	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science	Metrics	8.418721907212904	61.08787005837319	110288

In order to implement a low-latency and highthroughput network under limited silicon area, the choice of optimal network parameters is critical. Due to the large design space of a network, it is difficult to evaluate a design without the aid of proper tools. In this paper, a simulator for low dimensional L-ary n-cube networks, which are wire-efficient [4] and are widely used in fine-grained message-passing multicomputers [l], is presented. The simulator helps to evaluate the network performance by using a predefined simulation language. The language can be used to specify network parameters, such as network topology, channel arbitration, processor/router interface, timing, flow control, and routing algorithm. Outputs generated by the simulator include average message latency, expected execution time, network hot spots, contention spots, message hit ratio, and size of message pools. A non-blocking send and blocking receive programming model is assumed.	blocking (computing);distributed computing;hit (internet);mimd;message passing;network performance;network topology;non-blocking algorithm;overhead (computing);programming model;router (computing);routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation language	Jing-Shiang Tseng;Chung-Ta King	1992		10.1109/CMPSAC.1992.217581	parallel computing;message passing;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;flow control;database;distributed computing;programming paradigm;network performance;programming language;hot spot	Networks	-2.3436889637493556	67.0875039112406	110397

The underlying faults are difficult to localize, as the information gained from the hardware-based diagnostic methods typically in use lacks sufficient detail. The alternative proposed in this paper is software instrumentation that monitors key registers and flags to detect anomalies indicative of failure. In contrast to hardware-based techniques, which use invasive probes that can alter the very phenomena being studied, the proposed approach makes use of standard peripherals such as the serial or Ethernet port to monitor and record the effect of ESD. We illustrate the use of this software instrumentation technique in conjunction with a three-dimensional ESD injection system to produce a sensitivity map that visualizes the susceptibility of various segments of an embedded system to ESD.	central processing unit;discharger;electrostatic discharge materials;embedded system;map;peripheral;propagation of uncertainty;serial port;software propagation;usb	Pratik Maheshwari;Byong-Su Seol;Jong-Sung Lee;Jae-deok Lim;Sahra Sedigh Sarvestani;David Pommerenke	2011	2011 IEEE 13th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering	10.1109/HASE.2011.64	electromagnetic interference;embedded system;three-dimensional space;instrumentation;electronic engineering;real-time computing;electrostatic discharge;computer science;engineering;kullback–leibler divergence;robot kinematics	Embedded	9.840765249515174	60.56898041433592	110790

An added advantage of these switches is that they allow for a reconfiguration of the network topology to suit the requirements of the application. To realize the full potential of a high-performance computing system with a reconfigurable interconnect, there is a need to design algorithms for computing a topology that will allow for a high-throughput load distribution, while simultaneously partitioning the computational task graph of the application for the computed topology. In this paper, we propose a new framework that exploits such reconfigurable interconnects to achieve these interdependent goals, i.e., to iteratively co-optimize the network topology configuration, application partitioning and network flow routing to maximize throughput for a given application. We also present a novel way of computing a high-throughput initial topology based on the structural properties of the application to seed our co-optimizing framework. We show the value of our approach on synthetic graphs that emulate the key characteristics of a class of stream computing applications that require high throughput. Our experiments show that the proposed technique is fast and computes high-quality partitions of such graphs for a broad range of hardware parameters that varies the bottleneck from computation to communication.	algorithm;bottleneck (software);central processing unit;computation;computer cluster;dhrystone;electrical connection;emoticon;experiment;exploit (computer security);graph partition;high-throughput computing;interdependence;iteration;load balancing (computing);low-power broadcasting;mapreduce;message passing interface;network switch;network topology;no-communication theorem;parallel computing;reconfigurable computing;requirement;routing;scalability;stream processing;supercomputer;synthetic intelligence;throughput;vertex (graph theory)	Deepak Ajwani;Shoukat Ali;John P.

Such a restriction limits its applicability. An incomplete hypercube may provide more flexibility in system sizes. There are three classes of variant incomplete hypercube interconnection networks: I/sup r//sub m/, I/sup r//sub M/ and I/sup r//sub A/. The authors focus on the parallel routing algorithms for these three classes of incomplete hypercubes. Parallel paths between any given two nodes mean that these paths have the same source and destination nodes but with different intermediate nodes. Parallel communication can speed up the data transfer operation and increase the system fault-tolerance and the communication reliability between two nodes.<<ETX>>	algorithm;apollonian network;central processing unit;interconnection;power of two;routing;speedup;system fault tolerance	Maw-Sheng Horng;Deng-Jyi Chen;Kuo-Lung Ku	1992	CompEuro 1992 Proceedings Computer Systems and Software Engineering	10.1016/0167-8191(94)90129-5	routing;parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;interconnection;distributed computing;parallel algorithm;hypercube	Arch	-1.7561613771948996	69.66527842407639	111417

Device technology in electrooptics has matured to a point where small, low power, and low cost devices exist which are suitable for use in bus level implementations. Therefore, the realization of physically distributed, bus-interconnected multiprocessors is now possible. In this paper we propose a bus arbitration mechanism suitable for a large optical bus structure heavily populated with asynchronous bus masters. It is a two-level arbitration system with incoming requests batched on a demand basis and serviced in a linear priority order within each batch. Low priority requests cannot be starved in high contention environments. For an optical bus of fixed length, propagation delay is bounded by the end-to-end transit time and is independent of the number of devices attached. In addition, as contention for the bus increases and batch sizes become larger, the time overhead paid for bus control decreases. Thus, a performance improvement is achieved dynamically under high contention conditions. o 1990 Academic Press, IN.	bus (computing);bus mastering;crosstalk;end-to-end principle;interference (communication);overhead (computing);population;propagation delay;software propagation	Donald M.

This system is equivalent to the well known crossbar system when there is no hierarchy (nt = I ) , and to the cluster-based system introduced in [15] when the number of levels equals two (171 = 2). However, a number of levels greater than two may be needed in systems that have large number of processors and memory modules, since the goal is to reduce the network complexity without significantly reducing the performance. The performance of the 771 -level hierarchical multiprocessor system is analyzed in terms of the system bandwidth ( B U T ) for both hierarchically nonuniform reference ( H S R ) and uniform reference ( I R ) models. The results show that for higher rate of local requests (requests to memory modules within the same cluster) the ttl-level system performs fairly close to the crossbar system and outperforms a typical multiple-bus system (with the number of buses equal to half the number of processors). Finally the bandwidth of the t t1level system is evaluated for different number of levels and the results are compared with those of a crossbar system ( T I ) = 1).	central processing unit;crossbar switch;dimm;multiprocessing;profiling (computer programming);whole earth 'lectronic link	Imad Mahgoub;Ahmed K.

While nanometer feature sizes allow denser chip designs in each technology generation, fabricated ICs become more susceptible to wear-outs, causing operation failure. Even a single link failure within an on-chip fabric can halt communication between application blocks, which makes the entire chip useless. In this paper, we aim to make faulty chips designed with network-on-chip (NoC) communication usable. Specifically, we present fault-tolerant irregular topology-generation method for application-specific NoC designs. Designed NoC topology allows different routing path if there is a link failure on the default routing path. Additionally, we present a simulated annealing-based application mapping algorithm aiming to minimize total energy consumption of the NoC design. We compare fault-tolerant topologies with nonfault-tolerant application-specific irregular topologies on energy consumption, performance, and area using multimedia benchmarks and custom-generated graphs. Our results demonstrate that our method is able to determine fault-tolerant topologies with negligible area increase and better energy values.	algorithm;delay-tolerant networking;fault tolerance;fault-tolerant computer system;halting problem;integrated circuit;network on a chip;router (computing);routing;simulated annealing;single point of failure;transistor;wear leveling	Suleyman Tosun;Vahid Babaei Ajabshir;Ozge Mercanoglu;Özcan Özturk	2015	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2015.2413848	routing;fault tolerance;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;multipath routing;distributed computing;network topology;computer network;logical topology	EDA	2.7072236255759745	62.716234380737646	113093

Energy consumption can be estimated by simulating the sensor network with a power model. Power model is the key component for the accurate estimation. However, the power model is not publicly accessible and it is not easy to generate accurate fine-grain power model. In this paper we proposed a simplified but yet accurate power model for AVR-based sensor nodes. Also, we developed an automated power model generation tool. The tool generates an instruction-level power model that can be connected to sensor network simulators. We model the current consumption of ATmega128 instruction set which is the most widely used processor in sensor node. Loading, execution, and control of the measurement framework are managed by the tool. Using the tool, we can generate power models of various sensor nodes using ATmega128 as their processor. Experimental result shows that our tool successfully generated accurate power models of various sensor nodes including Mica2.

However, retention failure has emerged as a major reliability concern for this technology due to the large variations in retention time because of process variations and temperature effects. The conventional solution to mitigate retention failures is to use scrubbing at regular intervals to prevent accumulation of errors, based on the worst case retention time of the memory array. But this leads to large performance and energy overheads. In this work, we propose a process variation and temperature aware scrubbing technique, where we cluster the cache lines into different groups based on their retention times and use different scrubbing intervals for each of these groups. In addition, the scrubbing interval is adjusted at run-time based on the operating temperature, to guarantee target error rate requirements. Our results show that for a 512KB cache, a group size of 4 can reduce the performance and dynamic energy overheads of scrubbing by 97%, under the same error rate constraint.	best, worst and average case;cmos;cache (computing);data scrubbing;magnetoresistive random-access memory;memory scrubbing;propagation of uncertainty;random access;requirement;scalability;tree accumulation	Nour Sayed;Sarath Mohanachandran Nair;Rajendra Bishnoi;Mehdi Baradaran Tahoori	2018	2018 23rd Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)	10.1109/ASPDAC.2018.8297306	data scrubbing;real-time computing;process variation;cache;scalability;computer science;operating temperature;magnetoresistive random-access memory;cmos;random access	EDA	7.23014868246859	61.49640709625574	114165

PCM with appropriate scalability, power consumption and multiple bits per cell storage capability is a probable candidate for substituting DRAM. Although storing multiple bits per cell seems to be a rational response to large memory demands, there is a significant problem to achieve this goal. Resistance drift problem is an important reliability concern that is coupled to a multi-level cell PCM (MLC PCM) memory system. In this paper, we propose a memory system architecture that, by exploiting the benefits of compression, converts resistance drift prone blocks to drift resilient blocks in order to protect the memory system from resistance drift. Evaluations on a full-system simulator, consisting of a quad-core ALPHA CMP and a banked PCM memory, show that our proposed approach provides up to 9.8× reduction in bit error rate, an average of 8% reduction in energy consumption, and 21% IPC improvement.	bit error rate;computer architecture simulator;dynamic random-access memory;multi-core processor;multi-level cell;scalability;simulation;systems architecture	Majid Jalili;Hamid Sarbazi-Azad	2014	2014 IEEE 25th International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors	10.1109/ASAP.2014.6868667	data compression;embedded system;programming;parallel computing;real-time computing;bit error rate;computer science;reliability;resistance;dram;statistics	EDA	7.555509588033494	61.87731144114645	114400

The designed ciphers operate efficiently with different plaintext lengths, 64 and 128-bit, for Cobra-H64 and Cobra-H128, respectively. Both of them use very simple key scheduling that defines high performance, especially in the case of frequent key refreshing. A novel feature of Cobra-H64 and Cobra-H128 is the use of the Switchable Operations which prevent the weak keys. The offered high-level security strength does not sacrifice the implementation performance, of both ciphers. Architecture, design and hardware implementation of the two ciphers are presented. The synthesis results for both FPGA and ASIC implementations prove that Cobra-H64 and Cobra-H128 are very flexible and powerful new ciphers, especially for high-speed networks. The achieved hardware performance and the implementation area cost of Cobra-H64 and Cobra-H128 are compared with other ciphers, used in security layers of wireless protocols (Bluetooth, WAP, OMA, UMTS and IEEE 802.11). From these comparisons it is proven that the two proposed are flexible new ciphers with better performance in most of the cases, suitable for wireless communications networks of present and future.	data-directed programming	Nicolas Sklavos;Nikolay A.

0e762ec70194b758044864dee34d40e946ee7faf	sd-pcm: constructing reliable super dense phase change memory under write disturbance	phase change memory;write disturbance	Phase Change Memory (PCM) has better scalability and smaller cell size comparing to DRAM. However, further scaling PCM cell in deep sub-micron regime results in significant thermal based write disturbance (WD). Naively allocating large inter-cell space increases cell size from 4F2 ideal to 12F2. While a recent work mitigates WD along word-lines through disturbance resilient data encoding, it is ineffective for WD along bit-lines, which is more severe due to widely adopted $\mu$Trench structure in constructing PCM cell arrays. Without mitigating WD along bit-lines, a PCM cell still has 8F2, which is 100% larger than the ideal. In this paper, we propose SD-PCM for achieving reliable write operations in super dense PCM. In particular, we focus on mitigating WD along bit-lines such that we can construct super dense PCM chips with 4F2 cell size, i.e., the minimal for diode-switch based PCM. Based on simple verification-n-correction (VnC), we propose LazyCorrection and PreRead to effectively reduce VnC overhead and minimize cascading verification during write. We further propose (n:m)-Alloc for achieving good tradeoff between VnC overhead minimization and memory capacity loss. Our experimental results show that, comparing to a WD-free low density PCM, SD-PCM achieves 80% capacity improvement in cell arrays while incurring around 0-10% performance degradation when using different (n:m) allocators.	capacity loss;code;diode;dynamic random-access memory;elegant degradation;formal verification;image scaling;overhead (computing);phase-change memory;scalability	Rujia Wang;Lei Jiang;Youtao Zhang;Jun Yang	2015		10.1145/2694344.2694352	parallel computing;real-time computing;phase-change memory;computer hardware;computer science	Arch	7.118956493430009	61.66024915666131	114841

High precision time synchronization can enable a variety of extensions of applications. This paper includes the design and implementation of the precision time protocol over low rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANpsilas). To achieve high precision in LR-WPANpsilas, we analyze the factors of latency and jitter in wireless environments, and we aim to minimize these factors. In addition, this paper presents experiments and the performance evaluation of the precision time protocol in LR-WPANpsilas. The result is that we established for nodes in a network to maintain their clocks to within a 50 nanosecond offset from the reference clock.	experiment;lr parser;performance evaluation;precision time protocol;ubiquitous computing	Hyuntae Cho;Sanghyun Son;Yunju Baek	2008	2008 13th Asia-Pacific Computer Systems Architecture Conference	10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625431	embedded system;communications protocol;synchronization;real-time computing;computer science;wireless network;oscillation;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Mobile	4.56609404609302	72.18589318298733	114915
8458ee42d35e8408f8204a7b83528129291c2d90	design of fault tolerant shuffle exchange gamma interconnection network layouts		Advancement in technology has resulted in increased computing power with the use of multiple processors within a system. These multiple processors need to communicate with each other and with memory modules. Multistage Interconnection Networks (MINs) provide a communication medium in such multi-processor systems by interconnecting a number of processors and memory modules. Besides, MINs also provide a cost effective substitute to costly crossbars in parallel computers and switching systems in telephone industry. This paper introduces two new fault-tolerant MINs named as Shuffle Exchange Gamma Interconnection Networks (SEGIN-1 and SEGIN-2). SEGIN-1 and SEGIN-2 can be obtained by altering Shuffle Exchange Network with one extra stage (SEN+) and provide two disjoint paths similar to it. Performance of SEGIN-1 and SEGIN-2 has been evaluated in terms of alternative paths, disjoint paths, reliability and hardware cost, and is compared with some very famous MINs like Shuffle Exchange Network (SEN), Shuffle Exchange Network with one extra stage (SEN+), Shuffle Exchange Network with two extra stage (SEN+2), Extra Stage Cube (ESC) and Gamma Interconnection Network (GIN). Results suggest that SEGINs surpass all the compared networks; hence, the proposed designs seem to be suitable for implementing practical interconnection networks.	central processing unit;computer;cube;dimm;electronic switching system;fault tolerance;multiplexer;multiprocessing;multistage interconnection networks;network switch;parallel computing;provisioning	Gaurav Khanna;Rajesh Mishra;Sanjay Kumar Chaturvedi	2017	Journal of Interconnection Networks	10.1142/S0219265917500050		Arch	0.9358653454260785	64.4475298162383	115363

Recent studies show that 1–5% of the SEUs (single event upset) can cause MBUs (multiple bit upsets). The probability of MBU generation due to SEU is increasing because of the reduction in minimum energy required to flip a memory bit in modern technologies. Register file is the most sensitive component in a microprocessor. In this paper, we present an innovative way to protect registers in a 64-bit register file for a RISC processor using extended Hamming (8, 4) code (SEC-DED code) and narrow-width values. A narrow-width value can be represented by half number of bits of the register width. Two additional bits for each data register have been used to store the information for a narrow-width value. Each 64-bit data in register file has its unique 64-bit extended Hamming code that is stored in another register file in a bit-interleaved manner. Two copies of narrow-width values can be stored in one register and each copy has its unique extended Hamming code in other register file. Proposed method has been tested using fault injection simulation with SPEC2000 benchmarks. Error probability of a word that stores generated values for register file in SPEC2000 benchmarks and is protected with proposed method is less than the error probability of the same word that is protected with TMR or various extended Hamming codes. The implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA shows that the area overhead of a register file with 64-bit wide and more than 64-word entry that is protected with proposed method is less than the area overhead of the same register file that is protected with TMR. Error detection and correction is performed in parallel with execute stage to prevent performance degradation. More than 99% of errors in adjacent 32 bits in data or extended Hamming code registers can be corrected with the proposed method. Presented method employs pure combinational logics and can be used for 16-bit and 32-bit register files too.	16-bit;32-bit;64-bit computing;bit error rate;combinational logic;dedicated hosting service;elegant degradation;embedded system;error detection and correction;error-tolerant design;fault injection;field-programmable gate array;hamming code;mbus (sparc);microprocessor;overhead (computing);processor register;register file;semiconductor device fabrication;simulation;single event upset;triple modular redundancy	Siamak Esmaeeli;Morteza Hosseini;Bijan Vosoughi Vahdat;Bizhan Rashidian	2011	2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2011.6122330	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer hardware;control register;computer science;memory buffer register;ring counter;register renaming;stack register;processor register;hamming(7,4);register allocation;register file;status register;memory data register	Arch	7.8263569779304305	60.79396831612932	115424

This shrinking leads to increases in susceptibility to transient errors and permanent faults. Network on Chips (NoCs) are poised to address the demands for high bandwidth communication among processing elements. The structural redundancy inherited in NoC-based design can be exploited to improve reliability and compensate for the effects of failures in digital systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced fault tolerant micro-architecture for NoC routers. The proposed router supplies dynamic virtual channel allocation using Unified Buffer Structure (UBS) and History Aware Free-slot Tracker (HAFT). Plus, to reduce the associated performance costs of retransmissions in the case of failure, the proposed router employs a high-performance fault tolerant control flow, handling both transient and permanent faults without extra retransmission buffer requirements. Experimental results show a significant improvement in reliability as well as decreases in the average latency and energy consumption.	control flow;digital electronics;fault tolerance;integrated circuit;microarchitecture;network on a chip;redundancy (engineering);requirement;retransmission (data networks);router (computing);tree network;virtual channel	Mohammad Hossein Neishaburi;Zeljko Zilic	2011	2011 12th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design	10.1109/ISQED.2011.5770788	embedded system;fault tolerance;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;network on a chip;computer network	Arch	5.369407897553971	60.78680890529302	115634
41e2a0ef51953ef2939a50b4f71ee5484dc5fc16	tolerating multiple failures in raid architectures with optimal storage and uniform declustering		We present DATUM, a novel method for tolerating multiple disk failures in disk arrays. DATUM is the first known method that can mask any given number of failures, requires an optimal amount of redundant storage space, and spreads reconstruction accesses uniformly over disks in the presence of failures without needing large layout tables in controller memory. Our approach is based on information dispersal, a coding technique that admits an efficient hardware implementation. As the method does not restrict the configuration parameters of the disk array, many existing RAID organizations are particular cases of DATUM. A detailed performance comparison with two other approaches shows that DATUM'S response times are similar to those of the best competitor when two or less disks fail, and that the performance degrades gracefully when more than two disks fail.	raid	Guillermo A.

For direct connection networks such as mesh networks, hybrid electrooptical networks that employ circuit switching can reduce latency and thereby system throughput by an order of magnitude. For packet switched local area networks, optically controlled electrooptic waveguide crossbar networks provide higher efficiency and also lower latency advantages. To illustrate our thesis, we present two examples of electrooptical waveguide-based network designs. In the first, we describe a new self-routing optical crossbar design, VIPER +, that can be realized by locally controlled 2 × 2 electrooptic switches. The VIPER + crossbar is unique in that it can solve the network access and conflict arbitration problems optoelectronically. Further, by cascading the proposed crossbar networks, larger nonblocking self-routing optical networks can be implemented in modular fashion. The second design based on VIPER + is a waveguide mesh interconnection network that incorporates an optical express router, in which optical channels are accessed for remote processor communications, in an electrical mesh.

00af0de94a9fa3e9df8f841b788d2ad67ec2fc09	cable-geometric error-prone approach for low-latency interconnection networks		Interconnection network is a main concern in the architecture design of highly parallel systems such as high density data centers and supercomputers that reach millions of endpoints, e.g., 10M cores for Sunway TaihuLight system. As the number of endpoints of such systems has gradually increased to meet the higher computing and storage demand, the interconnection network is required to provide a low latency and high communication bandwidth, i.e., less than 1-microsecond latency across systems with a link bandwidth is greater than 100GB/s. In the low-latency design context, our primary aim is to provide a novel solution based on the technology-driven approaches: (1) cable-geometric small-world network topology with custom routing, and (2) the use of an FEC(forward error correction)-free error-prone mechanism for a high-speed low-reliable link. Both can present a logarithmic diameter low-radix network with low-latency and high-bandwidth switches, although approximate computing or ABFT (algorithm-based fault tolerance) design is required for parallel applications.	approximate computing;approximation algorithm;cognitive dimensions of notations;computation;data center;fault tolerance;forward error correction;higher computing;interconnection;keyboard shortcut;network planning and design;network switch;network topology;overhead (computing);randomness;routing table;scanline rendering;sunway taihulight;supercomputer	Thao-Nguyen Nguyen;Michihiro Koibuchi	2017	2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)		latency (engineering);fault tolerance;interconnection;latency (engineering);network topology;network architecture;network traffic control;computer network;bandwidth (signal processing);computer science;distributed computing	Arch	2.535897227436892	62.98809736539062	117441

Almost all such functions feature the use of clocks and timers in control and/or data roles, and these are typically implemented in an ad hoc manner. This paper introduces a set of three configurable timing modules that are based on abstractions of the prevalent timing paradigms observed in network protocols. The modules fit within the experimental ShapeUp methodology for modular FPGA-based system design, and so can be easily integrated with other modules that are tailored for specific networking functions. The use and benefits of the new modular approach are demonstrated by an example of a flexible FPGA reference design that has been made available for real-life use by telecommunication equipment providers.	accessibility;communications protocol;compiler;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;gigabit;hoc (programming language);interface description language;level design;library (computing);modular design;modular programming;network processor;programming paradigm;real life;real-time computing;reference design;systems design;terabit;timer	Christopher E.

For such case, the network topology needs to scale effectively. In this paper, we propose a new scalable topology for kilo-core-oriented processors named CSquare, a cluster-formed structure, in which each cluster is a variation of the butterfly-tree. For each cluster, the routers adopt parallel-level structure to obtain efficient global connections. With the global interconnections between clusters, the topology scale can be extended at a much faster rate than with only one cluster. For such characters, we propose a deadlock-free routing algorithm for CSquare, called GNCA. Compared with 2D-Mesh and Torus, CSquare employs fewer routers and links. The simulation results indicate that CSquare greatly improves the average latency and throughput under various traffic patterns and consumes less power and area.	3d floor plan;level structure;network on a chip;scalability;simulation;throughput	Naijun Zheng;Huaxi Gu;Xin Huang;Xiaokang Chen	2015	Microprocessors and Microsystems - Embedded Hardware Design	10.1016/j.micpro.2015.03.008	parallel computing;real-time computing;convergence;topology table;computer science;distributed computing;network on a chip;tree;network topology;computer network;logical topology	EDA	2.2366861833621035	62.688749454130274	118146

By nature, WSNs are resource-constrained, fragile, complex to analyse, and failure-prone. Naturally, with the growing number of installations, it is becoming fundamental to efficiently diagnose failures as soon as possible, in order to deal with the underlying causes. In accordance with this, from 2005 onwards, the offer of diagnostic tools has been increasing, as the other base technologies (e.g. networking, operating system, localisation, synchronisation) become reasonably stable. The purpose of this survey is to provide an overview of existing post-deployment WSN diagnostic tools, by briefly presenting their functionality, architecture and constraints, in order to enable a basic understating of each tool. The survey also includes a multi-dimensional comparative analysis of the various tools, based on a proposed classification scheme and evaluation criteria, as well as an identification of the main open research issues. Although the number of diagnostic tools is high and considerable work has been done in this area, we conclude that there are still several challenges concerning post-deployment WSN diagnostic tools, regarding scope, flexibility, generality, mobility and security. Moreover, there is a need for mature, native diagnostic-oriented functionality in WSN platforms and operating systems.	comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;open research;operating system;qualitative comparative analysis;software deployment	André Rodrigues;Tiago Camilo;Jorge Sá Silva;Fernando Boavida	2012	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-012-9240-6	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.352413641693088	72.53064415339779	118231

This technique is first applied to create a smart illumination system that uses a single LED as both light source and sensor. We then present several devices that use an LED as a generic wireless serial data port. An important implication of this work is that every LED connected to a microprocessor can be thought of as a wireless two-way communication port. We present this technology as a solution to the “last centimeter problem”, because it permits disparate devices to communicate with each other simply and cheaply with minimal design modification.

6cbd60e98ccae31291a1e4d56656c00b29810ec6	simulation evaluation algorithms of lsrp and dvrp in bank network		Because the computational complexity of high usability analysis is too high when selecting the routing protocol in the bank network plan, a simple measurement method of high usability for banks is proposed to solve this problem in the article. First, establish a simulation environment which is close to the real network of banks to offer the measurement environment and data. Second, based on the theoretical comparison of LSRP and DVRP, establish the simple simulation measurement algorithm by Shannon’s information entropy theory. Finally, evaluate the degree of high usability of LSRP and DVRP in the bank network by this algorithm. The result of simulation shows that (1) the simulation is close to the periodic rule of the statistical data group in real environment, (2) the deviation ratio is less than 0.1, and (3) the covariance is unequal to 0. And the result indicates that the simulation is connected with the real environment and both are very close, and the simulation environment can offer effective data. The computation result of the simple simulation measurement algorithm shows that the time cost differences of LSRP and DVRP exist in the period of fault recovering, which indicates the simple measurement algorithm is effective.	algorithm;central processing unit;computation;computational complexity theory;distance-vector routing protocol;entropy (information theory);shannon (unit);simulation;usability	Feixue Huang;Yong Zhou;Zhijie Li	2010	Computer and Information Science		mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;statistics	HPC	3.9778061079067797	72.9544017388255	119190

In this paper we propose HyDMA, a low-latency inter-core DMA approach based on a hybrid packetcircuit switching NoC. With dynamic setup and lengthening of circuit channels composing of bidirectional links, HyDMA can achieve both high flexibility of packet switching and low communication latency of circuit switching for concurrent DMA transfers.

In this paper , we explore architectural solutions to leverage the design elements of Passive Optical Cross-Connection Networks with Multiple P lanes (POXN/MPs) and Passive Optical Cross-Connection Networks with Multiple Planes and Bundled Ports (POXN /MP-BPs), both of which consist primarily of passive optical fabrics and optical transceivers that replace groups of switches in hierarchic al networks. Through simple physical interconnections, ou r proposed architectures allow datacenter network (DCN) to increment ally scale out in network capacity. From developed formulas for calculating cost and power consumption, we demonstrate that POXN /MP-BPs can significantly reduce the cost and power consumpti on of datacenter networks compared to the traditional DCNs. To lower overhead and adapt to the types of real datacenter scen arios that are possible with POXN /MP-BPs, we propose the new Multiple Channels with Bundled Po rts Distributed Access Protocol (MCBDAP), which outperforms the Multiple Channels Distribut ed Access Protocol (MCDAP) for POXN /MP in terms of bandwidth efficiency, especially for those applications involving highe r proportions of inter-rack tra ffic than intra-rack tra ffic.	algorithm;broadcasting (networking);data center;dynamic circuit network;fat tree;mp/m;multicast;multitier architecture;network performance;network switch;optical switch;overhead (computing);passive optical network;scalability;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput;transceiver;transmitter	Pei Jin;Changcheng Huang	2017	Optical Switching and Networking	10.1016/j.osn.2017.05.001	control reconfiguration;scalability;computer network;distributed computing;computer science;design elements and principles;transceiver;optical switch;port (computer networking);spectral efficiency;communication channel	Networks	1.9812874478117062	62.045542855407454	119672
fe2600e0c17f58514ebc3df8b17ca8086d14919c	poster: beyond static sending intervals for sensor node energy estimation		Several aspects have to be considered in order to develop energy efficient sensor networks with a lifetime of several years under outdoor conditions. These aspects include the battery types, the energy consumption of the platform for various operational states as well as several other aspects such as the communication pattern influenced by the position in the network and the propagation conditions. In this paper, we present results from a long term measurement study to characterize the traffic required to transfer the required sensor data and analyze the required overhead. Our results show that simple assumptions on sending intervals do not reflect reality and need to be reconsidered when modeling the energy consumption of sensor nodes, especially under harsh environmental conditions.	overhead (computing);sensor node;software propagation	Silvia Krug;Axl Schreiber;Michael Rink	2017		10.1145/3124087.3124100	wireless sensor network;battery (electricity);efficient energy use;real-time computing;energy consumption;sensor node;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;engineering	Mobile	9.354367351184562	73.5813560343866	119708

Reactive thermal management, which sets temperature thresholds to trigger thermal capping actions, is too """"near-sighted"""", and it may lead to severe performance degradation and thermal overshoots. More aggressive proactive thermal management minimizes performance penalty with smooth optimal control, but it requires the knowledge of the system thermal models to be precise. Unfortunately, in practice these models are not provided by equipment manufacturers, and they strongly depend on the deployment environment. Hence, we need to develop procedures to derive thermal models automatically in the field. In this paper, we focus on static thermal model learning. We tackle the problem in a real-life context: we developed a complete infrastructure for model-building and thermal data collection in the Linux environment, and we tested it on an Intel Nehalem-based server CPU. Model building is based on a least-square procedure which extracts the model linking power dissipation with temperature in steady-state conditions.

The crosstalk problem is solved by routing messages using time division multiplexing (TDM) approach. This paper focuses on minimizing the number of groups (time slots) required to realize a permutation. Many researchers concentrated on this NP-hard problem and concluded that AI algorithms perform better than the heuristic algorithms. They also showed that majority of the times the performance of genetic algorithm (GA) was better than simulated annealing algorithm (SAA). In this research, we implement a new approach to minimize the number of passes required for scheduling a given permutation. A combinational method is developed which comprises the use of Bayesian inference method on GA and SAA to always guarantee the best solution, instead of only using either GA or SAA. Simulations are performed in Java using multiple threads to run SA and GAA in parallel and to evaluate the performance of the new method. The results are then compared to those obtained from GA and SAA.	combinational logic;computer simulation;crosstalk;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);java;multiplexing;multistage amplifier;multistage interconnection networks;np-hardness;network switch;order by;routing;scheduling (computing);software release life cycle;the times	Ajay K.

This paper proposes an alternative method, one based on the turn model for designing wormhole routing algorithms. The turn model produces routing algorithms that are deadlock free, very adaptive, minimal or nonminimal, and livelock free for direct networks--whether or not they contain virtual channels. This paper illustrates how to modify the routing algorithms produced by the turn model to handle dynamic faults. This paper first describes how to modify the negative-first routing algorithm, which the turn model produces for n-dimensional meshes without virtual channels, to make it one-fault tolerant. Simulations of the one-fault-tolerant routing algorithm and other minimal and nonminimal routing algorithms in a two-dimensional mesh indicate that misrouting increases communication latencies significantly at high throughputs. The conclusion is that misrouting should be used only for increasing the degree of fault tolerance, never for just increasing adaptiveness. Finally , the paper describes how to modify the negative-first routing algorithm to make it (n - 1)-fault tolerant for n-dimensional meshes without virtual channels.	routing	Dong Xiang	2001	IEEE Trans.

4b0b2a386890c065dbd9eb6bc228d3f336663ffc	mitigating observability loss of toggle-based x-masking via scan chain partitioning		The Toggle-based <italic>X</italic>-masking method requires a single toggle at a given cycle, there is a chance that non-<italic>X</italic> values are also masked. Hence, the non-<italic>X</italic> value over-masking problem may cause a fault coverage degradation. In this paper, a scan chain partitioning scheme is described to alleviate non-<italic>X </italic> bit over-masking problem arising from Toggle-based <italic>X</italic>-Masking method. The scan chain partitioning method finds a scan chain combination that gives the least toggling conflicts. The experimental results show that the amount of over-masked bits is significantly reduced, and it is further reduced when the proposed method is incorporated with <italic>X</italic>-canceling method. However, as the number of scan chain partitions increases, the control data for decoder increases. To reduce a control data overhead, this paper exploits a Huffman coding based data compression. Assuming two partitions, the size of control bits is even smaller than the conventional <italic>X </italic>-toggling method that uses only one decoder. In addition, selection rules of <italic>X</italic>-bits delivered to <italic>X</italic>-Canceling MISR are also proposed. With the selection rules, a significant test time increase can be prevented.	data compression;data masking;elegant degradation;fault coverage;feature toggle;floppy disk;huffman coding;overhead (computing);recursion;selection rule;switch;unsharp masking	Sae-Eun Kim;Jaeyong Chung;Joon-Sung Yang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.2018.2801847	computer science;parallel computing;fault coverage;huffman coding;real-time computing;scan chain;decoding methods;data compression;observability;masking (art);exploit	EDA	7.7192635532857485	62.11542308747287	120174

We explore the usage of POSE, our Parallel Object-oriented Simulation Environment, for application performance prediction on large parallel machines such as BlueGene. This study involves the simulation of communication at the packet level through a detailed network model. This presents an extremely fine-grained simulation: events correspond to the transmission and receipt of packets. Computation is minimal, communication dominates, and strong dependencies between events result in a low degree of parallelism. There is limited look-ahead capability since the outcome of many events is determined by the application whose performance the simulation is predicting. Thus conservative synchronization approaches are challenging for this type of problem. We present recent experiences and performance results for our network simulator and illustrate the utility of our simulator through prediction and validation studies for a molecular dynamics application.	blue gene;computation;degree of parallelism;interconnection;molecular dynamics;network model;network packet;parallel computing;performance prediction;simulation	Terry Wilmarth;Gengbin Zheng;Eric J.

The Network Coding (NC) is adopted in the proposed architecture. Compared with the traditional NoC design, the proposed NoC architecture can improve the data throughput and decrease the hardware complexity. In the proposed architecture the process elements are connected with the logical network, which is established with interconnected local mono-direction buses. The proposed architecture inherits the advantages both bus and traditional NoC, and provides the possibility for NC. From the analysis and case studies, we find that the proposed architecture can enhance the performance of NoC with NC.	linear network coding;local bus;multicast;network on a chip;throughput	Jian-Hao Hu;Si-wei Zhang	2011	2011 6th International ICST Conference on Communications and Networking in China (CHINACOM)	10.1109/ChinaCom.2011.6158330	embedded system;parallel computing;linear network coding;intelligent computer network;network architecture;engineering;local bus;network on a chip;bus network;computer network	Arch	1.6063057998620285	64.50133744504222	121702
e42b539f6254fb5c3b22000794eba4dc40ab05ee	destination-based congestion awareness for adaptive routing in 2d mesh networks	on chip networks;adaptive routing	The choice of routing algorithm plays a vital role in the performance of on-chip interconnection networks. Adaptive routing is appealing because it offers better latency and throughput than oblivious routing, especially under nonuniform and bursty traffic. The performance of an adaptive routing algorithm is determined by its ability to accurately estimate congestion in the network. In this regard, maintaining global congestion state using a separate monitoring network offers better congestion visibility into distant parts of the network compared to solutions relying only on local congestion. However, the main challenge in designing such routing schemes is to keep the logic and bandwidth overhead as low as possible to fit into the tight power, area, and delay budgets of on-chip routers. In this article, we propose a minimal destination-based adaptive routing strategy (DAR), where every node estimates the delay to every other node in the network, and routing decisions are based on these per-destination delay estimates. DAR outperforms Regional Congestion Awareness (RCA), the best previously known adaptive routing algorithm that uses nonlocal congestion state. The performance improvement is brought about by maintaining fine-grained per-destination delay estimates in DAR that are more accurate than regional congestion metrics measured in RCA. The increased accuracy is a consequence of the fact that the per-destination delay estimates are not corrupted by congestion on links outside the admissible routing paths to the destination. A scalable version of DAR, referred to as SDAR, is also proposed for minimizing the overheads associated with DAR in large network topologies. We show that DAR outperforms local adaptive routing by up to 79% and RCA by up to 58% in terms of latency on SPLASH-2 benchmarks. DAR and SDAR also outperform existing adaptive and oblivious routing algorithms in latency and throughput under synthetic traffic patterns on 8×8 and 16times;16 mesh topologies, respectively.	algorithm;awareness;global network;interconnection;mesh networking;network congestion;network topology;nonlocal lagrangian;overhead (computing);router (computing);routing;scalability;synthetic intelligence;tcp congestion control;throughput	Rohit Sunkam Ramanujam;Bill Lin	2013	ACM Trans.

In most cases, these protocols require that all network access be through the operating system, which adds significant overhead to both the transmission path (typically a system call and data copy) and the receive path (typically an interrupt, a system call, and a data copy). To address this performance problem, several user-level communication architectures have been developed that remove the operating system from the critical communication path. 1,2 In this article, we describe six important issues to consider in designing communication protocols for user-level architectures. The issues we have selected focus on the performance and semantics of a communication system. The first, the data transfer mechanism a protocol uses, significantly affects latency and throughput. Direct memory access usually gives the best throughput in user-level communication, but to avoid unnecessary copying, sophisticated address translation mechanisms are needed, another important design issue. To make user-level protocols feasible in a multiprogramming environment, designers also need protection mechanisms that do not rely on operating system intervention. Network packets are received using some control transfer mechanism—either polling or interrupts, each of which has its advantages and drawbacks. The last issues we focus on are reliability and multicast, which in modern networks can be supported both on the host processor and the network interface. To provide a basis for analyzing these issues, we present a simple network interface protocol for Myricom's Myrinet network. 3 As the sidebar """" The Myrinet Network """" describes, Myrinet has a programmable network interface. Researchers can thus explore many protocol design options, and several groups have designed communication systems for Myrinet. In this article, we refer to 11 such systems. Table 1 lists the characteristics of each. As the table shows, the systems differ significantly in how they resolve the design issues we describe, but all aim for high performance and provide a lean, low-level, and more or less generic communication facility. Figure 1 shows the operation of our simple network interface protocol for Myrinet. Operation begins when a user process of the sending host—host A—invokes a simple send primitive to send a data packet. Because the protocol sends packets with a maximum payload of 256 bytes, users must fragment their data so that each fragment fits in a packet.

Traditionally, researchers would run a serial network simulator on a workstation for a time period to obtain certain results. However, as the demand to simulate larger and more complex networks increases, the limited computing capacity of a single workstation and the limited simulation capability of a single network simulator have become apparent obstacles to the simulationists. In this thesis we develop techniques that can scale up a simulation to address the limited capacity of a single workstation, as well as techniques that can compose a simulation from different simulator components to address the limited capability of a single network simulator. We scale up a simulation with two different approaches, namely (1) reducing resource requirement of a simulation so that larger simulation can fit into one single workstation; and (2) partitioning a simulation model in a way that makes the best use of the resources of the available computer cluster, and distribute the simulation onto the different processors of the computer cluster to obtain the best parallel simulation performance. On the other hand we also consider techniques for building complex network simulations by composing from independent components. When different existing simulators excel at different protocol layers/scenarios, we can make each simulator execute the layers where it excels, using a simulation backplane to be the interface between different simulators. In this thesis, we demonstrate that these techniques enable us to not only scale up simulations by orders of magnitude with a good performance, but also compose complex simulations with high fidelity.	composability;scalability;simulation	Donghua Xu	2006			real-time computing;computer architecture simulator;simulation;computer science;network simulation;distributed computing;simulation language;network traffic simulation	HPC	-1.934101375036232	65.6549719559024	122660
64801b80a85536146efd7ccf369956110b36e733	pdds: scalable sensor data distribution for cyber-physical systems using gpgpus		In many cyber-physical systems (CPS), one of the primary challenges is how to disseminate many sensor streams to collaborating entities in a timely, reliable, and scalable manner. However, in CPS, communication and related computation is often unstable and constitutes a serial bottleneck when multiple sensor streams need to be distributed. In this paper, we propose a novel publish-subscribe middleware architecture, called parallel data distribution service (PDDS), to address this problem. To bypass this serial bottleneck effectively, PDDS exploits state-space models for sensor streams both at a publisher and its subscribers. These models are used to estimate true states of monitored physical processes without actual communication. This approach not only reduces the communication overhead significantly, but also provides the tolerance against potential delays and instability in communication. Further, with the model-based methods, many sensor streams can be accessed in parallel since sensor streams can bypass a serial bottleneck, such as network stacks. At the middleware layer, PDDS processes the model-related computation, such as the state estimation, in parallel using modern embedded general-purpose computing on graphics processing units, enabling highly scalable and energy-efficient processing of massive sensor streams. The proposed approach is implemented in a data distribution service middleware using CUDA. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach can achieve significant energy savings and much higher scalability compared to baseline approaches.	baseline (configuration management);cuda;central processing unit;computation;computer graphics;control theory;cyber-physical system;data distribution service;embedded system;entity;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;general-purpose markup language;graphics processing unit;instability;middleware;overhead (computing);parallel computing;performance evaluation;publish–subscribe pattern;simd;scalability;sensor web;state space;statistical model	Woochul Kang;Jibum Kim	2018	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2018.2820808	distributed computing;streams;architecture;data distribution service;computer science;cyber-physical system;scalability;instability;bottleneck;middleware	HPC	-2.821677855160581	63.707778481827695	122674

Being a basic and popular structure, the mesh network has wide application range as the result of some of its topology features. Meanwhile, as an important variant of hypercube, the Exchanged Crossed Cube(ECQ) combines advantages of crossed cube and exchanged hypercube, i.e. the promotion of network performance and the reduce of communication cost. To enlarge the application range of the ECQ, this paper discusses the embedding strategies of Mesh network into ECQ and proposes 4 methods to embed meshes into ECQ. We distinguish these methods by comparing their dilation, expansion, loading and congestion. The comparison result shows that compromise among four of the above parameters has to be made to achieve the improvement of some parameters.	cube;mesh networking	Xinyang Wang;Deyu Qi;Naqin Zhou	2018	Journal of Interconnection Networks	10.1142/S0219265918500111	cube;mesh networking;polygon mesh;hypercube;interconnection;distributed computing;dilation (morphology);network performance;compromise;computer science	Theory	1.1120123530567765	68.67398455702701	122820

It improves the efficiency, modularity, and scalability of the system, and optimizes use of event triggers. For IoTH, BLE - a subset of the recent Bluetooth v4.0 stack - provides a low-power and loosely coupled mechanism for sensor data collection with ubiquitous units (e.g., smartphones and tablets) carried by humans. This fundamental design paradigm of BLE is enabled by a range of broadcast advertising modes. While its operational benefits are numerous, the lack of a common time reference in the broadcast mode of BLE has been a fundamental limitation. This article presents and describes CheepSync, a time synchronization service for BLE advertisers, especially tailored for applications requiring high time precision on resource constrained BLE platforms. Designed on top of the existing Bluetooth v4.0 standard, the CheepSync framework utilizes low-level timestamping and comprehensive error compensation mechanisms for overcoming uncertainties in message transmission, clock drift, and other system-specific constraints. CheepSync was implemented on custom designed nRF24Cheep beacon platforms (as broadcasters) and commercial off-the-shelf Android ported smartphones (as passive listeners). We demonstrate the efficacy of CheepSync by numerous empirical evaluations in a variety of experimental setups, and show that its average (single-hop) time synchronization accuracy is in the 10 μs range.	android;bluetooth;clock drift;clock synchronization;crowdsourcing;data mule;distributed computing;energy profile (chemistry);high- and low-level;humans;internet of things;loose coupling;low-power broadcasting;programming paradigm;requirement;scalability;smartphone;tablet computer	Sabarish Sridhar;Prasant Misra;Gurinder Singh Gill;Jay Warrior	2016	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2016.7378439	embedded system;synchronization;transmitter;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;bluetooth;computer network	Mobile	7.623378141790138	69.01996969477008	123700

The current practice of server overheating detection is to monitor the server inlet temperature with the temperature sensor on the server enclosure, or the CPU temperature with on-die thermal sensors. However, this is in contrast to the fact that different components in a server may have different overheating thresholds, which are closely related to their respective thermal failure rates and expected lifetimes. Moreover, the thermal correlation between the inlet (or CPU) and other server components can be different for every server model. As a result, relying on the single inlet or CPU temperature for server overheating detection is over-simplistic, which may lead to either degraded detection performance or false alarms that can result in excessive cooling power, leading to unnecessarily low inlet temperature. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach that leverages thermal dynamics to intelligently choose sensor placement locations for precise overheating server component detection. We first formulate the detection problem as a constrained optimization problem. We then adopt Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to establish the thermal model and analyze the thermal status of the server enclosure under various overheating conditions, such as inlet overheating, fan failures and CPU overloading. Based on the CFD analysis, we apply data fusion and advanced optimization techniques to find a near-optimal solution for sensor placement locations, such that the probability of detecting different overheating components is significantly improved. Our empirical results on a real rack server testbed demonstrate the detection performance of our solution. Extensive simulation results also show that the proposed solution outperforms other commonly used overheating monitoring solutions in terms of detection probability and error rate.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);central processing unit;computation;computational fluid dynamics;computer cooling;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);data center;function overloading;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;sensor;server (computing);simulated annealing;simulation;testbed	Xiaodong Wang;Xiaorui Wang;Guoliang Xing;Cheng-Xian Lin	2012	2012 International Green Computing Conference (IGCC)	10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322273	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;engineering	Metrics	-3.741388814868118	60.968251857034176	124447

New technologies of integration now enable the design of computing systems with hundreds and even thousands of independent processing elements which can cooperate on the solution of the same problem for a corresponding improvement in the execution time. However, as the number of processing units increases, concerns for reliability and continued operation of the system in the presence of failures must be addressed. Adaptive routing algorithms have been frequently suggested as a means of improving communication performance in large-scale massively parallel computers, Multiprocessors System-on-Chip (MP-SoCs), and peer-to-peer communication networks. Before such schemes can be successfully incorporated in networks, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the factors which affect their performance potential. This paper proposes a novel analytical model to investigate the performance of five prominent adaptive routings in wormhole-switched 2-D tori fortified with an effective scheme suggested by Chalasani and Boppana [S. Chalasani, R.V. Boppana, Adaptive wormhole routing in tori with faults, IEE Proc. Comput. Digit. Tech. 42(6) (1995) 386–394], as an instance of a fault-tolerant method widely used in the literature to achieve high adaptivity and support inter-processor communications in parallel computers.

3099603e0d7c5197418fc801d59b415c45dbb4f3	handling large-scale data using two-tier hierarchical super-peer p2p network		In the ever-expanding world of IoT, data has not only increased in volume and velocity but has also moved from residing in centralized nodes to distributed nodes across multiple locations. Traditional data clustering technologies, based on centralized operations, cannot be scaled to efficiently manage Big Data, thus creating a need for clustering in distributed environments. To address the problem of modularity, flexibility, and scalability, a dynamic hierarchical two-tier architecture and model for cooperative clustering in distributed super-peer P2P network is presented in this paper. The proposed model is called Distributed Cooperative Clustering in super-peer P2P networks (DCCP2P). It involves a hierarchy of two layers of P2P neighborhoods. In the first layer, peers in each neighborhood are responsible for building local cooperative sub-clusters from the local data. Each node sends a summarized view of local data to its super-peer in a form of sub-cluster's centroids extracted from the local cooperative clustering, minimizing the exchange of information between nodes and their super-peers. In the next layer, sub-clusters are merged at each super-peer and at the root of the hierarchy, where one global clustering can be derived. The distributed cooperative approach finds globally optimized clusters and achieves significant improvement in global clustering solutions without the cost of centralized clustering.	big data;centralized computing;cluster analysis;cooperative mimo;global serializability;multitier architecture;peer-to-peer;scalability;velocity (software development)	Rasha Kashef;Akshat Niranjan	2017		10.1145/3175684.3175726	artificial intelligence;machine learning;architecture;speedup;cluster analysis;scalability;modularity;big data;computer science;exchange of information;hierarchy	DB	2.3286508760871523	72.46488844024587	124979

57f995cabf626f00d1295a073114cf6777ec10ef	itubee: a software oriented lightweight block cipher		In this paper, we propose a software oriented lightweight block cipher, ITUbee. The cipher is especially suitable for resource constrained devices including an 8-bit microcontroller such as sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. For a sensor node one of the most important constraints is the low energy consumption because of the limited battery power. Also, the memory on sensor nodes are restricted. We have simulated the performance of ITUbee in the AVR ATtiny45 microcontroller using the integrated development platform Atmel Studio 6. We have evaluated the memory usage and clock cycles needed for an encryption. The number of clock cycles gives a metric for energy consumption. The simulation results show that ITUbee is a competitive block cipher on 8-bit software platforms in terms of energy consumption. Also, less memory requirement of the cipher is remarkable. In addition, we have shown that the attacks which are effective on software oriented lightweight block ciphers can not reduce the 80-bit security level of ITUbee.	block cipher	Ferhat Karakoç;Hüseyin Demirci;A.

A dynamic control policy that utilizes the maximal matching (for scheduling) and the join-the-shortest-queue (for routing) discipline, is shown to maximize the throughput and stabilize the system in a sense called “uniform mean recurrence time property” under fairly mild stochastic assumptions. Owing to the non-Markovian nature of the states, system stability is established using a perturbed Lyapunov function method.	directed acyclic graph;lyapunov fractal;matching (graph theory);maximal set;poincaré recurrence theorem;routing;scheduling (computing);semantic network;stochastic process;throughput	Ying-Chao Hung;George Michailidis	2012	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2011.2164012	stochastic process;mathematical optimization;routing;throughput;von neumann stability analysis;stability;lyapunov function;pattern matching;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing;queueing theory;computational model;server;scientific control;statistics	Embedded	3.5369779590816046	67.4112835882677	125419

While a large part of the design of such networks will rely on the engineering of physical aspects, such as developing technology for efficient energy harvesting, sensing, and communication, a significant role will also be played by the algorithms underlying the operation of nodes to ensure that optimal use is made of the limited supply of energy. This paper discusses concepts that will facilitate the design of such algorithms, such as spike-based encoding of signals and data aggregation through gossiping. We propose a method to extract information from a sensor network using nonpacket spike-based communication with local interactions between nodes. Rather than gathering sensor values from each individual node and sending them to a central destination node, measurements from the nodes are processed through the interactions between nodes, while diffusing in the network, to obtain an integrated value characteristic for all nodes' measurements.	action potential;algorithm;data aggregation;gnu nano;interaction;power supply	Ferdinand Peper;Kenji Leibnitz;Jun-nosuke Teramae;Tetsuya Shimokawa;Naoki Wakamiya	2016	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2015.2472291	embedded system;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;wireless;encoding;computer network	Mobile	9.360248969607323	74.4357410174183	125544

Deadlock states have been observed in existing computer networks emphasizing the need for carefully designed flow control procedures (controllers) to avoid deadlocks. Such a deadlock-free controller is readily found if we allow it global information about the overall network state. Generally, this assumption is not realistic, and we must resort to deadlock free local controllers using only packet and node information. We present here several types of such controllers, we study their relationship and give a proof of their optimality with respect to deadlock free controllers using the same set of local parameters.	computer;deadlock;network packet;network switch;packet switching	Sam Toueg;Jeffrey D.

Switch modules are interconnected only at the outputs by multiplexers. The partitioned switch fabric provides a flexible distributed architecture, which is the key to simplify the operation and maintenance of the whole switching system. The modularity implies less stringent synchronization requirements and makes higher-speed implementation possible. The proposed modular switch is intended to meet the needs of broadband telephone offices of all sizes.

It's important to know their dynamic power consumption before optimization. Current research focuses on simulation, or integrating software probes inside the node. They are not always applicable. We proposed an energy efficiency testbed for wireless sensor nodes. It is portable and can realtime sample the data of power consumption. Our device, based on measurements of current and voltage information, enables accurate energy efficiency analysis of nodes in real world. It's useful for evaluating and modeling a new platform at design phase. Moreover, it can be used to monitor health status of sensor nodes from the aspect of power.

There are several options for providing data communication between these field devices and traffic management centers (TMC). Wireless networks are attractive due to their relatively lower cost and ease of deployment compared to fixed networks. However, these face unique security and signal interference problems, and deploying new wireless networks can require significant equipment investment. In this work, a new extremely low-cost wireless strategy for ITS network communication is presented. This approach applies control channels of the Network Trunking System (NTS), a licensed radio frequency to support the voice communication, to control DMS operation under the National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocol (NTCIP). Because the NTS network has already installed in the metropolitan, urban, and rural areas in Oklahoma, it provides a cheap deployment solution requiring only additional adapter devices. Long term operation and maintenance costs can further be amortized between voice and data services. The proposed technique is compared to the existing ITS wireless networking strategies and hybrid network strategies merging wired and wireless networks deployed in Oklahoma. Details of the strategy for using wireless networking in the Oklahoma ITS and experiences with wireless ITS device deployment are also provided.	amortized analysis;byte;data rate units;geforce 9 series;interference (communication);interrupt;modem;network topology;null-terminated string;radio frequency;replication (computing);sensor;software deployment;traffic message channel;trunking;uncompressed video	Ekasit Vorakitolan;Joseph P.

The first of the new algorithms called simple sender side CCT is similar to the original, but busy waiting is eliminated. Results presented show that simple sender side CCT avoids performance problems that can be caused by busy waiting.The second new algorithm called receive side CCT employs a different strategy for updating channel clocks and determining which objects should be scheduled on critical channels. Performance results show that this version provides better scaling with respect to the connectivity of the model, at the expense of some added complexity.	algorithm;blocking (computing);busy waiting;computational complexity theory;image scaling;scalability;simulation	Rob Simmonds;Cameron Kiddle;Brian W.

d71776f988cc754a4a73299f350adaa94390bb81	an optimal permutation routing algorithm on full-duplex hexagonal networks	permutation routing	In the permutation routing problem, each processor is the origin of at most one packet and the destination of no more than one packet. The goal is to minimize the number of time steps required to route all packets to their respective destinations, under the constraint that each link can be crossed simultaneously by no more than one packet. We study this problem in a hexagonal network, i.e. a finite subgraph of a triangular grid, which is a widely used network in practical applications. We present an optimal distributed permutation routing algorithm on full-duplex hexagonal networks, using the addressing scheme described by F.G. Nocetti, I. Stojmenović and J. Zhang (IEEE TPDS 13(9): 962-971, 2002). Furthermore, we prove that this algorithm is oblivious and translation invariant.	addressing scheme;algorithm;cr rao advanced institute of mathematics, statistics and computer science;duplex (telecommunications);ivan stojmenović;magma;network packet;routing;shortest path problem;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Janez Zerovnik;Ignasi Sau	2008	Discrete Mathematics & Theoretical Computer Science		mathematical optimization;routing;combinatorics;static routing;discrete mathematics;source routing;dsrflow;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;permutation graph;mathematics;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;geographic routing	Theory	0.4877927897822335	70.7625721522864	127322

The proposed method utilizes two types of redundancies to reduce the recovery cost, that is, data redundancy, meaning that data block may be compressed to a smaller size, and storage space redundancy, meaning that disk array may have unused storage space. To utilize these redundancies, the code rate of erasure correction coding is adaptively determined depending on the compressed data size and available storage space. Results of a simple simulation show that the proposed method can reduce the recovery cost without affecting the response time of failure-free operations. For a disk array of 6 disks with average compression ratio 0.6 and utilization ratio 0.7, the read data amount for single-failure recovery is reduced by a factor of 0.24.	adaptive coding;code rate;data compression;data redundancy;disk array;floppy-disk controller;response time (technology);simulation	Haruhiko Kaneko	2015	2015 IEEE 21st Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing (PRDC)	10.1109/PRDC.2015.13	data compression;erasure code;reliability engineering;chlorine;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer hardware;computer science;disk mirroring;redundancy;encoding;statistics	Arch	7.566618599313709	62.59087738522458	127469

This paper classifies the effects of transient single bit-flip fault injections into the FlexRay communication controller. In this protocol, when an injected fault is activated, this may result in one or more error types, i.e.: Boundary violation, Conflict, Content, Freeze, Synchronization, Syntax, and Invalid frame. To study the activated faults, a FlexRay bus network, composed of four nodes, was modeled by Verilog HDL; and a total of 135,600 transient faults was injected in only one node, called the target node. The results show that only 9,342 of the faults (about 6.9%) were activated and their effects were observed in the network nodes. The results also show that the Synchronization error is the widespread error with the occurrence rate of 70.1%. The Invalid frame, Boundary violation, Syntax, Content, Freeze, and Conflict errors have the occurrence rates of 51.1%, 32.4%, 24.6%, 20.6%, 17.3%, and 0.0%, respectively. Among the error types, the Freeze errors are the most critical errors as they mostly result in system failures. The results also show that most of the activated faults, about 75.3%, were observed simultaneously in the target node and a neighbor node. About 11.1% of the activated faults were observed only in the target node and about 13.5% only in the neighbor node.	bus network;communications protocol;fault model;fault tolerance;flexray;front-end processor;hardware description language;verilog	Yasser Sedaghat;Seyed Ghassem Miremadi	2010	J.

This is achieved by maintaining a table, which contains information about the communication nodes that take part in the formation of parallel disjoint paths. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which is illustrated by a model computer network. Modification in finding parallel routes on the basis of the connectivity matrix, without reducing its rows and columns to zero, is suggested.	adjacency matrix;column (database);information exchange;parallel algorithm;table (database);telecommunications network	Boncho Aleksandrov;Petko Kochevski	2012		10.1145/2383276.2383311	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	HPC	0.873733897900064	69.77249991724577	127732

b4adccdd82b6638497746122b98abfb88917215e	on the utilization of system-on-chip platforms to achieve nanosecond synchronization accuracies in substation automation systems	communications system on chip substation automation systems;synchronization hardware ip networks field programmable gate arrays protocols topology substations	A synchronized common sense of time is a key factor for many smart grid applications, such as the sample value process bus operation. The precision time protocol (PTP), as defined in IEEE 1588-2008 standard, is highly recommended for substation communication networks, because it enables synchronization accuracies in the nanoseconds range through conventional Ethernet-based networks. This paper explores the implementation of PTP functionalities on new Xilinx Zynq-7000 all programmable system-on-chip (SoC) device. Different PTP master and slave implementations have been analyzed taking benefit from the flexibility of the SoC all programmable devices. The explored features go from simple only-software versions aided by PTP support of Gigabit Media Access Controllers (GMACs)embedded in the processor section to high-accuracy solutions that include custom PTP hardware in the logic section of the device. For each configuration approach, two different experimental setups based on two Zynq commercial low-cost boards has been built, and the protocol performance has been evaluated by measuring time offset between the pulse per second output signals of the master and the synchronized slave. The results obtained from this analysis show excellent accuracy results, with time offsets in the range of 40 ns and standard deviations of less than 10 ns.	arm architecture;automation;bus network;clock signal;complex network;control function (econometrics);experiment;gigabit;network congestion;precision time protocol;requirement;sas;semiconductor intellectual property core;slave clock;software versioning;synchronization (computer science);system on a chip;systemverilog;telecommunications network;timer;traction substation;transmitter	Naiara Moreira;Jesús Lázaro;Unai Bidarte;Jaime Jimenez;Armando Astarloa	2017	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2015.2512440	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;engineering	Embedded	5.884225865893435	67.83800571537635	128380

This parallelism may lead to flows with packets out-of-order when leaving the NP system. But packet reordering has a bad impact on network performance, especially when using the dominating TCP protocol. In this paper, we describe a Hardware Re-Sequencer Unit for Network Processors. Incoming packets will be tagged in the ingress path, preserving the packet order with flow granularity. An Aggregation Unit reorders the packet flows in the egress path if needed. In contrast to most other solutions the way of the packet through the NP system is dispensable, which enlarges design freedom in terms of e.g. load balancing. After explaining the general concept, a SystemC model is presented. Simulation results are used for dimensioning and a proof of concept with real traffic traces. General aspects concerning the implementation are discussed.	microsequencer;network processor	Michael Meitinger;Rainer Ohlendorf;Thomas Wild;Andreas Herkersdorf	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-78153-0_8	traffic generation model;embedded system;link state packet;parallel computing;real-time computing;packet analyzer;network packet;packet generator;computer science;out-of-order execution;packet segmentation;processing delay;load balancing;operating system;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;packet forwarding;transmission delay;network performance;packet loss;packet switch;proof of concept;burst switching;network processor	Arch	-2.7560994947212745	68.32896351427807	128608

These procedures are used to dynamically partitipn the multiprocessor into many subsystems, and reconfigure them to form a variety commonly used topologies to match task graphs. By examining the switching capability of the interconnection network, design rules for avoiding connection conflicts are exploited. Then, on the basis of these rules, parallel procedures are designed. With the procedures, a subsystem can be reconfigured in the form of the desired topologies without interfering with other subsystems. In addition, the reconfiguration of a subsystem can be accomplished in constant time, independently of subsystem size.	disk partitioning;multiprocessing;multistage interconnection networks;time complexity	Woei Lin;Chuan-lin Wu	1986	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.1986.1676683	embedded system;parallel processing;parallel computing;multiprocessing;data processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;programming language;algorithm	Arch	-1.3766894208349678	68.38841338589485	129843

A trip-based model is proposed to support adaptive, distributed, and deadlock-free multiple multicast on any network with arbitrary topology using at most two virtual channels per physical channel. This model signiicantly generalizes the path-based model proposed earlier 21, 22], which works only for Hamiltonian networks and can not be applicable to networks with arbitrary topology resulted due to system faults. Fundamentals of the trip-based model, including the necessary and suucient condition to be deadlock-free, and the use of appropriate number of virtual channels to avoid deadlock are investigated. The potential of this model is illustrated by applying it to hypercubes with faulty nodes. Simulation results indicate that the proposed model can implement multiple multicast on faulty hypercubes with negligible performance degradation.	deadlock;elegant degradation;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);multicast;node (computer science);routing;simulation	Yu-Chee Tseng;Dhabaleswar K.

Since the register file is in the critical path of the processor pipeline, any reliable design that increases either the pressure on the register file or the register file access latency is not desirable. In this paper, we propose to exploit narrow-width register values, which present the majority of the generated values, for duplicating a copy of the value within the same data item, called in-register duplication (IRD), eliminating the requirement of additional copy registers. The datapath pipeline is augmented to efficiently incorporate parity encoding and parity checking such that error recovery is seamlessly supported in IRD and the parity checking is overlapped with the execution stage to avoid increasing the critical path. Our experimental evaluation using the SPEC CINT2000 benchmark suite shows that IRD provides superior read-with-duplicate (RWD) and error detection/recovery rates under heavy error injection as compared to previous reliability schemes	benchmark (computing);cmos;critical path method;data deduplication;data item;datapath;electronic circuit;error detection and correction;microprocessor;parity bit;register file;responsive web design;specint	Jie S.

In this paper we introduce a new type of a decentralized clustering problem for networks. The so called Decentralized Packet Clustering (DPC) problem is to find for packets that are sent around in a network a clustering. This clustering has to be done by the routers using only few computational power and only a small amount of memory. No direct information transfer between the routers is allowed. We investigate the behavior of new a type of decentralized k-means algorithm — called DPClust — for solving the DPC problem. DPClust has some similarities with ant based clustering algorithms. We investigate the behavior of DPClust for different clustering problems and for networks that consist of several subnetworks. The amount of packet exchange between these subnetworks is limited. Networks with different connection topologies for the subnetworks are considered. A dynamic situation where the packet exchange rates between the subnetworks varies over time is also investigated. The proposed DPC problem leads to interesting research problems for network clustering.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);cluster analysis;computation;deferred procedure call;heuristic (computer science);k-means clustering;multi-agent system;network packet;network topology;router (computing);routing	Daniel Merkle;Martin Middendorf;Alexander Scheidler	2005	Int.

The validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing analytical results to those obtained through simulation experiments of the actual systems. The proposed model is then used to investigate the implications of bursty traffic on network performance. The results reveal that the performance of k-ary n-cubes degrades considerably in the presence of bursty traffic, stressing the great need for new network architectures that can efficiently support this type of traffic. This study also shows that increasing the number of virtual channels can reduce the impact of bursty traffic and thus improve network performance.	cube	Geyong Min;Mohamed Ould-Khaoua	2002		10.1109/MASCOT.2002.1167099	traffic generation model;real-time computing;network architecture;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Vision	-2.3766333194226705	67.65141220423574	130635

To provide such a communication mechanism, the Portable Image Computing Architectures (PICA) group at Georgia Tech is designing the High-Performance Efficient Router (HiPER), a multidimensional router with high-throughput serial channels (1-2 Gbps). Providing high performance for size, weight, power, and energy constrained systems requires careful attention to routing, switching, and error control mechanisms, and the HiPER Prototype (HiPER-P) is a proof-of-concept vehicle that will validate efficient implementations of these mechanisms. The HiPER-P combines mad postman (bit-pipelined) switching with dimension-order routing, producing a router with a very low-latency routing function. To maintain robust communication as link speeds increase and link power budgets decrease, the HiPER-P provides flit-level hop-by-hop retransmission of erroneous flits. This error control mechanism provides built-in error control at the network level. The design of the HiPER-P is presented in this paper as well as results of performance simulations which characterize mad postman switching combined with flit-level error control.	interconnection;parallel computing;router (computing)	Phil May;Sek M.

4e248409e6b8446ac04e8a8ab9bd87d0c0378bb9	side-channel protection by randomizing look-up tables on reconfigurable hardware - pitfalls of memory primitives		Block Memory Content Scrambling (BMS), presented at CHES 2011, enables an effective way of first-order side-channel protection for cryptographic primitives at the cost of a significant reconfiguration time for the mask update. In this work we analyze alternative ways to implement dynamic first-order masking of AES with randomized lookup tables that can reduce this mask update time. The memory primitives we consider in this work include three distributed RAM components (RAM32M, RAM64M, and RAM256X1S) and one BRAM primitive (RAMB8BWER). We provide a detailed study of the area and time overheads of each implementation technique with respect to the operation (encryption) as well as reconfiguration (mask update) phase. We further compare the achieved security of each technique to prevent firstorder side-channel leakages. Our evaluation is based on one of the most general forms of leakage assessment methodology known as non-specific t-test. Practical SCA evaluations (using a Spartan-6 FPGA platform) demonstrate that solely the BRAM primitive but none of the distributed RAM elements can be used to realize an SCA-protected implementation.	battery management system;casp;combinational logic;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;distributed memory;encryption;field-programmable gate array;first-order predicate;lookup table;random-access memory;randomized algorithm;randomness;s-box;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;throughput;tracing (software)	Pascal Sasdrich;Oliver Mischke;Amir Moradi;Tim Güneysu	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21476-4_7	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;computer security	Crypto	9.887536398931713	63.936191062414004	130891

Due to the cost, time and expertise required to deploy a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), simulation is currently the most widely adopted evaluation method. Network simulation is well established for mobile ad hoc networks, using simulators such as the popular ns2. However, the differing characteristics and performance criteria of WSNs introduce additional simulation requirements, and this has resulted in a number of simulators and simulator extensions developed specifically for this purpose. This paper investigates the suitability of a number of state-of-the-art simulators for evaluating energy-aware WSNs, and subsequently proposes a novel structure for simulating energy-aware WSNs. The proposed structure provides diverse, flexible and extensible hardware and environment models, and integrates a structured architecture for embedded software to enhance the design of energy-aware sensor nodes. To illustrate an implementation of the structure, details of – and observations obtained using – an in-house simulator (WSNsim) are presented.

Subtasks of a program can then be run on separate processors, communicating through shared memory or hard wired links, depending on the hardware and topology of the system. With ring networks, a token passing or store-and-forward communication scheme is often used. The token passing scheme allows for only one processor to send a message at a time. The store-and-forward scheme allows many messages to travel around the network and must be deadlock free. This paper presents the simulation of a distributed network of INMOS Transputers. Also discussed are the store-and-forward message passing scheme that is modeled and results obtained thus far.	central processing unit;deadlock;message passing;shared memory;simulation;store and forward;token ring;transputer;user (computing)	Janice R.

Arriving packets are load-balanced packet-by-packet over multiple lower speed center stage packet switches. It is known that, for unicast traffic, a PPS can precisely emulate a FCFS output-queued (OQ) switch with a speedup of two and an OQ switch with delay guarantees with a speedup of three. In this paper we ask: is it possible for a PPS to emulate the behavior of an OQ multicast switch? The main result is that for multicast traffic an N-port PPS can precisely emulate a FIFO OQ switch with a speedup of S>2/spl radic/N+1, and a switch that provides delay guarantees with a speedup of S>2/spl radic/(2N)+2.	fifo (computing and electronics);load balancing (computing);multicast;network packet;network switch;packet switching;speedup;unicast	Sundar Iyer;Nick McKeown	2001	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/4234.929609	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;load balancing;computer network;systems architecture	Metrics	-3.8595652817201667	69.63697252294773	131750

To the best of our knowledge it is the fastest of its kind to date. We start from an efficient actively secure evaluation of general binary circuits that was implemented by the authors of [DLT14]. They presented an optimized implementation of the so-called MiniMac protocol [DZ13] that runs in the pre-processing model, and applied this to a binary AES circuit. In this paper we describe how to dedicate the pre-processing to the structure of AES, which improves significantly the throughput and latency of previous actively secure implementations. We get a latency of about 6 ms and amortised time about 0.4 ms per AES block, which seems completely adequate for practical applications such as verification of 1-time passwords.	aes instruction set;authentication;automake;bash;block cipher;c dynamic memory allocation;c99;ciphertext;command-line interface;debug;encryption;fastest;gnu compiler collection;hash function;ia-64;linux;lookup table;microsoft visual studio;microsoft windows software development kit;nonlinear system;password;preprocessor;real life;secure multi-party computation;throughput;macos	Ivan Damgård;Rasmus Winther Zakarias	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-31517-1_13	parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;aes implementations	Security	9.173446613690258	64.64056866398376	132243

System-on-chips (SoCs) platforms based on network-on-chips (NoCs) could be a viable option for the deployment of large multicore designs with thousands of cores. This paper proposes the generalized binary de Bruijn (GBDB) graph as a reliable and efficient network topology for a large NoC. We propose a reliable routing algorithm to detour a faulty channel between two adjacent switches. In addition, using integer linear programming, we propose an optimal tile-based implementation for a GBDB-based NoC in which the number of channels is less than that of Torus which has the same number of links. Our experimental results show that the latency and energy consumption of the generalized de Bruijn graph are much less than those of Mesh and Torus. The low energy consumption of a de Bruijn graph-based NoC makes it suitable for portable devices which have to operate on limited batteries. Also, the gate level implementation of the proposed reliable routing shows small area, power, and timing overheads due to the proposed reliable routing algorithm.	algorithm;de bruijn graph;deadlock;graphics;integer programming;interrupt latency;linear programming;mobile device;multi-core processor;network on a chip;network switch;network topology;requirement;routing;software deployment;system on a chip;torus interconnect	Mohammad Hosseinabady;Mohammad Reza Kakoee;Jimson Mathew;Dhiraj K.

The algorithm is fully scalable, the dimension of the hypercube can be chosen independently of the an'ty and height of the complete tree. The basic property of the embedded tree is that both all the tree nodes at a given level and all the tree nodes together are uniformly distributed within equally-sized subcubes of the hypercube. This implies that no hypercube node is loaded with more than [Ah/2n] tree nodes and [Bh/2*] leaves of the tree, where A h is the number of all tree nodes, Bh is the number of leaves of the k-ary complete tree of height h, and n is the dimension of the hypercube. The embedding enables optimal emulations of both DivideBConquer computations on the k-ary complete tree, where only one level of nodes is active at a time, and general computations based on k-ary complete trees, where all tree nodes are active simultaneously. As a special case we get an algorithm for embedding the k-ary complete tree of height h into its optimal hypercube with load 1 and with dilation that is only by a small constant factor worse than the lower bound. This improves the best previous result by Shen et al., whose embedding has load 1 and nearly optimal dilation, but requires much larger than the optimal hypercube.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;binary tree;computation;connection machine;dilation (morphology);embedded system;emulator;fault tolerance;journal of the acm;link/cut tree;network congestion;olap cube;parallel algorithm;scalability;self-balancing binary search tree	Jan Trdlicka;Pavel Tvrdík	1996		10.1109/SPDP.1996.570390	optimal binary search tree;segment tree;red–black tree;emulation;parallel computing;divide and conquer algorithms;tree rotation;vantage-point tree;exponential tree;concurrent computing;binary tree;computer science;theoretical computer science;range tree;k-ary tree;interval tree;distributed computing;2–3–4 tree;fractal tree index;dilation;search tree;upper and lower bounds;programming language;network topology;hypercube;avl tree;computer network	Theory	-0.1931846313495962	69.20562021008875	133377

In this paper, we propose an effective faulttolerant technique for the circular butterfly parallel system to ensure its rigid full butterfly structure even in the presence of failures, addressing reconfiguration in detail. A resulting butterfly system with L levels involves (Iflog, L ) % spare PE’s and approximately 50% additional links. The reconfiguration process of our design in response to any operational fault is easy and can be performed in a distributed manner. The reliability and layout of this proposed design are‘ evaluated analytically. This design, due to its specific configuration, exhibits significantly improved reliability while taking only moderate extra layout area.

However, recent studies show that structural relaxation effect makes the resistance of phase-change material drift over the time, which can severely degrade multilevel per cell phase-change memory storage reliability. This makes powerful memory fault tolerance solutions indispensable, where error correction code (ECC) will play an essential role. This work aims to develop fault tolerance solutions that can effectively compensate memory cell resistance drift. First, based upon information-theoretical study, we show that conventional use of ECC, which is unaware of memory content lifetime, can only achieve the performance with a big gap from the information-theoretical bounds. This motivates us to study the potential of time-aware memory fault tolerance, where the basic idea is to keep track the memory content lifetime and use this lifetime information to accordingly adjust how memory cell resistance is quantized and interpreted for ECC decoding. Under this time-aware fault tolerance framework, we study the use of two types of ECCs, including classical codes such as BCH that only demand hard-decision input and advanced codes such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that demand soft-decision probability input. Using hypothetical four-level per cell and eight-level per cell phase-change memory with BCH and LDPC codes as test vehicles, we carry out extensive analysis and simulations, which demonstrate very significant performance advantages of such time-aware memory fault tolerance strategy in the presence of significant memory cell resistance drift.	bch code;ecc memory;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;fault tolerance;general protection fault;heart rate variability;information theory;linear programming relaxation;low-density parity-check code;memory cell (binary);phase-change memory;scalability;simulation;thermal resistance	Wei Xu;Tong Zhang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2052640	fault tolerance;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;low-density parity-check code;computer science;engineering;statistics	Metrics	7.598670580412317	61.93484976293591	134126

4d9df5d2a3ce62f263861f8e5ccde84d3cde76ec	deadlock recovery technique in bus enhanced noc architecture		Increase in the speed of processors has led to crucial role of communication in the performance of systems. As a result, routing is taken into consideration as one of the most important subjects of the Network on Chip architecture. Routing algorithms to deadlock avoidance prevent packets route completely based on network traffic condition by means of restricting the route of packets. This action leads to less performance especially in non-uniform traffic patterns. On the other hand True Fully Adoptive Routing algorithm provides routing of packets completely based on traffic condition. However, deadlock detection and recovery mechanisms are needed to handle deadlocks. Use of global bus beside NoC as a parallel supportive environment, provide platform to offer advantages of both features of bus and NoC. This bus is useful for broadcast and multicast operations, sending delay sensitive signals, system management and other services. In this research, we use this bus as an escaping path for deadlock recovery technique. According to simulation results, this bus is suitable platform for deadlock recovery technique.	algorithm;central processing unit;deadlock;interconnection;multicast;network on a chip;network packet;packet switching;routing;simulation;systems management;throughput	Saeid Sharifian Nia;Abbas Vafaei;Hamid Shahimohamadi	2012	CoRR		real-time computing;engineering;local bus;distributed computing;deadlock prevention algorithms;bus network;computer network	HPC	-2.235567369430083	68.71178486555962	135045
16bdafeec92302bfa4ae8b59f209248d475735a4	some remarks about tracing digital cameras - faster method and usable countermeasure		In this paper we consider the issue of tracing digital cameras by analyzing pictures they produced. Clearly, the possibility of establishing if a picture was taken by a given camera or even if two pictures come from cameras of the same model can expose users’ privacy to a serious threat. In the paper, at first, we propose a simple and ultra-fast algorithm for identification of the brand of a digital camera and compare the results with the state-of-the-art algorithm by Lukás et al.’s. Experimental results show that at the cost of a moderate decrease of accuracy, our method is significantly faster, thus can be used for an analysis of large batches of pictures or as a preprocessing for more exact. In the second part, we propose a method for limiting the possibility of tracing digital cameras. Our method is a transformation of the picture that can be classified as a type of standardization. We prove that it prevents all methods of tracing cameras based on analysis of histograms. Moreover, in an extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate that the transformed pictures are very similar to the original images under both visual and objective numerical measure inspection.	8-bit color;algorithm;amazon simple storage service;cmos;charge-coupled device;digital camera;image analysis;image histogram;lu decomposition;numerical analysis;peak signal-to-noise ratio;pixel;preprocessor;privacy;rayleigh–ritz method;s3 texture compression;threat (computer)	Jaroslaw Bernacki;Marek Klonowski;Piotr Syga	2017		10.5220/0006434803430350	computer security;usable;computer science;embedded system;tracing;countermeasure	Graphics	6.75956565319169	65.82079450427761	135077

(IEEE 28th international parallel and distributed processing symposium workshops, pp 1438–1447, 2014) as a useful alternative of the classical multi-dimensional torus network. The one-to-all broadcast is a well-known algorithm that spreads a message from one node to all other nodes in the network. This paper presents an improved one-to-all broadcasting algorithm in $$G_\alpha ^n$$ G α n that achieves a lower average number of steps to receiving the broadcasted message. Furthermore, the all-to-all broadcasting method is illustrated based on dividing the proposed one-to-all broadcasting algorithm into four phases. The analytical and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better traffic performance than the current known algorithm and has 4.1 % less total number of senders.	algorithm;distributed computing;duplex (telecommunications);international parallel and distributed processing symposium;overhead (computing);simulation;spanning tree	Zaid Hussain	2015	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-015-1532-7	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;broadcasting	Arch	0.5564749851056804	70.76845115578709	135302

We argue that future sensor applications will be hierarchical with multiple tiers, where each tier employs sensors with different characteristics. We argue that multi-tier networks are not only scalable, they offer a number of advantages over simpler, single-tier unimodal networks: lower cost, better coverage, higher functionality, and better reliability. However, the design of such mixed networks raises a number of new challenges that are not adequately addressed by current research. We discuss several of these challenges and illustrate how they can be addressed in the context of SensEye, a multi-tier video surveillance application that we are designing in our research group.	closed-circuit television;embedded system;image sensor;multitier architecture;scalability	Purushottam Kulkarni;Deepak Ganesan;Prashant J.

As a consequence, various MAC solutions have been proposed suiting to different application characteristics [1]. However, MAC protocols are typically implemented in a monolithic fashion -- specific to a particular hardware platform. This hinders the possibility of code re-use across different platforms, which makes both implementation and porting cumbersome. It also imposes difficulties in protocol redesign when the application requirements change since the entire radio stack needs to be modified.	communications protocol;requirement	Obaid Salikeen;Junaid Ansari;Xi Zhang;Petri Mähönen	2010		10.1145/1869983.1870019	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	6.958496450951821	71.66276819855807	135799

This class includes the already known Replicated Delta Networks (RDNs) and Parallel Delta Networks (PDNs). For the GPDNs the rearrangeability condition is given and a routing algorithm for the establishment of any set of connection requests is presented. The proposed algorithm operates in case of GPDNs composed of 2qx2q swtching elements and it is able to set-up any permutation with a time complexity equal to O(Nlog2N). As far as the implementation of rearrangeable topologies is concemed, the fields of applicability of RDNs. PDNs and other GPDNs have been investigated. In particular, it has been proved that. if large networks (N>256) have to be implemented, GPDNs structures requires a lower number of switching elements with respect to RDNs and PDNs. This features can be obtained without any impairment on the complexity of the routing algorithm.	algorithm;multistage interconnection networks;routing;time complexity	Francesco Bernabei;Marco Listanti	1989		10.1109/INFCOM.1989.101457	time complexity;routing;parallel computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Arch	-1.0953579574927486	70.27531627712737	135907

In designing this NoC architecture, basic network problems such as dead-lock/livelock freedom and high throughput are considered. Additionally, some issues related with actual VLSI implementation, such as design complexity and simplicity of routing algorithm, are evaluated. To verify its efficiency, a simulation-based performance evaluation and an analytical method are used. In simulation, we compare our works with other designs using standard traffic patterns used in the literature. Also a new analytical performance model is proposed. Unlike previous wormhole and adaptive routing models, the model introduced copes with variable node buffer size as well as message length under uniform random traffic pattern. The analytical model is validated by comparing with the simulation-based model using the same traffic pattern. Major contribution here is the design of two different performance models for the proposed router in NoC architecture. Specifically, a simple and accurate analytical model for NoC communication for standard applications includes the effect of variable node buffer size as well as the message length. This is the first attempt in proposing an accurate analytical model for adaptive routers.	router (computing);simulation	Jun Ho Bahn;Nader Bagherzadeh	2008	IET Computers & Digital Techniques	10.1049/iet-cdt:20070043	fifo;system on a chip;embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;network architecture;computer science;deadlock;integrated circuit;distributed computing;very-large-scale integration;programming language;implementation	Arch	-2.1761748629165174	68.54028943782426	136630

While we were among the earliest promoters of this approach, through experience we found that this principle leads to fragile and unmanageable systems and explore an alternative. The  Tenet architecture  is motivated by the observation that future large-scale sensor network deployments will be  tiered , consisting of motes in the lower tier and  masters , relatively unconstrained 32-bit platform nodes, in the upper tier. Tenet constrains multinode fusion to the master tier while allowing motes to process locally-generated sensor data. This simplifies application development and allows mote-tier software to be reused. Applications running on masters  task  motes by composing task descriptions from a novel tasklet library. Our Tenet implementation also contains a robust and scalable networking subsystem for disseminating tasks and reliably delivering responses. We show that a Tenet pursuit-evasion application exhibits performance comparable to a mote-native implementation while being considerably more compact. We also present two real-world deployments of Tenet system: a structural vibration monitoring application at Vincent Thomas Bridge and an imaging-based habitat monitoring application at James Reserve, and show that tiered architecture scales network capacity and allows reliable delivery of high rate data. 1		Jeongyeup Paek;Ben Greenstein;Omprakash Gnawali;Ki-Young Jang;August Joki;Marcos Augusto M.

2db16a3ad72b874864d9771df9b625c3f0169833	execution time distributions in embedded safety-critical systems using extreme value theory		Several techniques have been proposed to upper-bound the worst-case execution time behaviour of programs in the domain of critical real-time embedded systems. These computing systems have strong requirements regarding the guarantees that the longest execution time a program can take is bounded. Some of those techniques use extreme value theory (EVT) as their main prediction method. In this paper, EVT is used to estimate a high quantile for different types of execution time distributions observed for a set of representative programs for the analysis of automotive applications. A major challenge appears when the dataset seems to be heavy tailed, because this contradicts the previous assumption of embedded safety-critical systems. A methodology based on the coefficient of variation is introduced for a threshold selection algorithm to determine the point above which the distribution can be considered generalised Pareto distribution. This methodology also provides an estimation of the extreme value index and high quantile estimates. We have applied these methods to execution time observations collected from the execution of 16 representative automotive benchmarks to predict an upper-bound to the maximum execution time of this program. Several comparisons with alternative approaches are discussed.	embedded system;extreme value theory;maxima and minima	Joan del Castillo;Maria Padilla;Jaume Abella;Francisco J.

Resilience to transients is achieved by exploiting the phase relationship between data symbols and a common reference symbol where the symbols are transmitted using additional wires. Detection of transient faults is performed by comparison of the data symbol and the reference symbol. We demonstrate it is possible to achieve a similar number of transitions per bit as existing delay insensitive codes, from a power consumption point of view, but achieving resilience to transient faults. The link has been synthesized and validated using 0.12 ¼m technology and power, area and performance are given. It has been shown that the link area cost is 409 ¼m2 per data bit and energy per bit is 356 fJ/bit. Latency through the link is 0.8 ns and the maximum operating frequency or throughput of the link is 1.056 GHz.	clock rate;interrupt latency;network on a chip;qr code;throughput	Simon Ogg;Bashir M.

In this paper, a new fault tolerance routing algorithm for n-dimensional meshes is presented. The presented algorithm is based on a planer fault model which only disables minimum fault-free nodes to form rectangular fault regions. The algorithm uses three virtual channels per physical channel and only employs a very simple deadlock avoidance scheme. In spit the variety fault regions in n-dimensional mesh, the presented algorithm is always connected as long as fault regions do not disconnect the network. The result of simulation shows that the proposed routing algorithm is of feasibility of gracefully degraded operation.	algorithm;deadlock;dijkstra's algorithm;elegant degradation;fault model;fault tolerance;interconnection;routing;simulation	Xin-Ming Duan;Ji-Gang Wu	2012	2012 13th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies	10.1109/PDCAT.2012.25	fault tolerance;parallel computing;computer science;multipath routing;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-0.4605719390189638	68.87553752562327	138497

The overall performance of a massively parallel computer system is heavily affected by the interconnection network and its processing nodes. Continuing advances in VLSI technologies promise to deliver more power to individual nodes. However, the on-chip interconnection networks consume up to 50% of the total chip power and off-chip bandwidth is limited to the maximum number of possible out going physical links. In addition, the long wiring and low performance of communication network overwhelm the benefit of parallel computer system whereas it increases total cost. In this paper, we propose a new interconnection network that reduces the problems of high power consumption, long wiring length and low bandwidth issues.We havemeasured the static network performance and required power consumption of our proposed ‘3D-TESH’ interconnection network and compared the performance with other networks at different levels of hierarchy such as inter-chips, inter-nodes and inter-cabinets. 3D-TESH network has achieved about 52.08% better diameter and about 45.71% better average distance than the 3D-Torus network with 12.61% less router power usage at on-chip level. Furthermore, 3D-TESH requires about 41% less router power usage than 5D-Torus at the on-chip level. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

f7b24b4d131804b8e3ed863a16ecd81feee24052	await: an ultra-lightweight soft-error mitigation mechanism for network-on-chip links		Networks-on-Chip have become a widely accepted communication paradigm for many-core Systems-on-Chip. However, with the ever-shrinking transistor size, the network's sensitivity to transient faults on the physical links cannot be ignored since even a single transient fault can lead to a network-wide congestion and a system failure. This paper proposes the AWAIT mechanism, an ultra-lightweight transient fault mitigation mechanism for Network-on-Chip links. The proposed mechanism covers all single event transients. The experimental results show that the AWAIT mechanism prevents network-wide failure even in harsh environments (up to 80 million random faults on links per second). The AWAIT mechanism is also scalable and imposes only 5.1 % area overhead with very negligible critical path delay overhead.	await;critical path method;fault (technology);manycore processor;network congestion;network on a chip;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;router (computing);scalability;soft error;system on a chip;transistor;transistor–transistor logic	Karl Janson;Rene Pihlak;Siavoosh Payandeh Azad;Behrad Niazmand;Gert Jervan;Jaan Raik	2018	2018 13th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)	10.1109/ReCoSoC.2018.8449374	real-time computing;critical path method;fault tolerance;transistor;scalability;network on a chip;fault detection and isolation;soft error;computer science	Arch	5.454428128851648	60.45771393680978	138701

Recent work on static analysis and fault-injection-based experiments on applications reveals that certain variables in the application are critical to its crash- and hang-free execution. If it can be ensured that only the computation of these variables is error-free, then a high degree of crash/hang coverage can be achieved at a low performance overhead to the application. The selective replication technique provides an ideal platform for validating this claim. The technique is compared against complete duplication as provided in current architecture-level techniques. The results show that with about 59% less overhead than full duplication, selective replication detects 97% of the data errors and 87% of the instruction errors that were covered by full duplication. It also reduces the detection of errors benign to the final outcome of the application by 17.8% as compared to full duplication.	computation;experiment;fault injection;overhead (computing);static program analysis	Nithin Nakka;Karthik Pattabiraman;Ravishankar K.

Besides describing specific transformations for well-known static routing algorithms, we present a black box transformation scheme applicable to every static, oblivious routing algorithm. We analyze the performance of our protocols under a stochastic and an adversarial model of packet injections.#R##N#One result of our specific transformations is the first dynamic routing algorithm for leveled networks that is stable for arbitrary admissible injection rates and that works with packet buffers of size depending solely on the injection rate and the node degree, but not on the size of the network. Furthermore, we prove strong delay bounds for the packets. Our results imply, for example, that a throughput of 99% can be achieved on an n-input butterfly network with buffers of constant size while each packet is delivered in time O(log n), with high probability.#R##N#Our black box transformation ensures that if the static algorithm is pure (i.e., no extra packets apart from the original packets are routed), its dynamic variant is stable up to a maximum possible injection rate. Furthermore, in the stochastic model, the routing time of a packet depends on local parameters such as the length of its routing path, rather than on the maximum possible path length, even if the static algorithm chosen for the transformation does not provide this locality feature and is not pure. In the adversarial model, the delay bound of the packets is closely related to the time bound given for the static algorithm.	routing;store and forward	Christian Scheideler;Berthold Vöcking	2000	SIAM J.

We propose a methodology to develop efficient and deadlock free routing algorithms for such NoC platforms which can be specialized for an application or a set of concurrent applications. Application specific topology of communicating cores as well as information about their communication concurrency over time is exploited to maximize communication adaptivity and performance. We demonstrate, both through analysis of adaptivity as well as simulation based evaluation of latency and throughput, that our algorithm gives significantly higher performance as compared to general purpose deadlock free algorithms like XY and odd-even.	algorithm;classical xy model;concurrency (computer science);deadlock;field-programmable gate array;level design;mesh networking;network on a chip;network packet;packet switching;programming paradigm;router (computing);routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;software development;static random-access memory;switched communication network;telecommunications network;throughput	Maurizio Palesi;Shashi Kumar;Rickard Holsmark;Vincenzo Catania	2007	2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370367	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;network on a chip;deadlock prevention algorithms;field-programmable gate array;computer network	Arch	1.8446567431879837	62.887347848186614	139353

Many routing algorithms proposed for processor networks have the potential of deadlock due to the cyclic topology of the network. In this paper we first formalize the concept of message routing. Next, we show a method by which a deadlock-free routing algorithm can be constructed out of a given routing algorithm. Finally the method is illustrated by constructing deadlock-free routing algorithms for cartesian product processor networks.	algorithm;central processing unit;computation;concurrent computing;deadlock;parallel computing;routing	Peter A.

The modified architecture consists of an input module, an output module, two point-to-point (PTP) modules, and one modified multicast/broadcast (M/B) module(s). We also implement the multicast/broadcast module with WDM technique, which reduces the hardware cost required for multicast and the re-computation cost for a new connection. We show that it has the best application flexibility and provides multicast function without imposing significant negative impacts on the whole network. A new multicast connection pattern is also proposed in this paper, which makes it practical and economical to apply amplification in space-division networks. Compared with existing multicast architectures, this new architecture with Dilated Benes PTP modules has better performance in terms of system SNR, the number of switch elements, and system attenuation in point-to-point connections. Moreover, the multicast/broadcast module adopts wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique to increase its multicast/broadcast assignment. As a result, given m available distinguished wavelengths, one M/B module can support at most m M/B requests at the same time. The new proposed M/B module with WDM is more practical and economical to apply amplification in space-division networks.	computation;multicast;multistage amplifier;multistage interconnection networks;network architecture;point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);recursion;signal-to-noise ratio;wavelength-division multiplexing	Hao Tian;Ajay K.

This paper presents the design principle of a reconngurable network which is able to realize any graph of maximal degree four. The architecture is based on a special multistage Clos network, constructed out of a number of static routing switches of equal size. Upper bounds on the cut size of 4-regular graphs, if split into a number of clusters, allow minimizing the number of switches and connections while still ooering the desired reconnguration capabilities as well as large scalability and exible multiuser access. EEcient algorithms connguring the architecture are based on an old result by Petersen 27 about the decomposition of regular graphs. The concept presented here is the basis for the Parsytec SC series of reconngurable MPP-systems. The currently largest realization with 320 processors is presented in greater detail.	algorithm;central processing unit;clos network;goodyear mpp;julius petersen;maximal set;multi-user;multiprocessing;multistage interconnection networks;network switch;parallel computing;real-time transcription;requirement;routing;scalability;telecommunications network	Burkhard Monien;Ralf Diekmann;Reinhard Lüling	1997	Int.

Among the emerging design platforms, """"electronic textiles"""" (or e-textiles) make possible a wide variety of novel applications, ranging from consumer electronics to aerospace devices. Due to the harsh environment of e-textile components and battery size limitations, low-power and redundancy techniques are critical for obtaining successful e-textile applications. In this paper, we consider a platform which consists of dedicated components for e-textiles, including computational modules, dedicated transmission lines, and thin-film batteries on fiber substrates. As a theoretical contribution, we address the issue of the energy-aware routing for e-textile platforms and propose an efficient algorithm to solve it. Furthermore, we derive an analytical upper bound for determining the maximum number of achievable jobs over all possible e-textile routing frameworks. From a practical standpoint, for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher, the routing technique we propose achieves close to or more than 75 percent of this theoretical upper bound. Moreover, compared to the non-energy-aware counterpart, the new routing technique increases the number of encryption jobs by one order of magnitude"""	algorithm;cipher;e-textiles;encryption;general-purpose modeling;job stream;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;profiling (computer programming);redundancy (engineering);routing;scheduling (computing);transmission line;ubiquitous computing	Jung-Chun Kao;Radu Marculescu	2006	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.2006.86	advanced encryption standard;embedded system;routing;static routing;parallel computing;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;operating system;ubiquitous computing;computer network	EDA	7.684746410151124	66.29204429658283	139725

In such a system, each PE is assigned to a Router in the neighborhood. The required interconnect topology among the PE's is implemented via a fixed Backbone Network connecting all the Routers. A localized Auxiliary Network is used to provide assignment flexibilities between each Router and its peripheral PE's. Faulty PE's are repaired via spare PE's in the array, and to extend the reach of spares, repair is done via Replacement Chains: a faulty PE's Router will be assigned to another functional PE within its neighborhood; the Router of the replacement PE will then be reassigned to another PE, until eventually a spare PE is reached. In this paper, we propose a Many-processor Array on the basis of this principle, and show that this architecture is able to deliver high level of fault tolerance properties while being scalable in hardware and interconnect overheads.	electrical connection;fault tolerance;high-level programming language;internet backbone;microprocessor;peripheral;processor array;router (computing);scalability;simulation	Soumya Banerjee;Wenjing Rao	2017	2017 22nd Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)	10.1109/ASPDAC.2017.7858361	maintenance engineering;embedded system;parallel processing;fault tolerance;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;network topology;computer network	EDA	0.26925334238971177	67.26994135284342	140136

Data packets must be processed at these rates, presenting serious challenges for traditional computing approaches. This article presents a tool chain that maps a domain-specific packet-processing language called PX to high-performance reconfigurable-computing architectures based on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. PX is a declarative language with object-oriented semantics. A customized computing architecture is generated to match the exact requirements expressed in the PX description. The architecture includes components for packet parsing and editing, and for table lookups. It is expressed in a register transfer level (RTL) description, which is then processed using standard FPGA implementation tools. The architecture is dynamically programmable via custom firmware updates when the packet-processing system is in operation. The authors illustrate the language, tool chain, and implementation results through a practical example involving a 100-Gbps OpenFlow implementation.	computer architecture;custom firmware;data rate units;declarative programming;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;network packet;openflow;parsing;pixel;reconfigurable computing;register-transfer level;requirement;streaming media;toolchain	Gordon J.

General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA 1X) for wide areas, and 802.11 and Bluetooth for local areas have already emerged. Broadband wireless networks urgently call for rich contents for consumers. Among various possible applications, video communication is one of the most promising for mobile devices on wireless networks. This paper describes the generation, coding, and transmission of an effective video form, scalable portrait video for mobile video communication. As an expansion to bilevel video, portrait video is composed of more gray levels, and therefore possesses higher visual quality while it maintains a low bit rate and low computational costs. Portrait video is a scalable video in that each video with a higher level always contains all the information of the video with a lower level. The bandwidths of 2-4-level portrait videos fit into the bandwidth range of 20-40 kbps that GPRS and CDMA 1X can stably provide; therefore, portrait video is very promising for video broadcast and communication on 2.5-G wireless networks. With portrait video technology, we are the first to enable two-way video communication on pocket PCs and handheld PCs.

In the wireless ring each processor has a single buuer and cannot distinguish which neighbor the arriving bit comes from. This feature substantially increases anonymity of the ring. A priori it is not clear whether any non-trivial computation can be performed on wireless rings. Nevertheless we show that wireless rings are computationally equivalent to hardware rings.	computation;computational model;whole earth 'lectronic link;wireless router	Krzysztof Diks;Evangelos Kranakis;Adam Malinowski;Andrzej Pelc	1995	Theor.

Our architecture uses a simple ring-based path-setup network for assisting an optical folded Torus Network-on-Chip (NoC) serving cache coherence traffic. We investigate performance/power effects on a CMP system and we compare against both a high-performance electronic folded Torus NoC (electronic baseline) and a state-of-the-art optical folded Torus with sequential path-setup (optical baseline). The reduced path-setup overhead of our proposal allows reconfigurable optical networks to potentially be compatible with the small messages composing directory-based cache coherent traffic and thus be the enabling factor for significantly improving energy consumption.	baseline (configuration management);cache coherence;coherence (physics);directory (computing);multi-core processor;multiprocessing;network on a chip;network switch;optical switch;overhead (computing);tiled rendering;torus interconnect	Paolo Grani;Sandro Bartolini	2014	2014 IEEE Intl Conf on High Performance Computing and Communications, 2014 IEEE 6th Intl Symp on Cyberspace Safety and Security, 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Embedded Software and Syst (HPCC,CSS,ICESS)	10.1109/HPCC.2014.80	optical transport network;embedded system;passive optical network;parallel computing;optical burst switching;photonics;computer science;optical add-drop multiplexer;optical switch;optical performance monitoring;network topology;optical cross-connect;computer network	Arch	2.021970681481498	61.76320990184651	141886

Unfortunately, PCM has higher read latency than DRAM, resulting in lower system performance. This paper investigates architectural techniques to improve the read latency of PCM. We observe that there is a wide distribution in cell resistance in both the SET state and the RESET state, and that the read latency of PCM is designed conservatively to handle the worst case cell. If PCM sensing can be tuned to exploit the variability in cell resistance, then we can get reduced read latency. We propose two schemes to enable better-than-worst-case read latency for PCM systems. Our first proposal, Early Read, reads the data earlier than the specified time period. Our key observation that Early Read causes only unidirectional errors (SET being read as RESET) allows us to efficiently detect data errors using Berger codes. In the uncommon case that Early Read causes data error(s), we simply retry the read operation with original latency. Our evaluations show that Early Read can reduce the read latency by 25% while incurring a storage overhead of only 10 bits per 64 byte line. Our second proposal, Turbo Read, reduces the sensing time for read operations by pumping higher current, at the expense of accidentally switching the PCM cell with small probability during the read operation. We analyze Error Correction Codes (ECC) and Probabilistic Row Scrubbing (PRS) for maintaining data integrity under Turbo Read. We show that a combination of Early Read and Turbo Read can reduce the PCM read latency by 30%, improve the system performance by 21%, and reduce the Energy Delay Product (EDP) by 28%, while requiring minimal changes to the memory system.	best, worst and average case;byte;computer data storage;data integrity;dynamic random-access memory;electronic data processing;memory scrubbing;memory timings;overhead (computing);phase-change memory;procedural reasoning system;pumping (computer systems);qr code;retry;scalability;spatial variability	Prashant J.

Most prefetchers are often oblivious to the network congestion when generating prefetech requests. In this work, we investigate the interaction between prefetchers and on-chip networks and exploit the synergy of these two components in multi-core architectures. We explore prefetchaware on-chip networks that differentiates between prefetch and demand traffic by prioritizing demand traffic. In addition, we propose prefetch control mechanism based on network congestion. Our evaluations show that the combination of the proposed prefetch-aware router architecture and congestion sensitive prefetch control improves the performance of benchmarks by 11-13% on average, up to 30% on some of the workloads.	benchmark (computing);multi-core processor;network congestion;network on a chip;network planning and design;prefetch input queue;router (computing);synergy	Junghoon Lee;Minjeong Shin;Hanjoon Kim;John Kim;Jaehyuk Huh	2011	2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques	10.1109/PACT.2011.27	instruction prefetch;chip;system on a chip;multi-core processor;network synthesis filters;routing;network planning and design;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;accuracy and precision;network on a chip;network congestion;bandwidth;computer network	Arch	1.573805445595055	61.45506056970121	142375

But, the probability of the worst possible combination is usually low, and the routing algorithm may be able to find a route between source and destination nodes. The network dependability parameters computed according to this approach will be underestimated. In this paper we propose a methodology for accurately evaluating interconnection network dependability. In addition, we apply it to obtain an accurate estimation of the reliability and availability parameters in a 2-D mesh, taking into account network size, routing algorithm, failure and repair rates of nodes, and coverage. Finally we compare the computed results under both approaches.	interconnection	Vicente Chirivella;Rosa Alcover;José Duato	2001		10.1109/ICPP.2001.952099	routing;fault tolerance;static routing;parallel computing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	NLP	-1.1988157985126826	68.78127686432245	142393

We investigate routing algorithms for different message types and demonstrate 19% reduction of the impact of fault detection messages on application messages. We also show the limitations of prioritized fault detection messages for different application message packet injection rates.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;centralized computing;fault detection and isolation;interconnection;manycore processor;network on a chip;network packet;overhead (computing);packet switching;routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);sensor;transistor	Arne Garbade;Sebastian Weis;Sebastian Schlingmann;Bernhard Fechner;Theo Ungerer	2013	2013 21st Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing	10.1109/PDP.2013.76	routing;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;network on a chip;computer network	HPC	5.025553523886105	60.73167213479079	142708

Our system is based on many sensor nodes deployed all over a building to monitor temperature and humidity and detect any brutal temperature increase. These nodes are based on simple , cheap and easily programmed equipment. while several simulations using NS-2 and other simulators has been conducted in many other works to study the efficiency of a network based on MST, our application tests this topology in real conditions to ensure it effectiveness in a Zigbee network. Our developed system provides an easy interface for programming and displaying results. All sensed data is sent to the coordinator which forwards it to the user’s pc to be viewed by the user. This paper also presents some performances of this discussed topology obtained by real conditions tests.	arduino;minimum spanning tree	Mourad Ouadou;Ouadoudi Zytoune;Yassin Elhillali;Atika Rivenq;Driss Aboutajdine	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25067-0_5	minimum degree spanning tree;spanning tree;minimum spanning tree;connected dominating set;distributed minimum spanning tree	Vision	7.749801206785649	74.49141534644986	143168

Hence strong error correction code (ECC) schemes are highly recommended. With a strong error correction capability, low-density-parity code (LDPC) is now applied for the state-of-the-art flash memory. However, LDPC has long decoding latency when the raw bit error rates (RBER) are high. This is because it needs finegrained soft sensing between states to iteratively decode the raw data. In this work, we propose a smart sensing level placement scheme to reduce the LDPC decoding latency. The basic idea for the placement scheme is motivated by two asymmetric error characteristics of flash memory: the asymmetric errors at different states, and the asymmetric errors caused by voltage left-shifts and right-shifts. With understanding of these two types of error characteristics, the sensing levels are smartly placed to achieve reduced sensing levels while maintaining the error correction capability of LDPC. Experiment analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement.	areal density (computer storage);error detection and correction;flash memory;image scaling;low-density parity-check code;parity bit;residual bit error rate;simulation	Qiao Li;Liang Shi;Chun Jason Xue;Qingfeng Zhuge;Edwin Hsing-Mean Sha	2017	2017 22nd Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)	10.1109/ASPDAC.2017.7858383	electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;sensor;reliability;statistics	EDA	7.566980511350184	61.841418726426355	143219

We propose to add a few extra stages in an MIN to create multiple paths between any source and destination. Connection principles of Multipath MINs (MMINs) for packet switching are presented in this paper. Performance of such network is analyzed for possible use in multiprocessor systems and dataflow computers. For an MMIN with n nodes, the number of required stages is confined in the range [log2n+1, 2log2n-1]. Each stage consists of n/2 buffered 2-by-2 switching cells. In practice, one or two extra stages is sufficient beyond log2n stages required in a unique-path MIN. The delays of MMINs are shown much shorter than that of using unique-path MINs for packet switching. The improvement lies in significantly reduced packet wait delays in buffers, especially under heavy traffic conditions. The tradeoffs between reduced network delays and increased hardware cost are studied. Optimal design criteria and procedures are provided for developing MMINs with a fixed network size and stages.	computer;dataflow;multipath propagation;multiprocessing;multistage interconnection networks;network packet;network switch;optimal design;packet switching;wait state	Chi-Yuan Chin;Kai Hwang	1984		10.1145/800015.808171	ring network;parallel computing;real-time computing;heuristic;fast packet switching;computer science;virtual memory;processing delay;optimal design;operating system;end-to-end delay;np-hard;distributed computing;transmission delay;burst switching;network delay;circuit switching;computer network	Arch	-0.8011897850313654	72.32670486624194	145560

Unlike existing message-combining algorithms in which the number of nodes in each dimension should be power-of-two and square, the proposed algorithms accommodate non-power-of-two tori where the number of nodes in each dimension need not be power-of-two. In addition, destinations remain fixed over a larger number of steps in the proposed algorithms, thus making them amenable to optimizations. Finally, the data structures used are simple, hence making substantial saving of message-rearrangement time.		Young-Joo Suh;Kang G.

Efforts have also been put in place to create schemes that are able to provide learning mechanisms for event detection using classification or clustering approaches. These schemes entail substantial communication and computational overheads owing to the event-oblivious nature of data transmissions. In this paper, we present an event detection scheme that has the ability to distribute detection processes over the resource-constrained wireless sensor nodes and is suitable for events with spatio-temporal characteristics. We adopt a pattern recognition algorithm known as Distributed Hierarchical Graph Neuron (DHGN) with collaborative-comparison learning for detecting critical events in WSN. The scheme demonstrates good accuracy for binary classification and offers low-complexity and high-scalability in terms of its processing requirements.	neuron	Anang Hudaya Muhamad Amin;Asad I.

In the experimental work, unidirectional MINs like Omega, Butterfly and Clos are investigated. The study is completed by bidirectional binary, fat and full binary tree. To avoid link contentions and associated delays, collective communications are processed in synchronized steps. Minimum number of steps is sought for the given network topology, wormhole switching, minimum routing and given sets of sender and/or receiver nodes. Evolutionary algorithm proposed in this paper is able to design optimal schedules for broadcast and scatter collective communications. Acquired optimum schedules can simplify the consecutive writing high-performance communication routines for application-specific networks on chip, or for development of communication libraries in case of general-purpose multistage interconnection networks.	bidirectional search;binary tree;clos network;evolutionary algorithm;file allocation table;general-purpose markup language;library (computing);mathematical optimization;multistage interconnection networks;network topology;omega;routing;wormhole switching	Jirí Jaros	2009		10.1145/1569901.1570107	real-time computing;multidisciplinary design optimization;binary tree;computer science;evolutionary algorithm;distributed computing;network topology;computer network	HPC	-1.5737052514008025	69.54651938909389	146120

In this paper, we investigate the use of multicore as the compute platform for routing applications using BGP, the ubiquitous protocol for routing in the Internet backbone, as a representative application. We develop a scalable multithreaded implementation for BGP and evaluate its performance on several multicore configurations using a fully configurable multicore simulation environment. We implement several optimizations at the software and architecture levels, achieving a speedup of 6.5 times over the sequential implementation, which translates to a throughput of ∼170K updates per second. Subsequently, we propose a generic architecture and parallelization methodology which can be applied to all routing protocol implementations to achieve significant performance improvement.	border gateway protocol;central processing unit;control plane;image scaling;internet backbone;legacy code;library (computing);multi-core processor;multithreading (computer architecture);parallel computing;power supply unit (computer);routing;scalability;simulation;software architecture;speedup;thread (computing);throughput	Abhishek Dhanotia;Sabina Grover;Gregory T.

In this work we propose an efficient approach to application-specific irregular topology generation for contention-free NoC. We take advantage of a priori knowledge of the communication characteristic of the application (embedded system) to perform computation and communication scheduling and route generation with regard for performance constraints. In the result we obtain customized and minimal topology. During topology generation we take into consideration energy and resource issues, so our methodology assumes simple router architecture and minimal number of links.

f3b46205ce173f68de3221370a598fed15b84491	novel wsn hardware for long range low power monitoring		Environmental monitoring applications often require 24/7 operation in harsh, low resource (e.g. power and communication) environments over a large scale area with ad-hoc deployment of sensors. Data processing at the sensor is required to minimize communication overhead. Such an application scenario presents opportunities for research in wireless sensor networks (WSN)s that are distinct from existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions. We present a novel modular, highly flexible, hardware solution with a core feature of a System on a Chip (SoC) with add-ons such as memories, interfaces, and different transmission input/output I/O modalities.

Each node can fail independently with probability p. Failures are permanent. The primary focus is on Byzantine failures, but we also handle crash-stop failures. We consider two network models: a regular grid, and a random network. Our necessary and sufficient conditions for the Byzantine failure model indicate that p should be less than frac12, and the critical node degree is Theta(dmin+(lnn/ln(1/2p))+ln(1/2(1-p))) (where dmin is the minimum node degree associated with a non-empty neighborhood, and is a small constant). For a random network we prove that, for failure probability less than frac12, the critical average degree for reliable broadcast is O(lnn/frac12-p+frac12ln(1/2(1-p))). We briefly discuss the issue of crash-stop failures for which we have results that improve upon previously existing results for this model, when p approaches 0. We also identify an interesting similarity in the structure of various known results in the literature pertaining to a set of related problems in the realm of connectivity and reliable broadcast.	byzantine fault tolerance;consensus (computer science);extensibility;failure;flow network;grid network;random graph;regular grid;software deployment;vii	Vartika Bhandari;Nitin H.

Their analysis yields an expression for the average message delay, under the assumption of a Poisson message arrival process. In the present paper a much more general treatment of the same problem is presented, resulting in a closed form expression for the whole probability generating function of the message delay, which is valid for a general arrival process. A I. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM TIME division multiple access (TDMA) system (or a loop communication system) with multiple contiguous output is considered. In such a system, time is divided into time slots of constant length and a fixed number, say u , of contiguous slots is allocated to each station in a periodical fashion. For a given station, a frame is defined as the time period between the ends of two adjacent groups of u contiguous transmission slots (Fig. 1 ) . It is assumed that the stations have at their disposal an unlimited buffer for the temporary storage of messages awaiting transmission. The messages have the same constant length of one slot each and are transmitted on a first-comefirst-served basis. They arrive at each station according to a general uncorrelated arrival process, i.e., the numbers of arrivals at a station during the subsequent frames are described as a sequence of i. i.d. random variables. Let E(z ) denote the (common) probability generating function of these random variables. The purpose of the paper is to derive the delay performance of the messages at a given station in terms of the quantity u and the function E(z). The queueing analysis of TDMA or similar systems has been addressed previously in the scientific literature on many occasions; see, for instance, [I]-[7]. Related work, in a different context, has also been reported in [9]-[13]. Several authors have derived the generating function of the queue length for the case where one single slot per frame (u = 1) is allocated to each station [2], [3], [5], [7], or for the case of multiple (u > 1) contiguous output [4], [6]. The distribution (or, at least, the mean value) of the message delay has been obtained for the case u = 1 , for instance, in [5]-[7]. However, to the best of the author’s knowledge, the analysis of the message delay for the case u > 1 has been addressed only once, namely, in a recent paper by KO and Davis [l]. Their analysis is valid for a Poisson arrival process only and yields an expression for the average delay. Using a different analytic approach, we obtain in this paper the whole probability generating function of the message delay for a general uncorrelated message arrival process.

QUEUE LENGTH AS SEEN BY NEW ARRIVALS In the sequel we assume that the length of u contiguous slots is much less than the frame length. In these circumstances it is justified to analyze the buffer behavior at a given station as if departures from the queue were only possible at the end of a frame (Fig. l ) , an approximation which was also tacitly introduced by KO and Davis [ I ] . Let uk denote the queue length at any given station just prior to the kth frame, and ek the number of messages arriving at this station during the kth frame; then the following state equation holds: u k + , = ( u k + e k u ) + (1) where c+ denotes max (0, c). The equilibrium queue length distribution at frame marks is then described by the probability generating function V(Z), defined as V ( Z ) 4 lim E[zUk] (2) where E [ . . 1 indicates the expected value of the expression between square brackets. The function V(z), defined in ( 2 ) , can be derived from (1) in a straightforward and well-known fashion. It is given by (see, for instance, [6]) k + m where zlr z2, . . , zuI are the u 1 zeros of E ( @ z u inside the unit circle of the complex plane. The number of messages in the queue as seen by a new arrival depends on the order that the arrival comes in (within the frame) and on the queue length at the beginning of this frame. It can be shown (see [SI) that the probability generating function X(z) of the queue length at arrival instants can be derived from the function V(z) by means of the formula The proof of this equation is based on the uncorrelated nature of the arrival process and also assumes single arrivals (as opposed to bulk arrivals). Combination of (3) and (4) yields an explicit expression for the function X(@: 0090-6778/86/0700-0681$01 .OO O 1986 IEEE 682 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL COM-34. NO. 7. J U L Y 1986 111. MESSAGE DELAY We define the message delay (d) at any given station as the time duration between the message arrival and its transmission (Fig. 2). I n view of the approximation mentioned at the beginning of Section 11, the message delay consists of one fractional frame (namely, the remainder of the frame of arrival) and an integer number ( r ) of frames, which will be referred to as the discrete message delay. In this section we derive the probability distribution of the random variable r . We proceed as follows. Let x denote the number of messages in the queue at the arrival instant of a message. Then the discrete message delay r o'f this message is given by r = I:] where [ c ] denotes the integer part of c. Note that the random variable. x is described by the probability generating function X ( Z ) introduced in Section 11. * .Equation (6) makes clear that Brob [ r = k ] = c Prob [ x = k u + j ] , k 2 0. u I	approximation;computer science;expanded memory;floor and ceiling functions;national fund for scientific research;scientific literature;system time;xfig	Herwig Bruneel	1986	IEEE Trans.

For example, applications such as wild-fire monitoring require data to be presented to users in a timely manner. However, most models and algorithms for sensor networks have focused on alternative metrics such as energy efficiency. In this paper, we present a new model of sensor network aggregation that focuses on total latency. Our model is flexible and enables users to configure varying transmission and computation time on a node-by-node basis, and thus enables the simulation of complex computational phenomena. In addition, we present results from three tasking algorithms that trade-off local communication for overall latency performance. These algorithms are evaluated in simulated networks of up to 200 nodes.	algorithm;computation;cyber-physical system;distributed algorithm;information processing;interrupt latency;real-time transcription;schedule (computer science);simulation;time complexity;vii;world wide web	James Horey;Brent Lagesse	2011	2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops	10.1109/ICDMW.2011.109	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;information processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;distributed computing;efficient energy use	Robotics	9.899206862109395	73.29539789234632	149049
17672773ef914b8449831be3cc78c13ab49ebd3b	dynamic partitioning to mitigate stuck-at faults in emerging memories		Emerging non-volatile memories have many advantages over conventional memory. Unfortunately, many are susceptible to write endurance challenges, resulting in stuck-at faults. Existing mitigation methods statically partition and invert data within a block containing such faults (partition-and-flip) to ensure data is written to match stuck-at cells such that they may remain in service. Unfortunately, these schemes have limited fault tolerance capabilities and require the assumption that their auxiliary bits are fault free. We propose a dynamic partitioning scheme that improves the number of tolerated stuck-at faults and simultaneously protects auxiliary bits. Dynamic partitioning can significantly improve the fault tolerance over existing static partitioning approaches with an equal number of auxiliary bits. Moreover, it can often still improve fault tolerance while reducing the number of auxiliary bits. Compared to flip-N-write and Aegis, a leading mitigation scheme, dynamic partitioning can achieve 7–72% and 5–53 x lower write error rates, respectively, for the same capacity overhead with a stuck-at-fault rate of 10−3.	benchmark (computing);bit field;error message;fault tolerance;image scaling;lookup table;non-volatile memory;overhead (computing);resistive random-access memory	Jiangwei Zhang;Donald Kline;Liang Fang;Rami G.

Wireless industrial communication is gaining popularity due to its cost-effectiveness, flexibility and capability of functioning in harsh environments. However, to replace the wired counterpart in the most critical applications performing real-time control and monitoring, the according requirements in terms of latency, reliability and determinism must be met, the latency among which is found to be the bottleneck. To improve the latency performance of wireless communication, modification or new techniques should be developed. Moreover, medium access control (MAC) design should be based on valid timing parameters, as to achieve ultra-low latency, the timing parameters are pushed to the limits. In this paper, we consider to provide fundamental timing constraints as valid inputs for MAC design for wireless high performance network. We start from determining the fundamental constraints as well as the affecting factor in the timing perspective, and then we review and analyze some state-of-art wireless implementations in terms of the timing indexes. Based on the investigation and analysis, realistic timing constraints of different algorithms, hardware, mechanisms are presented, and three main directions for MAC design in wireless high performance network are outlined.

Accordingly, the sensing, computing and communicating infrastructure is set with a programmable middleware that allows for quickly deploying different applications running on top of it so as to follow the changing ambient needs. In this scenario, we face the problem of setting up the desired application in complex scenarios with hundreds of nodes, which consists of identifying which actions should be performed by each of the nodes so as to satisfy the ambient needs while minimizing the application impact on the infrastructure battery lifetime. Accordingly, we approach the problem by considering every possible decomposition of the application's sensing and computing operations into tasks to be assigned to each infrastructure component. The contribution of energy consumption due to the performance of each task is then considered to compute a cost function, allowing us to evaluate the viability of each deployment solution. Simulation results show that our framework results in considerable energy conservation with respect to sink-oriented or cluster-oriented deployment approaches, particularly for networks with high node densities, non-uniform energy consumption and initial energy, and complex actions.	algorithm;ambient intelligence;computation (action);deploy;distributed computing;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;inference;middleware;node - plant part;personnameuse - assigned;programming paradigm;simulation;solutions;density;sensor (device)	Virginia Pilloni;Luigi Atzori	2011		10.3390/s110807395	embedded system;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;data mining;nanotechnology;computer security	Mobile	9.766786481577638	72.50179249765822	149416

It is challenging to process multimedia data in real-time with the highest possible QoS, while avoiding potential thermal problems. To aggravate the problem, immediate dissipation of the accumulated heat is infeasible. In this paper, we design an empirical model to predict the power consumption and resulting processor temperature for video decoding. Based on the model, we develop a predictive method that avoids deadline misses due to thermal faults by adapting the video quality before the temperature exceeds the specified threshold. We implement our predictive control scheme and two baseline approaches by extending an open source implementation of the H.264 scalable video coding standard. Our approach controls the temperature to be below the specified threshold for most of the time unlike the tested baselines, while supporting similar or even better video quality.	baseline (configuration management);central processing unit;control theory;data compression;experiment;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;multi-core processor;open-source software;overshoot (signal);quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;scalability;scalable video coding;streaming media;video coding format;video decoder	Mehmet H.

WSNs are applied in monitoring, measurement, and control. Nuclear power plants (NPPs), in particular, have not been eager to adopt WSNs due to reliability, electromagnetic and radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI) as well as security concerns. On the other hand, the two main benefits from adding WSNs to NPPs are increased reliability from using robust wireless monitoring as a backup network for the primary wired system and reduce costs from installation and maintenance (in comparison to wired networks). We propose a new fault model and a fault tolerant in-network aggregation scheme, bitvector. First, in order to mimic the interference environment in NPP, we define a new fault model with time-dependent faults. We propose the fault duration concept, a time span during which the link error rate is fixed, such as when EMI/RFI appears between nodes. Therefore, the fault duration is an indicator of the network stability. Second, based on the fault model, there are some network links whose quality are not good during a fault duration interval. Bitvector estimates neighbor link quality dynamically and orders primary and backup parents dynamically according to link quality estimation. In addition, since data rate is low in NPPs, bitvector is able to use redundancy to improve accuracy. In particular, for some faults, bitvector defers fault detection and fault recovery by one sensing interval. Experiments show that bitvector significantly improves performance in root mean square (RMS) error and correct message rate, benefits of bitvector are even larger for environments with high fault rates.	backup;bit array;data rate units;emi;fault detection and isolation;fault model;fault tolerance;interference (communication);mean squared error;radio frequency;uninterruptible power supply	Wenchen Wang;Daniel Mossé;Daniel G.

From road safety to recreation applications, a wide range of services are emerging from the rapid technological advances in vehicles sensing, computing, and wireless capabilities. The key issue with respect to those new purposes is the ability of vehicles to disseminate information collected by on-board sensing devices about their surroundings. In this paper, we propose a component-based approach to analyze existing dissemination protocols for VANETs. Our results help better understand the behavior of each component by avoiding the interplays that may result from their combination. We also identify which technical instantiations best fit to different application profiles and environment parameters, while having regard to the resulting performance issues.	component-based software engineering;curve fitting;floor and ceiling functions;hoc (programming language);on-board data handling	Prométhée Spathis;Raul Adrian Gorcitz;Ryuji Wakikawa;Serge Fdida	2012		10.1145/2402599.2402608	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;analysis;modularity;computer security;dissemination;computer network	HCI	5.477100243426262	72.14657704087836	149848

A novel distributed network partition scheme is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, a largescale network can be partitioned into some wheellike sub-networks with nuclear nodes. In wheellike sub-networks, ring links and spoke links could provide reciprocal safeguard. Based on such structure, different distributed restoration schemes can be combined for failure restoration. The proposed partition approach has been implemented through computer simulation, and it was tested on practical national-scale optical networks. The simulation result shows that this scheme is practicable and effectual. key words: network partition, distributed restoration, large-scale optical network, sub-network	centralized computing;circuit restoration;computer simulation;network partition;subnetwork	Hui He;Ge Fan;Chao Guo	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e88-b.3.1256	computer simulation;ring network;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;node;implementation;computer network	Networks	-3.979765217991838	74.32773955672708	150025

Such a many-core system requires high-performance interconnections to transfer data among the cores on the chip. Traditional system components interface with the interconnection backbone via a bus interface. This interconnection backbone can be an on-chip bus or multilayer bus architecture. With the advent of many-core architectures, the bus architecture becomes the performance bottleneck of the on-chip interconnection framework. In contrast, network on chip (NoC) becomes a promising on-chip communication infrastructure, which is commonly considered as an aggressive long-term approach for onchip communications. Accordingly, this paper first discusses several common architectures and prevalent techniques that can deal well with the design issues of communication performance, power consumption, signal integrity, and system scalability in an NoC. Finally, a novel bidirectional NoC (BiNoC) architecture with a dynamically self-reconfigurable bidirectional channel is proposed to break the conventional performance bottleneck caused by bandwidth restriction in conventional NoCs.

A possible next step in this evolution is to use ATM for memory interconnect. This paper discusses how ATM can fulfill the functional and performance requirements in a memory interconnect, and the implications this will have for external ATM communication. We conclude that ATM can be used as a memory interconnect. It can meet the throughput requirements but will have problems with the latency requirements for the transfer of small cache lines. The fixed 48 byte payload in ATM results in inefficient use of bandwidth and increased latency. The ATM and the ATM Adaptation Layers do not have sufficient functionality and must be extended to meet memory interconnect requirements. Using ATM internally in the memory interconnect has a limited synergy effect when the system is connected to an ATM based LAN or WAN.	atm turbo;atm adaptation layer;byte;cpu cache;cache (computing);requirement;synergy;throughput	Per Gunningberg;Øivind Kure	1995			embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;atm adaptation layer;computer network	Arch	-3.8313791579172376	64.83094157867805	150174

04b57b984803644cc2061e344d38d71fe2ea4d8e	exploring a novel cryptographic solution for securing small satellite communications		The need for encryption for use onboard satellites is a growing issue. While larger and modern satellites may have the hardware capabilities to use common terrestrial encryption schemes, smaller and older satellites may lack such capabilities. Small satellites are becoming increasingly important, and securing their communications a necessity. The Department of Defense, for example, is developing CubeSats, a type of small satellite, for use in operations. Despite the growing need, currently, there is no agreed upon encryption algorithm for these devices, which have limited hardware capabilities and physical space. This paper presents and characterizes a novel algorithm that uses chaos theory to encrypt data. Specifically, a proof-of-concept of this novel algorithm is presented. It is then compared against AES and SPECK in terms of speed of encryption and decryption.	algorithm;block size (cryptography);byte;chaos theory;communications satellite;cryptography;encryption;ibm notes;mathematical optimization;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);speck (cipher);terrestrial television	Samuel Jackson;Jeremy Straub;Scott Kerlin	2018	I.

However, its increasing node degree is an obvious weakness. Some networks such as the Cube-Connected Circle and the DeBruijn Network have been proposed to overcome the increasing degree of the hypercube. I n this paper, we present a new, cost-eflective network which outperforms the cube network. It can overcome the increasing degree of the cube network while keeping the advantages of the cube network such as logarithmic diameter, easy routing, optimal fault tolerance, and suitability for the ASCEND/DESCEND class of parallel problems. Furthermore, the proposed network achaeves the logarithmic diameter with a very small constant node degree, 3 or 4.	ascend;cube;fault tolerance;interconnection;routing	Guihai Chen;Francis C. M.

The main idea is to use several dimensions of practical size in hierarchical multiplexing to overcome the physical constraints present when using only one dimension of large size. We generalize the case of one-dimensional switching networks to k-dimensional switching networks. Such networks have high degree of connectivity (>> 1OOO) and reduced complexity compared to one-dimensional networks. We introduce a technology-independent universal theory discussing two models, one of multidimensional selective switching, and the other of multidimensional broadcasting, concentrating on complexity and channel assignment. The required size of each dimension, hardware complexities, channel assignment, and corresponding routing algorithms and their time complexities are discussed. It is shown with examples how the complexity of these networks can be reduced to a minimum by optimal allocation of the complexity in each dimension. Several realizations of three-dimensional wavelength-time-space networks using different technologies (e.g., fiberoptics, acousto-optics, free-space and photonic switching) are described for both models.	blocking (computing);clos network;columbia (supercomputer);complexity;computer;crosstalk;digest access authentication;electrical engineering;electron;ibm research;lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;non-blocking algorithm;optical fiber;point-to-point (telecommunications);routing;sensor;telecommunications network;universality probability;wavelength-division multiplexing	Jacob Sharony	1994	IEEE/ACM Trans.

This general task can take many different forms, depending on the specific reliability metric. Numerous methods are known to accomplish it in various situations, precisely or approximately, but usually demanding significant algorithmic complexity. The issue we address is that what happens if the input data is unreliable, i.e., it is only known with limited accuracy. We propose a mathematical approach that can estimate and bound the resulting error, in terms of the input inaccuracy. It is particularly interesting that the method applies to a very broad class of models, independently of the actual reliability model that is chosen from the class. This feature allows wide applicability of our method, and also makes possible the handling of uncertainties in the considered model itself, not only in the input data.	analysis of algorithms;computational complexity theory;network topology;reliability engineering;vii	András Faragó	2013	2013 9th International Conference on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN)		reliability engineering;reliability theory;computer science;probability;data mining;statistics	DB	2.010923896317301	71.49386793582974	152078

The aim of the first phase is to find a set of alternative routes for each commodity, while the traff ic of each commodity is optimally distributed on the alternative routes in the second phase. Our final goal is to route all messages so that the average time delay of a message is minimized. Since the Hopfield neural network (HNN) can only solve problems whose energy functions can be expressed as quadratic forms, the expression of the average time delay of a packet needs first to be simpli fied and then explicitl y included into the energy function. Our algorithm is applied to two network models, both of which have been previously analyzed by other researchers using mathematical methods. Compared with previous results, the proposed algorithm considerably reduces the time delay a packet encounters. A large number of experiments also indicate that the proposed algorithm has very good stabilit y. Our work provides a possible routing policy for future high speed communication networks due to the fact that a hardware-implemented NN can achieve an extremely high response speed.	algorithm;artificial neural network;broadcast delay;experiment;hopfield network;mathematical optimization;network packet;packet switching;routing;telecommunications network;two-phase commit protocol	G.

A prime example is the parallel packet switch (PPS) in which a demultiplexing algorithm sends cells, arriving at rate $R$ on $N$ input-ports, through one of $K$ intermediate slower switches, operating at rate $r<R$. In order to utilize the parallelism of the PPS, a key issue is to balance the load among the planes; since randomization is known as a successful paradigm to solve load balancing problems, it is tempting to design randomized demultiplexing algorithms that balance the load on the average. This paper presents lower bounds on the average queuing delay introduced by the PPS relative to an optimal work-conserving first-come first-serve (FCFS) switch for randomized demultiplexing algorithms that do not have full and immediate information about the switch status. These lower bounds are shown to be asymptotically optimal through a methodology for analyzing the maximal relative queuing delay by measuring the imbalance between the middle stage switches; clearly, this also bounds (from above) the average relative queuing delay. The methodology is used to devise new algorithms that rely on slightly outdated global information on the switch status. It is also used to provide, for the first time, a complete proof of the maximum relative queuing delay provided by the fractional traffic dispatch algorithm [S. Iyer and N. McKeown, in Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE Communications Society, New York, NY, 2001, pp. 1680-1687; D. Khotimsky and S. Krishnan, in Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, IEEE Communications Society, New York, NY, 2001, pp. 100-106]. These optimal algorithms are deterministic, proving that randomization does not reduce the relative queuing delay of the PPS.	network switch;packet switching	Hagit Attiya;David Hay	2008	SIAM J.

While most work in the field of power management and low-power design has focused on optimizing the energy consumer (i.e., the sensor node, including its hardware, software, applications, and network protocols), very little work has targeted the energy supply system itself. A practical approach to alleviating the problem of limited battery resources in sensor nodes is the use of environmental energy harvesting. Solar energy harvesting, in particular, holds significant promise since photovoltaic conversion techniques are now mature enough to permit the development of cheap and small, yet reasonably efficient, solar panels. Our demonstration showcases our recent research in designing solar energy harvesting systems, as well as harvesting aware performance scaling algorithms and network protocols [1].	algorithm;autonomous robot;communications protocol;image scaling;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;power management;sensor node;solar cell	Kris Lin;Jennifer Yu;Jason Hsu;Sadaf Zahedi;David Lee;Jonathan Friedman;Aman Kansal;Vijay Raghunathan;Mani B.

The development of a reliable and robust large-scale WSN system requires that the design concepts are checked and optimized before they are implemented and tested for a specific hardware platform. Simulation provides a cost effective and feasible method of examining the correctness and scalability of the system before deployment. In this paper, we study the performance of Pymote, a high level Python library for event-based simulation of distributed algorithms in wireless ad-hoc networks. We extended the Pymote framework allowing it to simulate packet level performance. The extension includes radio propagation, energy consumption, mobility and other models. The extended framework also provides interactive plotting, data collection and logging facilities for improved analysis and evaluation of the simulated system.	chart;cluster analysis;computer simulation;correctness (computer science);displacement mapping;distributed algorithm;high- and low-level;high-level programming language;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;internet of things;mathematical optimization;network packet;python;routing;scalability;sid meier's alpha centauri;software deployment;software propagation;ubiquitous computing	Farrukh Shahzad	2016	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2016.2570220	algorithm design;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;human–computer interaction;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;internet of things;computer network	Mobile	4.09553755178877	74.4823724753984	153528

The router is optimized for voice transmission in the mobile base station network. IP Header Compression (RFC 2507), compresses and restores long headers of packets in point-to-point message streams improving bandwidth utilization and real-time characteristics. The function was implemented in FPGA technology using a new high-level design language based on the software language ANSI-C. The design method used is similar to methods for software design. The resulting hardware can be tested in full speed on a PCI-board. In a parallel effort, a second group of designers using the same specification implemented the same functionality using traditional hardware design methods and tools. This enabled us to compare the efficiency of the two design methods. Using the new methods, the design was completed 3-4 times faster with similar results in terms of speed and area. This can be attributed to support for sequential logic and a compact representation in the language and to a software-like design methodology with fast turnaround in the design environment."""	handel-c	Kjell Torkelsson;Johan Ditmar	2001		10.1109/DSD.2001.952110	embedded system;real-time computing;design methods;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network	HCI	-3.572193955523816	64.37154632102556	153901

Moreover, the industry expects platform-based SoC design to evolve to communication-centric design, with NoCs as a central enabling technology. In this article, we introduce the AEthereal NoC. The tenet of the AEthereal NoC is that guaranteed services (GSs) - such as uncorrupted, lossless, ordered data delivery; guaranteed throughput; and bounded latency - are essential for the efficient construction of robust SoCs. To exploit the NoC capacity unused by the GS traffic, we provide best-effort services.	best-effort delivery;lossless compression;network on a chip;network switch;roland gs;semiconductor;system on a chip;throughput	Kees G.

For server and high-performance computing markets, however, such DRAM caches must also provide sufficient support for reliability and fault tolerance. While conventional off-chip memory provides ECC support by adding one or more extra chips, this may not be practical in a 3D stack. In this paper, we present a DRAM cache organization that uses error-correcting codes (ECCs), strong checksums (CRCs), and dirty data duplication to detect and correct a wide range of stacked DRAM failures, from traditional bit errors to large-scale row, column, bank, and channel failures. With only a modest performance degradation compared to a DRAM cache with no ECC support, our proposal can correct all single-bit failures, and 99.9993% of all row, column, and bank failures, providing more than a 54,000x improvement in the FIT rate of silent-data corruptions compared to basic SECDED ECC protection.	cpu cache;checksum;computer memory;die (integrated circuit);dirty data;dynamic random-access memory;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;fault tolerance;forward error correction;hamming code;server (computing);supercomputer	Jaewoong Sim;Gabriel H.

It demonstrates how a particular heuristic extension of the arrival theorem, which was introduced earlier for very special network topologies, can be effectively applied (in an essentially unchanged manner) to obtain all mean performance measures for a rich class of Gordon-Newell like non-product-form queueing networks (QNs). All nodes in the class of queueing networks discussed are either FIFO or IS (pure delay), there is a single closed chain with probabilistic routing and each FIFO node also processes customers from a dedicated open chain. The number of FIFO nodesK, the number of IS nodesL and the closed chain populationN are finite but arbitrary and closed chain customers route probabilistically according to an arbitrary routing matrixQ. The think time distribution at an IS node is general, the service time distribution for both closed chain and open chain customers at the FIFO nodes is exponential with distinct service times for each, and both IS think times and FIFO service times are node dependent.	queueing theory	Jay S Kaufman;Wing Shing Wong	1994	Annals OR	10.1007/BF02024660	real-time computing;gordon–newell theorem;computer science;layered queueing network;distributed computing;network topology;computer network	Metrics	3.549482684840885	69.51945318997576	155124

A new arrival is assigned to the queue with the smaller buffer content. We construct formal (as opposed to rigorous) asymptotic approximations to the Joint stationary distribution of the Markov process ( U_{1}(t), U_{2}(t) ), treating separately the asymptotic limits of heavy traffic, light traffic, and large buffer contents. In heavy traffic, the stochastic processes U_{1}(t) + U_{2}(t) and U_{2}(t) - U_{1}(t) become independent, with the distribution of U_{1}(t) + U_{2}(t) identical to the heavy traffic waiting time distribution in the standard M/G/2 queue, and the distribution of U_{2}(t) - U_{1}(t) closely related to the tail of the service time density. In light traffic, we obtain a formal expansion of the stationary distribution in powers of the arrival rate.		Charles Knessl;Bernard J. Matkowsky;Zeev Schuss;Charles Tier	1987	IEEE Trans.

Although primarily suited for next-generationserver I/O, the InfiniBand can also extend to the embedded computing, storage, and telecommunications industries. This high-volume, industry-standard I/O interconnect extends the role of traditional backplane and board buses beyond the physical connector. Today’s data center environment uses multiple technologies for storage, communications, and clustering. The most common example of this environment is using a low-latency Fibre Channel network for storage connectivity and Ethernet for server communications. The increased demand for online services has created fundamental bottlenecks in server and networking designs for system architects. One major bottleneck is the use of software transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) stack to implement reliable transport services over Ethernet networks. This contributes high latency to the communications link and consumes a significant amount of the processor’s resources as the application tries to fill the link with reliable data traffic. Another major bottleneck is the scalability problem with parallel-bus architectures such as the peripheral component interconnect (PCI). As these buses scale in speed, they can’t support the multiple network interfaces that system designers require. For example the PCI-X bus at 133 MHz can only support one slot and at higher speeds these buses begin to look like point-topoint connections. Over 200 sponsoring companies from the server, storage, and communications industries formed the InfiniBand Trade Association to develop a standard I/O technology that overcomes these bottlenecks and addresses other current and future data center needs. The resulting InfiniBand standard is a scalable, switched-fabric architecture that includes hardware transport capabilities to relieve the CPU of protocol overhead. Mellanox Technologies’ InfiniBand silicon product, InfiniBridge, lets system designers construct entire fabrics based on the device’s switching and channel adapter functionality.

Memories are one of the elements affected by soft errors, which cause bitflips in some of the cells. A number of techniques such as the use of Error Correction Codes (ECCs), interleaving or scrubbing are utilized to mitigate the effects of soft errors on memories. Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) pose additional challenges, as many of those protection techniques are not applicable to CAMs. In this paper, a novel protection technique for CAMs is proposed, showing a convenient way to tackle false positives and negatives, and quantitatively studying the achieved benefit in reliability.

However, the most prevalent applications of queueing theory are in the telecommunications field. Queueing Theory for Telecommunications: Discrete Time Modelling of a Single Node System focuses on discrete time modeling and illustrates that most queueing systems encountered in real life can be set up as a Markov chain. This feature is very unique because the models are set in such a way that matrix-analytic methods are used to analyze them. Queueing Theory for Telecommunications: Discrete Time Modelling of a Single Node System is the most relevant book available on queueing models designed for applications to telecommunications. This book presents clear concise theories behind how to model and analyze key single node queues in discrete time using special tools that were presented in the second chapter. The text also delves into the types of single node queues that are very frequently encountered in telecommunication systems modeling, and provides simple methods for analyzing them. Where appropriate, alternative analysis methods are also presented.	computer;markov chain;queueing theory;real life;systems modeling	John N.

A general strategy of sharing multiple types of discrete resources with finite capacity under the model of DRS is proposed. It is based upon a media access protocol, CSMA/CD-W (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection for Wireless), which supports wireless inter-robot communication among multiple autonomous mobile robots without using any centralized mechanism. This resource sharing strategy is derived based on the fact that with the single, time-multiplexed communication channel, asynchronous events for requesting and releasing resources are effectively serialized. It is shown that the control protocol is effective, efficient, reliable and robust.	robot	Jing Wang;Suparerk Premvuti	1996	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	10.1016/S0921-8890(96)00032-2	shared resource;mobile robot;embedded system;computer science;autonomous system;artificial intelligence;distributed computing;robotics;computer security;collision detection;channel	Robotics	-1.2973954534189907	73.13366883757672	156147

An efficient NoC router should not only minimize the average packet latency of the network but also have minimum pipeline latency, area, and power. Area and power overheads are affecting the scalability and popularity of traditional input buffered routers. In this context minimally buffered deflection routers are emerging as a cost effective alternative. We propose SLIDER, Smart Late Injection DEflection Router, that uses side buffers for accommodating a fraction of deflected flits. The main contributions of this work are smart late injection and selective flit preemption. In SLIDER the injection stage is kept at the end of the router pipeline. This reduces the contention in the arbitration stage, eliminates unwanted intra-router movement of flits and effectively utilizes the idle output channels. We parallelize independent operations in the router pipeline and reduce the pipeline latency by 25%. Experimental results on synthetic and real workloads show that SLIDER reduces average flit latency, channel wastage, and deflection rate, and increases throughput in the network when compared to the state-of-the-art minimally buffered deflection routers.	computer performance;dhrystone;multi-core processor;network on a chip;network packet;preemption (computing);router (computing);scalability;throughput;vii	Bhawna Nayak;John Jose;Madhu Mutyam	2013	2013 IEEE 31st International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)	10.1109/ICCD.2013.6657068	core router;embedded system;routing;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;network on a chip;one-armed router;computer network	Arch	2.07650080742598	62.09249956471314	156412

Especially, as Internet traffic is growing at a fast rate, designing Next Generation Networks (NGN) to be more energy efficient is increasingly important. Approaches towards making network components less energy consuming include: optimising hardware, the use of smart standby and/or adapting the power consumption (by scaling the clock frequency) in response to the traffic load. This paper examines the possible power savings on the NetFPGA 1G reference router when scaling the frequency of router core logic and SRAMs between 125MHz and 62.5MHz. Power measurements taken with the National Instruments USB-6251 for three different packet sizes, are analysed and discussed.	clock rate;image scaling;netfpga;network packet;next-generation network;router (computing)	Feng Guo;Olga Ormond;Martin Collier;Xiaojun Wang	2012	2012 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications (GreenCom)	10.1109/GreenCom.2012.6519626	core router;embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;computer network	Metrics	4.973513599415769	62.45790912765275	157014

One basic drawback of these networks is that they cannot provide a desired level of fault tolerance because of the bounded degree of the nodes. On the other hand, networks like hypercube (where degree of a node grows with the size of a network) can provide the desired fault tolerance but the design of a node becomes problematic for large networks. In their attempt to combine the best of the both worlds, authors in [1] proposed hyper-deBruijn networks that have many additional features of logarithmic diameter, partitionability, embedding etc. But, hyper-deBruijn networks are not regular, are not optimally fault tolerant and the optimal routing is relatively complex. Our purpose in the present paper is to extend the concepts used in [1] to propose a new family of scalable network graphs that retain all the good features of hyper-deBruijn networks as well as are regular and maximally fault tolerant; the optimal point to point routing algorithm is very simple.	algorithm;asymptotically optimal algorithm;butterfly graph;emoticon;fault tolerance;grid network;hyper-heuristic;input/output;interconnection;maximal set;memory-mapped i/o;multiprocessing;point of view (computer hardware company);routing;scalability;very-large-scale integration	Wei Shi;Pradip K.

This will require high-performance on-chip networks with very low latency to provide a communication substrate for the increasing number of cores. In this paper, we consider Gaussian on-chip networks that are of significant topological advantages over traditional mesh and torus networks in terms of diameter and average hop distance. Many applications on MPSoCs need global data movement and global control to exchange data and synchronize the execution among cores, which require all-to-all broadcast communication. In this paper, we propose an all-to-all broadcast algorithm suitable for on-chip implementation on the Gaussian network topology. The algorithm utilizes controlled message flooding based on a broadcast pattern, which can be described in a formal, generic way for each node in terms of a few simple operations and can be easily built into router hardware. Furthermore, the generic broadcast pattern also ensures a balanced traffic load in all dimensions in the network so that minimum total latency for all-to-all broadcast can be achieved. The algorithm overlaps message switching time with transmission time in a pipelined fashion to further reduce the total communication latency of all-to-all broadcast. Comparison results demonstrate the topological merits of Gaussian networks and ultralow latency of the proposed all-to-all broadcast algorithm.	algorithm;genetic algorithm;load balancing (computing);multiprocessing;network topology;pipeline (computing);router (computing);routing;switching time;system on a chip	Zhemin Zhang;Zhiyang Guo;Yuanyuan Yang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.2012.126	broadcast domain;system on a chip;embedded system;broadcast radiation;parallel computing;real-time computing;atomic broadcast;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	Arch	2.056168377022397	62.528342445903455	157815
26302cbb21b9108be140fb66b6f4acc1eb7f23a8	automated negotiation for opportunistic energy trading between neighbouring wireless sensor networks		As the Internet of Things grows, the number of wireless sensor networks deployed in close proximity will continue to increase. By nature, these networks are limited by the battery supply that determines their lifetime and system utility. To counter such a shortcoming, energy harvesting technologies have become increasingly investigated to provide a perpetual energy source; however, new problems arise as a result of their wide spatio-temporal variation. In this paper, we propose opportunistic energy trading, which enables otherwise independent networks to be sustained by sharing resources. Our goal is to provide a novel cooperation model based on negotiation to solve coordination conflicts between energy harvesting wireless sensor networks. Results show that networks are able to satisfy their loads when they agree to cooperate.		Andre P. Ortega;Geoff V. Merrett;Sarvapali D.

The focus of this paper is on wormhole routed multistage networks supporting turnaround routing. Existing machines characterized by such a system model include the IBM SP-1, TMC CM-5, and Meiko CS-2.Efficient collective communication among processor nodes is critical to the performance of SPCs. A system-level multicast service, in which the same message is delivered from a source node to an arbitrary number of destination nodes, is fundamental in supporting collective communication primitives including the application-level broadcast, reduction, and barrier synchronization. This paper addresses how to efficiently implement multicast services in wormhole-routed multistage networks, in the absence of hardware multicast support, by exploiting the properties of the switching technology. An optimal multicast algorithm is proposed. The results of implementations on a 64-node SP-1 show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the application-level broadcast primitives provided by currently existing collective communication libraries including the public domain MPI.	algorithm;barrier (computer science);computer;connection machine;library (computing);message passing interface;multicast;multistage amplifier;multistage interconnection networks;parallel computing;reduction (complexity);routing;scalability;traffic message channel	Hong A Xu;Yadong Gui;Lionel M.

An FBRN consists of multiple FDDI token rings and has the ability to reconfigure itself in the event of network faults. Thus, an FBRN has the potential to provide high available bandwidth even in the presence of numerous faults. Realization of this potential depends crucially on the choice of reconfiguration algorithm. We design and analyze a distributed reconfiguration algorithm for FBRNs. Our algorithm is optimal in the sense that it always produces a configuration that has the maximum available bandwidth possible for the given fault pattern. This algorithm has polynomial time complexity and hence can be efficiently implemented. We evaluate the algorithm's performance in terms of the available bandwidth in the network as a function of the number of faults.	algorithm;network architecture;time complexity;token ring	Sanjay Kamat	1995		10.1109/ICDCS.1995.500035	real-time computing;network architecture;computer science;distributed computing;suzuki-kasami algorithm;high availability;computational complexity theory;computer network;fiber distributed data interface	EDA	-1.3639614105677111	71.15912425465415	158578

Analytical modelling is a cost-effective tool and plays an important role in achieving a clear understanding of the network performance. However, most of the existing models for PCS are unable to capture the realistic nature of message behaviours generated by real-world applications, which have a significant impact on the design and performance of communication networks. This paper presents a new analytical model for PCS in interconnection networks in the presence of bursty and correlated message arrivals coupled with hot-spot destinations, which can capture the bursty message arrival process and non-uniform distribution of message destinations. Such a traffic pattern has been found in many practical communication environments. The accuracy of the proposed analytical model is validated through extensive simulation experiments. The model is then applied to investigate the effects of the bursty message arrivals and hot-spot destinations on the performance of interconnection networks with PCS.	circuit switching;hot spare;interconnection	Yulei Wu;Geyong Min;Mohamed Ould-Khaoua;Hao Yin	2011	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/j.jss.2011.05.045	real-time computing;cost-effectiveness analysis;telecommunications;computer science;uniform distribution;network performance;hot spot;circuit switching;statistics;computer network	Arch	-2.1235266192427513	68.17792746500439	158694

This paper describes design issues for such software, using a router for the Inmos TSOO transputer called Tiny as an example. Performance figures show that Tiny achieves near optimal routing performance given the hardware limits.

Suppose that initially the nodes contain one packet each addressed to distinct nodes of the cube. We show that there is a distributed randomized algorithm that can route every packet to its destination without two packets passing down the same wire at any one time, and finishes within time O(log N) with overwhelming probability for all such routing requests. Each packet carries with it O(log N) bits of bookkeeping information. No other communication among the nodes takes place.

We develop a new packet definition to support different requirements in an MIMD message passing architecture and also verify its efficiency by comparing simulation results with various routing algorithms. Major contributions of this paper are the design of Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture adopting a minimal adaptive routing algorithm with competitive performance and feasible design complexity, thus satisfying all the stated design goals. The proposed adaptive routing algorithm and NoC architecture offer nearly optimal performance. This can be shown by comparing with the near-optimal worst-case throughput routing algorithm for 2D-mesh networks. By providing a uniform way of constructing such network architecture, its scalability can be easily accomplished. Moreover, this network architecture can be applied to different SoC developments.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;deadlock;interconnection;mimd;mesh networking;message passing;multi-core processor;network architecture;network on a chip;network packet;prototype;requirement;router (computing);routing;scalability;simulation;throughput;very-large-scale integration	Jun Ho Bahn;Seung Eun Lee;Nader Bagherzadeh	2007	IJHPSA	10.1504/IJHPSA.2007.015395	chip;policy-based routing;high-throughput screening;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;parallel computing;message passing;network architecture;hierarchical routing;adaptive routing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;mesh networking;distributed computing;network operations center;very-large-scale integration;routing protocol;network on a chip;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network;satisfiability	Arch	1.8896897613148975	63.10214756052878	159965

Several parameters in the design space are investigated, namely, network topology, parallelism degree, the rate at which messages are sent by processing nodes over the network, and routing strategy. The main results of this analysis are as follows: 1) the most suited topologies to achieve high throughput with a limited complexity overhead are generalized de Bruijn and generalized Kautz topologies and 2) depending on the throughput requirements, different parallelism degrees, message injection rates, and routing algorithms can be used to minimize the network area overhead.	algorithm;de bruijn graph;network on a chip;network topology;overhead (computing);parallel computing;requirement;routing;simulation;throughput	Maurizio Martina;Guido Masera	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2010.2046257	routing;parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;network on a chip;computer network	Arch	1.881076251759033	63.07004095454538	160097

In most cases, the replacement of a dead node is difficult and costly. It is therefore crucial to minimize the total energy consumption of the network. Since the major consumer of power in WSNs is the data transmission process, we consider nodes which cooperate for data transmission in terms of groups. A group has a leader which collects data from the members and communicates with the outside of the group. We propose and formalize a model for data collection in which mobile entities, called data MULEs, are used to move between group leaders and collect data messages using short-range and low-power data transmission. We combine declarative and operational modeling. The declarative model abstractly captures behavior without committing to specific transitions by means of probability distributions, whereas the operational model is given as a concrete transition system in rewriting logic. The probabilistic, declarative model is not used to select transition rules, but to stochastically capture the result of applying rules. Technically, we use probabilistic rewriting logic and embed our models into PMaude, which gives us a simulation engine for the combined models. We perform statistical quantitative analysis based on repeated discrete-event simulations in Maude.	correctness (computer science);data mule;declarative programming;entity;low-power broadcasting;maude system;message passing;model checking;network theory;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;production (computer science);real-time clock;rewriting;sensor;simulation;state space;statistical model;transition system;vesta (software configuration management)	Fatemeh Kazemeyni;Einar Broch Johnsen;Olaf Owe;Ilangko Balasingham	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30729-4_11	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer security	Embedded	9.605018877811073	73.48764205452808	160674

Parameter tuning gave good communication performances compared with other PVM implementation that directly use the ATM Adaptation Layerinstead of TCP/IP. It is foreseen that, on developing PVM distributed applications, better communication performances could be obtained through a careful network parameter setting.	atm turbo;application programming interface;computer cluster;distributed computing;end-to-end principle;experiment;fork (software development);fragmentation (computing);ip fragmentation;internet protocol suite;network packet;parallel virtual machine;performance;throughput	Maurizio Giordano;Mario Mango Furnari;Francesco Vitobello	1999		10.1109/EURMIC.1999.794811	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing	HPC	-2.72277180362745	65.48608832976818	160751
290ccb6dad63344cbef4d54578fffd2959093dbd	det-wifi: a multihop tdma mac implementation for industrial deterministic applications based on commodity 802.11 hardware		Wireless control system for industrial automation has been gaining increasing popularity in recent years thanks to their ease of deployment and the low cost of their components. However, traditional low sample rate industrial wireless sensor networks cannot support high-speed application, while high-speed IEEE 802.11 networks are not designed for real-time application and not able to provide deterministic feature. Thus, in this paper, we propose Det-WiFi, a real-time TDMAMAC implementation for high-speed multihop industrial application. It is able to support high-speed applications and provide deterministic network features since it combines the advantages of high-speed IEEE802.11 physical layer and a software Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC layer. We implement Det-WiFi on commercial off-the-shelf hardware and compare the deterministic performance between 802.11s and Det-WiFi under the real industrial environment, which is full of field devices and industrial equipment. We changed the hop number and the packet payload size in each experiment, and all of the results show that Det-WiFi has better deterministic performance.	automation;centralized computing;control system;experiment;network architecture;network packet;real-time computing;real-time transcription;sampling (signal processing);software deployment;testbed;tridiagonal matrix algorithm	Yujun Cheng;Dong Hee Yang;Huachun Zhou	2017	Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1155/2017/4943691	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Embedded	6.0159867568506185	72.54281921489009	160991

It is desirable that one employs as few resource copies as possible to ensure that every node is able to reach the resource in a given number of hops, achieving efficient resource placement. This placement method also keeps system performance degradation minimal after one resource copy becomes unavailable due to a fault. First, we consider placing multiple copies of a certain resource in a way that every cube node without the resource is adjacent to a specified number of resource copies. The use of our developed perfect and quasiperfect multiple-adjacency codes makes it possible to arrive at efficient solutions to this placement problem in a simple and systematic manner for an arbitrary hypercube. We then deal with the generalized resource placement in the hypercube such that every node without the resource can reach no less than a specified number of resource copies in no more than a certain number of hops, using as few resource copies as possible. Our placement results yield lowest potential access contention for a given number of resource copies (i.e., cost), particularly useful for large-scale hypercubes.	code;elegant degradation	Hsing-Lung Chen;Nian-Feng Tzeng	1994	IEEE Trans.

This work investigates the new opportunities inherently provided by a particular class of hardware technologies, i.e., reconfigurable hardware devices, addressing the cryptanalysis of the SHA-1 hash function as a case study. We show how hardware reconfiguration enables some unexplored approaches such as algorithm and architecture exploration, as well as on-the-fly system specialization relying on hardware programmability. We also identify some new cryptanalysis methods, including two novel techniques for SHA-1 cryptanalysis called interbit constraints and constraint relaxation. Relying on the proposed approaches, we designed an FPGA-based platform targeting 71- and 75-round versions of SHA-1. Under the same cost budget, the estimated times for a collision achieved by the platform are at least one order of magnitude lower than other solutions based on high-end supercomputing facilities, reaching the highest performance/cost ratio for SHA-1 collision search and providing a striking confirmation of the impact of hardware reconfigurability.	algorithm;cryptanalysis;cryptographic hash function;cryptography;field-programmable gate array;hardware acceleration;linear programming relaxation;partial template specialization;reconfigurability;sha-1;supercomputer	Alessandro Cilardo;Nicola Mazzocca	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2013.2256898	embedded system;real-time computing;reconfigurable computing;computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;statistics	Crypto	9.61999405663337	64.39370420244636	161319
a6a6fe833bb061b4fe792e6e4cc2aabb59349a88	demo: a software defined radio platform for rapid cross-layer prototyping	software defined radio;cross layer adaptation;rapid prototyping	In the research community there exists a large amount of high quality wireless protocols and physical layer algorithms. However, single layer performance improvements are decreasing compared to cross-layer optimizations. These optimizations have more degrees of freedom and therefore allow for greater improvements. Sadly, there are no platforms that allow easy prototyping of these cross-layer optimized systems. To tackle this problem we present CLAWS (Cross-Layer Adaptable Wireless System), which combines a powerful FPGA based SDR with a fully standard compliant IEEE 802.15.4 stack. Combined to form a very flexible platform with easy access to all layers of the network stack.  To show its performance we have developed a demonstrator that shows how CLAWS can interoperate with a network of off-the-shelf wireless sensor nodes. Moreover, using this powerful and easy to use platform, we've implemented a cross-layer improvement, where all nodes are able to send on different frequencies at the same time to the CLAWS node.	accessibility;algorithm;display resolution;etsi satellite digital radio;field-programmable gate array;interoperability;protocol stack;prototype	Tom Vermeulen;Bertold Van den Bergh;Sofie Pollin	2015		10.1145/2801676.2801683	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	6.6713041142673255	69.89362569106419	161419

Network-on-Chip (NoC) has been proposed as a solution to multi-core communication problems. The advantages of NoC include high bandwidth, low latency, low power consumption and scalability. The interconnection architecture has a significant impact on the performance of networks in terms of point-to-point delay, throughput, and loss rate. We evaluate the performance of three NoC architectures, including the torus, the Metacube and the hypercube under Poisson and bit-complement traffic pattern. Network sizes of 32, 64, 128, 512 and 1024 nodes are considered. Three injection rates ranging from 10% to 30% are applied to the target networks. Performance evaluation reflects that the torus is a viable choice for small networks (32-64 nodes) and the Metacube exhibits similar performance to the hypercube for 128 nodes and 512 nodes networks under a moderate load. Lower link complexity and fewer long wires make the Metacube a cheaper alternative to the hypercube.	bitwise operation;grid network;interconnection;microprocessor;multi-core processor;network on a chip;olap cube;performance evaluation;point-to-point protocol;requirement;scalability;system on a chip;throughput	Jie Chen;Paul Gillard;Cheng Li	2012	2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356997	embedded system;throughput;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;architecture;network on a chip;network topology;computer network	HPC	2.293787379438684	61.6341362755689	161645
a712c14dcfa0114a01ee32e5af9ae300073a0fb6	iea: an intermittent energy aware platform for ultra-low powered energy harvesting wsn		Energy harvesting (EH) technology largely broadens the range of applications of WSN and extends the life circle thereof. As the energy is unpredictable, the operation of energy harvesting WSN is often intermittent, maybe under the lowest working voltage in most of the time. At this point, the power dissipation may be much larger than that of sleep mode, which will waste energy and prolong the network latency time, whereas the current researches have not attempted to solve the problem. In this paper, we propose a general intermittent energy aware EH-WSN platform (IEA), along with the energy management circuit to switch the power supply automatically without any software, which is capable to decrease the quiescent current below 0.5 uA in undervoltage situation, and takes usage of Ferroelectric RAM to reduce the reboot energy for minimizing the energy dissipation. Besides, integral circuit is firstly used to realize the ultra-low power measurement. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify that the power of IEA in low voltage is at least 55 times lower than that of the current platforms for improving the energy efficiency significantly.	international ergonomics association	Yonghui Zhang;Hong Gao;Siyao Cheng;Zhipeng Cai;Jianzhong Li	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-60033-8_17	real-time computing;computer network;latency (engineering);energy harvesting;simulation;efficient energy use;sleep mode;computer science;reboot;energy management;low voltage;biasing	EDA	9.512504923891823	71.78946479895943	161822

Estimates are provided of various network parameters as a function of the workload, using analytical models and detailed network simulations. It is shown that the proposed design for fault tolerance is more cost-effective than the brute-force technique of having multiple copies of the network. >	fetch-and-add;interconnection	Prithviraj Banerjee;Abhijeet Dugar	1986	IEEE Trans.

This is mainly due to the extremely high speed of the state-of-the-art network links and to the fact that in order to support advanced quality of service (QoS), per-flow queueing is desirable. In this paper we describe the architecture of a memory manager that can provide up to 10Gbs of aggregate throughput while handling 512K queues. The presented system supports a complete instruction set and thus we believe it can be used as a hardware component in any suitable embedded system, particularly network SoCs that implement per flow queuing. When designing this scheme several optimisation techniques have been evaluated and the most cost and performance effective ones used. These techniques minimize both the memory bandwidth and the memory capacity needed, which is considered a main advantage of the proposed scheme. The proposed architecture uses a simple DRAM for data storage and a typical SRAM for keeping data structures-pointers, therefore minimising the system's cost. The device has been fabricated within a novel programmable network processor designed for efficient protocol processing in high speed networking applications. It consists of 155K Gates and occupies 5.23 mm in UMC 0.18υ CMOS.	aggregate data;cmos;computer data storage;data structure;dynamic random-access memory;embedded system;gigabit;mathematical optimization;memory bandwidth;memory management;nor gate;network processor;quality of service;static random-access memory;system on a chip;throughput	George Kornaros;Ioannis Papaefstathiou;Aristides Nikologiannis;Nicholaos Zervos	2003		10.1145/775832.775849	embedded system;interleaved memory;parallel computing;real-time computing;quality of service;data structure;computer science;operating system;computer network;memory management	Arch	-0.47873911886826526	61.55502106602673	162245

SoC systems represent a complex interconnection of various functional elements. Existing bus based interconnect architectures do not present a scalable solution to the existing problems in the communication. Networks-on-chip (NoC) has been proposed as a new design paradigm to solve the communication bottlenecks of the bus based system design (Benini and Micheli, 2002 , Dally and Towles, 2001). The basic idea is to interconnect the various intellectual property (IP) cores using on-chip networks (Hemani et al., 2000, Dally and Towles, 2004, Duato et al. 1998). Exploiting the advantages of NoC in FPGAs for implementing SoC designs is an active area of research. Modern FPGAs can support up to 10 million gates to accommodate all logic and the associated routing. Thus, logic area is at a premium in FPGAs. In order to implement a competitive NoC architecture in FPGAs, the area occupied by the network logic should be kept to a minimum. This ensures maximum area utilization by the logic while maintaining the performance of the on-chip network. Area reduction results in increased performance and reduced power consumption of the overall system (Sethuraman et al., 2005, Sethuraman et al., 2004). Firstly an area reduction, by designing a light weight router for FPGAs, was achieved. Then, a novel router architecture designs (Multi Local Port Routers and Multi2 Routers) that provide ample opportunity to optimize the data traffic, thereby achieving improvement in both the power and the performance were proposed. This is primarily because of the reduction in the number of packets flowing in the main networks-on-chip mesh.

Consequently, this work examines fault tolerant communication algorithms for use in the NoC domain. Two different flooding algorithms and a random walk algorithm are investigated. We show that the flood-based fault tolerant algorithms have an exceedingly high communication overhead. We find that the redundant random walk algorithm offers significantly reduced overhead while maintaining useful levels of fault tolerance. We then compare the implementation costs of these algorithms, both in terms of area as well as in energy consumption, and show that the flooding algorithms consume an order of magnitude more energy per message transmitted.	algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;buffer overflow;design for manufacturability;fault tolerance;network on a chip;network packet;overhead (computing);throughput;transmitter	Matthew Pirretti;Greg M.

08e8e707ab7b3e220fbc6441a4fcc380ecf64bcf	applying partial power-gating to direction-sliced network-on-chip		Network-on-Chip (NoC) is one of critical communication architectures for future many-core systems. As technology is continually scaling down, on-chip network meets the increasing leakage power crisis. As a leakage power mitigation technique, power-gating can be utilized in on-chip network to solve the crisis. However, the network performance is severely affected by the disconnection in the conventional power-gated NoC. In this paper, we propose a novel partial power-gating approach to improve the performance in the power-gated NoC.The approach mainly involves a direction-slicing scheme, an improved routing algorithm, and a deadlock recovery mechanism. In the synthetic traffic simulation, the proposed design shows favorable power-efficiency at low-load range and achieves better performance than the conventional power-gated one. For the application trace simulation, the design in the mesh/torus network consumes 15.2%/18.9% more power on average, whereas it can averagely obtain 45.0%/28.7% performance improvement compared with the conventional power-gated design. On balance, the proposed design with partial power-gating has a better tradeoff between performance and power-efficiency.		Feng Wang;Xiantuo Tang;Zuocheng Xing	2015	J.

Routing algorithms, as one of the key components that influence NOC latency, are the subject of extensive research. Static routing algorithms have low cost but unlike adaptive routing algorithms, do not perform well under non-uniform or bursty traffic. Adaptive routing algorithms estimate congestion levels of output ports to avoid routing traffic over congested ports. As global adaptive routing algorithms are not restricted to local information for congestion estimation, they are the prime candidates for balancing traffic in NOCs. Unfortunately, destinations of packets are not considered for congestion estimation in existing global adaptive routing algorithms. We will show that having identical congestion estimates for packets with different destinations prevents global adaptive routing algorithms from reaching their peak potential. In this work, we introduce Fast, a low-cost global adaptive routing algorithm that estimates congestion levels of output ports on a per-packet basis. The simulation results reveal that Fast achieves lower latency and higher throughput as compared to those of other adaptive routing algorithms across all workloads examined. Fast increases the throughput of an $$8 \times 8$$ 8 × 8 network by 54, 30, and 16 % as compared to DOR, Local, and RCA on a synthetic traffic profile. On realistic benchmarks, Fast achieves 5 % average, and 12 % maximum latency reduction on SPLASH-2 benchmarks running on a 49-core CMP as compared to the state of the art.	algorithm;cpu cache;downstream (software development);global serializability;institute for operations research and the management sciences;network congestion;network on a chip;network packet;router (computing);routing;simulation;synthetic intelligence;system on a chip;throughput	Pejman Lotfi-Kamran	2015	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-015-1439-3	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;parallel computing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;adaptive routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;network on a chip;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Arch	2.08493017582026	63.87417207610406	163367

Its design arises from the desired network characteristics of minimizing mean and maximum packet transfer time, local routing, expandability, deadlock avoidance, and fault tolerance. The network is based on fixed degree nodes and has 0( log p) mean and maximum packet transfer distances, where p is the number of processors. The routing method is detailed and schemes for expandability, deadlock avoidance, and fault tolerance are presented. The network’s performance is demonstrated via computer simulation on stochastically defined problems. The network is shown to have performance superior to that of the hypercube network for reasonable size networks (232 processors) when similar technology and network node designs are used for both.

Instead of regular topology networks, constructing irregular mesh topology network on chip (NoCs) becomes an attractive approach to building future NoC systems with irregular structure. Deadlock-free routing control algorithm is a promising problem for irregular mesh topology. The available routing algorithms from regular mesh are not suitable for irregular mesh network. So in this paper, we introduce a hybrid scheme multiphase routing algorithm for irregular mesh integrating oversized rectangle modules. The basic idea of the scheme is borrowed from the area of fault tolerant networks, where a network topology is rendered irregular due to fault regions. The proposed scheme only employs 2 virtual channels per physical channel with fast routing decisions. In the case that the proposed two-phase routing scheme does not keep connection between some pairs of nodes, certain healthy nodes are deactivated to guarantee its deadlock-freeness. A greedy method is presented to ensure that only the minimum nodes are deactivated.	deadlock;fault tolerance;greedy algorithm;mesh networking;network on a chip;network topology;requirement;routing;two-phase commit protocol	Xinming Duan;Wu Jigang	2013	JCP	10.4304/jcp.8.1.27-32	wireless mesh network;routing table;switched mesh;routing;static routing;parallel computing;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;shared mesh;mathematics;distributed computing;order one network protocol;routing protocol;network on a chip;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	HPC	0.8133728528465082	68.49943065898496	163958

These are the frequency bands of the IEEE 802.11a standard in Europe and in the USA. A good matching is obtained in both configurations.

Presented in this paper is a structural variation of the basic APPB which utilizes optical switches to provide the capability of switching messages between buses without their being relayed by intermediate processors. Such switching capability eliminates the optical-electronic-optical signal conversion due to message relays and offers improved communication efficiency. We discuss routing issues, evaluate bandwidth improvement, and present efficient communications including matrix transpose, binary tree routing, and perfect shuffle which take advantage of the switching capability.	network switch	Zicheng Guo	1994	J.

14e02b30a62d20f296e944fcfc0fac8481cbfdee	meeting the deadline: on the complexity of fault-tolerant continuous gossip	gossip;crashes and restarts;dynamic rumor injection;random and expander graphs	In this paper we introduce the problem of Continuous Gossip in which rumors are continually and dynamically injected throughout the network. Each rumor has a deadline, and the goal of a continuous gossip protocol is to ensure good “Quality of Delivery,” i.e., to deliver every rumor to every process before the deadline expires. Thus, a trivial solution to the problem of Continuous Gossip is simply for every process to broadcast every rumor as soon as it is injected. Unfortunately, this solution has high per-round message complexity. Complicating matters, we focus our attention on a highly dynamic network in which processes may continually crash and recover. In order to achieve good per-round message complexity in a dynamic network, processes need to continually form and re-form coalitions that cooperate to spread their rumors throughout the network. The key challenge for a Continuous Gossip protocol is the ongoing adaptation to the ever-changing set of active rumors and non-crashed process. In this work we show how to address this challenge; we develop randomized and deterministic protocols for Continuous Gossip and prove lower bounds on the per-round message-complexity, indicating that our protocols are close to optimal.	fault tolerance;gossip protocol;randomized algorithm	Chryssis Georgiou;Seth Gilbert;Dariusz R.

Unfortunately, the most widespread WSN simulators today have only the basic model for the battery, which does not account many of the important real-life hardware dependences. Therefore in the paper we are suggesting a novel approach to modeling the energy consumption for battery-powered WSN nodes. The suggested approach is based on the utilization of three dependences: the effect of battery charge on battery voltage; the effect of the supply voltage on the consumed by the WSN node current and the effect of the WSN node current on the available battery energy. The paper includes the description of the suggested module and its implementation in MiXiM framework for the OMNeT++ network simulator. Comparison of the results for real-life experiments, simulations using the standard approach and simulations utilizing the suggested approach are given. As revealed by the presented results, the suggested approach can significantly increase the simulation precision and provides additional functionality that can be valuable for WSN simulation.	experiment;real life;simulation	Konstantin Mikhaylov;Jouni K.

This compact nature allows a system designer to give priority to link bandwidth or signal-to-noise ratios, rather than being restricted by lane areas. We describe our point-to-point link and develop it into a fully-routable system, with a repeater, router, arbiter and multiplexer.

Consider $m$ input ports, each of which is equipped with a buffer (queue) of limited capacity. Data packets arrive online and can be stored in the buffers if space permits; otherwise packet loss occurs. In each time step the switch can transmit one packet from one of the buffers to the output port. The goal is to maximize the number of transmitted packets. Simple arguments show that any work-conserving algorithm, which serves any nonempty buffer, is 2-competitive. Azar and Richter recently presented a randomized online algorithm and gave lower bounds for deterministic and randomized strategies. #R##N#In practice, greedy algorithms are very important because they are fast, use little extra memory, and reduce packet loss by always serving a longest queue. In this paper we first settle the competitive performance of the entire family of greedy strategies. We prove that greedy algorithms are not better than 2-competitive no matter how ties are broken. Our lower bound proof uses a new recursive construction for building adversarial buffer configurations that may be of independent interest. We also give improved lower bounds for deterministic and randomized online algorithms.#R##N#In this paper we present the first deterministic online algorithm that is better than 2-competitive. We develop a modified greedy algorithm, called semigreedy, and prove that it achieves a competitive ratio of $17/9 \approx 1.89$. The new algorithm is simple, fast, and uses little extra memory. Only when the risk of packet loss is low does it not serve the longest queue. Additionally we study scenarios when an online algorithm is granted additional resources. We consider resource augmentation with respect to memory and speed; i.e., an online algorithm may be given larger buffers or higher transmission rates. We analyze greedy and other online strategies.	data buffer;z-buffering	Susanne Albers;Markus Schmidt	2005	SIAM J.

The project goal is to have one million processors included in a single machine, which consequently span many thousands of circuit boards. A computer of this scale imposes large communication requirements between these boards, and requires an extensible method of connecting to external equipment such as sensors, actuators and visualisation systems. This paper describes two systems that can address each of these problems. Firstly, SpinLink is a proposed method of connecting the SpiNNaker boards by using time-division multiplexing (TDM) to allow eight SpiNNaker links to run at maximum bandwidth between two boards. SpinLink will be deployed on Spartan-6 FPGAs and uses a locally generated clock that can be paused while the asynchronous links from SpiNNaker are sending data, thus ensuring a fast and glitch-free response. Secondly, SpiNNterceptor is a separate system, currently in the early stages of design, that will build upon SpinLink to address the important external I/O issues faced by SpiNNaker. Specifically, spare resources in the FPGAs will be used to implement the debugging and I/O interfacing features of SpiNNterceptor.	artificial neural network;central processing unit;debugging;field-programmable gate array;glitch;input/output;interconnection;multiplexing;printed circuit board;requirement;sensor;simulation;spinnaker	Kier Dugan;Jeffrey S.

With the increasing development of novel applications in NoCs, one-to-many (multicast) or one-to-all (broadcast) communications are becoming universal and indispensable. The performance constraint metrics, such as power consumption and network latency, are often stringent on NoC systems. Without multicast support, the performance of traditional NoCs will be significantly degraded by such communications. In this paper, we propose Latency-Aware Dual-Partition Multicast (LADPM) routing for mesh-based on-chip networks to reduce packet latency and balance network load. A detailed wormhole router design is also presented for the proposed LADPM scheme. LADPM scheme can adaptively make routing decision based on the distribution of the destination nodes of the multicast traffic. Experimental results, implemented under a cycle-accurate simulator, show that compared with the best known multicast scheme RPM, LADPM reduces Energy-Delay Product by 25.4% on average. More importantly, in heavy traffic load networks, LADPM is a scalable solution.	central processing unit;computer architecture simulator;electronic data processing;load balancing (computing);multicast;network on a chip;network packet;one-to-many (data model);programming paradigm;router (computing);routing;scalability;simulation	Jianhua Li;Chun Jason Xue;Yinlong Xu	2010	2010 IEEE 16th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/ICPADS.2010.27	routing;parallel computing;real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;network on a chip;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;computer network;multicast address	HPC	2.1112920837005196	62.01883418112747	166819

There are many simple iterative arbitration algorithms proposed for the VOQ architecture. These algorithms either employ a 3-phase or a 2phase hand-shaking scheme between the switch inputs and outputs. It has been shown that neither scheme can outperform the other in all traffic patterns. As a result, we propose a 2-stage matching algorithm that combines the benefit of both schemes, and also achieves the best desynchronization of arbiter pointers during their scheduling. We will demonstrate that this new algorithm outperforms all the other iterative algorithms considered under various traffic models. We also propose a possible hardware implementation method of the algorithm.	algorithm;arbiter (electronics);iteration;iterative method;network packet;packet switching;pointer (computer programming);simpl;scheduling (computing)	Ying Jiang;Mounir Hamdi	2002		10.1109/ICC.2002.997219	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;fair queuing;distributed computing;iterative method;computer network	Networks	-3.954382913768803	68.22955224616545	167042

A time shared TMR scheme is used to achieve the error correcting capability. A quarter of the original sorting network based on perfect shuffle is triplicated and voted in each stage. The hardware complexity of this time shared TMR error correcting sorting network is a little more than the original sorting network. The price is that the delay time increases by a factor of 4. However, the throughput penalty can be minimized by pipelining. A technology-independent gate level analysis of hardware complexity and delay time is included in this paper. Possible variations of the basic design are also discussed.	error detection and correction;qr code;sorting network	Yuang-Ming Hsu;Earl E.

0d8815a9d1f0cfc0cbc73086492f7672f1bac3be	a software-defined hybrid cache with reduced energy: poster		Energy becomes an inevitable challenge when using a large die-stacking DRAM cache as part of memory. Emerging volatile STT-RAM can be integrated with DRAM as a software-managed hybrid cache to effectively reduce the static and dynamic energy of large cache, but there is extra refresh energy overhead. We observe that reducing the refresh rate of volatile STT-RAM will provide significant energy savings while introducing a small number of bit errors that can be easily tolerated by most error-resilient applications. Thus, we propose a quality-aware approximate die-stacking hybrid cache and develop a novel data allocation scheme. We also propose the online quality monitor and the light-weight check scheme for error recovery. The results show an average 91% reduction in volatile STT-RAM refresh energy with minimal loss in output quality.	approximation algorithm;cpu cache;die (integrated circuit);dynamic random-access memory;memory refresh;overhead (computing);penetration test;refresh rate;stacking	Jiacong He;Joseph Callenes-Sloan	2017		10.1145/3155016.3155021	bit error rate;cache;embedded system;software;dram;approximate computing;refresh rate;computer science	Arch	7.2925639831199724	61.91010298169062	167935

In this paper, a synchronous and distributed medium access control (SD-MAC) protocol is designed and implemented. Tailored for WNoC, SD-MAC employs a binary countdown approach to resolve channel contention between RF nodes. The receiver_select_sender mechanism and hidden terminal elimination scheme are proposed to increase the throughput and channel utilization of the system. Our simulation study shows the promising performance of SD-MAC in terms of throughput, latency, and network utilization. As a major component of simple and compact RF node design, a MAC unit implements the proposed SDMAC that guarantees correct operation of synchronized frames while keeping overhead low. The synthesis results demonstrate several attractive features such as high speed, low power consumption, nice scalability and low area cost.	access control;cmos;computation;interconnection;multiply–accumulate operation;network on a chip;overhead (computing);radio frequency;requirement;scalability;simulation;system on a chip;throughput	Yi Wang;Dan Zhao	2007	2007 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design	10.1145/1326073.1326200	chip;embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;network on a chip;high-level synthesis;cmos;communications system;computer network	EDA	2.8481385963186985	61.23928141378972	167968

Dateline, proposed decades ago, is one of the most popular methods to remove cyclic dependencies within a single dimension of a torus. While the problem of virtual channel misbalance caused by these deadlock avoidance schemes brings lots of performance pathologies. In this paper, we propose a serial virtual channel balanced routing algorithms (VCBR) for torus networks. The technique is deadlock-free, and can promote the virtual channel balance in a wise manner. Moreover, these methods can be used to both wormhole and virtual cut-through switched networks. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods as compared to the well-known existing approaches.	algorithm;deadlock;electrical connection;routing;simulation;virtual channel;whole earth 'lectronic link	Zhigang Yu;Dong Xiang;Xinyu Wang	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications & 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.193	algorithm design;routing;throughput;parallel computing;simulation;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-0.8774363228162328	68.50199743516231	168143

In this paper, we study loop-free backpressure routing policies that forward packets along directed acyclic graphs DAGs to avoid the looping problem. These policies use link reversal algorithms to improve the DAGs in order to support any achievable traffic demand. For a network with a single commodity, we show that a DAG that supports a given traffic demand can be found after a finite number of iterations of the link-reversal process. We use this to develop a joint link-reversal and backpressure routing policy, called the loop free backpressure LFBP algorithm. This algorithm forwards packets on the DAG, while the DAG is dynamically updated based on the growth of the queue backlogs. We show by simulations that such a DAG-based policy improves the delay over the classical backpressure routing policy. We also propose a multicommodity version of the LFBP algorithm and via simulation show that its delay performance is better than that of backpressure.	algorithm;backpressure routing;directed acyclic graph;iteration;simulation;traverse;throughput	Anurag Rai;Chih-Ping Li;Georgios S.

(1994, 1995) as a systematic design methodology for real-time systems. The objective of this experimental study is to assess design alternatives integrated into the method and their performance implication on resultant systems built via the PCM. Such design alternatives include scheduling jitter, sensor-to-output latency, intertask communication schemes, and system utilization. For this study, we have chosen a computerized numerical control (CNC) machine as our target real-time system, and built a realistic controller and a plant simulator. We show the detailed development process of the CNC controller and report its performance. The performance results were extracted from a controlled series of more than hundred test controllers obtained by varying four test variables. This study unveils several weaknesses of the PCM: (1) the communication scheme built into PCM incurs a large latency though average sensor-to-output latency is one of the most dominating factors in determining control quality; (2) scheduling jitter is taken seriously in PCM though its effect appears only when average sensor-to-output latency is sufficiently small; (3) loop processing periods are not properly optimized for control quality though they are another dominating factor of performance; and (4) transient overloads are not considered at all in PCM, even though they can seriously damage the performance of a system. Based on these results, we propose a new communication scheme and a transient overload handling technique for the improved period calibration method.	experiment;gerber format;numerical analysis;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;resultant;scheduling (computing);simulation;test case	Namyun Kim;Minsoo Ryu;Seongsoo Hong;Heonshik Shin	1999	Real-Time Systems	10.1023/A:1008085412199	embedded system;real-time computing;digital control;design methods;computer science;control system;operating system;software development process	Embedded	-2.9471131094314886	61.8719862802062	168581

This paper aims on advocating a scalable interconnection network topology capable of meeting the high performance communication prerequisites. Therefore, in what follows hierarchical multilevel hybrid hexagon topology has been discussed and its behavior has been successfully verified. Furthermore, the communication performance of the proposed network has been paralleled with already existing multidimensional topologies, like the butterfly, the cube and the hypercube.

Multi-FPGA platforms are considered to be the most appropriate experimental way to emulate and evaluate these large System-on-Chips. The deployment often goes through the Network-on-Chip partitioning on all FPGAs requiring the use of inter-FPGA communication links between routers. The number of external links and their performance restrict the communication bandwidth. Currently, the number of inter-FPGA signals is considered to be a major problem in the Network-on-Chip deployed on multi-FPGAs. As there are more signals to be connected than IOs, inter-FPGA links must be shared between routers leading to significant bottlenecks. As the ratio of the logic capacity to the number of IOs rises slowly for each FPGA generation, this technological bottleneck will be remaining for future system designs. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for inter-FPGA collision management in the Network-on-Chip partitioned on multi-FPGAs. The structure ensures to efficiently share the external link between several routers with a minimum number of collisions and inter-FPGA bottlenecks. The proposed architecture is easily placed between the Network-on-Chip and the external protocol. The collision management architecture is based on the BackOff algorithm used in Wi-Fi communications and adapted to FPGA platforms. This algorithm balances accesses among all the routers connected with the inter-board interfacing, thereby avoiding collisions. We compare this structure with traditional techniques using experimental and theoretical results. The novel inter-FPGA architecture for the Networkon-Chip based on the BackOff algorithm achieves lower latency with fewer resources compared to other solutions.	algorithm;backoff;computational complexity theory;embedded system;emulator;experiment;field-programmable gate array;internal link;linear algebra;mediawiki;network on a chip;performance;random access;rapid refresh;rapid prototyping;root-finding algorithm;round-robin scheduling;router (computing);software deployment;system on a chip	Atef Dorai;Virginie Fresse;Catherine Combes;El-Bay Bourennane;Abdellatif Mtibaa	2017	Microprocessors and Microsystems - Embedded Hardware Design	10.1016/j.micpro.2017.01.006	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;network on a chip;computer network	EDA	1.9478790331095792	62.270045225337334	168973

These interfaces, implemented in user-level software, run on oo-the-shelf PCs and replace all of the link and many of the physical layer functions typically implemented in dedicated hardware on a network interface card (NIC). They provide all of the processing needed to transform between wideband IF signals and network packets. Moving this functionality into user-level software has several advantages. Among other things, it makes it easy to implement protocols that adapt to diierent applications and environmental conditions. Our approach is compatible with the existing OSI protocol stack, but supports a ner granularity of layering. This ner granularity makes it possible for our NIC to dynamically change functions, such as modulation technique, that are xed in other NICs. It also ooers interfaces that facilitate interoperation with a variety of other systems, e.g., codecs. We also present a brief description of our architecture which allows these software NICs to be built, as well as a sample NIC that runs on a PentiumPro, designed to interoperate with a commercial 2.4 GHz ISM band frequency hopping spread spectrum radio.	archi;c++;codec;experiment;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;implicit shape model;interoperability;interoperation;line printer daemon protocol;longrun;modulation;network packet;protocol stack;sfiaplus;signal processing;total loss;universal instantiation;user space	Vanu G.

In this paper, we first build a novel predictive thermal model for generic periodic tasks running on a single core. This model can dynamically derive the core temperature at any time quickly and accurately. To verify the model, we use both Hot Spot simulator and a real Linux machine to run six network applications chosen from Net Bench. Then, we propose an online model update strategy using on-chip thermal sensors, which can effectively correct incidental errors by adjusting model parameters """"on-the-fly"""". Finally, by combining the thermal model and the online update, we design, implement and evaluate a predictive model-based thermal management scheme on an Intel Xeon E5335 core for network applications based on the Stop & Go technique. Compared with two other alternatives, our scheme achieves lower temperature, higher throughput, no thermal constraint violation, and negligible overhead cost."""	hot spare;hotspot (wi-fi);interference (communication);java hotspot virtual machine;linux;multi-core processor;network packet;overhead (computing);sensor;simulation;thermal management of high-power leds;throughput	Jilong Kuang;Laxmi N.

The hypercube is one of the most widely used topologies because it provides small diameter and is so robust that it can very efficiently emulate a wide variety of other frequently used structures. Nevertheless, the major drawback of the standard hypercube is that it cannot be expanded in practice. This paper proposes a methodology that modifies hypercube network in order to support incremental growth techniques. The proposed methodology accomplishes this goal with minimal modifications of individual hypercubes and, contrary to other existing techniques, without any need for extra resources		Sotirios G.

Small modules that provide both an access and an ATM switching function are distributed over some extended geographical area and connected to a passive optical medium. Each module is equipped with some small number of electrooptic transmitters and receivers that provide access to the medium. Assignment of wavelengths to transmitter/receiver pairs create logical channels that are wavelength-multiplexed onto the medium, thus creating a logical connection diagram among the modules. Advantages of the lightwave-based distributed architecture are the huge bandwidth of the medium, a high degree of modularity to facilitate growth, high reliability, and the ability to provide """"clear channels"""" among modules. On the other hand, if the externally offered flow of ATM cells among modules is too uniform, then each module may be capable of supporting only a fraction of the load that could be carried by any port of a fully connected centralized ATM switch with output queueing. Fortunately, under the much more realistic assumption of nonuniform traffic, the independence between the logical connection diagram and the physical topology of the medium can be exploited by reconfiguring the connection diagram to """"match"""" the nonuniformity of the cell traffic. Simulation results show that, as the nonuniformity becomes larger, the reconfiguration technique allows the traffic-handling capability of a distributed switch to match that of a centralized switch. >"""	atm turbo;centralized computing;electronic switching system	Anthony S.

These key components are widely used in multimedia compression systems, e.g., video and image codecs. The technique encodes the input array at the 2-D linear transformation level, and algorithms are designed to operate on encoded data and produce encoded output data. The proposed error detection technique is a system-level method therefore can be used in existing hardware or software 2-D linear transformation architectures with low overhead. More importantly, the proposed weighted checksum code based error detection can enable quality metric aware error detection which only flags an error when the quality of the result is lower than expectation. The error tolerance detection technique can fit perfectly in multimedia compression systems.	algorithm;checksum;codec;correctness (computer science);data compression;error detection and correction;error-tolerant design;matlab;overhead (computing);simulation	Shih-Hsin Hu;Jacob A.

Turn model based routing disallows some of the turns in order to avoid deadlock, while providing partial adaptivity. In this paper, all 2D uniform turn models are examined for deadlock freeness and connectivity; 50 deadlock free turn models are extracted that provide full connectivity in the network. An extended adaptivity metric is introduced to classify the turn models; all extracted turn models are compared in terms of adaptivity, robustness and latency. Experimental results identify the most robust turn models and the most efficient ones in terms of latency.	algorithm;deadlock;network on a chip;routing;system on a chip	Siavoosh Payandeh Azad;Behrad Niazmand;Karl Janson;Thilo Kogge;Jaan Raik;Gert Jervan;Thomas Hollstein	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050634	latency (engineering);deadlock;computer science;robustness (computer science);distributed computing	Embedded	2.385473385705985	64.71235985866073	171590

Such network interconnects have particular characteristics and thus have different communication requirements. Accordingly, we need to frequently implement new protocol stacks for embedded systems. Implementing new protocol stacks on embedded systems has significant design space but it has not been explored in detail. In this paper, we aim to explore the design space of network protocol stacks for specialpurpose embedded systems. We survey several design choices very carefully so that we can choose the best design for a given network with respect to performance, portability, complexity, and flexibility. More precisely we discuss design alternatives for implementing new network protocol stacks over embedded operating systems, methodologies for verifying the network protocols, and the designs for network gateway. Moreover, we perform case studies for the design alternatives and methodologies discussed in this paper.	communications protocol;complexity;electrical connection;embedded operating system;embedded system;gateway (telecommunications);meltwater entrepreneurial school of technology;requirement;software portability	Hyun-Wook Jin;Junbeom Yoo	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10265-3_22	embedded system;communications protocol;embedded operating system;real-time computing;formal verification;computer science;operating system;tunneling protocol;distributed computing;default gateway	Embedded	-1.6177297737867669	63.51879939873704	171689

In this mode, information is transferred in a connection oriented fashion among communicating entities using fixed size packets know as ATM cell. The Batcher-Banyan combinational switches are one of high speed space division switches. But it finds difficulties in routing two cells with same destination thus it routes one at the cost of other. The output queues placed at the output stages of banyan can resolve above problem up to great extent .Those are equipped with an internal speed- up network and free from head of blocking problem faced in input queuing . It offers a trade-off between the hardware complexity and cell loss probability. Hence ATM switches with output queues have been selected for designing, simulation using project navigator, Active HDL tools and synthesized for target device XC3S250E-5FT256.	atm turbo;behavioral modeling;blocking (computing);cisco lan2lan personal office for isdn;combinational logic;connection-oriented communication;entity;hardware description language;integrated services digital network;ken batcher;network switch;routing;simulation;speedup	Suresh S.

However, the load balancing on these two multicomputer systems are not so well as we expected. The worst case of tree architecture requires O ( M x p x logp) routing time for redistributing the workload over the system and it requires O ( M x 4) for mesh architecture while pipelined packet routing scheme is used. In this paper, we proposed an approach based on superconcentrators to reduce the above bounds to O(M1ogp) for both cases with only additional O(p) cost. Furthermore, using this scheme, the underlying systems can leave the load balancing problem entirely to the superconcentrator so that it does not arise any additional workload of the systems. In addition, this scheme also adds extra communicating paths to the processors so that it not only increase the communication capacity among the processors but also could tolerate edge faults of the systems.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;central processing unit;distributed computing;division by zero;load balancing (computing);microsoft edge;network packet;parallel computing;routing;scalability	Gene Eu Jan;Ming-Bo Lin	1994		10.1109/ICPADS.1994.590133	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;load balancing;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	HPC	-0.46318855939405024	69.20249532880602	171980

Meeting latency requirements of communication among various cores is one of the crucial objectives for system designers. The core interface to the networking logic and the communication network are the key contributors to latency. With the goal of reducing this latency we examine the packetization strategies in the NoC communication. In this paper, three schemes of implementations are analyzed, and the costs in terms of latency, and area are projected through actual synthesis.	access time;analysis of algorithms;emergence;network on a chip;network packet;overhead (computing);packet switching;programming paradigm;requirement;system on a chip;systems design;telecommunications network	Praveen Bhojwani;Rabi N.

Because denser memories are likely to contain more errors, DRAM employs repair schemes that replace errors with good cells for yield enhancement of a memory. The conventional repair scheme covers only manufacturing-level errors. As DRAM wears out while operating in the field, to enhance the lifetime of a memory, we need to incorporate a post-package repair scheme into a memory system for repairing aging errors. In this paper, we propose a methodology that repairs aging errors in a memory during field operations. Using the memory yield and lifetime simulator, we evaluate the proposed repair method. Employing a 2GB DDR3 ECC-DIMM as a case study, we demonstrate that our post-package repair scheme improves the yield and the lifetime of a memory.	bit error rate;built-in self-test;cpu cache;computer data storage;dimm;dynamic random-access memory;ecc memory;elegant degradation;image scaling;lookup table;memory controller;memory scrubbing;page table;portland pattern repository;sensor;x.690	Daehyun Kim;Linda S.

Basically, the new system comprises an algorithmic part, running on a PC (the software aspect), and an ad hoc hardware architecture. The bitstreams necessary for testing FPGA internal resources are automatically generated on a PC using a sequential algorithm, which varies according to the FPGA chip to be evaluated, and are subsequently downloaded onto the hardware architecture. Next, a customized application, also run on a PC, downloads the previously generated bitstreams consecutively, using the Xilinx Impact tool.#R##N##R##N#The hardware architecture comprises two boards based on FPGAs.

Thus, in order to ensure correct transmission of the test/results patterns, a communication bus between both boards is required.#R##N##R##N#The two FPGAs are configured using JTAG protocol, and reconfiguration of both is carried out via a multi-load algorithm which, once each resource unit has been tested, downloads a new bitstream onto the FUT.#R##N##R##N#The present proposal enables the resources of an FPGA to be tested and provides an exhaustive, complete report on the status of the FPGAs different internal resources, with a view to reusing the FPGA for another application.	field-programmable gate array	Ignacio Bravo Muñoz;Alfredo Gardel Vicente;Beatriz Pérez;José Luis Lázaro;Jorge García;David Salido	2011	Journal of Systems Architecture - Embedded Systems Design	10.1016/j.sysarc.2011.05.003	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;reconfigurable computing;computer science;operating system;hardware architecture;fpga prototype;field-programmable gate array	EDA	-0.7196042834030505	62.039066903811175	172775

Since device scaling has come to a limit, the technology trend now is stacking dies three-dimensionally to obtain more silicon area and shorter wire length. The most challenging part for making a 3D chip is inter-layer communication method. Currently, TSV is the most popular and promising technique to provide the best performance. However, it suffers from many problems due to inter-layer wiring. As a substitute, inductive coupling can be used as a reliable and non-expensive technology. In this work we use inductive coupling for the inter-layer communication to build a 3D NoC. We also propose a token bus protocol for an efficient implementation of multi-layer communications. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture achieves maximum throughput of 4.7 flits/cycle under uniform random traffic.	image scaling;inductive coupling;inter-process communication;layer (electronics);manycore processor;maximum throughput scheduling;multi-core processor;network on a chip;stacking;through-silicon via;wiring	Jinho Lee;Mingyang Zhu;Kiyoung Choi;Jung Ho Ahn;Rohit Sharma	2011	2011 International SoC Design Conference	10.1109/ISOCC.2011.6138783	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;computer network	EDA	2.4063827667974795	61.78889039035437	172788

A large number of studies have been carried out to achieve this objective. Most of them propose a new technique that affects one of the parameters that characterize the interconnection network. These techniques are completely new or inspired in the techniques previously used in multiprocessor systems. The impact of the proposal is studied (in most cases using simulation), and an analysis is made of the effect of the new technique over the system performance versus those currently in existence. In this kind of study most of the network parameters are fixed and usually only a few parameters are varied. This paper presents a more general study of the interconnection network performance. This study consists in showing the effect of different design parameters over the network performance, and the interaction between them. This study would not be viable with the traditional techniques due to the number of simulations required. The alternative of the experimental design is used to carry out the study.	algorithm;computer cluster;design of experiments;experiment;interconnection;network performance;network switch;parallel computing;random-access memory;routing table;simulation;software performance testing;tor messenger;workstation	Raúl Martínez;José L.

The units of the computer (processors with local memory) communicate with each other by transmitting messages. A processor can transmit a message to any other processor, and transmission takes constant time. If two or more processors try to send a message to the same processor no transmission is successful and retransmission must occur. We show how to implement an extremely simple and efficient form of randomized routing in this model. We study, in particular, the problem of realizing arbitrary h-relations. In an h-relation, each processor is the source as well as the destination of at most h messages. We propose a simple and practical distributed randomized algorithm for realizing arbitrary h-relations on an n-processor such network within O(h + log n log log n) parallel communication steps. Our algorithm is pure in the sense that no information aside from actual messages is transmitted between processors. Anderson and Miller [1] and Valiant [19] have derived a @(h + log n) algorithm for the same problem, which achieves optimality for a slightly larger range of h. Their algorithm is complicated as opposed to ours that we believe to be practical. Optimal interprocessor communication algorithms in realistic models of parallel computers are not only interesting in their own sake, they are one of the main components in optimally simulating PRAMs as well aa implementing Valiant's bulk-synchronous parallel model [13, 19, 18]. 1 Introduction Optics has been used in the design of special purpose computing devices for quite some time now, especially in the field of signal processing.

88ee369d3ebdf6b2acabc42b9b574a91b871140e	k-optimized path routing for high-throughput data center networks		Network throughput has become an important issue for big-data analysis on Warehouse-Scale Computing (WSC) systems. It has been reported that randomly-connected inter-switch networks can enlarge the network throughput. For irregular networks, a multi-path routing method called k-shortest path routing is conventionally utilized. However, it cannot efficiently exploit longer-than-shortest paths that would be detour paths to avoid bottlenecks. In this work, a novel routing method called k-optimized path routing to achieve high throughput is proposed for irregular networks. We introduce a heuristic to select detour paths that can avoid bottlenecks in the network to improve the network throughput. Experimental results show that the proposed k-optimized path routing can improve the throughput by up to 133 % compared to the conventional k-shortest path routing. Moreover, it can improve the network bandwidth while maintaining the low network latency.

8a8dd6bc9f5370a9abc72adb5cf38fcf6aea05a6	revenand: a fast-drift-aware resilient 3d nand flash design		The paradigm shift from planar (two dimensional (2D)) to vertical (three-dimensional (3D)) models has placed the NAND flash technology on the verge of a design evolution that can handle the demands of next-generation storage applications. However, it also introduces challenges that may obstruct the realization of such 3D NAND flash. Specifically, we observed that the fast threshold drift (fast-drift) in a charge-trap flash-based 3D NAND cell can make it lose a critical fraction of the stored charge relatively soon after programming and generate errors.  In this work, we first present an elastic read reference (VRef) scheme (ERR) for reducing such errors in ReveNAND—our fast-drift aware 3D NAND design. To address the inherent limitation of the adaptive VRef, we introduce a new intra-block page organization (hitch-hike) that can enable stronger error correction for the error-prone pages. In addition, we propose a novel reinforcement-learning-based smart data refill scheme (iRefill) to counter the impact of fast-drift with minimum performance and hardware overhead. Finally, we present the first analytic model to characterize fast-drift and evaluate its system-level impact. Our results show that, compared to conventional 3D NAND design, our ReveNAND can reduce fast-drift errors by 87%, on average, and can lower the ECC latency and energy overheads by 13× and 10×, respectively.	cell (microprocessor);charge trap flash;cognitive dimensions of notations;ecc memory;error detection and correction;flash memory;glossary of computer graphics;hike messenger;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;reinforcement learning;the verge	Mustafa Shihab;Jie Zhang;Myoungsoo Jung;Mahmut T.

The erasures considered here are due to the drifting of the electrical parameter used to encode information outside the normal ranges associated to a logic 0 or a logic 1 value. For example, a dielectric breakdown in a magnetic memory cell may reduce its electrical resistance sensibly below the levels which correspond to logic 0 and logic 1 values stored in healthy memory cells. Such deviations can be sensed during memory read operations and the acquired information can be used to boost the fault masking capacity of an error-correcting code. Here, we investigate the use of erasure information to enable double-bit error correction with the help of single-bit error correction and double-bit error detection codes or shortened single-bit error correction codes.	bit error rate;computer security;dedicated hosting service;ecc memory;encode;error detection and correction;forward error correction;hamming code;interrupt latency;list of samsung system on chips;memory cell (binary)	Samuel Evain;Valentin Savin;Valentin Gherman	2013	2013 18th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)	10.1007/s10836-014-5440-1	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;tec;dielectric strength;magnetoresistive random-access memory	Logic	8.715378844287656	61.30682008135595	173539

A bisectional network is constructed by using the theory of symmetric balanced incomplete block design. It is also isomorphic to folded hypercube in that a binary hypercube network can be easily extended as a bisection network by adding additional links. These additional links add to the network some rich topological properties such as node symmetry, small diameter, small inter-node distance, and partitionability. The important property of partitioning is exploited to investigate a redundant task allocation and a semi-distributed task redistribution strategy under real-time constraints. The same approach is used to partition hypercube systems as well. We study the performance of both networks and show that the bisectional network performs considerably better than the hypercube. The performance evaluation and comparison has been done through simulation by taking into account system load, task migration overhead, task timing constraints, node failure and repair rates, and by examining important measures such as task deadline missing probability, task response time, and probability of task being lost.<>		Ishfaq Ahmad	1994			block design;parallel computing;real-time computing;multiprocessing;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;operating system;interconnection;distributed computing;computer performance;network performance;management;scheduling	NLP	-0.3136788059878044	66.91776622017193	173545

In practice, however, the channel width is constrained by real-world considerations. These constraints impact on the choice of network topology and mandate more sophisticated switching technologies. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the family of multidimensional mesh topologies (which includes the hypercube) under the constant pin-out constraint. We assign a channel width to each system so that the product of the node degree and the channel width is constant and then analyze the stochastic performance of these systems using three schemes: message switching, virtual cut-through switching, and partial cut-through switching. Our analyses are more accurate than those appearing in the literature, and the results show that under the constant pin-out constraint, higher dimensionality is more important than wider channel width.

In general, these applications require that the network presents a minimum degree of reliability, effectiveness and robustness. However, the specificity of the nodes used in this type of networks makes them prone to failures. Indeed, the multichannel communications are generally privileged in the interference context which is very frequent in several WSNs’ applications due to the density of sensors and the harsh environment in which they are deployed. Moreover, in real applications, the occurrence of some faults (for example fire) may alter an entire zone of the network especially in the case of large scale deployment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a network fault recovery approach from simultaneous failures in a large scale multichannel WSN. To make our solution as realistic as possible, we consider the case of the precision agriculture application and propose a detailed deployment of the WSN for that application. The choice of precision agriculture application is motivated by the fact that this application require large scale WSN (thousands and thousands of sensors) to supervise such a large area. Based on such precision agriculture scenario, we propose our fault recovery approach, called Simultaneous Failure Recovery based on Relay Node Relocation (SFR-RNR), that aims to restore the connectivity and partially the coverage in the network. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulation.	sensor web	Samira Chouikhi;Inès El Korbi;Yacine Ghamri-Doudane;Leïla Azouz Saïdane	2017	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2017.10.008	computer network;robustness (computer science);distributed computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;software deployment;precision agriculture;interference (wave propagation);recovery approach;real-time computing;relay	Mobile	7.460611387077517	73.70975161691231	174246
f41349baa9d88a1818e1b5fbfa071ac841713d05	a mobile geo-communication dataset for physiology-aware dash in rural ambulance transport		Use of telecommunication technologies for remote, continuous monitoring of patients can enhance effectiveness of emergency ambulance care during transport from rural areas to a regional center hospital. However, the communication along the various routes in rural areas may have wide bandwidth ranges from 2G to 4G; some regions may have only lower satellite bandwidth available. Bandwidth fluctuation together with real-time communication of various clinical multimedia pose a major challenge during rural patient ambulance transport.; AB@The availability of a pre-transport route-dependent communication bandwidth database is an important resource in remote monitoring and clinical multimedia transmission in rural ambulance transport. Here, we present a geo-communication dataset from extensive profiling of 4 major US mobile carriers in Illinois, from the rural location of Hoopeston to the central referral hospital center at Urbana. In collaboration with Carle Foundation Hospital, we developed a profiler, and collected various geographical and communication traces for realistic emergency rural ambulance transport scenarios. Our dataset is to support our ongoing work of proposing physiology-aware DASH, which is particularly useful for adaptive remote monitoring of critically ill patients in emergency rural ambulance transport. It provides insights on ensuring higher Quality of Service (QoS) for most critical clinical multimedia in response to changes in patientsu0027 physiological states and bandwidth conditions.

Different from tag identification that collects IDs of all the tags, tag scanning first verifies whether or not a responding tag has already been identified and retrieves its ID when the answer is yes, and collects the tag's ID only when it is unidentified. In this paper, we present the first study on spot scanning with a handheld reader, which aims to scan tags in the reader's interrogation range at an arbitrarily specified position in the system. Existing studies mainly focus on continuous scanning, and they are highly time inefficient in performing spot scanning. The inefficiency stems from the small overlap between tag populations in different spot scanning operations, in which case existing solutions cannot efficiently recognize unidentified tags. We develop a novel technique called LOCK to efficiently recognize unidentified tags even when the overlapped tags are few. LOCK does not simply use a tag's reply slot index but also compact short responses from tags to efficiently distinguish unidentified tags from identified ones. The valuable compact short responses are firstly investigated, which are the keys for efficient tag identification in the paper. Based on LOCK, three tag scanning protocols are proposed to solve the spot scanning problem. Simulation results show that, for spot scanning, our best protocol reduces per tag scanning time by up to 70 percent when compared with the state-of-the-art solution. Moreover, the proposed protocols can also be employed to perform continuous scanning with better time efficiency than the best existing solutions.	3d scanner;handheld game console;population;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;simulation;tag cloud	Xuan Liu;Shigeng Zhang;Bin Xiao;Kai Bu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2014.2381252	database index;communications protocol;estimation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security;server	Mobile	4.97322411697088	70.1301809721031	174723

We received 58 submissions, two of which were invited, and a total of 16 were accepted. The high level of competition has led to the selection of top-level contributions from renowned academic institutions and industries, covering issues at different levels of the design process. In particular, the topics covered by this special issue include router architecture, routing and reconfiguration techniques, application mapping and virtualization, application specific architectures, support for parallel programming, memory organization and reliability issues. Under the router architecture category, we have selected three papers. Asynchronous quasi-delay-insensitive NoCs have several advantages over their clocked counterparts. On the other side, although virtual channel (VC) is the most utilized flow control method in asynchronous routers, spatial division multiplexing (SDM) achieves better throughput performance for best effort traffic than VC. Based on this, Song and Edwards, in their paper entitled ‘‘Asynchronous Spatial Division Multiplexing Router’’, present a novel asynchronous SDM router architecture and perform an exhaustive analysis with different configurations of payload size, communication distance, buffer size, port bandwidth, network size and number of VCs. They show that the proposed architecture achieves higher throughput with lower area overhead. As the network size increases, the communication latency becomes a dominant problem. To address this problem, development of fast router architectures which minimize the number of clock cycles needed for packets forwarding, represent one of the most widespread research directions. Reducing the router delay to just one clock cycle is a cherished desire of researchers. In this context, Lai et al., in their paper entitled ‘‘A Practical Low Latency Router Architecture with Wing Channel for On-Chip Network’’, present a single-cycle router architecture and compare it, in terms of performance (latency and throughput), cost (silicon area) and power dissipation with other solutions showing that interesting performance and power improvement can be obtained with modest area overhead. Starting from the observation that the input buffers of a router consume a significant portion of the total power of the interconnection network, Zhang et al., in their paper entitled ‘‘Design of a Performance Enhanced and Power Reduced Dual-Crossbar Network-on-Chip Architecture’’, propose a dual-crossbar design which combines the advantages of buffered and buffer-less networks and allows to achieve significant performance improvement (in terms	best-effort delivery;clock rate;clock signal;crossbar switch;delay insensitive circuit;high-level programming language;interconnection;interrupt latency;memory organisation;multi-core processor;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;network on a chip;overhead (computing);parallel computing;router (computing);routing;throughput;virtual channel	Maurizio Palesi;Shashi Kumar;Radu Marculescu	2011	Microprocessors and Microsystems - Embedded Hardware Design	10.1016/j.micpro.2011.01.002	embedded system;computer architecture;design methods;computer science;network on a chip	Arch	2.6870066600886697	60.89242852410472	175023

In this work, we benefit from the advantages of non-contiguous processor allocation mechanisms, by allowing the tasks of the input application mapped onto disjoint regions (sub-meshes) and then virtually connecting them by bypassing the router pipeline stages of the inter-region routers. The experimental results show considerable improvement over one of the best existing allocation mechanisms.	algorithm;central processing unit;low-power broadcasting;multiprocessing;network on a chip;network packet;packet switching;parallel computing;point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);router (computing);whole earth 'lectronic link	Marjan Asadinia;Mehdi Modarressi;Arash Tavakkol;Hamid Sarbazi-Azad	2011	2011 Design, Automation & Test in Europe	10.1109/DATE.2011.5763072	algorithm design;parallel computing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	EDA	2.1462104274678038	61.869281474803955	175193

Routing algorithms are responsible for the on-chip communication and traffic distribution through the network. Hence, designing efficient and high-performance routing algorithms is of significant importance. In this paper, a deadlock-free and highly adaptive path-based routing method is proposed without using virtual channels. This method strives to exploit the maximum number of minimal paths between any source and destination pair. The simulation results in terms of performance and power consumption demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the other adaptive and non-adaptive schemes. This efficiency is achieved by reducing the number of hotspots and smoothly distributing the traffic across the network.	algorithm;deadlock;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hotspot (wi-fi);mpsoc;multiprocessing;network congestion;network on a chip;router (computing);routing;simulation;smoothing;system on a chip;veritas cluster server	Poona Bahrebar;Dirk Stroobandt	2014	2014 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)		policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;network on a chip;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	EDA	2.1382122818137144	62.84711289904037	175508

Adaptive LIP’s (ALIP) and EC with early evaluation (ECEE) increase the performance by relaxing the evaluation rule: Computation is enabled as soon as the subset of inputs needed at a given time is available. Their difference in terms of implementation and behavior in selected cases justifies the need for the comparative analysis reported in this paper.

Simulation is the methodology usually followed in evaluation studies, because the model can more faithfully represent hardware implementation, taking into account more details. Nevertheless, the number of parameter combinations is often high, and simulations also take long to complete. Therefore, evaluation studies must choose a subset of the parameters and restrict the variability of each of them. In a previous paper [,O], we have proposed a methodology for evaluating interconnection networks. I t is based on experimental design used in statistical studies. Using this methodology, we can study network behavior considering many parameters, running only a subset of the simulations required to study all the combinations.

In this paper we analyze the possible failure scenarios in the handshake of a 4-phase bundled data protocol that can arise from transient faults and systematically elaborate mitigation techniques for the resulting effects, namely single event transients and single event upsets. By simulated fault injection we show the effectiveness of the proposed extensions for protecting the channel. We take care to make these extensions themselves immune against transient faults, and we prove their proper and deadlock-free operation under fault conditions by means of model checking. Finally we show that, while providing superior coverage, our approach is in line with comparable approaches with respect to the area overhead.	channel (communications);code coverage;data architect;data architecture;deadlock;delay insensitive circuit;fault injection;fault tolerance;graphics pipeline;model checking;overhead (computing);path protection;pipeline (computing);reliability engineering;single event upset;single point of failure;vii	Syed Rameez Naqvi;Jakob Lechner;Andreas Steininger	2014	Fifteenth International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design	10.1109/ISQED.2014.6783315	embedded system;communications protocol;failure analysis;electronic engineering;real-time computing;formal verification;computer science	Arch	3.470346869666324	64.15809855723563	175841

To match the very low power production capabilities of the PMFC, we couple it with an ultra-low power wake-up receiver used as a trigger for sampling and transmission of the sensed value. We demonstrate that this combination, with a new, receiver initiated MAC-level communication protocol, results in a sustainable system for reasonable data rates, shown to be 30s in our laboratory setting.

The paper investigates an impact of collective communication (CC) overhead that may be critical for performance of parallel applications. Two potential topologies of networks on chip (NoC) are investigated, a ring-based network and 2D-mesh, due to their easy manufacturability on a chip. The wormhole switching, full duplex links and 1-port non-combining as well as combining nodes are considered. The lower bounds on the number of communication steps and upper bounds of CC times based on real CC algorithms are given. They can be evaluated for any given start-up time and link bandwidth.

The focus of this paper is on permutation routing where each processor contains exactly one packet initially and finally. A slight modification of permutation routing called balanced routing is also discussed. For two-dimensional grids a determinisitc routing algorithm is given forn×n meshes where each processor has a buffer of size f(n) < n. It needs 2n + O(n/f(n)) steps on grids without wrap-arounds. Hence, it is asymptoticaliy nearly optimal, and as good as randomized algorithms routing data only with high probability. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that onr-dimensional cubes of processors permutation routing can be performed asymptotically by (2r−2)n steps, which is faster than the running times of so-far known randomized algorithms and of deterministic algorithms.	central processing unit;network packet;olap cube;randomized algorithm;router (computing);routing;with high probability	Manfred Kunde	1993	Algorithmica	10.1007/BF01185337	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;source routing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;flooding;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;mathematics;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;randomized algorithm;triangular routing;algorithm;routing information protocol	Theory	0.09036539990155154	70.75314465165785	177896

Increasing processor power and memory availability allow more demanding applications, such as scientific visualization and imaging. Advances in network performance and functionality have the potential for supporting programs requiring high bandwidth and predictable performance. However, the bottleneck in increasingly in the host-network interface, and thus the ability to deliver high performance communication capability to applications has not kept up with the advances in computer and network speed. We have proposed a new architecture that meets these challenges called Axon, whose novel aspects include: an integrated design of hardware, operating systems, and communications protocols, stressing both performance and the required functionality for demanding applications; the proper division of hardware and software function; and reorganization of end-to-end protocols to take advantage of the increased functionality of the emerging high speed internetworks. ...

The recent IEEE 802.15.4 standard has been developed to address vital issues of these networks, such as limited battery power and low processing capabilities. However, the standard does not meet all the requirements of industrial networks. For example, only some of the IEEE 802.15.4 nodes save energy. Also, this standard suffers from beacon frame collisions. In this paper, we describe MaCARI, a deterministic MAC layer protocol which allows all nodes to save energy and avoids the beacon frame collisions. We discuss several optimizations to increase the performance of the protocol or to offer QoS features. We evaluated the main components of MaCARI using a simulation and a prototype on a real hardware platform in order to prove their feasibility.	lp-type problem	Gérard Chalhoub;Erwan Livolant;Alexandre Guitton;Adrien van den Bossche;Michel Misson;Thierry Val	2009	Ad Hoc & Sensor Wireless Networks		reverse address resolution protocol;embedded system;network allocation vector;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network	Mobile	6.21826487878166	72.68577920746651	178112

With the advent of side channel attacks, devices’ resistance to such attacks became another major requirement. This paper describes a cryptographic hardware module for an AES algorithm that provides complete protection against first order differential power analysis by embedding a data masking countermeasure at a hardware level. We concentrate on inversion in GF (2) since this is the only non-linear operation that requires complex transformations on masked data and on bits of the masks. The simulation and synthesis results confirm that the proposed solution is suitable for applications in GSM and ad-hoc networks in terms of performance, gate count and power consumption. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a side channel-resistant AES hardware module suitable for smartand SIM-cards.	algorithm;coprocessor;cryptography;data masking;gate count;grammatical framework;hoc (programming language);nonlinear system;side-channel attack;simulation;smart card;throughput	Elena Trichina;Tymur Korkishko	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30496-8_18	smart card;telecommunications;computer science;side channel attack;computer security;statistics	EDA	9.839536114252448	65.95654689104668	178531

The sets of edges in those graphs can be partitioned to dimensions. It is well known that the hypercube can be extended by adding a wildcard dimension resulting in a folded hypercube that has better fault-tolerant and communication capabilities. First the authors prove that the folded hypercube is optimal in the sense that only a single wildcard dimension can be added to the hypercube. They then investigate the idea of adding wildcard dimensions to d-dimensional meshes and tori. Using techniques from error correcting codes they construct d-dimensional meshes and tori with wildcard dimensions. Finally, they show how these constructions can be used to tolerate edge and node faults in mesh and torus networks.	code;coding theory;computer;error detection and correction;fault tolerance;interconnection;parallel computing	Jehoshua Bruck;Robert Cypher;C.

This problem can usually be solved by coordinating the actions of the remote testers using a test management protocol, a ferry protocol with inter-process communication, or a telephone/terminal connection. However, these solutions either require an additional communication channel or an additional protocol for coordination between the testers. Such requirements can be eliminated by constructing a synchronizable test sequence such that the corresponding sequence of transitions causes no synchronization problem. A heuristic we develop in this study constructs a synchronizable test sequence from a given strongly biconnected digraph representing a deterministic and minimal FSM using synchronizable UIO sequences for each state of the given FSM.	biconnected graph;channel (communications);directed graph;heuristic;inter-process communication;requirement;test management	Hasan Ural;Zhiping Wang	1993	Computer Communications	10.1016/0140-3664(93)90082-4	synchronization;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;algorithm	SE	3.13936460151255	66.76607330127064	178952

All these tasks can be reduced to the problem of copy detection, and in this paper, we propose a canonical hash function for VLSI layout datasets which can be used for efficient copy detection and signature generation. The proposed signature is independent of the ordering of the layout elements, their tessellation, resolution, and even vertex count. These parameters, which do not contribute to the final wafer image, increase the entropy of the data and thus standard hash functions such as message digest (MD5) or secure hash algorithm (SHA), are not suitable for this problem of VLSI layout hashing. In this paper, a novel, entropy reduced hash function is developed which can be used to alleviate the above mentioned problems of physical IP management.

Generally, when people consider wireless devices they think of such items as cell phones or personal digital assistants, items with high costs and energy requirements that target specific, highly standardized applications and rely on a powerful infrastructure. A new direction in wireless system design, however, is extending wireless connectivity to small, low-cost embedded devices for a wide range of applications. Application possibilities for miniature wireless sensing devices include inventory asset tracking, roadside traffic pattern and open parking spot detection, individual plant monitoring for precision agriculture, habitat monitoring in nature preserves, and advanced building security and automation. The military could blanket fields with sensors to detect troop movement. Sensors might enable civil engineers to gauge the structural integrity of buildings and bridges after earthquakes or fires. Integrating hundreds of thousands of sensing and control points could provide new insights into the state of the world. Exploiting local communication and application-specific protocols can drastically reduce size, cost, and power use in wireless devices. These devices won’t need to communicate with the nearest high-power control tower, but only with their local peers. Peer-to-peer networking techniques provide a flexible mesh-like interconnect that shuttles data between thousands of tiny embedded devices. A handful of the devices might act as bridges between a local embedded communication mesh and a traditional data network. Figure 1 depicts a precision agriculture deployment— an active area of application research. Researchers are developing new algorithms for data aggregation, ad hoc routing, and distributed signal processing for low-power peer-topeer wireless networks. As researchers envision smaller and lower-cost devices, the range of application scenarios grows dramatically. The Mica wireless platform serves as a foundation for the emerging possibilities. Pictured in Figure 2, the Mica platform measures 1.25 × 2.25 inches, runs the TinyOS operating system (http://webs.cs.berkeley.edu/tos), and is suited for self-configuring multihop wireless networks.

Scarce energy and computation power of individual nodes, unattended and harsh operation environment, self configuration after random deployment etc complexities are known characteristic features of a WSN. Despite aforesaid constraints WSN has been evolved as a tool to bridge the gap between physical world of sensors/actuators and the virtual world of information and services. In some typical scenarios of many potential fieldspsila e.g. environmental monitoring, space explorations, military, agricultural, medical etc to name a few, WSN has been emerged as a promising technology. Sensing the environment and sending the sensed information to a remote place via sink are two primary jobs of a sensor network. These jobs are required to be done with greater reliability because some major decisions depend on the information received from WSN. The issue of quantifying reliability for a WSN is addressed in this paper.	computation;distributed computing;internet backbone;job stream;reliability engineering;sensor;software deployment;virtual world	Neetesh Purohit;Pritish Kumar Vardawaj;Sanjiv Tokekar	2008	2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks	10.1109/ICON.2008.4772586	sensor web;embedded system;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;environmental monitoring;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	6.695429392688369	73.83729245282308	180030

Recently, deadlock recovery techniques have been shown to be an alternative to deadlock avoidance. Disha Concurrent is a progressive deadlock recovery scheme able to simultaneously redirect several deadlocked messages through a deadlockfree lane. Unlike deadlock avoidance techniques, Disha provides true fully adaptive routing without using virtual channels to guarantee deadlock freedom. In this paper, we analyze the application of Disha to networks of workstations. We propose an implementation of Disha on irregular networks that allows concurrent deadlock recovery, proving that this implementation is always able to recover from deadlock. A new switch organization and a new flow control protocol are proposed to support Disha. Performance evaluation results show that applying Disha to irregular networks increases network throughput by a factor of up to 3.5, and also reduces latency with regard to other routing algorithms based on deadlock avoidance techniques.	algorithm;computer;crossbar switch;deadlock;flow control (data);parallel computing;performance evaluation;requirement;routing;throughput;virtual channel;workstation	Federico Silla;Antonio Robles;José Duato	1998		10.1109/ICPP.1998.708466	local area network;communications protocol;parallel processing;algorithm design;routing;throughput;latency;parallel computing;real-time computing;cost-effectiveness analysis;workstation;concurrent computing;adaptive routing;computer science;concurrency control;flow control;distributed computing;deadlock prevention algorithms;computer network	HPC	-2.185775572546396	68.81879361775022	180283

FlexRay is a deterministic communication protocol which is increasingly used in the automotive industry as it provides a high bandwidth and allows for safety critical applications. It is characterized by pre-set communication cycles that are subdivided into static and dynamic segments; the data transmissions are scheduled by different rules depending on the segment. We propose for the first time a hybrid model of NCS with FlexRay for this purpose. We show, under reasonable assumptions, that the asymptotic stability property ensured by the controller in the absence of communication constraints is preserved when the latter is implemented over FlexRay with sufficiently frequent data transmission. In particular, we assume that on each communication segment, the data transmissions are governed by uniformly globally exponentially stable protocols. This covers the case when the round-robin protocol is implemented on the static segment and the try-once-discard protocol is implemented on the dynamic segment. We provide explicit maximum allowable transmission interval bounds that guarantee stability.	communications protocol;control system;emulator;flexray;network computing system;nonlinear system;round-robin dns	Wei Wang;Dragan Nesic;Romain Postoyan	2015	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2015.06.010	control engineering;embedded system;real-time computing;networked control system;engineering;control theory;hybrid system	Embedded	3.2714547607251263	67.93843471630356	180445

However, if specialized modules are sending data at full speed to the NoC, Quality of Service (QoS) can be no longer guaranteed. This work presents a multi-layer mesh NoC approach to improve the QoS of such communication hungry SoCs. While one mesh layer is fixed in the system for control purposes, other data layers can be configured at runtime to provide the desired data throughput required by the application. This is accomplished by partially and dynamically reconfiguring the data layer routers. Arbitration algorithms, routing algorithms and huge crossbars are removed from the data layer routers, because all data routers in the path a configured accordingly before its utilization. A SoC following this idea was prototyped in a Virtex-4 FPGA and the Early Access Partial Flow was used to partially and dynamically reconfigure the NoC. We show that 120 (5!) different configurations are needed for each reconfigurable router with 5 bidirectional ports. Each configuration requires 33KB of memory and occupies 32 CLBs of area.	algorithm;early access;field-programmable gate array;kilobyte;layer (electronics);network on a chip;quality of service;router (computing);routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);system on a chip;throughput	Leandro Möller;Peter Fischer;Fernando Gehm Moraes;Leandro Soares Indrusiak;Manfred Glesner	2010	2010 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications	10.1109/FPL.2010.53	system on a chip;embedded system;parallel computing;quality of service;computer science;operating system;network on a chip;computer network	EDA	1.9424233651513598	61.931901168018236	180503

One reason is that many efficient and popular networks such as the meshes, tori, hypercubes, hyper de Bruijn, product shuffle, and the newly proposed folded Petersen networks belong to this class of networks. Secondly, with the help of cartesian product graphs, a unique method for the design and analysis of a class of networks as well as techniques for embedding and communication algorithms can be provided. In this paper, first multiple arc-disjoint spanning trees are constructed on product networks with bidirectional links. These trees are utilized to design fault-tolerant algorithms for several important communication primitives assuming all-port communication. The problems under consideration include broadcasting, gossiping, scattering, and total exchange. >		Sabine R. Öhring;Dirk H.

Standards such as ZigBee, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a and WIA-PA are, nowadays, at the basis of the main process-automation technologies. However, despite the success of these standards, management of WSNs is still an open topic, which clearly is an obstacle to dependability. Existing diagnostic tools are mostly application- or problem-specific, and do not support standard-based multi-network monitoring. This paper proposes a WSN monitoring architecture for process-automation technologies that addresses the mentioned limitations. Specifically, the architecture has low impact on sensor node resources, uses network metrics already available in industrial standards, and takes advantage of widely used management standards to share the monitoring information. The proposed architecture was validated through prototyping, and the obtained performance results are presented and discussed in the final part of the paper. In addition to proposing a monitoring architecture, the paper provides an in-depth insight into metrics, techniques, management protocols, and standards applicable to industrial WSNs.

750e2c07bc7b8932156d08a50ac00d15933fd90e	a traffic-aware medium access control mechanism for energy-efficient wireless network-on-chip architectures		Wireless interconnection has emerged as an energy efficient solution to the challenges of multi-hop communication over the wireline paths in conventional Networks-on-Chips (NoCs). However, to ensure the full benefits of this novel interconnect technology, design of simple, fair and efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) mechanism to grant access to the on-chip wireless communication channel is needed. Moreover, to adapt to the varying traffic demands from the applications running on a multicore environment, MAC mechanisms should dynamically adjust the transmission slots of the wireless interfaces (WIs). Such dynamic adjustment in transmission slots will result in improving the utilization of the wireless medium in a Wireless NoC (WiNoC). In this paper we present the design of two dynamic MAC mechanisms that adjust the transmission slots of the WIs based on predicted traffic demands and allow partial packet transfer. Through system level simulations, we demonstrate that the traffic aware MAC mechanisms are more energy efficient as well as capable of sustaining higher data bandwidth in WiNoCs.	access control;baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);channel (communications);collegehumor;dhrystone;interconnection;internet backbone;multi-core processor;network on a chip;network packet;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;simulation;wireless router	Naseef Mansoor;Abhishek Vashist;M.

The algorithm takes advantage of the bottom up divide -and -conquer strategy applied in tree and pyramid architectures, hut only requires a mesh topology. In order to support non-local communication, where meshes perform poor, we have proposed a new augmentation, called the Polymorphic -Torus. A Polymorphic -Torus is a regular mesh interconnection network where each node is able to dynamically interconnect its ports, depending on its own data. By having each node properly drive such an interconnection, communication l inks between processors get established and disconnected and, as a result, the effective network diameter is reduced. Our proposed connected corn onent labeling algorithm requires 0 ( ) steps for a '? X G multicolored iniape on a n processor Polymorphic-Torus, which is the same performance achieved in a tree architecture with 2 n I processors. The lower number of processors and the simpler topology of Polymorphic-Torus (vs. tree) make it a very suitable approach to mesh augmentation for intermediate level vision applications.	central processing unit;connected component (graph theory);connected-component labeling;digital image;interconnection;mesh networking;parallel algorithm;sequence labeling;top-down and bottom-up design	Massimo Maresca;Hungwen Li;Mark A.

The method is evaluated using one million multiple-fault injection experiments; next reliability and MTTF of the protected memories are estimated based on fault injection experiments and several equations. The fault detection/correction coverage are also calculated and compared with previous methods i.e., Reed-Muller and hamming code. The results reveal that the proposed method behaves better than these methods in terms of fault detection and correction of multiple faults regarding to the area overhead.	barcode;experiment;fault detection and isolation;fault injection;hamming code;high-level programming language;mean time between failures;overhead (computing);parity bit;reed–muller code;static random-access memory	Costas Argyrides;Hamid R.

Large capacity SSD usually requires high-density multi-level cell flash memory fabricated with deep-submicron process. High-density memory chips, however, are vulnerable to soft errors caused by, for example, fluctuations of gate voltage and charge level in the floating gate. This paper proposes a hierarchical three-level error control coding suitable for the dependable SSD. The proposed coding is capable of correcting multiple random bit errors, as well as of recovering from single chip failures. Evaluation shows that the proposed coding scheme provides strong error correction capability. For example, bit error rate (BER) of the SSD is reduced from 1.08 × 10-4 to 2.44 × 10-19 by using the proposed coding, that is, using two BCH codes with different error correction capabilities for the first and the second levels, and the simple parity-check code for the third level. Extra one spare memory chip in the SSD improves mean time to data loss (MTTDL) from 13 years to 34 years.	access time;bch code;bit error rate;disk storage;error detection and correction;flash memory;hard disk drive;multi-level cell;random access;soft error;solid-state drive;very-large-scale integration;x.690	Haruhiko Kaneko;Takuya Matsuzaka;Eiji Fujiwara	2008	2008 14th IEEE Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing	10.1109/PRDC.2008.17	chip;parallel computing;real-time computing;error detection and correction;non-volatile memory;bit error rate;soft error;computer hardware;telecommunications;computer science;coding gain;bch code;random access;encoding	Arch	7.755084729856874	61.88076936908245	181950

In this paper, we present an error-resilient cache architecture that resolves the drawback of previous approaches, i.e., the performance degradation at a low supply voltage which is caused by cache misses in accesses to faulty resources. We utilize cache access locality and error-free resources in a cost-effective manner. First, we classify cache lines into fully and partially accessed groups and apply appropriate methods to each group. For the partially accessed group, we propose a method of matching memory access behavior and error locations with intra-cache line word-level remapping. In order to reduce the area overhead used to store the cache access information history, we present an access pattern-learning line-fill buffer (LFB). For the fully accessed group, we propose the utilization of error-free assist functions in the cache, i.e., a LFB and victim cache with no process variation-induced error at the target minimum supply voltage. We also present an error-aware prefetch method that allows us to utilize the error-free victim cache to achieve a further reduction in cache misses due to faulty resources. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives an average 32.6% reduction in cycles per instruction at an error rate of 0.2% with a small area overhead of 8.2%.	cpu cache;cache (computing);cycles per instruction;elegant degradation;experiment;information history;locality of reference;overhead (computing)	Young-Geun Choi;Sungjoo Yoo;Sunggu Lee;Jung Ho Ahn;Kangmin Lee	2013	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2202931	bus sniffing;least frequently used;pipeline burst cache;cache-oblivious algorithm;parallel computing;real-time computing;cache coloring;page cache;cpu cache;computer hardware;cache;computer science;write-once;cache invalidation;operating system;smart cache;mesi protocol;cache algorithms;cache pollution;low-power electronics;non-uniform memory access	EDA	7.281945572771457	61.227831732819894	182234

Scheduling algorithms that prevent packet-loss are always desirable. L ONGEST-QUEUE-FIRST (LQF) is an online greedy algorithm widely exploited because of its simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we give improved bounds on the competitive ratio of LQF in terms of the worst-case queuing length, parameterized with respect to the optimal queuing length of a clairvoyant adversary. This gives a better picture of LQF’s performance under heavy traffic than the usual (unparameterized) competitive ratio. We also discuss randomization, and we conclude with some intriguing open problems regarding a two-dimensional generalization of the problem. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Most of these applications have stringent dependability (reliability and availability) requirements, as a system failure may result in economic losses, put people in danger or lead to environmental damages. Among the different type of faults that can lead to a system failure, permanent faults on network devices have a major impact. They can hamper communications over long periods of time and consequently disturb, or even disable, control algorithms. The lack of a structured approach enabling the evaluation of permanent faults, prevents system designers to optimize decisions that minimize these occurrences. In this work we propose a methodology based on an automatic generation of a fault tree to evaluate the reliability and availability of Wireless Sensor Networks, when permanent faults occur on network devices. The proposal supports any topology, different levels of redundancy, network reconfigurations, criticality of devices and arbitrary failure conditions. The proposed methodology is particularly suitable for the design and validation of Wireless Sensor Networks when trying to optimize its reliability and availability requirements.	algorithm;anatomy, regional;criticality matrix;dependability;entity name part qualifier - adopted;environmental illness;fault tree analysis;last mile;neuronal calcium-sensor proteins;redundancy (engineering);requirement;semantics (computer science)	Ivanovitch M.

However, not too much attention has been focused on how the permuting properties interact with the mapping of tasks to processors in realizing the communication requirements between tasks. In this paper we focus on characterizing the abilities of some interconnection networks in realizing intertask communication that can be specified as permutations of the task names. From the point of view of the intertask communications requirements, the perceived permuting capabilities may depend upon the specific assignment of tasks to processors. Distinct network permutations may actually result in equivalent intertask communication patterns depending upon the mapping of tasks to processors. Characterizations of networks are developed based upon the theory of permutation groups. A number of properties as well as limitations of these networks become evident from this characterization. Finally, a class of switching networks is identified, that possess many useful properties that make them preferable to multistage interconnection networks in specific applications.	apollonian network;central processing unit;multistage interconnection networks;parallel computing;requirement	Sudhakar Yalamanchili;Jake K.

This paper proposes energy efficient error recovery (E3R) to simultaneously extend the lifetime and lower the energy/latency of PDM MLC/TLC NVMs. E3R partitions NVM rows into segments that remain in the PDM mode until a cell failure within a segment. E3R restores the failed segment to the full data mapping (FDM) mode, i.e., Conventional binary mapping, while other segments continue to operate in PDM mode. By incrementally restoring a row from PDM to FDM mode, E3R not only reduces memory energy/latency, but also enhances its lifetime by localizing faults to segments, thereby extending the row error correction capability of error-correcting pointers (ECPs). Simulation results on a TLC RRAM architecture show that E3R improves memory lifetime by 76% in comparison to unprotected memory, while also reducing memory energy by 16% over conventional binary mapping. Furthermore, we propose augmented E3R, which employs residual memory columns from the post manufacturing test to supplement E3R in error recovery. For no additional overhead, augmented E3R further improves memory lifetime by 6.2% over basic E3R.	column (database);error detection and correction;finite difference method;multi-level cell;non-volatile memory;online and offline;overhead (computing);resistive random-access memory;simulation	Shivam Swami;Kartik Mohanram	2016	2016 29th International Conference on VLSI Design and 2016 15th International Conference on Embedded Systems (VLSID)	10.1109/VLSID.2016.33	embedded system;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer hardware;computer science	EDA	7.762283516490862	61.41311851195287	183564

There are two main significances in this paper. First, the wheel-rail contact laws (including Hertz and Fastsim algorithms), which are widely used in the study of railway vehicle dynamics, are restructured for improved suitability that can take advantage of the rapid developing multiprocessor technology. Second, the complex algorithms for the contact laws are successfully implemented on a medium-sized Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device using six NiosII processors, where the executions of the Hertz and Fastsim parts are pipelined to achieve further enhancement in multiple contacts and the operation scheduling is optimized. In the Fastsim part, the floating point units with buffering mechanism are efficiently shared by five processors connected in a token ring topology. The FPGA design shows good flexibility in utilizing logic element and on-chip memory resource on the device and scalability for a significant speed up on a larger device in future work.	algorithm;directed acyclic graph;field-programmable gate array;floating-point unit;mpsoc;multiprocessing;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);real-time clock;real-time transcription;ring network;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;software design;system on a chip;token ring	Yongji Zhou;T.

Consequently, the constant in the run time of our routing scheme is substantially smaller, and the network topology is significantly simpler.	algorithm;network topology;random permutation;routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);sorting network	Eli Upfal	1992	J.

ead0446aece0e56801db52c716475fa597730545	fault localization in nocs by timed heartbeats		Future computing systems will contain more and more cores on a single die. Permanent faults occur not only during manufacturing but may also arise at runtime. To detect these faults, a group of cores is monitored by a single unit, receiving heartbeats from all cores. In this paper, we present a simple method to localize permanent faults in a 2D mesh-based NoC by using heartbeats and by measuring the time from source (core) to destination (monitoring unit). We introduce a heartbeat network along with the normal application message network to guarantee a deterministic heartbeat timing and no interferences with application messages. If the time for a heartbeat exceeds a given interval, it can be concluded that the heartbeat is missing or delayed, e.g. because of a faulty core, link or router. As this is not sufficient to localize a fault, we introduce the concept of Timed Heartbeats, which uses different routing directions in contrary to the intended routing to introduce a fixed, additional delay for rerouted heartbeats. The delay helps to localize the fault without any additional bandwidth consumption.	algorithm;die (integrated circuit);heartbeat network;network on a chip;network topology;router (computing);routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);sound quality	Bernhard Fechner;Arne Garbade;Sebastian Weis;Theo Ungerer	2012			router;real-time computing;heartbeat;heartbeat network;bandwidth (signal processing);computer science	EDA	4.9836948729777815	61.10171885460555	184044

81546e94b3ae4b8fef5239290c04c1defaf5eeda	neuromorphic computing for cognitive augmentation in cyber defense		The growth of digital content and information through the World Wide Web is increasing rapidly and more of this traffic is generated by smart mobile low size, weight, and power (SWaP) devices that are constantly sending/receiving information to/from the network for up-to-date operation. In terms of data, according to an IDC report by Gantz and Reinsel in 2012 [1], from 2005 to 2020, the digital universe will grow by a factor of 300, from 130 to 40,000 exabytes, and from now until 2020, the digital universe will about double every 2 years. The size of the digital universe in 2010 was estimated at 1,227 exabytes [1] in particular. Therefore, it can be expected that an increasing number of low SWaP devices will be implemented to offer enhanced functionality in terms of the complexity and number of services offered to users within the physically and electronically constrained form factor architecture. From a network security stand point, it will be important for the Army to ensure security and trust in the operation and functionality of smart mobile tactical devices. However, from the user’s point of view, performance degradation due to security add-ons may degrade device performance during operation and during operations where speed is critical, enhanced security could degrade operational effectiveness. Therefore, it is the main goal of this effort to perform basic research in methods and techniques to provide security to mobile tactical networks while ensuring low SWaP technical requirements for operation.

In order to provide well-controlled global wire delay and efficient global communication, a Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture was proposed by different authors [1][5][6]. NoC uses Interconnect Intellectual Property (IIP) to connect different resources. In a bottom up approach, this paper first studies the NoC system parameters constrained by the interconnections. Predictions on scaled system parameters such as clock frequency, resource size, global communication bandwidth and inter-resource delay are made for future technologies. Based on these parameters, a global wire planning scheme is proposed. At last, the main IIP modules are described and one possible transmission scheme is demonstrated and simulated.	clock rate;network on a chip;top-down and bottom-up design	Jian Liu;Meigen Shen;Lirong Zheng;Hannu Tenhunen	2003		10.1145/639929.639953	chip;embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;interconnection;top-down and bottom-up design;network on a chip;interconnect bottleneck;intellectual property	EDA	2.6384706115471337	60.96663663727608	185022

However, existing approaches for power modeling have several limitations. Some require external power meters, which is not convenient for people to use. Other approaches either rely on the battery current sensing capability, which is not available on many smartphones, or take a long time to generate the power model. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new way of generating power models from battery voltage dynamics, called V-edge. V-edge is selfconstructive and does not require current-sensing. Most importantly, it is fast in model building. Our implementation supports both component level power models and per-application energy accounting. Evaluation results using various benchmarks and applications show that the V-edge approach achieves high power modeling accuracy, and is two orders of magnitude faster than existing selfmodeling approaches requiring no current-sensing.	edge dominating set;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);power management;prototype;smartphone	Fengyuan Xu;Yunxin Liu;Qun Li;Yongguang Zhang	2013			embedded system;simulation	Networks	8.964404594795868	70.7613601069304	185552

A unique path MIN usually has lower hardware complexity and a simple control algorithm, but it lacks fault tolerance. This paper proposes a kind of multipath MINs, which are obtained by adding auxiliary links at the final stage in Quad Tree (QT) networks so that they can provide more paths between each source-destination pair, and presents their routing algorithm which is both destination tag based and adaptive. Starting with the routing tag for the minimum path between a given source-destination pair, the routing algorithm uses a set of rules to select switches and modify routing tag. In addition to trying the auxiliary link whenlink 0 andlink 1 are unavailable,link 1 will be tried whenlink 0 is unavailable. This feature distinguishing the proposed routing algorithm from that for QT networks makes better use of all the possible paths between the given source-destination pair. In the end, this paper introduces a performance index, which is calledcapacity, to compare different kinds of MINs. Comparison shows that the proposed MINs have bettercapacity than QT networks.	algorithm;fault tolerance;multipath propagation;multiprocessing;multistage interconnection networks;network switch;qt (software);quadtree;routing	Yingquan Zhou;Yinghua Min	1996	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/BF02948483	routing;fault tolerance;static routing;process performance index;real-time computing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Arch	-0.9373438080701871	69.2189247758049	186149

We consider a networked system composed of multiple wireless sensor networks (WSN) that are plugged into a cabled Networked Control System (NCS) made of middleware computers and control stations. The challenge that we faced was to provide predictable end-to-end latency expectations in those settings, as opposed to the problem of predicting latencies within a WSN only. We consider a deployment with multiple small-sized schedule-based WSN sub-networks and the NCS. The approach accounts for details such as de-synch issues that are to be expected in the heterogeneous context. Experimental results show actual latencies and confront them with predictions in a testbed deployment.

The number of update messages sent by each node during the update process is used as the measure of update overhead. Both synchronous behavior and asynchronous behavior of the MERIT algorithm are considered. The number of messages required for synchronous update is shown to be an upper bound for the number of messages required if update occurs asynchronously. The effect of network topology on update overhead is discussed. Finally, some implementation suggestions aimed at minimizing looping of messages during routing table update are presented.		Marjory J.

Solving the wirelength problem helps in minimizing the time delay in execution. The binary hypercube is one of the most popular interconnection networks since it has a simple structure and is easy to implement. The enhanced hypercube is an important variant of hypercube with a smaller diameter, improvised mean node distance and cost efficiency when compared to a binary hypercube. In this paper we consider the problem of embedding enhanced hypercubes into r-rooted complete binary trees for minimizing the wirelength.	binary tree;broadcast delay;cost efficiency;diameter (protocol);embedded system;interconnection;parallel algorithm	Jessie Abraham;Micheal Arockiaraj	2016	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2016.05.032	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;parallel computing;binary tree;embedding;mathematics	Theory	0.11448549638424727	68.22663055868384	186656
de1583ff94e2e97d65740c056662c286b6d63228	flexvc: flexible virtual channel management in low-diameter networks		Deadlock avoidance mechanisms for lossless lowdistance networks typically increase the order of virtual channel (VC) index with each hop. This restricts the number of buffer resources depending on the routing mechanism and limits performance due to an inefficient use. Dynamic buffer organizations increase implementation complexity and only provide small gains in this context because a significant amount of buffering needs to be allocated statically to avoid congestion. We introduce FlexVC, a simple buffer management mechanism which permits a more flexible use of VCs. It combines statically partitioned buffers, opportunistic routing and a relaxed distancebased deadlock avoidance policy. FlexVC mitigates Head-of-Line blocking and reduces up to 50% the memory requirements. Simulation results in a Dragonfly network show congestion reduction and up to 37.8% throughput improvement, outperforming more complex dynamic approaches. FlexVC merges different flows of traffic in the same buffers, which in some cases makes more difficult to identify the traffic pattern in order to support nonminimal adaptive routing. An alternative denoted FlexVCminCred improves congestion sensing for adaptive routing by tracking separately packets routed minimally and nonminimally, rising throughput up to 20.4% with 25% savings in buffer area.	blocking (computing);deadlock;link-state routing protocol;lossless compression;network congestion;protocol buffers;requirement;router (computing);simulation;speedup;throughput;variable assembly language;virtual channel	Pablo Fuentes;Enrique Vallejo;Ramón Beivide;Cyriel Minkenberg;Mateo Valero	2017	2017 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)	10.1109/IPDPS.2017.110	throughput;deadlock;virtual channel;computer science;parallel computing;hop (networking);distributed computing;real-time computing;adaptive routing;static routing;computer network;network packet;lossless compression	Arch	-1.724682092128433	69.39780127155429	187240

With such concurrency, packet ordering at the output of the network processor cannot be guaranteed. This paper studies the effect of concurrency in network processors on packet ordering. We use a validated Petri net model of a commercial network processor, Intel IXP 2400, to determine the extent of packet reordering for IPv4 forwarding application. Our study indicates that in addition to the parallel processing in the network processor, the allocation scheme for the transmit buffer also adversely impacts packet ordering. In particular, our results reveal that these packet reordering results in a packet retransmission rate of up to 61%. We explore different transmit buffer allocation schemes namely, contiguous, strided, local, and global which reduces the packet retransmission to 24%. We propose an alternative scheme, packet sort, which guarantees complete packet ordering while achieving a throughput of 2.5 Gbps. Further, packet sort outperforms the in-built packet ordering schemes in the IXP processor by up to 35%.	central processing unit;concurrency (computer science);data rate units;network congestion;network packet;network processor;parallel computing;petri net;pipeline (computing);retransmission (data networks);tcp congestion control;throughput	S.

For testing the cores in an SoC, a special mechanism is required since they are not directly accessible via chip inputs and outputs. In this paper, we introduce a novel test access mechanism (TAM) based on time-division multiplexing (TDM). This so-called TDM-TAM is P1500 compatible and, in fact, uses a P1500 wrapper. The TAM advantages are its flexibility, scalability, and reconfigurability. Also this TAM could be very useful for testing multi-frequency cores in SoCs because, with TDM, the test data rate can be changed. The proposed TAM is compared with two other approaches: a serial threading approach analogous to the IEEE1149.1 standard (Serial TAM) and a packet-switching test network (called NIMA). A network processing unit is used as an SoC platform to compare the different TAMs. Results show that, in most cases, TDM is the most effective TAM in both test time and overhead area. r 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UASNs) technologies are vigorously studied for monitoring underwater environment. The UASNs gather various underwater environmental data that should be delivered to a Monitoring Center where nearby or far from UASNs are deployed. To deliver data form underwater to the Monitoring Center or vice versa, a surface gateway should change acoustic signal to RF (Radio Frequency) signal. Depends on the service requirement, the surface gateway can adopt various wireless communication channels such as Cellular network, Zigbee and so on. In this paper, we propose the architecture of surface gateway that has several wireless communication channels and communication protocol.	acoustic cryptanalysis;communications protocol;radio frequency;sensor	Youngjun Jo;Jungyoungj Bae;Hyunjae Shin;Heungwoo Nam;Sae-Young Ahn;Sunshin An	2010	2010 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/EUC.2010.50	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	7.341395726859968	72.72838846921789	187751

The overhead for sending these messages over an interconnection network can dramatically limit the speedup of a parallel simulation. In this case, message aggregation techniques can increase the granularity of the application and reduce the communication overhead. This paper compares sender-initiated and receiver-initiated message aggregation strategies and addresses their perforniance when applied to parallel simulations of high-speed communication network models on a high perj4ormance clustel: Receiver-initiated strategies were initially motivated by the cyclic behavior of the parallel simulation kernel and by the capabilities of the test-bed environment to handle large messages up to 2000 bytes with small overheads.	aggregate data;byte;interconnection;load balancing (computing);network model;overhead (computing);parallel computing;performance;simulation;speedup;telecommunications network;testbed;traffic collision avoidance system	C.

However, most of these algorithms do not exhibit good scalability properties as the network size increases. As a consequence, most existing broadcast algorithms cannot support real-world parallel applications that require large-scale system sizes due to their high computational demands. Motivated by these observations, this study proposes a new adaptive broadcast algorithm for the mesh. The unique feature of our algorithm is that it handles broadcast operations with a fixed number of message passing steps irrespective of the network size. Our algorithm is based on the coded path routing, which has been proposed in (Al-Dubai and Ould-Khaous, 2001). Results from extensive comparative analysis reveal that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior performance characteristics over those of the well-known Recursive Doubling and Extending Dominating Node algorithms.	algorithm	Ahmed Yassin Al-Dubai;Mohamed Ould-Khaoua	2002		10.1109/ICPADS.2002.1183400	qualitative comparative analysis;distributed algorithm;routing;parallel computing;message passing;atomic broadcast;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;parallel algorithm;programming language;computer network	EDA	-1.6624561246060305	68.00886914170017	187991

We consider patterns of requests that are symmetric, e.g. for each request originating from a node v 1 and destined to a node v 2 , there also exists its symmetric, a request that originates from v 2 and destines to v 1. The problem can be viewed as coloring of undirected paths in trees, but we cannot hope for optimal solutions even when the network is a binary tree, a case for which the undirected problem is in P. In this paper we investigate the relation of this special case with both the undirected problem and the general (non{symmetric) version of the directed problem. We prove that the problem is NP{hard for arbitrary tree topologies and present lower and upper bounds on the number of wavelengths.	bandwidth (signal processing);binary tree;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;routing	Ioannis Caragiannis;Christos Kaklamanis;Giuseppe Persiano	1998			multipath routing;link-state routing protocol;routing information protocol;dynamic source routing;equal-cost multi-path routing;routing table;static routing;triangular routing;distributed computing;computer science	Theory	-0.793792585968486	71.47541394397115	188309

Thus, sensor networks present significant systems challenges involving the use of large numbers of resource-constrained nodes operating essentially unattended and exposed to potential local communication failures. MEMS technology, more reliable wireless communication and low-cost manufacturing have resulted in small, inexpensive and powerful sensors with embedded processing and wireless networking capability. When the number of sensor nodes becomes large, the centralized approach must be reviewed.

The trend of increasing refresh overhead limits the scalability of DRAM memory that refreshes all cells at the same rate, because the refresh rate setting depends on the worst-case weak cell manufactured in unstable process technology. To cope with this issue, fine-grained refresh (FGR) is proposed to eliminate the unnecessary refresh operations caused by minor weak cells. Even JEDEC’s DDR4 DRAM specification announces the support of FGR, which is likely to evolve and become a standard in future DRAM. Unfortunately, according to our key observation, the effectiveness of FGR is greatly confined by the procedure of refresh-oblivious device integration because all memory devices within a module have to be controlled and refreshed in a lockstep way after the step of assembly. In this paper, we are the first to propose a holistic FGR-oriented DRAM optimization framework, retention-aware DRAM assembly and repair (RADAR), to enhance the effectiveness of FGR in DRAM modules. RADAR includes two novel techniques applicable at the stage of DRAM assembly. The first one is retention-aware device clustering that integrates the “compatible” devices to achieve low refresh rate through a preassembly testing and retention-aware matching method. The second technique, Microfix, exploits the hierarchical DRAM array structure and its redundancy to fix critical weak DRAM rows through fine-grained row and subarray remapping. With this optimization architecture, RADAR, the refresh overhead of DRAM dual in-line memory modules can be dramatically reduced as implied in the experiments.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;cell (microprocessor);cluster analysis;control theory;dimm;dynamic random-access memory;experiment;holism;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);radar;random access;refresh rate;scalability	Ying Wang;Yinhe Han;Cheng Wang;Xiaowei Li	2017	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2016.2597220	market research;embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;memory rank;sense amplifier;static random-access memory;cas latency;memory refresh;engineering;electrical engineering;memory controller;software testing;universal memory;bandwidth;radar	Arch	7.556707820263629	60.50868976922724	188792

This scheme is then applied to deadlock recovery. When deadlock occurs in adaptive wormhole routing, the scheme routes the deadlocked message through a special recovery network, constructed from a sub set of the available network resources. Safe recovery is performed without loosing the adaptivity in routing. Simulation study revealed that the proposed scheme performs well under high network load.	algorithm;deadlock;routing;simulation;wormhole switching	R. S. Rajesh;S.

Recently proposed compact routing methods, however, do not guarantee deadlock-freedom. Cyclic channel dependencies on arbitrary routing are typically removed with multiple Virtual Channels (VCs). However, challenges still remain to provide good trade-offs between a number of required VCs and a time complexity of an algorithm for assignment of VCs to paths. In this work, a novel algorithm ACRO is proposed for enriching arbitrary routing functions with deadlock-freedom with a reasonable number of VCs and a time complexity. Experimental results show that ACRO can reduce the average number of required VCs by up to 63% compared with the conventional algorithm that has the same time complexity. Furthermore, ACRO reduces a time complexity by a factor of O(|N| · log|N|) compared with that of the other conventional algorithm that needs almost the same number of VCs.	algorithm;deadlock;routing table;scalability;time complexity	Ryuta Kawano;Hiroshi Nakahara;Seiichi Tade;Ikki Fujiwara;Hiroki Matsutani;Michihiro Koibuchi;Hideharu Amano	2016	2016 IEEE/ACIS 15th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)	10.1109/ICIS.2016.7550818	wireless routing protocol;time complexity;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;supercomputer;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;network switch;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;network topology;routing information protocol	HPC	-0.6912847126048531	69.08811952510104	190087

The low per node cost will enable the development of densely distributed sensornet for a wide range of applications. Sensornet is usually deployed in remote and hostile area without human care. To achieve scalable, robust and long-lived goal, sensornet itself should execute adaptive adjustment and burn energy economically. In this paper we present the idea of context aware sensornet (CASN). Be context aware, sensor nodes are expected to use contexts available and adjust their behaviors correspondingly. Also, cooperative sensor nodes are expected to use context to promote their collaboration. The paper presents the motivation and research challenge of building CASN. It also briefly discusses the implementation issues of CASN middleware.	cooperative mimo;digital electronics;low-power broadcasting;microelectromechanical systems;middleware;multi-function printer;scalability;sensor node	Huaifeng Qin;Xingshe Zhou	2005		10.1145/1101480.1101489	embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;computer security	Mobile	8.237827686438301	73.32386472937948	190415

Deflection routed torus NoCs are known to map particularly well to modern wire-rich FPGA substrates with fracturable LUT organizations while delivering high sustained bandwidths for various workloads and traffic patterns. However, they suffer from significantly higher worst case routing latencies due to deflections, particularly at large system sizes, when compared to classic buffered NoCs. To tackle this challenge, we design a deadlock-free hierarchical torus that (1) targets worst case latencies in deflection torus NoCs by separating deflections into two levels of the NoC, (2) delivers an FPGA-friendly design for deadlock freedom by providing physical escape channels in the lower levels, and (3) naturally supports physical layout for large multi-die FPGA chips by mapping upper level links to expensive interposer connections between dies. We generate layouts for implementing the NoC on the ML605 board (XCV6LX240T FPGA), VC707 board (XC7VX485T FPGA) and large multi-die XC7V2000T chips while delivering fast 300–500MHz NoCs while consuming 10–15% of FPGA LUT resources. For instance with the 16×16 NoC, we reduce worst case deflection costs by 1.5–10× while simultaneously improving sustained rates by 1.5–2× and lowering energy requirements by 25% for a range of statistically-generated traffic patterns.	best, worst and average case;data center;deadlock;emergence;field-programmable gate array;integrated circuit layout;interposer;network on a chip;network packet;packet switching;requirement;routing;scalability;throughput	Kumar H.

For a graph G, a faulty cluster is a connected subgraph of G such that all its nodes are faulty. In cluster fault tolerant routing problems, how many faulty clusters and how large of those clusters can be tolerated are studied. It has been known that for the node-to-node routing, H/sub n/ can tolerate as many as n-1 faulty clusters of diameter at most 1 with at most 2n-3 faulty nodes in total. In this paper, we extend the above result to show the sufficient conditions on faulty clusters of arbitrary diameters that H/sub n/ can tolerate. We also give an algorithm which, given a set of faulty clusters satisfying the sufficient conditions and non-faulty nodes s and t in H/sub n/, finds a fault-free path s/spl rarr/t of length d(s,t)+O(log n) in O(n+|F|) optimal time, where |F| is the total number of faulty nodes.	routing	Qian-Ping Gu;Shietung Peng	1997		10.1109/ISPAN.1997.645127	parallel computing;multipath routing;distributed computing;computer network	Theory	-0.009147230790641668	68.80996585476169	191094

The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment.	algebraic graph theory;connectivity (graph theory);dependability;fault tolerance;fibre channel point-to-point;internet of things;linear algebra;mean time between failures;mesh networking;open-source hardware;open-source software;real life;reliability engineering;tutte polynomial	Jae-Hyun Park	2016	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2015.2496259	wireless mesh network;cognitive radio;wireless wan;wireless site survey;human–computer interaction;reliability theory;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;order one network protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;internet of things;fading;polynomial;computer network	Mobile	5.193749605676438	73.3514759845389	191458

One-to-all or broadcast communication is one of the most important routing patterns and can be applied in many important applications. With the continuous increment in network size, routing in large size mesh networks with faults is unavoidable. In this paper, we propose a new fault-tolerant, local-information-based, and distributed broadcast routing algorithm based on the concept of k-submesh in all-port mesh networks. We suppose that each node has independent failure probability, under the assumption, we analyze the fault tolerance of our algorithm. We show that our routing algorithm is highly fault tolerant and has a high success probability to broadcast messages. For example, we formally prove that if the node failure probability is bounded by 0.12%, our broadcast routing algorithm works successfully with probability at least 99%. Simulation results show that our algorithm is efficient and effective in practice and theory, and the time steps of our algorithm is very close to the optimum.	algorithm;mesh networking;routing	Gaocai Wang;Jianer Chen;Chuang Lin	2010	Journal of Interconnection Networks	10.1142/S0219265910002799	wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;fault tolerance;static routing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;order one network protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Theory	-0.34255667325137695	69.68255925956446	191567

Integrated designs of transport services, protocol architecture, and implementation platforms are needed for the requirements of forthcoming applications in high-speed network environments. The transport subsystem PATROCLOS (parallel transport subsystem for cell based high speed networks) is designed with special emphasis on a high degree of inherent parallelism to allow efficient implementations on multiprocessor architectures combined with specialised hardware for very time critical functions. The paper presents transport system design guidelines based on experiences gained with parallel implementations of transport and network layer protocols on transputer networks, an implementation architecture for PATROCLOS based on transputer networks and results of a performance evaluation, which indicate promising throughput values. tions on hybrid multiprocessor platforms. In addition, several characteristics of emerging cell based networks such as ATM and DQDB influence the protocol design for the transport system [5]. A number of protocol mechanisms (e.g., connection management, error control, flow control) need to be changed in order to take advantage of the provided network bandwidth [6]. Moreover, since a large amount of data may be travelling between communicating end systems, it is impractical to maintain a consistent view of the state in both systems. The exchange of connection state information piggy-backed in user data can not be recommended for high performance communications. Mechanisms based on exchanges after dedicated requests (e.g., XTP [7]) or periodic exchanges (e.g., SNR [ 2]) seem to be more suitable. The parallel transport subsystem PATROCLOS presented in this paper attempts to overcome the performance limitations by the integration of protocol and implementation issues and by providing the required functionalities between the media access layer interface of cell-based networks and the transport layer interface in a single, modular designed protocol component.	ansi c;atm turbo;algorithm;communications protocol;computer multitasking;concurrent computing;diploma;entity;error detection and correction;executable;finite-state machine;gigabit;integrated services digital network;multiprocessing;network congestion;parallel computing;performance evaluation;precedence effect;prototype;requirement;schmidt decomposition;signal-to-noise ratio;springer (tank);systems design;throughput;transport layer interface;transputer	Torsten Braun;Claudia Schmidt	1993		10.1109/HPDC.1993.263855	communications protocol;computer architecture;parallel computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-2.371972751822305	65.47512521151816	192277

These directed graphs are regular of degree, have N=k/sup n/ vertices for some n, and can tolerate up to k-2 node faults. Their fault-free diameter is n=log/sub k/N, and this is increases by at most 1 hop in the presence of k-2 faults. This class is very rich: for any given N=k/sup n/, one can construct at least 2/sup N/ different graphs. This is in sharp contrast to most other such constructions (including the de Bruijn graph), in which only one graph exists for each N. It is also shown how to implement certain algorithms on these networks. >	de bruijn graph	M. A. Sridhar;Cauligi S. Raghavendra	1991	IEEE Trans.

Reliability and noise tolerance mostly concern the communication tasks between the network nodes, which are implemented complying with formal protocol rules. The challenging target for a reliability analysis is to provide comprehensive evaluations and acceptably accurate results. However, the current complexity of the protocol and the complexity of the networks with many nodes make it very difficult to achieve this target. This paper presents a novel system-level methodology for noise analysis of digital networked systems. The methodology is based on a simulation and analytical approach capable to address a fast and comprehensive study of the reliability properties complying with the protocol specifications. As a test case, the MOST 150 protocol has been considered. MOST 150 protocol is currently widely used for multimedia networks in automotive applications.	fault tolerance;reliability (computer networking);requirement;simulation;test case	Giovanni B.

Most wireless sensors have small batteries and must therefore be designed to consume very little power. In this paper, an approach for whole-system simulation for ultra-low power wireless sensor networks is proposed. To be able to estimate the power consumption of the whole network, the simulation framework must not only simulate the sensor nodes themselves, but also the overall system consisting of sensor nodes and other elements which can be much more sophisticated. It therefore includes an Instruction Set Simulator for better accuracy. To speed up the simulation Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) is used, with SystemC as the base for the simulation framework.	autonomous robot;field-programmable gate array;instruction set simulator;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;microcontroller;microprocessor;sensor;simulation;systemc;transaction-level modeling	Jan Haase;Markus Damm;Johann Glaser;Javier Moreno;Christoph Grimm	2009	2009 Forum on Specification & Design Languages (FDL)		embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	8.646004905046858	70.84149927585591	192996

Following this recent trend, this paper presents a tool, named AVR-INJECT, designed to automate the fault injection, and analysis of results, on WSN nodes. The tool emulates the injection of hardware faults, such as bit flips, acting via software at the assembly level. This allows to attain simplicity, while preserving the low level of abstraction needed to inject such faults. The potential of the tool is shown by using it to perform a large number of fault injection experiments, which allow to study the reaction to faults of real WSN software.	atmel avr;emulator;experiment;fault injection;fault model;incidence matrix;level of detail;microcontroller;software propagation	Marcello Cinque;Domenico Cotroneo;Catello Di Martino;Stefano Russo;Alessandro Testa	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing	10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160907	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Embedded	6.462935351037294	71.84967536515553	193032

Based on the scheduling scheme, we implement an automatic routine generator that takes the topology information as input and produces a customized MPI/spl I.bar/Alltoall routine, a routine in the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard that realizes AAPC. Experimental results show that the automatically generated routine consistently out-performs other MPLAlltoall algorithms, including those in LAM/MPI and MPICH, on Ethernet switched clusters with different network topologies when the message size is sufficiently large. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed AAPC algorithm in exploiting network band-widths.	algorithm;lam/mpi;mpich;maximum throughput scheduling;message passing interface;network topology;personalization;scheduling (computing);tree network	Ahmad Faraj;Xin Yuan	2005	19th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2005.288	throughput;supercomputer;parallel computing;message passing;network switch;computer science;message passing interface;operating system;distributed computing;cluster analysis;network topology;bandwidth;computer network	HPC	0.6072286190624401	62.830836165846755	193735

The queue length at a """"downstream"""" node at time t will depend on the number of customers that were initially present at an """"ups t ream"""" node, for example. Study of this lagged dependence has potential application in the dynamic control of queueing networks. Further, lagged correlations of this kind occur in the expressions for confidence intervals for average queue characteristics, bo th when these are found by direct measurement on the actual network or from simulations. In McNickle [1], the randomization approach was found to be an efficient and practical method for calculating these lagged correlations. In this paper some theoretical relationships that extend the value of computational results are given. In particular we show that for a two-node network with fixed service rates and traffic intensities, the lagged correlation between node 1 and node 2 is strictly proportional to that between node 2 and node 1, for any value of the time lag. We also prove a conjecture in McNickle [1], that in a feed-forward system the lagged correlation is proport ional to the rate of flow between the two nodes.

However, if the reconfiguration process triggered by the first failure is not completed before a second failure occurs, p-cycle reconfiguration methods fail to achieve 100% dual-failure restorability and reduce to the static p-cycle methods which do not take advantage of the spare capacity to be reconfigured. In this study, we propose to use a new restoration model designated as first event locally adaptive restoration model with a coordinated re-restoration effort. This model is aimed to limit the reconfiguration scope to a local p-cycle where the spare capacity is only reconfigured on its straddling links for reducing the reconfiguration overhead (i.e., the average number of reconfigured links during the reconfiguration time.) According to this model, a two-phase locally reconfigurable p-cycle method is proposed. Only the straddling links of the local p-cycle affected by the first failure are reconfigured in the first phase. The second phase is not initialized until the second failure really occurs in the affected local p-cycle. The second phase is to enable the dual-failure restorations with a coordinated re-restoration effort for the first failed link from its original end nodes for any damage that the second failure causes to previously deployed restoration paths. The objective of the proposed method is to maximize the dual-failure restorability within a limited reconfiguration scope. We evaluate the correlation between the normalized spare capacity cost and the dual-failure restorability. The results show that the proposed local reconfiguration heuristic method improves the average dual-failure restorability of the 9n17s and Cost 230 networks by 45.1% and 20.1%, respectively, relative to the static p-cycles method and achieves closely the optimal value obtained using integer linear programming (ILP). Additionally, the spare capacity cost of the proposed local reconfiguration method is smaller than that of previous p-cycle reconfiguration methods in the two test networks.	circuit restoration;failure cause;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;optimization problem;overhead (computing);reconfigurable computing;time complexity;two-phase locking	Chuan-Ching Sue	2008	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-008-0148-8	real-time computing	EDA	5.307142202596092	64.70950276078443	194033

We basically target two problem domains: First, simulations are often used with rather arbitrary configurations, i.e., the used settings may strongly deviate from realistic setups. Secondly, and as our key motivation, we aim to use the simulator to experiment with different algorithms and settings in parallel to an existing sensor network installation. That means that we want to exactly rebuild the real network in order to estimate the performance of our new settings before deploying them into the network. In our demo, we show that not only the physical environment influences the propagation of radio waves, but also the hardware. These changes are incorporated in realtime into our simulator. Even though the reasons for the strong variations are out of the scope, the consequences for the sensor network are significant.	algorithm;network topology;problem domain;radio wave;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;software propagation	Moritz Strübe;Simon Böhm;Rüdiger Kapitza;Falko Dressler	2011		10.1145/2030718.2030740	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;intelligent computer network;wireless sensor network;engineering;network simulation;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;network topology;visual sensor network;network traffic simulation	Mobile	4.59314119253133	73.84394497793105	194158

High speed and compact density multistage interconnection networks (MINs) are widely-used subsystems in different applications. New performance models are proposed to evaluate a novel fault tolerant MIN arrangement, thereby assuring performance and reliability with high confidence level. A concurrent fault detection and recovery scheme for MINs is considered by rerouting over redundant interconnection links under stringent real-time constraints for digital instrumentation such as sensor networks. A switch architecture for concurrent testing and diagnosis is proposed. New performance models are developed and used to evaluate the compound effect of fault tolerant operation (inclusive of testing, diagnosis, and recovery) on the overall throughput and delay. Results are shown for single transient and permanent stuck-at faults on links and storage units in the switching elements. It is shown that performance degradation due to fault tolerance is graceful while performance degradation without fault recovery is unacceptable.	fault tolerance;multistage interconnection networks	Minsu Choi;Nohpill Park;Fabrizio Lombardi	2003	IEEE Trans.

We assume an adversary that controls the injection time, source, and destination for each packet injected. A set of paths for these packets is admissible if no link in the network is overloaded. We present the first on-line routing algorithm that finds a set of admissible paths whenever this is feasible. Our algorithm calculates a path for each packet as soon as it is injected at its source using a simple shortest path computation. The length of a link reflects its current congestion. We also show how our algorithm can be implemented under today's Internet routing paradigms.When the paths are known (either given by the adversary or computed as above), our goal is to schedule the packets along the given paths so that the packets experience small end-to-end delays. The best previous delay bounds for deterministic and distributed scheduling protocols were exponential in the path length. In this article, we present the first deterministic and distributed scheduling protocol that guarantees a polynomial end-to-end delay for every packet.Finally, we discuss the effects of combining routing with scheduling. We first show that some unstable scheduling protocols remain unstable no matter how the paths are chosen. However, the freedom to choose paths can make a difference. For example, we show that a ring with parallel links is stable for all greedy scheduling protocols if paths are chosen intelligently, whereas this is not the case if the adversary specifies the paths.	admissible heuristic;adversary (cryptography);computation;control theory;end-to-end principle;function overloading;greedy algorithm;network congestion;network packet;online and offline;packet switching;polynomial delay;requirement;scheduling (computing);shortest path problem;source routing;time complexity	Matthew Andrews;Antonio Fernández;Ashish Goel;Lisa Zhang	2005	J.

This requires flexible solutions for design and implementation of field devices. The easy implementation of device functions for an early test in a system can be performed by introducing generalized approaches. The Generic Device, based on standard IT hard- and software, is an approach addressing this flexibility. The availability of low-price controller boards with Ethernet connection and general purpose I/O connectors, e.g. ARM based systems like Raspberry Pi, supports this idea. The paper analyses and discusses several alternatives for implementation of a Generic Device based on different hardware solutions.

In this paper, we propose a subset simulation (SS) framework that efficiently and accurately finds the worst case workload and the failure probability covering various workloads. In the proposed method, workloads that yield worst aged delay are efficiently generated by the NBTI-aware Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Through numerical experiments using benchmark circuits, the proposed method achieves up to 36 times speedup compared to the naive Monte Carlo method. From the result of the SS, feasible workload that gives worst aged delay is obtained.	benchmark (computing);best, worst and average case;elegant degradation;experiment;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo method;negative-bias temperature instability;numerical analysis;speedup;static timing analysis;subset simulation	Shumpei Morita;Song Bian;Michihiro Shintani;Masayuki Hiromoto;Takashi Sato	2018	2018 23rd Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)	10.1109/ASPDAC.2018.8297393	real-time computing;critical path method;workload;subset simulation;speedup;computer science;monte carlo method;markov chain monte carlo;mnist database;static timing analysis	EDA	-3.8700387543441486	61.641826823521775	194592

To load this network with data at such a speed, a host-network interfaee is required. Such art interfaee must both move data at the speed of the network and convert it between the network format (ATM cells) and a format useful to the host (e.g. transport level packets). A novel architecture for such an interface, which combines high speed with a high degree of flexibility, is described. The interfaee consists of one embedded controller per direction to decide where data should be fetched from and stored, and dedicated hardware to effect the moving and formatting of data. Alternative memory architectures are proposed, the choice between them being dependent on the type of bus in the host. The flexible design will allow experimentation with a variety of scheduling and segmentationheass embly rdgorithms, and with new transport protocols.	atm turbo;embedded controller;embedded system;megabit;memory architecture;network interface;network switch;scheduling (computing)	Bruce S.

Typical applications on a mobile device such as web browsing and text editing tend to have rather static image content; each frame hardly changes from the previous one. Efficiently detecting and handling no-motion scenarios is thus critical to extend the battery life. This paper focuses on image change detection. We propose to use checksum to detect image changes. Specifically, CRC hardware is used to optimize the power consumption of 1) refresh of a local display and 2) data compression for wireless remote display. Compared with a traditional, pixel-by-pixel comparison approach, using checksum for image change detection is not only fast, but also reduces accesses to the frame buffer, resulting in significant power savings. We have built a FPGA prototype to verify that CRC can capture image changes well enough to ensure a “visually lossless” quality.	checksum;code;cyclic redundancy check;data compression;dynamic random-access memory;entity–relationship model;field-programmable gate array;framebuffer;function prototype;hash function;lossless compression;mobile device;pixel;sensor;text editor	Kyungtae Han;Zhen Fang;Paul Diefenbaugh;Richard Forand;Ravi R.

Various techniques, such as shielding and coding, etc., have been proposed to minimize this delay. This paper proposes a set of coding schemes (scheme 1, 2 and 3) to reduce the delay by incorporating spatial and temporal redundancy independently as well as combined. SPICE simulations are carried out for interconnect lines of different dimensions at various technology nodes (180, 130, 90 and 65 nm). Experimental results indicate that the proposed coding scheme-2 eliminates the crosstalk classes 4, 5 and 6, and reduces the delay by about 33-67% for 2, 5 and 10 mm lengthinterconnects.	bus encoding;computer programming;crosstalk;electrical connection;propagation delay;spice;simulation;software propagation;very-large-scale integration	K.

These interconnection networks , however, realize only a subset of all possible input-output permutations in a non-blocking fashion. The non-blocking property of these networks is an extensively studied area in interconnection network theory fleld and efficient algorithms exist to check if any given permutation is passable by such networks without blocking. One of the most common interconnection network structures is the Inverse Omega Network and is topologically equivalent to the Reverse Banyan Network. In this paper we show how to check the passability by the Inverse Omega network of any given connection set and list some of the very general patterns passable by this network. We also show that the concentmte operation passable by the Inverse Omega network is just a special case of the more general alternate sequence operation that we show as being passable.

Ef-cient general simulations on such machines of algorithms designed for fully reliable PRAMs are developed. The PRAM we work with is the Concurrent-Read Concurrent-Write (CRCW) variant. Two possible settings for error occurrence are considered: the errors may be either static (once a memory cell is checked to be operational it remains so during the computation) or dynamic (a potentially faulty cell may crash at any time, the total number of such cells being bounded). A simulation consists of two phases: memory formatting and the proper part done in a step-by-step way. For each error setting (static or dynamic), two simulations are presented: one with a O(1)-time per-step cost, the other with a O(log n)-time per-step cost. The other parameters of these simulations (number of processors, memory size, formatting time) are shown in table 1 in section 6. The simulations are randomized and Monte Carlo: they always operate within the given time bounds, and are guaranteed to be correct with a large probability.	central processing unit;computation;crash (computing);memory cell (binary);mereology;monte carlo method;parallel random-access machine;randomized algorithm;shared memory;simulation	Bogdan S.

On the other hand, scalable networks with very good topological properties are often impossible to build because of their prohibitively high VLSI (e.g., wiring) complexity. Such a network is the generalized hypercube (GH). The GH supports full-connectivity of all its nodes in each dimension and is characterized by outstanding topological properties. Also, low-dimensional GHs have very large bisection widths. We propose here a new class of scalable interprocessor connections, namely HOWs (Highly-Overlapping Windows), capable of lower complexity than GHs and comparable performance. HOWs are obtained from GHs by uniformly removing edges to produce feasible systems of lower wiring complexity. Resulting systems contain numerous highly-overlapping GHs of smaller size. Also, the classical GH belongs to this new class of interconnections. We analyze the communications capabilities of 2-D HOWs and demonstrate that in practical cases they perform much better than binary hypercubes for important communications patterns. They also perform comparably to GHs. We develop algorithms for one-to-one unicasting, one-to-all broadcasting, all-to-all broadcasting, one-to-all personalized, and all-to-all personalized communications, under various communications models.	algorithm;communications protocol;computer;distributed shared memory;globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals;grid network;list of code lyoko episodes;microsoft windows;one-to-one (data model);personalization;scalability;supercomputer;unicast;very-large-scale integration;wiring	Qian Wang;Sotirios G.

88af5e55c44432642f5c713b263e84ce85deacea	power-efficient routing of spatial error tolerant dynamic 3d networks		This research assesses optimal low-power communication between devices in dynamic networks, considering delay and disruption tolerance. Given each device's motion and power output, it is possible to determine a path requiring the least power for communication, power usage, and time step after spatially correlated errors in disruption zones of networks. This work gives the proof of determining disruption zones in 3D networks in polynomial time (although an infinite number of potential regions exist) and can be used to analyze the least power path for multiple time steps. A modular tool implemented in Java allows users to trade-off message urgency and delay. Hundreds of simulations confirm such tools are necessary because cases with better power at the expense of delay can be identified and addressed. Since power is imperative in today's mobile systems, this problem is vital in dynamic networks. This can have huge ramifications in environments such as war zones due to enemy jamming, deep space satellite communications, smart automobile and road networks, or meteorological settings in hurricane mapping.	3d computer graphics;3d television;communications satellite;denial-of-service attack;imperative programming;java;low-power broadcasting;maximum power transfer theorem;network packet;packet switching;radio jamming;routing;simulation;time complexity	Rucha M.

Such a Wake-Up-Receiver (WuRx) unit senses the medium and switches on the communication interfaces in case of an external request. Otherwise, all system components for the network communication are completely switched off. Especially in the domain of resource-limited and embedded devices, WuRx technologies enable novel communication paradigms. But on the application layer, not all scenarios allow the efficient usage of such WuRx technologies. Dependent on environmental parameters, technological limitations and conceptual requirements, different strategies are necessary to ensure energy-efficient system operation. In this article, we present a critical analysis of the capabilities and the conceptual limitations of WuRx approaches. Therefore, we identify critical parameters for WuRx concepts, which limit the efficiency in real world scenarios. Our goal is to classify sufficient fields of application. Furthermore we evaluate the influences of these parameters on the system behaviour. In addition, we introduce heterogeneous energy harvesting approaches as an efficient way for the system optimisation. The proposed technologies are capable to be integrated into small-sized wireless sensor platforms and prolong the system uptime significantly. The presented simulation results are focusing on actual smart metering scenarios and wireless sensor networks. Based on these measurements, we were able to apply further optimisation steps within the system configuration on the application layer. In this context, we focus on applicationspecific key issues, like the trade-off between measurement quality and quantity, the usage of data buffering approaches and QoS capabilities.	autonomous robot;critical system;embedded system;gnu nano;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;network switch;network topology;quality of service;requirement;routing;simulation;smart meter;system configuration;system integration;topology optimization;transceiver;uptime	Matthias Vodel;Mirko Caspar;Wolfram Hardt	2012	JNW	10.4304/jnw.7.1.126-134	embedded system;routing;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous communication;efficient energy use;computer security;energy harvesting;computer network	Mobile	8.753029043853811	73.0609938320293	196999

In particular, by combining comparably low power CMOS cameras and low power wireless sensor nodes, and implementing on board compression and image analysis techniques, we can greatly enhance the application of dense wireless sensor networks to phenomena that are most readily observed in the optical domain.   In this demonstration we will introduce Cyclops. Cyclops (see Figure 1) is a joint project between Agilent Technology and the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS). It is a low power CMOS imager with a local frame grabber and local computation. It behaves like a sensor for a host and can do local computation and inference, acting as a more capable sensor. Inference can be based on a color histogram, statistical characteristics of images, or a hypothesis such as the existence of motion or a specific template in the scene. The demonstration will showcase the functionality of the first generation of Cyclops, including low duty cycle image capture and participation in a sensor network via an attached Crossbow Mica2.  Performance studies will also be presented, along with outstanding challenges and foreseeable opportunities.	cmos;color histogram;computation;cromemco cyclops;duty cycle;embedded system;frame grabber;image analysis;image sensor	Mohammad H.

However, the cost of these mechanisms can become prohibitive for cheaper memories, which have higher error rates. Instead of completely repairing faulty cells, this paper introduces new approximate memory repair mechanisms that only partially repair both CMOS DRAMs and STT-MRAMs. By combining redundant repair with unequal protection, such as skewing the limited spare elements available for repairing faults towards the k most significant bits, and a hybrid bit-shuffling and redundant repair scheme, the new mechanisms maintain excellent output quality while substantially reducing the cost of the repair mechanism, particularly for increasingly important cluster faults.	approximation algorithm;cmos;elegant degradation;ibm notes;image compression;most significant bit;overhead (computing);random-access memory;spin;semiconductor research corporation	Qianqian Fan;Sachin S.

Recent research focuses on their itnplementation costs, as well as the performance to enhance their practical applications. This paper proposes the Recover-x adaptive routing, which limits escape message candidates in a blocked or deadlocked conjiguration. This limitation simplifies the routing logic and offers a chance to balance the usage between adaptive and tion-adaptive channels. The cost and performance of four wormhole routers based on Verilog-HDL designs were compared. Synthesis results for the chosen gate array technology show that the Recover-x router attains a fast operating speed and lowlatency, with high-bandwidth communication performance.	algorithm;gate array;hardware description language;network performance;router (computing);routing;verilog	Tsutomu Yoshinaga;Masaya Hayashi;Maki Horita;Sayuri Nakamura;Kanemitsu Ootsu;Takanobu Baba	2000		10.1109/ICPADS.2000.857708	policy-based routing;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;parallel computing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;adaptive system;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;hardware description language;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Arch	2.217398608248687	63.6926775279162	197999

A multicast knockout principle, an extension of the generalized knockout principle, is applied in constructing the MOBAS in order to reduce the hardware complexity (e.g., the number of switch elements and interconnection wires) by almost one order of magnitude. In the proposed switch architecture, four major functions of designing a multicast switch: cell replication, cell routing, cell contention resolution, and cell addressing, are all performed distributively so that a large switch size is achievable. The architecture of the MOBAS has a regular and uniform structure and, thus, has the advantages of: (1) easy expansion due to the modular structure, (2) high integration density for VLSI implementation, (3) relaxed synchronization for data and clock signals, and (4) building the center switch fabric (i.e., the multicast grouping network) with a single type of chip. A two-stage structure of the multicast output buffered ATM switch (MOBAS) is described. The performance of the switch fabric in cell loss probability is analyzed, and the numerical results are shown. The authors show that a switch designed to meet the performance requirement for unicast calls will also satisfy multicast calls' performance. A 16/spl times/16 ATM crosspoint switch chip based on the proposed architecture has been implemented using CMOS 2-/spl mu/m technology and tested to operate correctly. >	atm turbo;multicast	H.

Network interface processing requires support for the following characteristics: a large volume of frame data, frequently accessed frame metadata, and high frame rate processing. This paper proposes three mechanisms to improve programmable network interface efficiency. First, a partitioned memory organization enables low-latency access to control data and high-bandwidth access to frame contents from a high-capacity memory. Second, a distributed task-queue mechanism enables parallelization of frame processing across many low-frequency cores, while using software to maintain total frame ordering. Finally, the addition of two new atomic read-modify-write instructions reduces frame ordering overheads by 50%. Combining these hardware and software mechanisms enables a network interface card to saturate a full-duplex 10 Gb/s Ethernet link by utilizing 6 processor cores and 4 banks of on-chip SRAM operating at 166 MHz, along with external 500 MHz GDDR SDRAM.	duplex (telecommunications);flash memory;gddr sdram;gigabit;gigabyte;memory organisation;network interface controller;parallel computing;read-modify-write;static random-access memory	Paul Willmann;Hyong-youb Kim;Scott Rixner;Vijay S.
