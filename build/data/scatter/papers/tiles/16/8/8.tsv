The approximating system can be analyzed analytically to obtain mean performance measures such as expected delay. We show through a formal argument that the approximation works well when the overall utilization of the system @r is small. Based on simulation experiments, we develop a modified version of the approximation that is accurate for a wide range of @r. Finally, we extend the approximation to more complex queueing scenarios, such as the low-latency-queueing discipline and systems with more than 2 classes.	approximation;fair queuing;network scheduler;weighted fair queueing	John F.

Historically this has led to needs and new developments within design and control of production and supply systems, on individual plant level as well as on portfolio level. These developments include applications within adaptive control, multivariable control, portfolio balancing control and load planning systems. In future the needs for more detailed utilization of plant and system knowledge will grow further due to increased market and technology complexity. Improved utilization of hybrid knowledge, i.e. modeling on different timescales and modeling with diverse fidelity, contains large potential improvements in the design phase as well as in the operational phase. These challenges should be taken up in research and eventually be applied commercially.		Tommy Moelbak	2016	Eur. J.

d05d8515953857cf3375211281838ec44fee669e	adaptive blockchain-based electric vehicle participation scheme in smart grid platform		The electric vehicle (EV) charging scheme can reduce the power generation costs and improve the smart grid resilience. However, the huge penetrations of EVs can impact the voltage stability and operating costs. In this paper, a novel EV participation charging scheme is proposed for a decentralized blockchain-enabled smart grid system. Our objectives are to minimize the power fluctuation level in the grid network and the overall charging cost for EV users. We first formulate the power fluctuation level problem of the smart grid system that take into accounts of EV battery capacities, charging rates, and EV users charging behavior. And then, we propose a novel adaptive blockchain-based electric vehicle participation (AdBEV) scheme that uses the Iceberg order execution algorithm to obtain an improved EV charging and discharging schedule. The simulation results show the proposed scheme outperforms the scheme that applying genetic algorithm approach in term of lowering the power fluctuation level and overall charging costs.	bitcoin;extended validation certificate;genetic algorithm;grid network;quantum fluctuation;simulation	Chao Qun Liu;Kok Keong Chai;Xiaoshuai Zhang;Eng Tseng Lau;Yue Chen	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2835309	electricity generation;battery (electricity);genetic algorithm;smart grid;distributed computing;computer science;voltage;schedule;electric vehicle;grid network;electrical engineering	HPC	3.3779893205896263	4.841574860990669	49032

Based on the traditional storage assignment policies which are focused on the storage frequency, we take workload balance into consideration and propose two new storage assignment policies for the automated warehouse. By analyzing and calculating, it is discovered that new storage assignment policy can effectively reduce roadway congestion, improve the warehouse workload balance and the operation efficiency.	accessibility;logistics;network congestion	Jinwen Cai;Xiang'an Kuang;Shaohua Song;Qilan Zhao	2016	2016 International Conference on Logistics, Informatics and Service Sciences (LISS)	10.1109/LISS.2016.7854514	real-time computing;operations management;database;business	HPC	6.608896567944891	4.709122091074565	49228

Traditionally formulated as an integer program, this problem is well known to be a very difficult one, only solvable by means of heuristic methods. This paper addresses the specific problem of inferring new design rules that can reduce the cost of the network, or reduce the message delay below some acceptable threshold. More specifically, it extends a recent approach using a rule-based system in order to prevent the risk of combinatorial explosion and to reduce the search space of feasible network topologies. This extension essentially implements an efficient inductive learning algorithm leading to the refinement of existing rules and to the discovery of new rules from examples, defined as network topologies satisfying a given reliability constraint. The contribution of this paper is the integration of learning capabilities into topological optimization of computer networks. Computational results confirm the efficiency of the discovered rules.	algorithm;computation;decision problem;heuristic;inductive reasoning;integer programming;machine learning;mathematical optimization;network topology;refinement (computing);rule-based system	Samuel Pierre	1998	IEEE Trans.

A linear activity is one tha progresses along a path (non-stationary), as it does it complete and another activity can proceed. Tradition scheduling methods model linear activities as havin constant production rates. Linear scheduling allows a activity to be modeled as a line with dimensions of tim and location. The slope of the line at any point represe the planned productivity rate of the activity. Predicting th productivity of linear activities is a scheduler's mos difficult task. Simulation can be used to give planne greater insight into the factors that influence an activity production rate.	linear scheduling method;scheduling (computing);simulation;stationary process	David J.

This class includes, for example, the famous Fibonacci word f = 01001010 · · · , the fixed point of the morphism 0 → 01 and 1 → 0. We then recover many results about the Fibonacci word from the literature (and improve some of them), such as assertions about the occurrences in f of squares, cubes, palindromes, and so forth. 1 Decidability As is well-known, the logical theory Th(N,+), sometimes called Presburger arithmetic, is decidable [43, 44]. Büchi [10] showed that if we add the function Vk(n) = k , for some fixed integer k ≥ 2, where e = max{i : k |n}, then the resulting theory is still decidable. This theory is powerful enough to define finite automata; for a survey, see [9]. As a consequence, we have the following theorem (see, e.g., [50]): Theorem 1. There is an algorithm that, given a proposition phrased using only the universal and existential quantifiers, indexing into one or more k-automatic sequences, addition, subtraction, logical operations, and comparisons, will decide the truth of that proposition. Here, by a k-automatic sequence, we mean a sequence a computed by deterministic finite automaton with output (DFAO) M = (Q,Σk,∆, δ, q0, κ). Here Σk := {0, 1, . . . , k− 1} is the input alphabet, ∆ is the output alphabet, and outputs are associated with the states given by the map κ : Q → ∆ in the following manner: if (n)k denotes the canonical expansion of n in base k, then a[n] = κ(δ(q0, (n)k)).

Power systems aim at lowering operational costs, requiring an adequate energy resources management. In this context, load consumption management plays an important role, being necessary to use optimization strategies to adjust the consumption to the supply profile. These optimization strategies can be integrated in demand response programs. The control of the energy consumption of an intelligent house has the objective of optimizing the load consumption. This paper presents a genetic algorithm approach to manage the consumption of a residential house making use of a SCADA system developed by the authors. Consumption management is done reducing or curtailing loads to keep the power consumption in, or below, a specified energy consumption limit. This limit is determined according to the consumer strategy and taking into account the renewable based micro generation, energy price, supplier solicitations, and consumers' preferences. The proposed approach is compared with a mixed integer non-linear approach.	genetic algorithm;home automation;ibm power systems;load management;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;software release life cycle;testbed	Filipe Fernandes;Tiago Sousa;Marco R.

The EPI represents a ratio between energy spent [kWh] per unit of product, area, volume, or other quantity directly related to production. The EPI values are supposed to be collected in a centralized data system enabling benchmarking activity at national level. One of the major barriers for this process is related to ethical and legal issues impeding disclosure of proprietary information. The tedious normalization process due mainly to volatile and un-reliable reference value is another major barrier for benchmarking process. As a result the accuracy of benchmarking IS&P represents always a challenge for governments and for corporations implementing ISO 50001. The paper proposes a new concept of using of Mathematical Model Benchmarking (MMB). The unitless indicator i.e. Benchmark Energy Factor (BEF) overcomes the current barriers. The paper presents the basics of MMB and basic use of BEF for a case study inspired from real life. The MMB concept can be used by any IS&P owner enabling easy implementation of ISO 50001. BEF indicator enables a reliable rating system model describing energetic efficiency of any IS&P and can be used by Utilities (for their DSM programs), NRCAN or U.S. Department of Energy - Energy-Star Certification for Plants Program replacing existent inefficient benchmarking practice. Canadian Standard Association is currently preparing Guidelines of benchmarking specific IS&P by using MMB concept.	benchmark (computing);bibliothèque des ecoles françaises d'athènes et de rome;centralized computing;data system;mathematical model;real life;sports rating system;volatile memory	Constantin D.

This approach can be used for reducing the peak power exchange between the grid and a cluster of units in the same feeder in price-driven demand response applications. Preliminary simulations prove that the proposed coordination scheme for DMPC succeeds in coordinating flexible DER unit, achieving significant peak shaving when required. The rationale of this approach consists in coordinating independent units equipped with local MPC controller via simple information passing and hiding in the local controllers the units' dynamics.	algorithm;design rationale;downtime;fairness measure;load management;scalability;simulation;system integration	Giuseppe Tommaso Costanzo;Oliver Gehrke;Daniel Esteban Morales Bondy;Fabrizio Sossan;Henrik W.

Conventionally, many researchers make two major assumptions when the production system modeling is conducted: 1) the first machine is never starved, and 2) the last machine is never blocked. These assumptions actually separate the production system from the material handling system. However, the production system is practically coupled with the material handling system due to the integrated nature of these two systems. In this paper, the above two crucial assumptions are relaxed and a new modeling method for the production system coupled with a material handling system is introduced. The algorithm derived is based on the fixed-point theory and the obstructions of modeling this coupled system are discussed. The results from numerical studies indicate that the proposed modeling method could effectively describe the coupled system performance.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;boundary case;emoticon;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point arithmetic;fixed-point theorem;in the beginning... was the command line;iteration;lagrangian relaxation;loop invariant;material handling;numerical analysis;performance;production system (computer science);pseudocode;series-parallel graph;simulation;systems engineering;systems modeling;the matrix;time complexity	Zhichao Zhou;Lin Li;Jie Lin	2014	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2013.2292569	computer science;artificial intelligence;production system;fixed-point arithmetic	Robotics	9.388767801060784	5.080223111738972	51908

The concept is intended to minimize, if not eliminate, the battery in the SHEV without resorting to full-range proportional control of the engine and generator. An initial optimization study reported for a mid-size SHEV showed that a 4.5-kWh lithium-ion battery pack was still required. In this paper, a sports-car-class SHEV was studied, where the challenge is to reduce the size of the ESS even more because the available space allocation is only one fourth that of the mid-size vehicle. In this paper, a controller is developed, which allows a hybridized SHEV to be realized with a light ESS. The controller includes a duty-cycling feature that manages the engine performance in multiple efficient regions and a bandwidth-limited (BWL) proportional controller feature that limits low-bandwidth battery current. The performance of the controller has been validated for a SHEV powertrain model with an 80-  $\text{V}_{\mathrm{dc}}$ 1.125-kWh battery, plus an 80-  $\text{V}_{\mathrm{dc}}$ 46.4-F ultracapacitor module using a customized Autonomie vehicle model. The results show that the combined FE of the new design is increased by 13%, compared with the corresponding FE in the equivalent conventional vehicle. Additional FE improvement is possible by reducing the engine size further to reflect the average power demand imposed by real drive cycles.	algorithm;computer data storage;duty cycle;finite-state machine;full-range speaker;mathematical optimization;maximum flow problem;subaru transcare;system on a chip	Masood Shahverdi;Michael S.

In many real systems, the effective processing rate often increases as the queue builds (by working faster or adding resources) and decreases as the queue empties (by working slower or shedding resources). Whether planned as part of the production control management, or unplanned as human nature, the effect is often causing the corresponding queueing systems to be more stable than predicted by simple queueing models. Discrete Event Simulation models can easily handle this complexity. This case study demonstrates the basics of variable rate processing, and illustrates its effective use in capacity simulation models at Mimeo.com.	entity;queueing theory;simulation	Paul D.

2ed4943608fd9b079c6413eef2493c54cbd042b9	a systems approach to quantifying the value of power generation and energy storage technologies in future electricity networks	technology value;future electricity system;carbon capture and storage;energy storage;power system modeling;unit commitment;intermittent renewables	A new approach is required to determine a technology's value to the power systems of the 21st century. Conventional cost-based metrics are incapable of accounting for the indirect system costs associated with intermittent electricity generation, in addition to environmental and security constraints. In this work, we formalise a new concept for power generation and storage technology valuation which explicitly accounts for system conditions, integration challenges, and the level of technology penetration. The centrepiece of the System Value (SV) concept is a whole electricity systems model on a national scale, which simultaneously determines the ideal power system design and unit-wise operational strategy. It brings typical Process Systems Engineering thinking into the analysis of power systems. The model formulation is a mixed-integer linear optimisation and can be understood as hybrid between a generation expansion and a unit commitment model. We present an analysis of the future UK electricity system and investigate the SV of Carbon Capture and Storage equipped power plants (CCS), onshore wind power plants, and grid-level energy storage capacity. We show how the availability of different low-carbon technologies impact the optimal capacity mix and generation patterns. We find that the SV in the year 2035 of grid-level energy storage is an order of magnitude greater than that of CCS and wind power plants. However, CCS and wind capacity provide a more consistent value to the system as their level of deployment increases.

Simulation is often the only available means for analyzing a sequence of such lengths. It is sometimes possible to obtain meaningful estimates for the limiting average delay indirectly, that is, without measuring lengths of individual passage-time intervals. For general time-average limits of a sequence of delays, however, it is necessary to measure individual lengths and combine them to form point and interval estimates. We consider sequences of delays determined by marking changes of the net and use a sequence of random vectors, called start vectors, to provide the link between the starts and terminations of individual passage-time intervals. This method of start vectors for measuring delays avoids the need for additional places and transitions to """"tag"""" entities in the system. We show that whenever the marking process of a stochastic Petri net has a recurrent single-state, the sample paths of any sequence of delays can be decomposed into one-dependent, identically distributed cycles. We then show that an extension of the regenerative method for analysis of simulation output can be used to obtain meaningful point estimates and confidence intervals for time-average limits. This estimation procedure is valid not only when there are no ongoing passage times at any regeneration point but, unlike previous methods, also when the sequence of delays does not inherit regenerative structure. Application of these methods to simulation of a manufacturing flow-line with a shunt bank is discussed."""	petri net	Peter J. Haas;Gerald S.

3e405ca476bded55be5873ccb7268fed7197b527	using health information to reconfigure platform operation, adjust mission goals and extend the life of the system.		One of the primary advantages of having prognostic information about a platform is the ability to adapt operation and mission planning to compensate for the impending reduced capability. In addition, information about the operating ranges and mission requirements can be used to change the point in time the fault will occur. For example, a change in how the load on a power system is distributed may extend the point a fault will occur and therefore, provide additional mission time and/or life of the power system. Thus, there is a need to develop a unified approach to apply health information to operating conditions and mission planning to minimize the impact of the impending fault as well as use the operating limits and mission parameters to extend the life of the failing components or system to maximize the life of the platform and range of the mission. This paper analyzes and compares different approaches to applying health information to operation reconfiguration, mission planning and life extension. The weaknesses and strengths of these approaches are analyzed and a unified approach is proposed for classifying and analyzing health integration schemes for command and control structures. In addition, several health integration examples, from publicly available literature, are provided using the proposed classification and analysis approach to demonstrate its range and value.	control flow;control system;failure;recommender system;requirement	James D.

Among many enabling technologies, the latest research results from both the power and energy community and computational intelligence (CI) community have demonstrated that CI research could provide key technical innovations into this challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis approach based on both trajectory and frequency domain information integrated with evolutionary algorithm to achieve the optimal control of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) based wind generation. Instead of optimizing all the control parameters, our key idea is to use the sensitivity analysis to first identify the critical parameters, the unified dominate control parameters (UDCP), to reduce the optimization complexity. Based on such selected parameters, we then use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the optimal values to achieve the control objective. Simulation analysis and comparative studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	computation;computational intelligence;evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimal control;particle swarm optimization;simulation	Yufei Tang;Ping Ju;Haibo He;Chuan Qin;Feng Wu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2013.2237795	control engineering;multi-swarm optimization;simulation;optimal control;computer science;engineering;control theory;mathematics;sensitivity analysis;statistics;evolutionary computation	Visualization	4.2852009729403076	7.411262681208642	53014

Allen's interval algebra is a calculus for temporal reasoning that was introduced in 1983. Reasoning with qualitative time in Allen's full interval algebra is NP-complete. Research since 1995 identified maximal tractable subclasses of this algebra via exhaustive computer search and also other ad-hoc methods. In 2003, the full classification of complexity for satisfiability problems over constraints in Allen's interval algebra was established algebraically. We review temporal reasoning concepts including a method for deciding tractability of temporal constraint satisfaction problems based on the theory of algebraic closure operators for constraints. Graph-based temporal representations such as interval and sequence graphs are discussed. We also propose novel research for scheduling algorithms based on the Fishburn-Shepp inequality for posets.

We develop Demand Response Management (DRM) plans that clearly spell out the maximum duration as well as maximum severity of inconvenience. We model the air conditioner as a power throttling device and for any given DRM plan we study the impact of increasing the number of power states on the resulting peak load reduction. Through simulations, we find out that adding just one additional state to the basic ON/OFF model, which can throttle power to 50% of the rated air conditioner power, can result in significant amount of peak reduction. However, the peak load that can be reduced is diminishing with the increase in number of states. Furthermore, we also observe the impact of inconvenience duration and inconvenience severity in terms of peak load reduction. These observations can serve as useful guidelines for developing appropriate DRM plans.	algorithm;load profile;simulation	Yawar Ismail Khalid;Naveed Ul Hassan;Chau Yuen;Shisheng Huang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007721	embedded system;atmospheric model;simulation;base load power plant;load balancing;air conditioning;engineering;peak demand;smart grid;thermostat	HPC	3.86301583011023	6.18918132602553	53709
7dc1fd25fd6aafece94270cd0b3c779284b6ee6f	distributed demand peak reduction with non-cooperative players and minimal communication		Demand response technology offers the exciting potential to reduce peak energy demand, electricity infrastructure expenditure, and household electricity bills. In this paper, a pricing mechanism that relies on non-cooperative heterogeneous loads knowledgeable of future energy consumption—such as electric vehicles—transferring minimal amounts of information to achieve peak demand response in a distributed fashion, whilst maintaining the privacy of the players. The existence of a Nash equilibrium is proven, as well as convergence conditions proving uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium and the stability of an “Iterated Synchronous Best Response Algorithm.” The price of anarchy (PoA) is proven to approach 1 as the number of homogeneous players approaches infinity, indicating there is no advantage to cooperation for a large number of similar players. Finally, simulation results are presented which suggest that the PoA for a system with heterogeneous players is likely to be proportional to the spread of energy consumption constraints.		Lyle D.

Two load modelling methodologies, time independent and time varying, are presented and applied to a single primary substation and then extended to the ENWL area. For the latter, the results considering the time-varying model, purely residential load, and 3% voltage reduction during a winter day show that it could be possible to achieve an aggregated peak reduction exceeding 150 MW (>3%). Although the two load models have shown strong agreement the latter is a more accurate alternative when demand response throughout the day is of particular interest.	microwave;reduction (complexity);traction substation	Andrea Ballanti;Luis F.

The aim is determining the optimal operating strategy for energy storage, to fulfil a time-varying energy demand and operational constraints while achieving a tradeoff betweenmicrogrid running costs and energy storage system life. Themicrogrid is composed by various renewable power production plants, storage devices and controllable loads, and has the ability to increase energy efficiency and reduce costs for energy purchasing from the main grid. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization problem. The optimization is aimed at minimizing the overall cost function of the systemwhile satisfying the customer demand and safety of the electrical network. A case study of an existing microgrid is investigated: the microgrid consists of a photovoltaic and a hydroelectric power plant, a battery storage, an office building and an industrial facility. The optimization problem is solved in an efficient way by using commercial software. Simulation results show the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach to satisfy the load and reduce total costs.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;commercial software;computer data storage;energy level;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;microgrid;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;purchasing;qr decomposition;simulation;state of charge	Renato De Leone;A.

As controllable loads, they form an attractive target for active demand response, by modulating, delaying or accelerating the charging of the vehicles. As such, this can be used to balance power from renewables, to shave peaks or to spread consumption more evenly, or to minimise energy costs. Such control actions need to take dynamically varying constraints into account, concerning arrivals and departure times, grid capacity, power consumption, green electricity generation, etc. Hence a multi-objective optimisation problem needs to be solved, in order to optimise for the different criteria. By incorporating predicted trends for loads, better results can be obtained than when only considering the current situation. Agent-based decentralised and hierarchic coordination mechanisms provide such functionality in a scalable yet robust way. Modular implementation allows flexibility.	mathematical optimization;robustness (computer science);scalability	Geert Deconinck	2011	2011 2nd IEEE PES International Conference and Exhibition on Innovative Smart Grid Technologies	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2011.6162839	control engineering;simulation;engineering;operations management	Robotics	2.277072876403137	5.043096417137498	54012

It aims to enable regionally or virtually restricted trading of ancillary services, which enhances the position of the balance group responsible party beyond that of simple accounting. Furthermore, it makes local market participants somewhat more independent from the transmission grid operator, but at the same time provides incentives for investments in distributed generation technologies. A wider spread of these technologies can help to save CO 2 emissions, while at the same time a part of them can also be used to counter the fluctuations of energy from volatile renewable sources, such as wind and solar power. Because of their relatively high margins and small share in total production, ancillary services are well-suited for a remuneration scheme. Participants in the auction are, thus, private households, which impose specific design characteristics on the auction. Most importantly, it needs to be transparent and easy to understand, as homeowners will typically not have the insights of a professional trader as well as lack a similar position and motivation. Also, the confinement to a single balance group, i.e. a local market, means that especially in the beginning of the trading only a small number of bidders can be expected. Therefore, competition will initially be limited, so that the auction design needs to be adapted accordingly. In order to test the performance of the proposed auction market design under varying information policies, a simple agent-based simulation program has been developed. We find that the theoretical predictions hold and that competition quickly leads to price convergence. In recent years ancillary services in electricity markets and especially such providing reserve energy have received increasing attention. This is due to several facts. First of all, the increase of the share of unpredictably fluctuating renewable energy in total energy production has led to a higher demand for reserve capacities to buffer those fluctuations. Secondly, new technological and societal developments have started to offer new ways of meeting this demand. Smaller and larger consumers can offer some of their loads and capacities to external control or even offer load adjustments at certain times of the day themselves. They can further participate in virtual power plants (VPPs) to sell power produced in large numbers of small-scale, distributed home devices, such as micro combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plants …	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;in the beginning... was the command line;traders	Christiane Rosen;Reinhard Madlener	2013	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2013.05.022	spectrum auction;industrial organization;eauction;combinatorial auction;economics;marketing;microeconomics;distributed generation;auction theory;commerce;forward auction	AI	0.9879517279824772	4.517775959581039	54262
266761883c28077e45e1503ba07b3537399cb4ce	multi-dimensional network security game: how do attacker and defender battle on parallel targets?		In this paper, we consider a new network security game wherein an attacker and a defender are battling over “multiple” targets. This type of game is appropriate to model many current network security conflicts such as Internet phishing, mobile malware or network intrusions. In such attacks, the attacker and the defender need to decide how to allocate resources on each target so as to maximize their utilities within their resource limits. We model such a multidimensional network security game as a constrained nonzero sum game. Two security breaching models, the product-form and the proportion-form, are considered. For each breaching model, we prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) based on Rosen's theorem and propose efficient algorithms to find the NE when the games are strictly concave. Furthermore, we show the existence of multiple NEs in the product-form breaching model when the strict concavity does not hold. Our study sheds light on the strategic behaviors of the attacker and the defender, in particular, on how they allocate resources to the targets which have different weights, and how their utilities as well as strategies are influenced by the resource constraints.	algorithm;concave function;constraint (mathematics);emoticon;mobile malware;multidimensional network;nash equilibrium;network security;phishing	Yuedong Xu;John C.

Our solution requires no interaction with home users: in particular, it does not require them to express their energy demand in advance.

Specifically we focus on systems whose dynamics is characterised by the parallel execution of a number of active jobs and such that the termination of an active job causes the remaining active jobs to be restarted from scratch (preemptive restart policy) or deactivated and can lead to the activation of new jobs. In such a framework, the state-space can be partitioned into disjoint sets (called macrostates). Each macrostate represents the parallel execution of the (currently) active jobs and a transition to another macrostate corresponds to termination of one of the active job. Models of this kind are subject to the phenomenon of state space explosion, to an extent which is proportional both to the level of concurrency (i.e., the number of active jobs in a macrostate) and to the dimension of the phase-type timing (i.e., the number of phases used to model jobs’ execution). Although techniques exist that allow for handling the infinitesimal generator matrix of such models in a memory efficient manner (e.g., in terms of Kronecker expressions), classical Markovian analysis remains hindered by the memory requirements for storing the vector of the steady-state or transient probabilities. In this paper we show that a Markov chain satisfying the above assumptions can be analysed by calculations performed on the (small) matrices describing the durations of the jobs without the explicit storage of the (large) vectors of transient of steady state probabilities.	concurrency (computer science);generator matrix;job stream;markov chain;requirement;state space;steady state	Paolo Ballarini;András Horváth	2009		10.4108/ICST.VALUETOOLS2009.7424	real-time computing;computer science;operations management;distributed computing	Metrics	6.484842091953791	10.563424118950127	56286

Examples of these classes are Angluin's pattern languages, unions of pattern languages by Wright and Shinohara, and classes of languages definable by length-bounded elementary formal systems studied by Shinohara. The present paper employs two distinct bodies of abstract studies in the inductive inference literature to analyze the learnability of these concrete classes. The first approach uses constructive ordinals to bound the number of mind changes. ω denotes the first limit ordinal. An ordinal mind change bound of ω means that identification can be carried out by a learner that after examining some element(s) of the language announces an upper bound on the number of mind changes it will make before converging; a bound of ω ·2 means that the learner reserves the right to revise this upper bound once; a bound of ω ·3 means the learner reserves the right to revise this upper bound twice, and so on. A bound of ω  2 means that identification can be carried out by a learner that announces an upper bound on the number of times it may revise its conjectured upper bound on the number of mind changes. It is shown in the present paper that the ordinal mind change complexity for identification of languages formed by unions of up to n pattern languages is ω n  . It is also shown that this bound is essential. Similar results are also shown to hold for classes definable by length-bounded elementary formal systems with up to n clauses. The second approach employs reductions to study the intrinsic complexity of learnable classes. It is shown that the class of languages formed by taking unions of up to n +1 pattern languages is a strictly more difficult learning problem than the class of languages formed by the union of up to n pattern languages. It is also shown that a similar hierarchy holds for the bound on the number of clauses in the case of languages definable by length-bounded EFS. In addition to building bridges between three distinct areas of inductive inference, viz., learnability of EFS subclasses, ordinal mind change complexity, and intrinsic complexity, this paper also presents results that relate topological properties of learnable classes to that of intrinsic complexity and ordinal mind change complexity. For example, it is shown that a class that is complete according to the reductions for intrinsic complexity has infinite elasticity. Since EFS languages and their learnability results have counterparts in traditional logic programming, the present paper demonstrates the possibility of using abstract results of inductive inference to gain insights into inductive logic programming.

In order to facilitate the IT engineering of these systems, we aim to provide a framework relying on executable modeling and simulation. Our main challenge is to interconnect models of the different business aspects of Smart Grids: physical models of the Energy Management System (EMS), models of the telecommunication infrastructure and behaviour models of the producers and consumers. Our solution complies with Model Driven Engineering (MDE) principles. Indeed, we rely on standards, like fUML for executable modeling and FMI for cosimulation, and model transformations to improve reusability, scalability and consistency. Our framework will be tested on the case study of the EMS of an island power grid mixing battery storage, renewable and fossil energy production.	behavioral modeling;complex systems;dymola;executable uml;fossil;finnish meteorological institute;management system;model-driven engineering;openmodelica;scalability;simulation	David Oudart	2017			smart grid;information technology;distributed computing;computer science	HPC	1.1636366727994685	7.111891252334516	56613
53e1f6a3226446eedce4c193e45e0cfbfb49b6b3	cyclic queuing systems with restricted length queues	queuing system	"""This paper is concerned with an analysis of the stochastic behavior of a system of tandem queuing stations in which capacity restrictions are imposed on the queue lengths. The closed, cyclic systems that we consider are shown to be stochastically equivalent to open systems in which the number of customers is a random variable. A concept of duality is introduced on the basis of the simple observation that the sequential movement of customers through the stages generates a counter-sequential motion of """"holes."""" The implications of the duality relation are discussed at some length. The differential-difference equations for the time-dependent stochastic structure of the system are derived, and the remainder of the paper is devoted to the solution of the equilibrium equations for several special systems. First, we analyze completely systems with only two stages. The well-known results for a finite capacity queue appear as a special case. Next, systems are considered for which the number of customers is so small that there is no possibility of blocking. Then, by a duality argument, an analysis is carried out for systems with a very large number of customers in which the blocking effect dominates. Finally, we compare two extreme systems. In the one system there is no blocking and customers may queue at each stage. The other system has unit capacity at each of the M stages so that the distribution of customers is determined solely by the effect of blocking."""	queueing theory	William J. Gordon;Gordon F.

To coordinate active and reactive power sharing among DERs, conventional droop control method is widely used as a decentralized control scheme. However, sharing powers among the sources based on the units' rated capacities is not an optimal solution in terms of economy and efficiency. In this paper, a new adaptive droop-based control strategy is proposed for AC MGs to optimally share MG load between corresponding units. The mentioned control strategy is developed in two levels. The upper control level is a mixed-objective optimization algorithm that provides optimal set-points for power generations considering system's constraints and goals, while the lower control level is responsible for tracking the reference signals coming from the upper level. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy under different operating scenarios, simulation results in a benchmark MG are also presented.

It is important for power systems to survive after such events and recover the power supply, especially for critical loads (CLs), as soon as possible. In this paper, a control strategy is proposed for electric springs (ESs) to enhance resilience of microgrids with fluctuating renewable resources. First, the feasible operating region of the ES and the power–voltage curve of the bus connected with the ES are derived analytically. Second, according to the derived feasible operating region, a novel control strategy of ES is proposed to regulate the frequency and voltage of microgrids with and without a communication system. The voltages on CLs are considered as a critical constraint for enhancing resilience during extreme natural events. Finally, the method to enhance resilience of microgrids with ES under both the frequency support mode and the voltage support mode are studied. Case studies demonstrate that ESs can enhance the resilience of microgrids with the proposed strategy with and without a communication system after extreme natural events.	control theory;ibm power systems;microgrid;power supply	Liang Liang;Yunhe Hou;David John Hill;Shu Yuen (Ron) Hui	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2609603	control engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;environmental resource management	EDA	1.931016659809787	7.15288515306575	57274

Input flows are modulated by a random external environment. Input flows are ordinary Poisson flows in each state of the environment, with intensities determined by the environment state. Service and switchover durations have exponential laws of probability distribution. A continuous-time Markov chain is introduced to describe the dynamics of the server, the sizes of the queues and the states of the environment. By means of the iterative-dominating method a sufficient condition for ergodicity of the system is obtained for the continuous-time Markov chain. This condition also ensures the existence of a stationary probability distribution of the embedded Markov chain at instants of jumps. The customers sojourn cost during the period of unloading the stable queueing system is chosen as a performance metric. Numerical study in case of two input flows and a class of priority and threshold routing algorithms is conducted. It is demonstrated that in case of light inputs a priority routing rule doesn't seem to be quasi-optimal.	ergodicity;markov chain;modulation;routing	Andrei V.

This paper introduces a simulationbased methodology to evaluate the joint impact of interdependence, component fragilities, and cascading failures in systemic fragility estimates. The proposed strategy uses a graph model of interdependent networks, an enhanced betweenness centrality for cascading failures approximation, and an interdependence model accounting for coupling uncertainty in the simulation of damage propagation for probabilistic performance assessment. This methodology is illustrated through its application to a realistic set of power and water networks subjected to earthquake scenarios and random failures. Test case results reveal two key insights: (1) the intensity of a perturbation influences interdependent systemic fragility by shaping the magnitudes of initial component damage and, sometimes counter-intuitively, the subsequent interdependence effects and (2) increasing local redundancy mitigates the effects of interdependence on systemic performance, but such intervention is incapable of eliminating interdependent effects completely. The previous insights provide basic guidelines for the design of systemic retrofitting policies. Additionally, the limitations of local capacity redundancy as a fragility control measure highlight the need for a critical assessment of intervention strategies in distributed infrastructure networks. Future work will assess the fragility-reduction efficiency of strategies involving informed manipulation of individual systemic topologies and the interdependence interfaces connecting them. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

269883da94cc1bddcdbf81211965d312adf123f4	a comprehensive mpc based energy management framework for isolated microgrids		Isolated regions and remote islands are facing problems such as imported fossil-fuel dependency, increasing electricity prices, and low electricity quality. Isolated microgrids technologies which integrate large scale of renewable energy resources, energy storages, flexible loads, traditional fossil-fuel generators and advanced electric electrical devices have been seen as the answer the above problems. In addition, a closed-loop based energy management operation framework is needed to accommodate the fluctuated renewable energy generation with a comprehensive energy management optimization strategy considering integer variables/discrete constraints and complex operation constraints in generators and energy storage models.

The main goal of the proposed design is to improve the grid power profile while satisfying the constraints established by the ESS. The strategy extension includes generation and demand forecasting in order to predict the future behavior of the microgrid. According to the forecast error and the battery State-of-Charge (SOC) the proposed strategy increases/decreases the grid power with the purpose of smoothing the power exchanged with the grid. The performance of the proposed strategy is verified through comparative numerical simulations using real data measured at the microgrid of the Public University of Navarre (UPNa).	cma-es;computer data storage;discharger;fuzzy logic;logic control;mg (editor);microgrid;numerical analysis;simulation;smoothing;state of charge	Diego Arcos-Aviles;Francesc Guinjoan;Martin P.

5c77940c16f8ccf7e0da37e4e826e86052a77727	quantitative comparison of data-driven and physics-based models for commercial building hvac systems		Commercial buildings are responsible for a large fraction of energy consumption in developed countries, and therefore are targets of energy efficiency programs. Motivated by the large inherent thermal inertia of buildings, the power consumption can be flexibly scheduled without compromising occupant comfort. This temporal flexibility offers opportunities for energy savings and the provision of frequency regulation to support grid stability. To realize these goals, it is of prime importance to identify a realistic model for the temperature dynamics of a building. In this paper, we identify a low-dimensional data-driven model and a high-dimensional physics-based model for the same system at different spatial granularities and temporal seasons using experimental data collected from an entire floor of an office building on the University of California, Berkeley campus. We perform a quantitative comparison in terms of estimates of the inherent thermal gains due to occupancy, open-loop prediction accuracies, and closed-loop control schemes. We conclude that data-driven models could serve as a substitution for highly complex physics-based models with an insignificant loss of prediction accuracy for many applications.	control theory	Datong P.

d11d6cd3d82003ed56b6b82d77e604ef0a3d3afc	learning-based hierarchical distributed hvac scheduling with operational constraints		This investigation proposes an energy management system for large multizone commercial buildings that combines distributed optimization with the adaptive learning. While the distributed optimization provides scalability and models the fresh-air infusion as ventilation constraints, the learning algorithm simultaneously captures the influences of occupancy and user interactions. The approach employs a hierarchical architecture and uses a service-oriented framework to propose a distributed optimization method for commercial buildings. In addition, it also includes operational constraints required for optimizing the building energy consumption not studied in the literature. We show that our hierarchical architecture provides much better scalability and minimal performance loss comparable to the centralized approach. We illustrate that the influences of operational constraints on chiller, duct, damper, and ventilation are important for studying the energy savings. The energy saving potential of the proposed approach is illustrated on a 10-zone building, while its scalability is shown via simulations on a 500-zone building. To study the robustness of the approach meeting cancellations or other events that influence zone thermal dynamics, the resulting energy savings are studied. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of scalability, energy consumption, and robustness.	algorithm;c object processor;centralized computing;computation;dvd region code;embedded system;experiment;global optimization;interaction;mathematical optimization;robustness (computer science);scalability;service-oriented device architecture;simulation;von neumann architecture	Nikitha Radhakrishnan;Seshadhri Srinivasan;Rong Su;Kameshwar Poolla	2018	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2017.2728004	scalability;robustness (computer science);architecture;mathematics;control engineering;occupancy;energy consumption;real-time computing;fair-share scheduling;scheduling (computing);adaptive learning	Visualization	6.136781800174341	6.461110823344588	57802
9ab06e58be84bd59a5eda2f4527740915376214d	analysis of battery/generator hybrid container ship for co2 reduction		Ships entering designated emission control areas are required to reduce emission gases drastically, in accordance with international maritime organization regulations or local policies. In this regard, a hybrid power system, which is a combination of conventional generators and lithium-ion batteries as a type of energy storage system (ESS), has been applied to ships. However, this hybrid concept has been focused on small-sized coastal ships, because they have a short voyage time or require high peak power for a short time. And by extension, this paper demonstrates the potential of a hybrid power system for medium-sized oceangoing ships. First, a medium-sized container ship is selected as a target ship. The electric load profile near ports is defined to select the optimum capacity of the ESS and generators. Then, to verify the advantage of the proposed system, this paper uses MATLAB/Simulink software for simulation. Finally, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are compared between the proposed power system and the conventional one which uses only generators. The results show that overall, 8.6% ~20.7% CO2 emissions can be reduced, depending on the electric load conditions of a ship. Hence, a hybrid power system can be an eco-friendly solution for medium-sized oceangoing ships, as well as small-sized coastal ships.	computer data storage;electrical load;load profile;matlab;simulation;simulink;ti-92 series	Kyunghwa Kim;Kido Park;Jaehoon Lee;Kangwoo Chun;Seok-Hyun Lee	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2814635	battery (electricity);computer network;hybrid power;software;electric power system;port (computer networking);computer science;control engineering;electrical load;energy storage	Arch	3.6577798030218283	8.037555253003637	58281

In the literature a number of techniques have been proposed for energy management, but the trade-off between users comfort index and energy consumption is still a challenge and unsolved. Previously we have proposed PSO based power control methodology. Our technique achieved good performance up-to some extent. In this paper, we propose an improved optimized power control methodology for occupants comfort index, energy saving and energy prediction using genetic algorithm (GA). Our proposed GA based optimized technique improved the occupants comfort index and consumed minimum power as compare to our previous work. Here our focus is to increase occupants comfort index, minimize energy consumption and comparison of power consumption using GA and PSO based predicted systems. GA based predicted system consumed less power as compare to its counterpart PSO based predicted system. The output and comparative results show the efficiency of the proposed method in increasing the occupant's comfort index and minimizing energy consumption.	genetic algorithm	Safdar Ali;Do-Hyeun Kim	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-2405-3	fuzzy logic;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;energy management	Mobile	6.186771408399581	6.575852389491948	58531

f71d97ee548174c1d0e7ed60811488df43e55e23	data driven chiller sequencing for reducing hvac electricity consumption in commercial buildings		It is well-known that the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) dominates electricity consumption in commercial buildings. Alongside, electricity prices are increasing in several nations around the world, putting pressure on facility managers to reduce the electricity consumption incurred in operating their HVAC and buildings. In this paper, we focus on one of the core problems in building operation, namely chiller sequencing for reducing HVAC electricity consumption. Our contributions are threefold. First, we make a case for why it is important to quantify the performance profile of a chiller, namely coefficient of performance (COP), at runtime, by developing a data-driven COP estimation methodology. Second, we show that predicting COP accurately is a non-trivial problem, requiring considerable computation time. To overcome this barrier, we develop a dominant-graph based COP prediction technique and a time-constrained chiller sequencing algorithm integrating the COP predictions, which strikes a good balance between electricity consumption reduction and ease of use for real-world deployment. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our scheme by applying it to real-world data, spanning 4 years, obtained from multiple chillers across 3 large commercial buildings in Hong Kong. The results show that our solution is able to save on average 21 MWh of electricity consumption in each of the 3 buildings, which is an improvement of over 30% compared to the current mode of operation of the chillers in the buildings. We offer our data-driven chiller sequencing framework under time constraints as an effective and practical mechanism for reducing the electricity consumption associated with HVAC operation in commercial buildings.	algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;coefficient;computation;file spanning;run time (program lifecycle phase);software deployment;time complexity;usability;whole genome sequencing	Zimu Zheng;Qiong Chen;Cheng Fan;Nan Guan;Arun Vishwanath;Dan Wang;Fangming Liu	2018		10.1145/3208903.3208913	software deployment;chiller;air conditioning;hvac;automotive engineering;ventilation (architecture);electricity;coefficient of performance;engineering	PL	4.577007929103449	6.851933993291463	58732

The city faces the problem of energy shortage, which leads to the building energy efficiency becoming an urgent need for the global environment. BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology has been widely used in the construction industry. The current building energy consumption calculation depending on that the BIM model is imported to different energy consumption software for energy consumption analysis. There are few methods to review building energy efficiency requirements automatically. In view of this, this paper discusses the method of review of building energy consumption in Revit platform. The feasibility of the method is proved through an office building construction. The method can automatically review whether design results of the building meet the building energy efficiency requirements in the design process and can shorten the review time.	bim;building information modeling;global variable;information model;requirement;revit	Qin Zhao;Zeyu Chen;Yiyun Zhu;Zhe Li;Xinhong Hei	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)	10.1109/CIS.2016.0057	energy-plus-house;energy engineering;shape;efficient energy use;building science;energy accounting;heat transfer	Robotics	3.054796427673124	10.004734237458953	59510

The jobs are processed by a single server in groups of varying size, between a predetermined threshold value and the buffer size. A dynamic probability rule is associated with the service mechanism. The services are assumed to be exponential whose parameter may depend on the group size. The steady-state analysis of this queuing model is performed using Markov chain theory. It is shown that the idle period of the server and the stationary waiting time of an admitted job are of phase type and that the departure process can be modeled using a versatile Markovian point process. Efficient algorithms for computing various performance measures such as throughput, mean number served, job overflow probability, server idle probability, the stationary mean waiting time, and the stationary mean idle time of the server, useful in qualitative and quantitative interpretations are developed. Some illustrative numerical examples are discussed.		Srinivasan R.

This paper studies distributive subalgebras of qualitative calculi, which are subalgebras in which (weak) composition distributives over nonempty intersections. It has been proven for RCC5 and RCC8 that path consistent constraint network over a distributive subalgebra is always minimal and globally consistent (in the sense of strong n-consistency) in a qualitative sense. The well-known subclass of convex interval relations provides one such an example of distributive subalgebras. This paper first gives a characterisation of distributive subalgebras, which states that the intersection of a set of n ≥ 3 relations in the subalgebra is nonempty if and only if the intersection of every two of these relations is nonempty. We further compute and generate all maximal distributive subalgebras for Point Algebra, Interval Algebra, RCC5 and RCC8, Cardinal Relation Algebra, and Rectangle Algebra. Lastly, we establish two nice properties which will play an important role in efficient reasoning with constraint networks involving a large number of variables.	allen's interval algebra;credit bureau;fuzzy subalgebra;maximal set;region connection calculus;sparse matrix;traffic collision avoidance system;whole earth 'lectronic link	Zhiguo Long;Sanjiang Li	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-23374-1_17	discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;algebra	AI	-4.464471711990848	10.555318577053535	59558

The most outstanding feature of this strategy is that EV batteries can be replaced within a short time and can be charged during off-peak periods or on low electric price and scheduled in any battery swap station. This paper proposes a novel centralized charging strategy of EVs under the battery swapping scenario by considering optimal charging priority and charging location (station or bus node in a power system) based on spot electric price. In this strategy, a population-based heuristic approach is designed to minimize total charging cost, as well as to reduce power loss and voltage deviation of power networks. We introduce a dynamic crossover and adaptive mutation strategy into a hybrid algorithm of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. The resulting algorithm and several others are executed on an IEEE 30-bus test system, and the results suggest that the proposed one is effective and promising for optimal EV centralized charging.	benchmark (computing);centralized computing;charging argument;complex system;dynamic dispatch;evolutionary algorithm;extended validation certificate;genetic algorithm;heuristic;hot swapping;hybrid algorithm;ibm power systems;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;paging;particle swarm optimization;quantum gate;scheduling (computing);synthetic genetic array;total system power	Qi Kang;Jiabao Wang;Mengchu Zhou;Ahmed Chiheb Ammari	2016	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2015.2487323	control engineering;algorithm design;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;engineering;algorithm	Embedded	5.317563606683079	4.919102176490562	59560

It is based on the use of optical system of reduced cost which is able to concentrate the solar light on a very small surface (high efficiency solar cell). At present, this technology has a marginal position in photovoltaic market and to take off needs to increase the confidence of the public and private sector. A better understanding of the concentrating photovoltaics technology electrical performance under real meteorological conditions would improve this situation. Because the bankability of a concentrating photovoltaics plant is addressed through the modelling of its energy production, an accurate estimation of the maximum power of the these modules is crucial to achieve it. Accordingly, the commercial evolution of concentrating photovoltaic technology demands prediction models for estimating the maximum power delivered by a concentrating photovoltaic module under real atmospheric conditions. Until now the only established standard method for outdoor power rating of this type of modules (ASTME-2527-09, defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials) does not consider the impact of the direct normal irradiance spectral distribution.

A fundamental challenge is to enable buildings to participate in demand-side services without violating indoor comfort. In this paper, we present a hierarchical Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to demand-side management in buildings, which encompasses heating/cooling systems, onsite generation and storage technologies, and enables the building to participate in balancing programs. In the upper level, a trajectory planner calculates the best possible reachable power profile to track as reference. In the lower level, a tracking problem is solved, which also minimises the energy use without violating the indoor comfort. The tracking problem is formulated so that an active-set method can be applied and the MPC problem can be solved in a distributed manner.

The solver is based on an efficient algorithm for maximizing the flow in repairable flow networks with complex topology. The discrete-event solver maximizes the flow through the repairable network upon each component failure and return from repair. This ensures a larger output flow compared to a flow maximization conducted on the static flow network. Because of the flow maximization upon failure and return from repair, the simulator also tracks naturally the variation of the output flow from multiple overlapping failures. The discrete-event solver determines the basic performance characteristic of repairable flow networks – the expected output flow delivered during a specified time interval in the presence of component failures.	expectation–maximization algorithm;failure cause;flow network;list of discrete event simulation software;mathematical optimization;solver	Michael T.

Under the fixed state of the random environment, the arrival flow is described by the marked Markovian arrival process. Type 1 customers have preemptive priority over type 2 customers. Type 1 customer is lost only if, at its arrival moment, all servers are busy by type 1 customers. The service times of both types of customers have an exponential distribution with the rate depending on the type of a customer. Type 2 customer is accepted for service if the number of busy servers at its arrival epoch does not exceed a fixed threshold. Otherwise, the arriving customer makes a randomized choice to leave the system permanently (to balk) or to join so called orbit and try to obtain service later. The inter-retrial times have an exponential distribution. Customers in orbit can be impatient and may leave the system after an exponentially distributed amount of time. Due to preemptive priority of type 1 customers, service of type 2 customer can be interrupted. In this case, the interrupted customer makes a randomized choice to leave the system permanently or go into orbit. When the random environment changes its state, immediately the following parameters of the system change their value: the total number of servers, the number of servers available for type 2 customers, the matrices defining the arrival process, the rates of service of customers, the rate of retrials, the impatience intensity, the probability of balking the system at the arrival moment or the moment of termination of service of type 2 customer. Behavior of the system is described by the level dependent multi-dimensional Markov chain that belongs to the class of asymptotically quasi-Toeplitz Markov chains. This allows us to derive the ergodicity condition for this Markov chain and compute its stationary distribution. The main performance measures of the system are expressed via the stationary state probabilities. Numerical illustrations are presented.	queueing theory	Alexander N. Dudin;Che Soong Kim;Sergey A.

079f14e1d2c1b733d0405a65e2da541d7cffd35e	the expressive power of indeterminate primitives in asynchronous computation	resource allocation;expressive power	Computer Science has witnessed the emergence of a plethora of different logics, models and paradigms for the description of computation. Yet, the classic Church-Turing thesis may be seen as indicating that all general models of computation are equivalent. Alan Perlis referred to this as the ”Turing tarpit”, and argued that some of the most crucial distinctions in computing methodology, such as sequential versus parallel, determinate versus nondeterministic, local versus distributed disappear if all one sees in computation is pure symbol pushing. How can we express formally the difference between these models of computation? This double issue of Mathematical Structures in Computer Science aims at addressing this fundamental question by focusing on the dichotomy between sequential and concurrent computation. In particular, on ways to capture formally that any translation from an expressive approach to concurrency to a formalism like that of Turing Machines would miss “what really matters”. By way of example, physicists know very well that non-Euclidean geometries can be “embedded” into the Euclidean one (and conversely), but they also know that the equivalence, an interesting equicoherence, misses what really matters, e.g., the intrinsic geometry of physical (typically relativistic) space. Similarly, one can give an “isomorphism” (as sets) between the real line and the plane (or any finite dimensional space), but this misses all that matters in the mathematical understanding of space, e.g., the notion of neighbourhood (Cartesian dimension is a topological invariant, not a set-theoretic one).	cartesian closed category;church–turing thesis;computer science;concurrency (computer science);concurrent computing;embedded system;emergence;indeterminacy in concurrent computation;model of computation;neighbourhood (graph theory);property (philosophy);semantics (computer science);set theory;turing completeness;turing machine;turing tarpit	Prakash Panangaden	1995		10.1007/3-540-60692-0_45	resource allocation;computer science;theoretical computer science;programming language;expressive power;algorithm	Theory	-2.599071841043764	13.040389882870915	60109

The use of automated electrical appliances have increased exponentially in day to day activity. To maintain a possible balance between the supply and demand the power companies are introducing the demand side management approach. As a result, consumers are adopted for load shifting or scheduling their loads into off-peak hours to reduce the electricity bill. When all the consumers are trying to run the scheduled electrical appliances at the same time then the usage of energy in the off peak hour curve is marginally high. However, service providers are in need of a load balancing mechanism to avoid over or under utilization of the power grid. In the existing works, threshold limit is applied for a home to maintain the balanced load and if the consumer exceeds it then the additional charges are applied in the bill. To overcome the above mentioned drawbacks there is a need to increase the power usage with minimum cost and reducing the waiting time. For this purpose, in this paper we implement multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, which results in the cost reduction for energy usage and minimize the waiting time for appliance execution. The result reveals that if the consumer exceeds the threshold limit, the scheduled running electrical appliances temporarily stops to maintain the energy usage under threshold level for cost benefit and resumes the stopped appliances later. Further, the proposed technique minimizes the overall electricity bill and waiting time for the execution of electrical appliances.	emoticon;evolutionary algorithm;interrupt;load balancing (computing);moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;pl/i;scheduling (computing);washing machine	Muralitharan Krishnan;Rathinasamy Sakthivel;Yan Shi	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.11.015	renewable energy;real-time computing;simulation;load balancing;computer science;load balancing;smart grid	Metrics	3.2831578524852967	5.811552202722387	60200

We show that this homology theory enjoys many important properties, as an invariant for directed homotopy. Among its properties, we show that subdivided precubical sets have the same homology type as the original ones ; similarly, the natural homology of a precubical set is of the same type as the natural homology of its geometric realization. By same type we mean equivalent up to some form of bisimulation, that we define using the notion of open map. Last but not least, natural homology, for the class of spaces we consider, exhibits very important properties such as Hurewicz theorems, and most of Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, in particular the dimension, homotopy, additivity and exactness axioms. This last axiom is studied in a general framework of (generalized) exact sequences.	bisimulation;category 1 cable;computation;concurrency (computer science);congruence of squares;diagram;grammatical framework;graph theory;homology (biology);homology modeling;map;modulo operation;natural language processing;objective-c;peano axioms;persistence (computer science);rewriting;rough set;semantics (computer science);turing completeness;x-machine;zeller's congruence	Jérémy Dubut;Eric Goubault;Jean Goubault-Larrecq	2017	Applied Categorical Structures	10.1007/s10485-016-9438-y	cellular homology;excision theorem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;relative homology;topology;moore space;mayer–vietoris sequence;cw complex;morse homology;homotopy sphere;mathematics;singular homology;eilenberg–steenrod axioms	Theory	-3.148383538106622	17.365851319145516	60246

Weighted voting games are a well-studied subclass of yes/no voting games, in which each voter has a weight, and an alternative is accepted if the total weight of its supporters exceeds a certain threshold. Weighted voting games are naturally extended to k-vector weighted voting games, which are intersections of k different weighted voting games: a coalition wins if it wins in every component game. The dimensionality, k, of a kvector weighted voting game can be understood as a measure of the complexity of the game. In this paper, we analyse the dimensionality of such games from the point of view of complexity theory. We consider the problems of equivalence, (checking whether two given voting games have the same set of winning coalitions), and minimality, (checking whether a given k-vector voting game can be simplified by deleting one of the component games, or, more generally, is equivalent to a k′-weighted voting game with k′ < k). We show that these problems are computationally hard, even if k = 1 or all weights are 0 or 1. However, we provide efficient algorithms for cases where both k is small and the weights are polynomially bounded. We also study the notion of monotonicity in voting games, and show that monotone yes/no voting games are essentially as hard to represent and work with as general	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;formal equivalence checking;np-completeness;turing completeness;weight function;monotone	Edith Elkind;Leslie Ann Goldberg;Paul W.

The method combines Markov-Monte-Carlo simulation with analytical results pertaining to uniformized Markov chains and product-form queuing networks. A stratified sampling plan is incorporated as a variance reduction technique. The concept of importance sampling is used to reduce the computational requirements of the plan and make it realizable in practice. The most important consequence of applying uniformization is that it enables the characterization of the response time distribution as an infinite mixture of Erlangian distributions. An estimate of the entire response time distribution may then be obtained in each simulation trial. This circumvents the practical problems associated with estimating tail probabilities. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the theory. >	response time (technology)	Adrian E. Conway;David E. O'Brien	1993	IEEE Trans.

In this context, this paper addresses one of the most critical steps of such process, the transportation of newborn animals from birth places to breeding farms. Specifically, an intelligent sensor system to monitor ventilation in truck trailers has been designed and validated. Experimental results obtained both in the lab and during real transportation trips are presented to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed system for the target application, in terms of cost, size, power consumption, and ability to operate at low air speeds.	addresses (publication format);animal welfare;animals, newborn;cooperative breeding;infant, newborn;respiration;cellular targeting	Ricardo Pardo;Carlos Gonz&#x00E1;lez;Jos&#x00E9; Fari&#x00F1;a;Mar&#x00ED;a D.

Because of the variability associated with the loads and the intrinsic intermittent and nature of renewable energy resources, the development and implementation of effective voltage control strategies is essential to reliably serve the loads, in particular when working islanded from the main grid. To face this problem, we propose a dispersed control approach capable to maintain voltage levels within the operational limits by means of DERs reactive and active power support. We implement an optimization framework to prove the robustness of the proposed control methodology. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with a set of representative studies from the testing of the simulation approach we performed, proving the absence of any opportunity cost involved by the control action.	control theory;google cloud messaging;heart rate variability;mathematical optimization;microgrid;portable c compiler;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment	Giovanni Massa;Vincenzo Galdi;Vito Calderaro;Antonio Piccolo;George Gross	2016	2016 Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC)	10.1109/PSCC.2016.7540977	control engineering;electronic engineering;power control;engineering;operations management;voltage optimisation;voltage regulation	EDA	2.2657820444380543	5.934786512968816	60802
6206fa420434ba197c4934dff2fbd7f30a78656f	virtual energy storage through decentralized load control with quality of service bounds		We propose a decentralized algorithm to help reduce demand-supply imbalance in a power grid by varying the demand from loads, just like charging and discharging a battery. The algorithm ensures strict bounds on the consumers' quality of service (QoS) by constraining the bandwidth of demand variation. A model-predictive-control formulation is adopted to compute local decisions at the loads. The algorithm is decentralized in the sense that loads do not communicate with one another. Instead, loads coordinate using local measurements of the grid frequency, which provide information about global demand-supply imbalance. It is envisioned that consumers will be recruited through long-term contracts, aided by the QoS guarantees provided by the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that loads are able to reduce frequency deviations while maintaining QoS constraints and that the performance of the algorithm scales well with the number of loads. Closed-loop stability is established under some assumptions.	algorithm;business architecture;discrete fourier transform;image scaling;load management;quality of service;simulation	Jonathan Brooks;Prabir Barooah	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963040	grid;battery (electricity);computer science;quality of service;real-time computing;energy storage;distributed computing;bandwidth (signal processing);frequency grid	HPC	1.9820434087619112	4.560817233621112	61107

We apply both measures to such critical infrastructure networks as transportation networks and the Internet and further explore the new measure through an application to an electric power generation and distribution network in the form of a supply chain. The Nagurney and Qiang network performance/efficiency measure that captures flows and behavior can identify which network components, that is, nodes and links, have the greatest impact in terms of their removal and, hence, are important from both vulnerability as well as security standpoints.	calculus of variations;ibm notes;internet information services;network performance;power supply;relevance;supply chain network;variational analysis	Anna Nagurney;Qiang Qiang	2008	J.

Moreover, network reconfiguration as one of the salient features of ADSs realized by remotely controlled switches (RCSs) is proposed to be incorporated in the simultaneous optimal siting and sizing process of DGs and capacitors. As the structure of the system would vary in the solution process, all of the buses are considered as the candidate bus to connect DGs and capacitors. Several scenarios have been considered for concurrent allocation of DGs, capacitors and also reconfiguration in loss minimization problem to interrogate the performance of the proposed method. Binary genetic algorithm (BGA) is employed to simultaneously identify the optimal site and size of DGs and capacitors as well as the system structure. The proposed algorithm is effectively implemented and then validated on the well-known IEEE 33-bus standard distribution system. Assessing the different scenarios reveals that incorporating network reconfiguration in combined allocation of DG and capacitor, would result in superior power loss minimization and also affects the optimal site and size of DGs and capacitors. 7	ball grid array;discontinuous galerkin method;genetic algorithm;network switch;remote control;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sajjad Golshannavaz	2014	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-141138	capacitor;ball grid array;machine learning;mathematics;genetic algorithm;distributed generation;control reconfiguration;control engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	5.185716927874976	4.310227347848051	61515

Due to multiple processes and overlapped activities, process mapping plays a significant role in building the model. The model replicates a non-terminating welding fabrication system with duplicate stochastic events caused by system failures and delays. A full factorial model is employed and analyzed to examine the main and interaction effects of five major types of system failures and delays via multiple regression analysis. The analysis derived from the full factorial model shows that material handling carrier delays have the most significant impact on the cycle time.

The main corollary is that logtime algorithms for the greatest common divisor from such givens (such as Stein’s) cannot be matched in efficiency by primitive recursive algorithms from the same given functions. The question is left open for the Euclidean algorithm, which assumes the remainder function. In 1991, Colson [3] proved a remarkable theorem about the limitations of primitive recursive algorithms, which has the following consequence: Colson’s Corollary. If a primitive recursive derivation of min(x, y) is expressed faithfully in a programming language, then one of the two computations min(1, 1000) and min(1000, 1) will take at least 1000 steps. The point is that the natural algorithm which computes min(x, y) inO(min(x, y)) steps cannot be matched in efficiency by a primitive recursive program, even though min(x, y) is a primitive recursive function; and so, as a practical and (especially) a foundational matter, we need to consider “recursive schemes” more general than primitive recursion, even if, ultimately, we are only interested in primitive recursive functions. In this paper we consider extensions of Colson’s Theorem which allow conditional definitions and especially calls to a rich variety of “given” functions, whose values are produced on demand in constant time. Sample, easy to state, result: Corollary 20. Consider primitive-recursive-like derivations, which in addition to composition and primitive recursion allow definition by cases and calls to the following functions and (characteristic functions of) relations: x+ y, x− y, x÷ 2, Parity(x), x = y, x < y For each such derivation of the greatest common divisor function gcd(x, y), there is a sequence of pairs {(xt, yt)} and a rational constant r > 0, such that limt(xt + yt) = ∞, and for all t, c ∗(xt, yt) ≥ r(xt + yt), The research reported here was partially supported by Grant #70/4/5633 from the Research Committee of the University of Athens. I am also grateful to the Graduate Program in Logic, Algorithms and Computation (MΠΛA), for some additional financial and much moral support. I thank Elias Koutsoupias who was (really) a collaborator in the early stages of this work (see Footnote 5); René David, for his useful comments on early versions of the paper; and Lou van den Dries for his comments which influenced substantially the final, revised version of the paper, and (more significantly) for his subsequent contributions to the topic, see 8.1. Colson proved a general result about (absolute) call-by-name primitive recursion, which implies this Corollary, and David [4] extended Colson’s result using a new method; the call-by-value version of the theorem was established by Fredholm [6, 7].

MOSCHOVAKIS where the essential complexity measure c(x, y) is lower than both the strict and non-strict (parallel) complexity measures for primitive recursive algorithms from arbitrary given functions. It follows that Stein’s algorithm which computes gcd(x, y) with strict complexity O(log2(x) + log2(y)), using the givens listed in the theorem and a very simple (but not primitive) recursion scheme, cannot be matched in efficiency using only “primitive-recursive-like” recursive definitions. We will start in Section 1 with some precise definitions of (mostly) familiar notions, and then give in Section 2 a detailed proof of the strict (call-by-value) version of Colson’s Theorem, which sets the pattern for the later results. Section 3 develops some simple ideas from linear programming, which are then used in Section 4 to effect the main construction of the paper for the call-by-value case; this is strengthened by the introduction of conditionals and the essential complexity measure in Section 5, and again in Section 6, where it is shown that the essential complexity is no larger than the non-strict complexity measure. The main result of the paper is established in Section 7. Finally, in Section 8, we discuss briefly the connection of this work with the work of Colson, Fredholm and David which inspired it, and we formulate two relevant open problems.	apl;computation;essential complexity;euclidean algorithm;linear programming;piecewise linear continuation;primitive recursive function;printer (computing);programming language;recursion;strict function;theoretical computer science;time complexity	Yiannis N.

c52c997c903ffaca4e1ef0ceb82cdcf31aed2f5f	knowledge extraction from time series of electric energy demand using temporal data mining		Planning activities are very important in the energy sector, where the utilities are seeking information that may assist in decisions regarding expansion needs and resource management, improving the quality of their services. This paper presents a methodology based on mining tools and representation of time series, in order to extract knowledge from series of electricity demand in various substations connected to an energy provider. To represent this knowledge, the language proposed by Mörchen (2005) called Time Series Knowledge Representation (TSKR) is used. It was conducted a case study using time series of energy demand for 8 substations interconnected by a ring system, which feeds the metropolitan area of Goiania-GO (Brazil), provided by CELG (Companhia Energética de Goiás), responsible for the service of power distribution in the state of Goiás (Brazil). Using the proposed methodology, three levels of knowledge that describe the behavior of the studied system were extracted, representing clearly the system dynamics, thus becoming a tool to assist planning activities.	data mining;knowledge representation and reasoning;system dynamics;time series	Alynne C.

The systems experience up and down alternating periods. In the up periods, the systems operate normally as the usual G/GI/N(+GI) queues with non-idling first-comefirst-served service discipline. In the down periods, arrivals continue entering the systems, but all servers stop functioning while the amount of service that each customer has received will be conserved and services will resume when the next up period starts. For models with abandonment, interruptions do not affect customers’ patience times. We assume that the up periods are of the same order as the service times but the down periods are asymptotically negligible compared with the service times. We establish the functional central limit theorems for the queue-length processes and the virtual-waiting time processes in these models, where the limit processes are represented as stochastic integral convolution equations driven by jump processes. The convergence in these limit theorems is proved in the space D endowed with the Skorohod M1 topology.	arm cortex-m;convolution;server (computing)	Hongyuan Lu;Guodong Pang;Yuhang Zhou	2016	Math.

By using PEVs for electricity storage and RES as distributed generators, microgrids (MG) become more reliable, stable, and cost-effective. However, the high intermittent nature of energy sources and unpredictable presence of PEV in the MG offers new technological challenges to the smart grid/MG energy management system (EMS). In this paper, we propose a new distributed real-time electricity allocation (DRTA) scheme for the smart grid/MG EMS whose objectives are to reduce the electricity bill of the residential customers, to increase the overall social benefit of smart MG/grid community, and to increase the energy efficiency and reliability of the MG to rely on locally generated electricity. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game using mechanism design and solve it to optimality. The proposed DRTA scheme converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium and produces a near-optimal solution. We compare the proposed scheme with a centralized optimal electricity consumption scheme and to the solution obtained from unregulated (natural) scheduling framework.	anytime algorithm;centralized computing;iteration;load regulation;mg (editor);microgrid;nash equilibrium;offset binary;plug-in (computing);privacy;real-time clock;real-time transcription;run time (program lifecycle phase);scheduling (computing);terminate (software)	Mosaddek Hossain Kamal Tushar;Chadi M.

b55e23e42f95cbdde314973b96fa999421e801f3	a cooperative multi-agent system for wind power forecasting		In the coming years, ensuring the electricity supply will be one of the most important world challenges. Renewable energies, in particular wind energy, are an alternative to non-sustainable resources thanks to their almost unlimited supply. However, the chaotic nature and the variability of the wind represent a significant barrier to a large-scale development of this energy. Consequently, providing accurate wind power forecasts is a crucial challenge. This paper presents AMAWind, a multi-agent system dedicated to wind power forecasting based on a cooperative approach. Each agent corresponds to a turbine at a given hour, it starts from an initial production forecast and acts in a cooperative way with its neighbors to find an equilibrium on conflicting values. An assessment of this approach was carried out on data coming from a real wind farm.	multi-agent system	Tanguy Esteoule;Alexandre Perles;Carole Bernon;Marie Pierre Gleizes;Morgane Barthod	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94580-4_12	renewable energy;wind power forecasting;wind power;mains electricity;operations management;turbine;multi-agent system;business	ML	1.7380744039716145	6.392074372651039	63147

An acceptable string corresponds to an expression or an utterance: it may be a natural text, a string of morphemes, a tree structure or any kind of representation. A sharp distinction is made between the syntactic function which is an attrib trin s and the distribution class which is a set of strings. Syntactic function of a continuous or discontinuous string is defined as the set of all the acceptable contexts of the string, and is called a complete neighborhood. Two contexts are equivalent if they accept or reject any given string at the same time. An elementary neighborhood is the set of all contexts equivalent to one context. Four simple distribution classes are proposed and their properties are discussed. Concatenation rules of a language can be described in terms of concatenated complete neighborhoods or concatenated distribution classes. Some possible representations and their consequences are discussed. Transformational rules are also described in a similar way. However, there is another problem of correspondence of original strings to their transforms. It is useful to establish subsets of elementary neighborhoods and this subclassification may contribute to a simplification of the clumsy representation of derivational history. Finally, some trivial but practically useful conventions are described.	concatenation;elementary;level of detail;transformational grammar;tree structure	Itiroo Sakai	1965			natural language processing;string operations;string;computer science;linguistics;tree structure;string metric;algorithm;string searching algorithm	NLP	-3.596781954774597	14.46288987285398	63183

Parisian ruin occurs once the process stays continuously below zero for a given period. We consider the dual risk model where ruin is declared either at the first time that the reserve stays continuously below zero for an exponentially distributed time, or once it reaches a given negative threshold. We obtain the Laplace transform of the time to ruin and the Laplace transform of the time period that the process is negative. Applying a duality relationship between our risk model and the queueing model, we derive quantities related to the G/M/1 busy period, idle period and cycle maximum.

In the model, signal cycle is divided into a series of subphases, and each subphase lasts 1 second. The model estimates the average conflicting vehicle flow rate for each subphase firstly, and next estimates the average delay of pedestrians arriving during each subphase using probability theory and gap acceptance theory, and then estimates the overall average delay by aggregating the average delay of pedestrians arriving during each subphase. Finally, field data collected from a crosswalk at a signalized intersection in Xi'an are used to validate the numerical model, and the validation results indicate that the model is able to estimate pedestrian delays accurately.	computer simulation	Qingfeng Li;Zhaoan Wang;Jianguo Yang	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30497-5_65	computer simulation;probability theory;simulation;numerical analysis;computer science;data field;database;volumetric flow rate;statistics	NLP	10.029427481659429	8.709181856831632	63478
b14fb71732fc5417c646abae457b272d0c6108cf	experimental design of a generative model based on working set size characterizations	experimental design;generic model	The emphasis of this research is on the evaluation of policies for placing and migrating files in computer networks. We restrict our attention to shared files; i.e. files that are used by more than one user in the system. Files accessed by only one user should be stored at the node from where the user normally accesses the system. A different strategy could be adopted if there were constraints in the amount of storage at certain nodes (or big differences in storage price), but we do not consider this aspect of the problem. One of the objectives of the thesis is to characterize the process of referencing shared files. This process has four main aspects: the order in which users access the file, the interreference times, the frequency of updates compared to the total number of accesses, and the fraction of the file that is accessed when it is opened. We model this referencing process by a semi-Markov process where the states are the nodes of the network. The evaluation of the migration policies is done, when possible, analytically, using the above-mentioned model. Trace-driven simulations are used both to validate the models and to evaluate the policies that are not tractable analytically.	cobham's thesis;design of experiments;generative model;semiconductor industry;simulation;working set size	Tzong-yu Paul Lee	1983	Perform.

It is not only a problem about cost reduction, but also a great contribute to the environmental protection. However, the energy efficiency was always ignored in the past decades. In order to gain more benefit and become more competitive in the market, energy efficiency should be considered as an essential factor in early planning phase. To overcome these problems, a new approach, which introduces energy efficiency as a key criterion into the planning process, is presented in this article. An energy recovery network is built according to the analysis of process and product demands. Afterwards the energy loss of the whole system, transport performance and space demand are simultaneously taken into account with the purpose of finding good facility planning from both energy and economic aspects. Finally, a practical expanding case is used to validate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.	mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization	Lei Yang;Jochen Deuse;Pingyu Jiang	2013	J.

cabe272787951a3e5651dcb691c662cb7da64828	two-layer hierarchical control for large-scale urban traffic networks		Many efforts have been carried out to optimize the traffic signal settings in cities. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art and-practice strategies cannot deal efficiently with oversaturated conditions (i.e. queue spillbacks and partial gridlocks), as they are either based on application-specific heuristics or they fail to replicate accurately the propagation of congestion. An alternative approach for real-time network-wide control is the perimeter flow control (or gating). This can be viewed as an upper-level control layer, and be combined with other strategies (e.g. local or coordinated regulators) in a hierarchical control framework. In the current work, a recently developed perimeter control regulator is utilized for the upper-level layer. Another lower-level control layer utilizes the max-pressure regulator, which constitutes a local feedback control law, applied in coupled intersections, in a distributed systems-of-systems (SoS) concept. Different approaches are discussed about the design of the hierarchical structure of SoS and a traffic microsimulation tool is used to assess the impact of each approach to the overall traffic conditions. Preliminary results show that integrating a network-level approach within a local adaptive framework can significantly improve the system performance when spillback phenomena occur (a common feature of city centres with short links).

Though technical literature presented extensive methodologies and models to improve LF accuracy, most of them are based upon aggregated power consumption data at the system level with little or even no information regarding power consumption of different customers' classes. With the deployment of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), new energy-use information becomes available. AMI data introduces a fresh perspective to perform LF, ranging from very-short- to long- term LF at the system level, or down to the consumer level. However, one critical step to realize these benefits is to develop data management and analysis process to transform AMI data into useful information. This paper addresses the efforts involved in preparing residential customers AMI data as inputs for LF, and introduces the idea of how the preprocessed data could be further enhanced by identifying customers' consumption patterns through the application of clustering. Grouping load profiles based on consumption behavior similarities will reduce the variability of load which is going to be predicted, and therefore, reducing the forecasting error.	cluster analysis;data pre-processing;ibm power systems;preprocessor;smart meter;software deployment;spatial variability	Franklin L.

21b392ee7dfeab24ea356bba7d33dd76bdc5ef48	data integrity attack on consensus-based load shedding algorithm for power systems		The paper presents a novel data integrity attack on consensus-based load shedding algorithm. In particular, we show that by sending out elaborately falsified information during the consensus iterations, attackers could manipulate the system operating point to achieve selfish goals, e.g. loads remain being served under contingencies while shedding other loads. More importantly, still maintain the system stability. This data integrity attack has three major features: 1) no additional information about system topology or other devices are required to launch the attack; 2) the attacking effect is accumulative which enables attackers to complete the attacks in either single or multiple iterations; 3) attackers could fulfill their goal using the local agent alone, no other agents need to be compromised during the attack. By revealing such potential risks, this paper conveys the message that besides the efforts of designing novel consensus-based applications, it is equally important to protect distributed smart grid applications from possible malicious cyber-attacks.

In this paper we develop a general framework to efficiently prove results of this sort, based on subgradient-based optimization applied to computational distances. This approach is simpler and natural than KL-projections already studied in this context (for example the uniform min-max theorem from CRYPTO’13), while simultaneously may lead to quantitatively better results. Some applications of our algorithm include: Fixing an erroneous boosting proof for simulating auxiliary inputs from TCC’13 and much better bounds for the EUROCRYPT’09 leakage-resilient stream cipher Deriving the unified proof for Impagliazzo Hardcore Lemma, Dense Model Theorem, Weak Szemeredi Theorem (CCC’09) Showing that """"dense"""" leakages can be efficiently simulated, with significantly improved bounds Interestingly, our algorithm can take advantage of small-variance assumptions imposed on distinguishers, that have been studied recently in the context of key derivation."""	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;constructive approximation;cryptography;key derivation function;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;simulation;spectral leakage;stream cipher;subderivative;subgradient method	Maciej Skorski	2016	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Theory	9.327092868992302	16.68017481291624	64916
ffe88feaf4a7dccdc1ee01cb09cddc064f6831c9	a constraint-based encoding for domain-independent temporal planning		We present a general constraint-based encoding for domainindependent task planning. Task planning is characterized by causal relationships expressed as conditions and effects of optional actions. Possible actions are typically represented by templates, where each template can be instantiated into a number of primitive actions. While most previous work for domain-independent task planning has focused on primitive actions in a state-oriented view, our encoding uses a fully lifted representation at the level of action templates. It follows a time-oriented view in the spirit of previous work in constraint-based scheduling. As a result, the proposed encoding is simple and compact as it grows with the number of actions in a solution plan rather than the number of possible primitive actions. When solved with an SMT solver, we show that the proposed encoding is slightly more efficient than state-of-the-art methods on temporally constrained planning benchmarks while clearly outperforming other fully constraint-based approaches.	automated planning and scheduling;causality;closing (morphology);constraint logic programming;cryptographic service provider;generic programming;microsoft windows;plan 9 from bell labs;requirement;scheduling (computing);simultaneous multithreading;solver	Arthur Bit-Monnot	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-98334-9_3	machine learning;artificial intelligence;template;encoding (memory);computer science	AI	-0.16648795102790923	12.035891004810075	65003

Solar photovoltaics (PV) is a clean and renewable technology that can be potentially used to power large wafer fabs. There exist some critical factors slowing the proliferation of facilities powered by PVs, including high capital costs and power output intermittency. This study investigates the reliability and the costs of operating a PV-based distributed generation (DG) system to generate renewable energy for wafer fabs. In addition to PVs, the DG system also features storage devices and a net metering function. We developed a simulation model to mimic the PV generation and load variability. The goal is to design a reliable and cost-effective PV-based DG system to mitigate carbon emissions. Two case studies are presented in this paper to demonstrate the performance of the proposed DG system for fabs located in Austin Texas, USA, and Dresden, Germany.	computer data storage;discontinuous galerkin method;heart rate variability;semiconductor fabrication plant;simulation;solar cell;wafer (electronics)	Leann Sanders;Stephanie Lopez;Greg Guzman;Jesus A.

Our goal is to show that by distributing network intelligence and control functions using the IPR, we will be capable of achieving improved survivability, security, reliability, and reconfigurability. Each IPR has embedded intelligence into it allowing it to switch power lines, shed load, and receive/broadcast local state-variable information to and from other IPRs. The information exchange capability of the routers will provide coordination among themselves to reconfigure the network when subject to a natural or man-made disaster. In this paper, we report our progress on six different activities around the creation of the IPR: IPR architecture; Communication Protocols among IPR; distributed controls; risk assessment of a system operated with and without IPR; power system reconfiguration based on a controlled islanding scheme using IPR; and the definition of the power routing as an ancillary service, since the IPR may provide improved efficiency and security in the context of a realistic market structure, such as Standard Market Design with LMP pricing algorithm. Finally, we present our effort to link this new concept to an education plan that addresses the socio-technical nature of power systems and the education needs of the new workforce.		Agustin A.

The system performs the algorithm of active queue management, that is, at the instant of its arrival each customer can be rejected and dropped with a probability depending on the customer capacity and the total capacity of other customers sojourning in the system even if there is a free memory space available. The stationary distribution of the number of customers and the loss probability were determined for the system under consideration.	active queue management;queueing theory	Oleg M.

The queue length process is in this case a birth-death process, for which we obtain explicit expressions for the Laplace transforms of the time-dependent distribution and the first passage time. These two transient characteristics were generally presumed to be intractable. Solving for the Laplace transforms involves using Green's functions and contour integrals related to hypergeometric functions. Our results are specialized to the [Formula: see text] queue, the M / M / m queue, and the M / M / m / m loss model.

The stealthy attack is a kind of cyber attack that is undetectable to any residue-based detection scheme. Our previous work [1] has shown that the existence of such attacks can be eliminated by rotationally switching off one of some preselected links which contain a spanning tree of the network graph. In this paper, we extend our previous work, to consider the case when the attack is only stealthy in some of the topologies. The possible consistent deviations of the estimated states are formulated. We show that as the attack is stealthy in more topologies, the flexibility of such deviations is linearly decreased. Several cases are studied to show this trade-off.	file spanning;ibm power systems;network topology;spanning tree	Shaocheng Wang;Wei Ren	2014	53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2014.7039384	engineering;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-2.9443047260228186	7.4697303234555426	65788

8bc894f7a4eafe1c0883a4a39d31f907599ee370	a general formula for the stationary distribution of the age of information and its application to single-server queues		This paper considers the stationary distribution of the age of information (AoI) in information update systems. We first derive a general formula for the stationary distribution of the AoI, which holds for a wide class of information update systems. The formula indicates that the stationary distribution of the AoI is given in terms of the stationary distributions of the system delay and the peak AoI. To demonstrate its applicability and usefulness, we analyze the AoI in single-server queues with four different service disciplines: first-come first-served (FCFS), preemptive last-come first-served (LCFS), and two variants of non-preemptive LCFS service disciplines. For the FCFS and the preemptive LCFS service disciplines, the GI/GI/1, M/GI/1, and GI/M/1 queues are considered, and for the non-preemptive LCFS service disciplines, the M/GI/1 and GI/M/1 queues are considered. With these results, we further show comparison results for the mean AoI in the M/GI/1 and GI/M/1 queues among those service disciplines.	fifo (computing and electronics);quadratic formula;queueing theory;server (computing);stationary process	Yoshiaki Inoue;Hiroyuki Masuyama;Tetsuya Takine;Toshiyuki Tanaka	2018	CoRR		real-time computing;computer science;stationary distribution;information age;queue;distributed computing	Metrics	7.968923558601318	11.022243281079739	65795

Congestion control is one of the key problems in high-speed networks, such as ATM. Conventional traffic prediction method for congestion control using BPN (back propagation neural network) has suffered from long convergence time and dissatisfying precision and it is not effective. The fuzzy neural network scheme presented in this paper can solve these limitations satisfactorily for its good capability of processing inaccurate information and learning. Finally, the performance of the scheme based on BPN is compared with the scheme based on RFNN using simulations. The results show that the RFNN scheme is effective.	atm turbo;artificial neural network;backpropagation;business process network;computer simulation;mathematical model;network congestion;neuro-fuzzy;real-time transcription;software propagation;velocity (software development);very-large-scale integration	Qian-Mu Li;Xue-long Zhao;Man-Wu Xu;Feng-Yu Liu	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571477	computer science;machine learning;network congestion;artificial neural network;computer network	HPC	1.0438827272112399	12.037329140060681	65876

To integrate the consumer side, several approaches like flexible tariffs, have been proposed and tested. However, many of these approaches not have been adopted widely yet because of the needed sophisticated (and often expensive) command and control infrastructures or their impact on the user comfort. In this paper an architectural approach for a lightweight demand-side-application will be proposed. Utilizing methods of peer-to-peer (p2p) networks and abstraction patterns the architecture will be enabling consumers to form spontaneous demand-side optimization networks in order to optimize their load and to provide energy services to the Smart Grid of the future. Because of the decentralized characteristic of the architecture, the aggregation instance does not need detailed information of the optimization network, while the approach is scalable.	domain model;international standard book number;management system;mathematical optimization;open-source software;peer-to-peer;program optimization;reference implementation;scalability;simulation;spontaneous order	Tim Dethlefs;Dirk Beewen;Thomas Preisler;Wolfgang Renz	2014			simulation;engineering;distributed computing;computer security	HPC	1.1614675262228467	6.625676582304384	65920

In particular, model predictive control (MPC) is used to control the charge and discharge of BESS to compensate for wind power forecast errors and minimize operation costs to the wind farm owner. A ramp rate penalty on wind power scheduling is included in the optimization to make the optimal control trajectory smoother, while the performance is kept intact. Numerical simulations with a one-year long wind power dataset show that MPC controller is much more effective in reducing the operation cost to the wind farm owner than the heuristic control algorithm or conventional reserves, in that BESS with a much smaller capacity will be suffice to achieve the same cost reduction.	algorithm;computational fluid dynamics;computer data storage;discharger;fossil;heuristic (computer science);ibm power systems;mathematical optimization;nameplate;numerical linear algebra;optimal control;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;scheduling (computing);state of health	Chiao-Ting Li;Huei Peng;Jing Sun	2013	2013 American Control Conference		control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;mathematics;model predictive control	EDA	4.755074614315695	5.36978849026687	66076

This scheme combines two method i.e. Direct Load Control (DLC) schedule and proposed Dynamic Power Allocation (DPA). DLC is used to reduce peak load occurrence. In order to maintain the customer satisfaction and comfort level, DLC work based on schedule and load priority technique. Meanwhile, DPA is used to reduce waste power in the system. This method will allocate the waste power to cluster that need more power based on customer power demand request and cluster power exchange program. The allocation process is conducted by adjusting power threshold of customer dynamic Circuit Breaker (CB). Load profile data from twelve feeders on three substations is used as input data. This scheme is simulated using simulator that written in VB. net. The simulation result shows this scheme can reduce peak load and allocate waste power effectively.	load profile;power supply;simulation;visual basic	Muhammad Gary Shafer;Kamalrulnizam Abu Bakar;Farah Ramadhani	2013	2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Control and Automation (CICA)	10.1109/CICA.2013.6611680	real-time computing;simulation;load balancing;engineering;operations management	Arch	3.6917492353802395	5.268994195062353	66106
464ee46d747a5737d5d96069cb8d188ec5e4bf8d	weighted register automata and weighted logic on data words		Abstract Data words are sequences of pairs where the first element is taken from a finite alphabet and the second element is taken from an infinite data domain. Register automata provide a widely studied model for reasoning on data words. In this paper, we investigate automata models for quantitative aspects of systems with infinite data domains, e.g., the costs of storing data on a remote server or the consumption of resources (e.g., memory, energy, time) during a data analysis. We introduce weighted register automata on data words over commutative data semirings equipped with a collection of binary data functions, and we investigate their closure properties. Unlike the other models considered in the literature, we allow data comparison by means of an arbitrary collection of binary data relations. This enables us to incorporate timed automata and weighted timed automata into our framework. In our main result, we give a logical characterization of weighted register automata by means of weighted existential monadic second-order logic; for the proof we employ a new class of determinizable visibly register automata.	automaton	Parvaneh Babari;Manfred Droste;Vitaly Perevoshchikov	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46750-4_21	discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;algorithm	Logic	-1.1248349832941817	15.841684791068104	66333

This generalizes well-known results by Takacs [12] for GI/M/∞. Furthermore, relations between batch arrival- and time-stationary probabilities are given.

The sojourn times in the failed state have arbitrary absolute continuous distributions. All sojourn times are independent. The system is working at time t if at least one component is working. We consider a problem of computation of system reliability on given time interval for the known initial states of the components. Non-stationary and stationary regimes are considered.		Alexander M.

Peak-shaving in high Photovoltaic (PV) penetration conditions and providing ancillary service in high load conditions are among the applications of EESS in distribution systems. In this paper, a new method is developed based on the voltage sensitivity analysis of the network in order to calculate the EESS capacity required for prevention of voltage rise and voltage drop in distribution grids with residential PVs and Electric Vehicles (EVs). The effect of EV home charging on EESS capacity in high PV penetration is also addressed. The results indicate that increasing the EV penetration in the network can decrease the EESS capacity need. This decrease is highest in situations with low PV penetration.	computer data storage;electric power quality;extended validation certificate;ibm power systems;logical volume management;page view;simulation;software deployment	Seyedmostafa Hashemi;Guangya Yang;Jacob Østergaard;Shi You;Seung Tae Cha	2013	IEEE PES ISGT Europe 2013	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2013.6695447	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	HPC	3.3182858219499525	6.833817675403496	66852

It basically combines standard pattern matching procedures with a constraint satisfaction solver, and it has the ability, not present in similar tools, to search for partial matches. A significant feature of our approach, especially in terms of efficiency for the application context, is that the (potentially) exponentially many solutions to the considered problem are represented in compact form as a graph. Moreover, the time and space necessary to build the graph are linear in the number of occurrences of the component patterns.

By using Netflow traffic collecting technology, we've collected some traffic data for the analysis from an NGN operator. To build wavelet basis neural network (NN), we replace Sigmoid function with the wavelet in NN, and use wavelet multiresolution analysis method to decompose the traffic signal and then employ the decomposed component sequences to train the NN. By using the methods, we build a NGN traffic prediction model by which to predict one day's traffic. The experimental results show that the traffic prediction method of wavelet NN (WNN) is more accurate than that without using wavelet in the NGN traffic forecasting.	artificial neural network;multiresolution analysis;next-generation network;sigmoid function;wavelet;wnn	Qigang Zhao;Xuming Fang;Qunzhan Li;Zhengyou He	2005	Proceedings Autonomous Decentralized Systems, 2005.

Energy self-sustainability is a critical foundation for successful field systems that are away from the power grid infrastructure. Instead of the conventional battery-based energy storage, this paper argues that the super capacitor buffering of solar energy (SOLARCAP) has the advantages of precise energy lifetime awareness, low maintenance, and operational robustness. By designing and developing a prototype implementation of the circuitry required for management and harvesting of energy, we demonstrate a SOLARCAP system that ensures safe device operation within the permitted voltage range.	content-control software;electronic circuit;image processing;linux;low-power broadcasting;opencv;powera;prototype;quality of service;software project management;software system	Amal Fahad;Tolga Soyata;Tai Wang;Gaurav Sharma;Wendi B.

Only one of the servers is active when the number of customers in the system does not exceed a prescribed threshold, whereas both are active above the threshold. The problem of determining the equilibrium density of the waiting time is formulated. A generating function is given for the Laplace transform of the density of the waiting time, and it is pointed out that it leads to an explicit expression for this quantity. Explicit expressions are obtained for the first and second moments of the waiting and sojourn times, and they are compared with the corresponding quantities for a single-server system with the same state-dependent mean service rates.	queueing theory;server (computing)	John A.

It is then shown that under a natural interpretation, these data structures define exactly the context-free languages of automata theory. Then a generalization in the direction of the ''patterns'' of SNOBOL is made. It is observed that this generalization models the ability of SNOBOL patterns to represent noncontext-free languages. Finally, it is shown that under certain restrictions, only context-sensitive languages are represented but that in general noncontext-sensitive languages can occur.		Arthur C. Fleck	1971	J. Comput.

5b98cf1b4db6b425e68b01df386a2e72aed068bf	investigation of induced crah bypass for air-cooled data centers using computational fluid dynamics		Previous studies investigated energy implications of computer room air handling (CRAH) unit bypass configuration and indicated significant energy saving potential for enclosed aisle data centers. These results were based on the thermodynamic modeling of the data center both at the room and cooling infrastructure levels coupled with the air flow network modeling (FNM) at room level. The contained structure of the enclosed aisle data centers allows FNM tools to have decent performance in predicting key air flow rates and fan power use in these configurations. However, any thermodynamic modeling tool to assess cooling energy consumption by the air-cooled data centers with CRAH bypass configuration needs to have more detailed quantitative information about the non-uniform temperature distribution among servers to ensure that none of the servers exceed recommended temperature limits for continuous operation. Furthermore, FNM cannot resolve complex air flow patterns in open aisle data centers, where some of the hot air recirculates back into the cold aisle and some of the cold air in the cold aisle bypasses racks and leaks into the room. We need more sophisticated tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to capture temperature non-uniformities at the rack surface; so that energy simulation tools utilize this information to assess the feasibility of CRAH bypass configuration primarily as an energy saving retrofit for air-cooled data centers. Here, we conduct a series of CFD simulations to extract critical information about the flow pattern and temperature non-uniformities of a specific data center layout with 1 MW IT load operating within a range of CRAH bypass fractions.	computation;computational fluid dynamics;computer cooling;continuous operation;data center;flow network;microwave;reflow soldering;simulation	Hamza Salih Erden	2017	2017 25th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)	10.23919/SOFTCOM.2017.8115552	computer science;real-time computing;room air distribution;airflow;energy consumption;data center;computational fluid dynamics;server;continuous operation	HPC	4.586982146163363	6.764392310338129	68365

If an arriving customer finds the server unavailable, it enters a virtual queue, called the orbit, according to its type. The customers from the orbits retry independently to access the server according to the constant retrial policy. We derive the generating function of the stationary distribution of the number of orbiting customers at service completion epochs in terms of the solution of a Riemann boundary value problem. For the symmetrical system we also derived explicit expressions for the expected delay in an orbit without solving a boundary value problem. A simple numerical example is obtained to illustrate the system’s performance.

The model is formulated as an extended stochastic Petri net using a variety of distributions for times between state changes. We define a metric for steady-state service availability and derive how it can be estimated from the models. We further analyze time-to-failure of systems with rejuvenation. Experiments show that the optimal rejuvenation interval as well as the achievable service availability improvement depend significantly on system utilization. The experiments also show that service availability can deviate significantly from steady-state system availability. Furthermore, we find that two of the three policies perform equally well so that the most appropriate can be chosen according to its applicability to a system in practice.	experiment;queueing theory;steady state;stochastic petri net;time-triggered architecture	Felix Salfner;Katinka Wolter	2010	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/j.jss.2010.05.022	reliability engineering;real-time computing;stochastic petri net;computer science;engineering;queue management system;steady state;petri net	Metrics	6.173614891193998	11.913739487498512	69372
4a3231c4b4696d62d2c8815f528e6cc82b46fb84	on functions computable in nondeterministic polynomial time: some characterizations		As it is well known, the class DTIMEF(PolΣ) of functions computable in deterministic polynomial time is the smallest class of functions that contains the projection functions, zero functions of arities zero and one, successor functions and length multiplication, and is closed under substitution and limited recursion. In this paper it is shown that by adding one more basic function or a further closure operator one obtains the class NTIMEF(PolΣ) of functions computable in nondeterministic polynomial time. The additional basic function one has to take is the guess function. The operators that are studied are nondeterministic branching, bounded unordered search, which is a generalization of bounded minimization, and limited inversion. Except in the case of nondeterministic branching, with respect to the guess function and each of these operators the functions in NTIMEF(PolΣ) possess a normal form which says that they can be generated from functions in DTIMEF(PolΣ) by only one application of this additional function or operator. In order to obtain a characterization of NTIMEF(PolΣ) that does not use limited recursion, time and space bounded versions of the iteration operator and the operator of taking the reflexive and transive closure of a function are considered. It is shown that NTIMEF(PolΣ) is also the smallest class of functions that contains the length multiplication and projection, zero and successor functions and is closed under substitution, nondeterministic branching, the operation of taking the limited inverse and one of these operators. If in their definition the time restriction is skipped, one obtains a characterization of the functions computable in nondeterministic polynomial space, and if, moreover, instead of length multiplication length addition is taken as basic function, then the functions computable in nondeterministic linear space are characterized. A normal form theorem is derived which implies that in any of these cases the characterized functions can be generated by only one application of these limited iteration and/or closure operators from functions computable in nondeterministic linear time.	computable function;np (complexity);p (complexity)	Dieter Spreen	1987		10.1007/3-540-50241-6_45	calculus;pure mathematics;mathematical economics;computable function;computable number;computable analysis	Theory	-0.5193470316556327	15.48739409242052	69388
aa81403b27b816e70abfc07f9a57ed149e936c0c	decision support in the investment analysis on efficient and sustainable street lighting		In recent years there has been a series of documents such as the European Strategy 20-20-20 to address the issue of energy efficiency in various sectors of activity. The objective is to reduce 20% of energy consumption, 20% of GHG emissions (Greenhouse Gases) and 20% of the energy consumed from renewable sources. Public lighting participates with 2.3% in global electricity consumption, so all contributions to the reduction in energy consumption will be relevant. Decision support in the investment analysis on efficient and sustainable street lighting allows a better use of the installed power. Hence, this paper deals with the reduction of losses in cables of a street lighting installation, depending on the luminaire used, presenting both simulation and experimental results. The economic choice of cables losses will allow improving the efficiency of the street lighting in general, providing also an optimal cost/benefit relationship. Moreover, real-time data acquisition systems of the equipment’s consumption can be integrated into a collective awareness system.	data acquisition;real-time data;simulation	J. A. Lobão;T.

One of the main drawbacks of generating electricity through, say, wind power, however, is random input, which obviously results in random output. This means that peak output does not always coincide with peak demand. Nevertheless, demand drives prices, making output regulation essential. Thus, improvements in energy management, aimed at satisfying demand and increasing profits, need to include output regulation mechanisms. This calls for the introduction of newly-developed energy storage equipment. This paper develops a simulation model incorporating both hydrogen-based energy storage equipment and various system-management strategies.	energy systems language;hydrogen;simulation	Cristina Azcárate;Rosa Blanco;Fermín Mallor	2010			simulation modeling;peak demand	AI	3.8606642380066085	6.440562078089548	70222

A recent paper treats this model under classical Poisson, exponential assumptions. Using work conservation and FIFO, we show that on every sample path (no stochastic assumptions), the waiting time in system of every customer increases with α. For Poisson arrivals and an arbitrary joint distribution of service times of the same customer at each station, we find the average waiting time at each station for α = 0 and α = 1. We extend these results to k ≥ 3 stations, sample paths that allow for server breakdown and repair, and to a tandem arrangement of single-server tandem queues.	exponential time hypothesis;fifo (computing and electronics);server (computing);tandem computers;time complexity	Chia-Li Wang;Ronald W.

As targets affect operations and hence wafer flows, wafer flow estimation under given daily production targets is a basis of adjusting targets and machine allocation. This paper presents an innovative design of target setting algorithm (TaSIV) that develops the target-tracking service model by characterizing target-induced mean and variability and designs a hybrid flow time approximation by exploiting transient tendon queue analysis between two stages to set targets for improving production performance. The design first adopts a Bernoulli trial with proportional-to-target probability to model the target-tracking machine allocation and FIFO dispatching and then characterize the target-induced variability (TIV). To capture the effect of TIV on wafer flows, the design then approximates the time for the last wafer in initial WIP of a stage to finish processing at the next stage, named two-stage penetration time approximation, APT-2, by using Markov chain analysis of tandem queues with given initial number of wafers. By Integrating APT-2 into a recursive algorithm, SOPEA, the design estimates penetration time of multiple stages and wafer flows in a fab. Finally, our design integrates APT-2/SOPEA into a fixed-point iteration between wafer flow estimation and capacity allocation for target setting with consideration of TIV. Over a mini-Fab example and given targets generated by TaSIV, simulation of proportional-to-target machine allocation and FIFO dispatching demonstrates that targets generated by TaSIV reduces over-optimism and close to actual moves by 30.7% of bottleneck machine groups as compared to a mean-value based scheme frequently adopted by practitioners of fab operation management. TaSIV also leads to reductions of 1.2% in mean cycle time and 15.4% in cycle time variance at 1.1% throughput increase.	approximation algorithm;bernoulli polynomials;downstream (software development);fifo (computing and electronics);fixed-point iteration;heart rate variability;markov chain;recursion (computer science);semiconductor device fabrication;semiconductor fabrication plant;simulation;spatial variability;throughput	Yu-Ting Kao;Shi-Chung Chang;Chun-Ming Chang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2014.6899413	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;operations management	EDA	9.676787880399338	5.174307928539909	70383

Using the example of the US power grid as a complex adaptive system, we demonstrate how components in a multi-layered power grid structure dynamically interact, evolve and adapt over time. In our model, electricity regulators strive to balance workload by dynamically adjusting service attributes in response to demand fluctuations. Additionally, they seek to change long-term consumption patterns by providing incentives and social education. Moreover, consumer agents focus on maximizing quantitative and qualitative utilities. By embedding a non-convex optimization model with the agent-based framework we study cooperativeness or competition in the consumers game environment. Our framework allows us to study the behavior of consumers under different control and incentive strategies. We expand model dynamics to include intrinsic environment and control factors. This study also examines circumstances in which agent-based and equilibrium models present similar outcomes or are unable to converge to same results. This method is used to study the robustness of the results, present equilibriums of interoperability equations, and study dynamics of traits.	agent-based model;complex adaptive system;converge;convex optimization;emergence;interoperability;mit engineering systems division;mathematical optimization;program optimization	Moeed Haghnevis;Amit Shinde;Ronald G.

Here in this paper, a soft computing approach Hierarchial Clustering method is used for grouping the various load points as per the number of distribution sub-stations available. The method further gives an optimum location of the distribution sub-station taking into aspects the distances of the various load points that it is feeding. The results of the discussed technique will lead to a configuration of distribution substations depending on the no. of load points and sub-stations required. It will have an effect of lowering the long range distribution expenses as it will lead to optimum feeder path.

A multi-agent control system is applied for the energy management and building operation. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is applied to optimize the set points based on the comfort zone. Integrating a grey predictor to predict outdoor temperature with the FACT model shows great promise in systematically determining the customer temperature comfort zone for smart buildings. With the application of the FACT model and other intelligent technologies, the multi-agent control system has successfully provided a high-level of temperature comfort with low power consumption to customers in smart building environments.

Fluid flow models have been analyzed extensively to evaluate the performance of production, computer, and telecommunication systems. Recently, we developed a methodology to analyze general Markovian continuous flow systems with a finite buffer. The flexibility of this methodology allows us to analyze a wide range of systems by specifying the transition rates and the flow rates associated with each state of each stage. In this study, in order to demonstrate the applicability of our methodology, we model and analyze a range of models studied in the literature. The examples we analyze as special cases of our general model include systems with phase-type failure and repair-time distributions, systems with machines that have multiple up and down states, and systems with multiple unreliable machines in series or parallel in each stage. For each case, the Markovian model is developed, the transition and flow rates are determined, and representative numerical results are obtained by using our methodology.	computation;downstream (software development);material flow;numerical analysis;os-tan;production system (computer science);run time (program lifecycle phase);series and parallel circuits;simulation;spectral method	Baris Tan;Stanley B.

In particular, the case in which a control policy (referred as “restart policy”) aiming to reduce the blocking frequency of the first machine is addressed. Such a policy consists of forcing the first machine to remain idle (it cannot process parts) each time the buffer gets full until it empties again. This specific behavior can be found in a number of industrial production systems, especially when some machines are affected by outage costs when stops occur. The two-machine one-buffer line is here modeled as a discrete time Markov process and the two machines are characterized by the same operation time. The analytical solution of the model is obtained and mathematical expressions of the most important performance measures are provided. Some significant remarks about the effect of the proposed restart policy on the behavior of the system are also pointed out.	blocking (computing);downtime;generative model;numerical method;operation time;production system (computer science);steady state	Elisa Gebennini;Andrea Grassi;Cesare Fantuzzi;Stanley B.

0ab018c3ac8bf3a93894cf797ced378755269536	hierarchical aggregation method for a scalable implementation of demand side management		Demand side management (DSM) aims to efficiently manage power flow by engaging energy customers, through offering incentives via price signals to alter their consumption patterns or directly controlling their loads. However, the integration of renewable energy generators and batteries in residential premises requires new approaches for DSM as they offer more flexibility. Moreover, as there are often a large number of residential energy customers within a distribution network, it is quite challenging to accommodate all of them in the DSM. In this paper, we propose an Aggregated Method (AM) that allows the treatment of distribution grid as a composition of several microgrids, which helps to aggregate underlying energy customers’ power and energy constraints and operating preferences. In addition, we provide methods for distributing the aggregated energy demand decisions among the participating energy customers. In contrast to the alternative centralized method, our approach requires less computational time to obtain decisions and hence scales well with increasing network size. Moreover, our results indicate that when using our method, energy customers receive more benefits through satisfying their energy requirements and operating conditions. Our overall analyses showed that the proposed framework can be easily adopted by the electricity market operators to create scalable DSM programs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2bd4130c28df1322ee454b8cf1d775f0df4172da	analysis of a strategy of adaptive group admission of customers to single server retrial system		Recent advances in wireless communication networks led to possibility of multi-rate transmission of information. In terms of queueing theory this means that a group of requests from users can be processed simultaneously in parallel and processing of the whole group is considered finished if processing of all individual requests belonging to this group is over. In this paper we consider a novel retrial queueing model where the requests (customers) are served in groups of finite size which are formed during a period of random length that is called admission period. The problem of choosing the optimal length of admission period and optimal size of the groups is faced here under assumptions that the input flow of customers is described by a Markovian Arrival Process (MAP), length of admission period and individual service time have phase type distribution. Advantages of the proposed customers service discipline are numerically illustrated.	numerical analysis;optimal matching;queueing theory;server (computing);telecommunications network	Arianna Brugno;Alexander N.

The theory focuses on a particular semigroup of ‘messages’ acting as transformations of a set of ‘states’, called a ‘medium’, whose axioms are both strong and natural. The term ‘medium’ stems from a particular application in which the transformations formalize the effects, on an individual, of ‘tokens’ of information delivered by the environment—that is, the ‘medium’. However, many different types of examples can be found, ranging from learning spaces to hypercube computers, suggesting that this concept is ubiquitous. The paper presents very basic concepts and results of media theory and is aimed at a wide body of researchers in discrete applied mathematics.	computer	Sergei Ovchinnikov	2007	International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems	10.1142/S0218488507004935	markov chain;computer science;artificial intelligence;token economy;machine learning;pure mathematics;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	ML	-2.474430258311883	11.826095326007618	73094

Further, loads are becoming increasingly responsive, in terms of both sheddability and shiftability. In this paper, we formulate the building energy management problem based on a demand-response (DR) adaptation framework that extends the traditional “supply-demand matching” to a “supply-store-demand-time-shift-utility adaptation” paradigm. Stochastic modeling of distributed-energy resources (DER) and measurement-based stochastic models of loads are used to approximately optimize building DR actions. Compared to systems that have no DR, the proposed optimization achieves savings in the range of approximately 35–70%, depending on the amount of energy storage, the flexibility of the loads, and the accuracy of the stochastic models.

In order to investigate the degree to which a cyber-contingency affects power system operations, we first categorize the potential impacts on the information flow respecting the end-to-end information features in terms of delayed, disordered, dropped, and distorted data. A simplified co-simulation model is then put forth for analyzing the interdependencies between energy and information flows, and obtaining the quantitative relation between information features and power system operations. As the operational characteristics of a cyber system can be entirely captured by all end-to-end information flows, our developed model is hence termed as the information flow based co-simulation model. The information flow based model features in low complexity and covering potential cyber contingencies. Moreover, the quantitative relation can provide requirements for the planning and operation of cyber systems. To illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model, a comparison with the commercial communication simulation software OPNET is made. Finally, a wide-area damping control application is taken as an example to demonstrate physical impacts of various cyber-contingencies.	categorization;co-simulation;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;ibm power systems;information flow (information theory);interdependence;requirement;simulation software;testbed	Yijia Cao;Xingyu Shi;Yong Li;Yi Tan;Mohammad Shahidehpour;Shiliang Shi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2017.2675362	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory	SE	-1.7112779636495767	6.6331848869881735	74005

Communication infrastructure that aggregates information from heterogeneous devices in the electric grid making the applications completely independent of physical connectivity is essential for building in the context of control applications. This investigation presents a semantic middleware that is used to implement a receding-horizon-based optimal power flow (OPF) in smart grids. The presence of renewable energy sources, storage systems, and loads dispersed all along the grid necessitates the use of grid wide control and a communication infrastructure to support it. To this extent, the proposed middleware will serve as the basis for representing various components of the power grid. It is enriched with intelligence by semantic annotation and ontologies that provide situation awareness and context discovery. The middleware deployment is demonstrated by implementing the receding horizon OPF in a network in Steinkjer, Norway. Our results demonstrate the advantages of both the middleware and the algorithm. Furthermore, the results prove the added flexibility obtained in the grid due to the addition of renewable energy and storage systems. The significant advantage of the proposed approach is that the real-time monitoring infrastructure is used for improving the flexibility, reliability, and efficiency of the grid.	algorithm;interaction;middleware;ontology (information science);real-time clock;software deployment	Alessio Maffei;Seshadhri Srinivasan;Pedro Castillejo;José-Fernán Martínez;Luigi Iannelli;Eilert Bjerkan;Luigi Glielmo	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2017.2655047	grid;computer science;software deployment;renewable energy;control engineering;real-time computing;smart grid;energy management;ac power;middleware;energy storage	HPC	0.929173878102188	6.6819290609708615	74159

Security attacks to such systems can have devastating effects on the functionality of the smart grids leading to electrical blackouts, economic losses or even fatalities. This paper presents an analytical game theoretic approach to analyzing security of SCADA smart grids by constructing a model of sequential, nonzero sum, two-player game between an attacker and a security administrator. The distinction of our work is the proposed development of game payoff formulae. A decision analysis can then be obtained by applying backward induction technique on the game tree derived from the proposed payoffs. The paper describes the development of the game payoffs and illustrates its analysis on a real-world scenario of Sybil and node compromised attacks at the sensor level of the smart grid SCADA systems.	backward induction;data acquisition;decision analysis;game theory	Rattikorn Hewett;Sudeeptha Rudrapattana;Phongphun Kijsanayothin	2014		10.1145/2602087.2602089	simulation;engineering;distributed computing;computer security	AI	-1.6711744410601286	6.15848999804949	74169

b79460232d8043f3bae85f99e0bff4d882856b68	game theory for secure critical interdependent gas-power-water infrastructure		A city's critical infrastructure such as gas, water, and power systems, are largely interdependent since they share energy, computing, and communication resources. This, in turn, makes it challenging to endow them with fool-proof security solutions. In this paper, a unified model for interdependent gas- power-water infrastructure is presented and the security of this model is studied using a novel game-theoretic framework. In particular, a zero-sum noncooperative game is formulated between a malicious attacker who seeks to simultaneously alter the states of the gas-power-water critical infrastructure to increase the power generation cost and a defender who allocates communication resources over its attack detection filters in local areas to monitor the infrastructure. At the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of this game, numerical results show that the expected power generation cost deviation is 35% lower than the one resulting from an equal allocation of resources over the local filters. The results also show that, at equilibrium, the interdependence of the power system on the natural gas and water systems can motivate the attacker to target the states of the water and natural gas systems to change the operational states of the power grid. Conversely, the defender allocates a portion of its resources to the water and natural gas states of the interdependent system to protect the grid from state deviations.	adversary (cryptography);game theory;ibm power systems;interaction;interdependence;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;unified model	Aidin Ferdowsi;Anibal Sanjab;Walid Saad;Narayan B.

This paper investigates the N-policy M/M/1 queueing system with working vacation and server breakdowns. As soon as the system becomes empty, the server begins a working vacation. The server works at a lower service rate rather than completely stopping service during a vacation period. The server may break down with different breakdown rates during the idle, working vacation, and normal busy periods. It is assumed that service times, vacation times, and repair times are all exponentially distributed. We analyze this queueing model as a quasi-birth-death process. Furthermore, the equilibrium condition of the system is derived for the steady state. Using the matrix-geometric method, we find the matrix-form expressions for the stationary probability distribution of the number of customers in the system and system performance measures. The expected cost function per unit time is constructed to determine the optimal values of the system decision variables, including the threshold N and mean service rates. We employ the particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Finally, numerical results are provided, and an application example is given to demonstrate the applicability of the queueing model.	server (computing)	Dong-Yuh Yang;Chia-Huang Wu	2015	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2015.01.017	m/m/1 queue;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;engineering;operations management;mathematics;particle swarm optimization	SE	8.359167796555115	9.630033747992442	74477
b0874fa3c8f017364fb4590f2c59db06bb4d6150	stamina: stabilisation monoids in automata theory		We present Stamina, a tool solving three algorithmic problems in automata theory. First, compute the star height of a regular language, i.e. the minimal number of nested Kleene stars needed for expressing the language with a complement-free regular expression. Second, decide limitedness for regular cost functions. Third, decide whether a probabilistic leaktight automaton has value 1, i.e. whether a probabilistic leaktight automaton accepts words with probability arbitrarily close to 1. All three problems reduce to the computation of the stabilisation monoid associated with an automaton, which is computationally challenging because the monoid is exponentially larger than the automaton. The compact data structures used in Stamina, together with optimisations and heuristics, allow us to handle automata with several hundreds of states. This radically improves upon the performances of ACME, a similar tool solving a subset of these problems.

fcdbca81b034672438a1a9b8fdf13bd1745b3c67	driving behavior modeling and estimation for battery optimization in electric vehicles: work-in-progress		Battery and energy management methodologies such as automotive climate controls have been proposed to address the design challenges of driving range and battery lifetime in Electric Vehicles (EV). However, driving behavior estimation is a major factor neglected in these methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware methodology for estimating the driving behavior in terms of future vehicle speeds that will be integrated into the EV battery optimization. We implement a driving behavior model using a variation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) called Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs (NARX). We train our novel context-aware NARX model based on historical behavior of real drivers, their recent driving reactions, and the route average speed retrieved from Google Maps in order to enable driver-specific and self-adaptive driving behavior modeling and long-term estimation. Our methodology shows only 12% error for up to 30-second speed prediction which is improved by 27% compared to the state-of-the-art. Hence, it can achieve up to 82% of the maximum energy saving and battery lifetime improvement possible by the ideal methodology where the future vehicle speed is known.	artificial neural network;autoregressive model;behavior model;extended validation certificate;mathematical optimization;nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model	Korosh Vatanparvar;Sina Faezi;Igor Burago;Marco Levorato;Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque	2017		10.1145/3125502.3125542	battery (electricity);real-time computing;artificial neural network;electric vehicle;computer science;nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model;autoregressive model;power optimization;driving range;model predictive control	HCI	5.563634005081021	7.370303551078918	74931

The algorithm is designed for smart grids with renewable energy sources, energy storage, and two-way communication and energy dispatch. Each appliance in a home has jobs that can be deferred but have deadlines. The algorithm takes into account day-ahead pricing with inclining block rates from energy retailers, local energy generation information from renewable sources, and future jobs to make decisions on when to buy or sell energy while still accomplishing the jobs before their deadlines. The algorithm achieves its optimality by formulating a linear optimization problem that can be solved efficiently. Simulation results show that our approach can reduce energy cost by 20% and peak energy consumption by 100% compared to other approaches.	algorithm;dynamic dispatch;job stream;linear programming;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);simulation	Thanh Dang;Kathryn E.

c1b572a40ac6585d4fc3a626912541e1789bfd07	theory and applications of satisfiability testing – sat 2014		Considering the theoretical hardness of SAT, the astonishing adeptness of SAT solvers when attacking practical problems has changed the way we perceive the limits of algorithmic reasoning. Modern SAT solvers are based on the idea of conflict driven clause learning (CDCL). The CDCL algorithm is a combination of an explicit backtracking search for a satisfying assignment complemented with a deduction system based on Boolean resolution. In this combination, the worst-case complexity of both components is circumvented by the components guiding and focusing each other. The generalization of the SAT problem into the first-order domain is called satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). The common way to solve an SMT problem is to employ a SAT solver to enumerate the assignment of the Boolean abstraction of the formula. The candidate Boolean assignment is then either confirmed or refuted by a decision procedure dedicated to reasoning about conjunctions of theory-specific constraints. This framework is commonly called DPLL(T) and is employed by most of the SMT solvers today. Although DPLL(T) at its core relies on a CDCL SAT solver, this SAT solver is only used as a black-box. This can be seen as an advantage since the advances in SAT easily transfer to performance improvements in SMT. On the other hand, in the last few years the idea of direct model construction complemented with conflict resolution has been successfully generalized to fragments of SMT dealing with theories such as linear real arithmetic, linear integer arithmetic, nonlinear arithmetic, and floating-point. All these procedures, although quite effective in their corresponding first-order domains, have not seen a more widespread acceptance due to their limitations in purely Boolean reasoning and incompatibility with DPLL(T). In this talk we describe a model-constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) that encompasses all the decision procedures above, including the decision procedures aimed at DPLL(T), while resolving the limitations mentioned above. The MCSAT framework extends DPLL(T) by allowing assignments of variables to concrete values, while relaxing the restriction that decisions, propagations, and explanations of conflicts must be in term of existing atoms.

f83f50ca12576efa28c0b62c0d15d6ac03ea8770	when to arrive at a queue with earliness, tardiness and waiting costs		We consider a queueing facility where customers decide when to arrive. All customers have the same desired arrival time (w.l.o.g. time zero). There is one server, and the service times are independent and exponentially distributed. The total number of customers that demand service is random, and follows the Poisson distribution. Each customer wishes to minimize the sum of three costs: earliness, tardiness and waiting. We assume that all three costs are linear with time and are defined as follows. Earliness is the time between arrival and time zero, if there is any. Tardiness is simply the time of entering service, if it is after time zero. Waiting time is the time from arrival until entering service. We focus on customers’ rational behaviour, assuming that each customer wants to minimize his total cost, and in particular, we seek a symmetric Nash equilibrium strategy. We show that such a strategy is mixed, unless trivialities occur. We construct a set of equations that its solution provides the symmetric Nash equilibrium. The solution is a continuous distribution on the real line. We also compare the socially optimal solution (that is, the one that minimizes total cost across all customers) to the overall cost resulting from the Nash equilibrium.	anarchy;closing (morphology);convex function;existential quantification;loss function;nash equilibrium;non-functional requirement;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;prisoner's dilemma;real life;server (computing);time of arrival;monotone	Eliran Sherzer;Yoav Kerner	2017	Perform.

To date explanations for constraints have usually been recorded eagerly when constraint propagation happens, which leads to ine cient use of time and space, because many will never be used. In this paper we show that it is possible and highly e ective to calculate explanations retrospectively when they are needed. To this end, we implement lazy explanations in a state of the art learning framework. Experimental results con rm the e ectiveness of the technique: we achieve reduction in the number of explanations calculated up to a factor of 200 and reductions in overall solve time up to a factor of 5.	algorithm;backjumping;constraint programming;expectation propagation;experiment;lars bak (computer programmer);lazy evaluation;literal (mathematical logic);local consistency;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;nightingale;open road tolling;propagator;requirement;software propagation	Ian P.

fe9ecbf459a72c03e1b2389a9b64ee32e2d6c7ba	turing computable embeddings, computable infinitary equivalence, and linear orders		We study Turing computable embeddings for various classes of linear orders. The concept of a Turing computable embedding (or tc-embedding for short) was developed by Calvert, Cummins, Knight, and Miller as an effective counterpart for Borel embeddings. We are focused on tc-embeddings for classes equipped with computable infinitary (varSigma _{alpha }) equivalence, denoted by (sim ^c_{alpha }). In this paper, we isolate a natural subclass of linear orders, denoted by WMB, such that ((WMB,cong )) is not universal under tc-embeddings, but for any computable ordinal (alpha ge 5), ((WMB, sim ^c_{alpha })) is universal under tc-embeddings. Informally speaking, WMB is not tc-universal, but it becomes tc-universal if one imposes some natural restrictions on the effective complexity of the syntax. We also give a complete syntactic characterization for classes ((K,cong )) that are Turing computably embeddable into some specific classes ((mathcal {C},cong )) of well-orders. This extends the similar result of Knight, Miller, and Vanden Boom for the class of all finite linear orders (mathcal {C}_{fin}).	computable function;turing completeness	Nikolay Bazhenov	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58741-7_15	church's thesis;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;utm theorem;pa degree;computable function;computable number;computable analysis	Theory	-3.2846316725977	16.686005704950034	75514

The decision making processes that arise in the design and operation of this kind of systems can be afforded by means of algorithmic methodologies. A large range of approaches based on the simulation of the behavior of the system have been reported to answer this problem. Their main advantage consists of being applicable to most of the systems. An important drawback is the significant computational resources required to perform an exhaustive exploration of the state space due to the combinatorial explosion. A manual choice of a reduced set of configurations to be simulated can be improved by the use of parametric Petri nets and a metaheuristic search of the most promising ones. In this paper, a review of some definitions of parametric Petri net found in the literature is presented, as well as a definition for the general framework of stating optimization problems of both, the operation and the design of the model of the DES. Moreover, a methodology to obtain such a parametric Petri net, called compound Petri net, from an easier-to-obtain set of alternative Petri nets is proposed and an application example is given.	algorithm;computation;computational resource;decision problem;feasible region;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;petri net;semantics (computer science);semiconductor industry;simulation;simulation-based optimization;state space;undefined behavior	Juan Ignacio Latorre;Emilio Jiménez Macías;Mercedes Pérez de la Parte	2011	2011 UKSim 5th European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation	10.1109/EMS.2011.63	discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;process architecture;petri net	EDA	-0.6002584027147034	11.35957021810163	75970

Multiple functional units improve the raw performance (throughput, response time, etc.) of the system, and, as units fail, the system may continue to function albeit with degraded performance. Such systems and other fault-tolerant systems are not adequately characterized by separate performance and reliability measures. A composite measure for the performance and reliability of a fault-tolerant system observed over a finite mission time is analyzed. A Markov chain model is used for system state-space representation, and transient analysis is performed to obtain closed-form solutions for the density and moments of the composite measure. Only failures that cannot be repaired until the end of the mission are modeled. The time spent in a specific system configuration is assumed to be large enough to permit the use of a hierarchical model and static measures to quantify the performance of the system in individual configurations. For a multiple-processor system, where performance measures are usually associated with and aggregated over many jobs, this is tantamount to assuming that the time to process a job is much smaller than the time between failures.

The techniques used relate to the derivation of a first passage time distribution in a particular Markov renewal process.

The building sector has emerged as a major energy consumer, prompting energy engineers to devise techniques for enhancing energy efficiency and conservation in this sector. Accordingly, the term energy-efficient buildings, which refers to the use of renewable energy sources (RESs) for generating power, is beginning to draw the attention of researchers. Since RESs, storage units, and consumers? multiple appliances in a given building are dispersed, the deployment of a suitable energy management system has become essential.	agent-based model;dawning information industry;distributed computing;entity;multi-agent system;software deployment	Sumedha Sharma;Bijaya Ketan Panigrahi;Ashu Verma	2018	IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine	10.1109/MCE.2017.2713646	marketing;software deployment;renewable energy;efficient energy use;transport engineering;multi-agent system;computer science;energy management system	Embedded	1.4865456940663424	7.393327691102208	78622

In this paper we prove that the set of répétitive strings over an alphabet of three or more letters is not context-free, settling a conjecture from [1]. Résumé. — Soit 2 un alphabet. Un mot contient un carré s'il est de la forme xyyz avec x, z e X* et ye£ + . Dans cet article, nous prouvons que V ensemble des mots contenant un carré sur un alphabet à trois lettres n'est pas algébrique, résolvant une conjecture de [1]. Let £ be an alphabet. A string of the form y y with y e Z + is called a répétition. A string which contains a répétition as a substring (i. e. a string of the form xyyz with x, zeX* and yelrt) is called a répétitive string. Interest in répétitive and nonrepetitive strings dates back at least as far as Thue's 1906 paper [13]. One question which has defied an answer for some time is whether or not the set of répétitive strings over an alphabet of three or more characters is context-free. (For binary alphabets the question is trivial.) This question is settled in this paper, confirming a conjecture from [1]. THEOREM. — The set of répétitive strings over an alphabet of three or more characters is not context-free. Classical techniques for showing languages to be not context-free appear to be of no use in proving this resuit, cf. [1, pp. 374-375]. At the same time, intuition very strongly suggests that répétitive strings are not context-free for the same reason that répétitions (i. e. strings of the form ww with w e l + ) are not contextfree: the first-in-last-out nature of a pushdown store does not provide the means (*) Received in October 1980, revised in March 1981. t) Computer Science Department, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington 99164 U.S.A.

WINKLMANN to remember one substring and then check it for equality with another substring — the information needed first for such a check is bound to réside at the bottom of the store. Thus, the situation is one where strong intuition does not readily translate into a proof. We regard this as a deficiency in the theory of context-free languages, which we expect to repair by first dealing with a special instance (the noncontext-freeness of répétitive strings) and then, in a subséquent paper, generalizing our proof technique into a new necessary condition for contextfreeness. The remainder of this paper consists of a proof of the above theorem and some concluding remarks. Ends of proofs are marked with the symbol D. We first prove that répétitive strings over a six-letter alphabet are not contextfree. The extension to three-letter alphabets will follow quite easily, using a resuit from [2]. Let .R be the set of répétitive strings over some fixed alphabet containing at least the six symbols a, b, c, S, 0, and 1. For the sake of deriving a contradiction assume that R is context-free. Let M be a nondeterministic pushdown automaton with L(M) = R. Without loss of generality we may assume that M has the following properties: — it accepts by empty store, — it has only one internai state, — it changes its stack height by at most 1 in any single step, and — it reads one input symbol in every step. These properties of M are the result of assuming that the grammar for R is given in """"2-Greibach-Normal-Form"""" [5, 9,11,12], where all productions are of the form A -> a BC, A -• a B, or A -> a with A,B,C being syntactic variables and a a terminal symbol. The standard construction ôf a nondeterministic pushdown automaton from a context-free grammar (see e. g. [8], pp. 115-116) then yields a machine with the above properties. The basic idea behind our proof is to analyze how the pda M can store information about its input. Specifically, we are going to exploit the fact that information received (on the input tape) during an early stage of the computation is bound to réside near the bottom of the stack. Information on the stack simply cannot be arbitrarily juggled around. Some of the technical details of such an analysis are simplified by the assumption that the height of the stack changes by at most 1 in any single move. But while convenient, this assumption is not essential. At the cost of adding some technical detail to the proof we could adopt the weaker assumption that there is some constant k, not necessarily 1, such that R.A.I.R.O. Informatique théorique/Theoretical Informaties REPETITIVE STRINGS ARE NOT CONTEXT-FREE 193 M changes its stack height by at most k in any single step. This weaker assumption corresponds to assuming that the grammar for R is given in Greibach-Normal-Form but not necessarily in 2-Greibach-Normal-Form. Let s dénote the size of the stack alphabet of M.

This work presents a market mechanism for smart charging that optimally allocates available charging capacity in a way that ensures network stability, while at the same time allowing vehicles to express individual preferences regarding their charging rates. Those who want higher rates can receive these, but must pay a higher price. The mechanism takes into account network-specific constraints such as total network load, voltage drop, and phase unbalance. However, since vehicles have differing impacts on these constraints, this leads to unequal access to the available resources (i.e., charging capacity), resulting in an unfair market. An additional constraint can be introduced to level the playing field for all users, but it leads to a reduction in aggregate performance. The mechanism is shown to be efficient and strategy-proof, so users cannot gain an unfair advantage by misrepresenting their preferences. A series of simulations demonstrate the mechanism's behavior and properties. The results open the door to multi-tiered user plans by demand response aggregators.	aggregate data;extended validation certificate;fairness measure;news aggregator;simulation;throughput;user (computing)	Julian de Hoog;Tansu Alpcan;Marcus Brazil;Doreen A.

The system is non-intrusive, can be easily deployed in electric boards and sends data to a central base station located away from the metering device.

In order to reduce CO2 emissions and release the full potential for sustainable mobility, EVs need to be charged with energy from renewable energy sources (RES). We employ a deterministic linear optimization approach with different coordination objectives for each simulation scenario. The objectives are to minimize the individual average charging costs, maximize the average use of wind power or minimize the average load factor for the charging times of each EV customer. Customers have real life driving profiles from the German mobility panel and are distinguished in employees and retired with their respective driving behavior. We find that the wind power share used for charging can be nearly doubled for both groups under the respective strategy. Average costs are increased in comparison to the cost oriented strategy but are considerably lower as in the uncoordinated charging case.	extended validation certificate;hash table;individual mobility;linear programming;mathematical optimization;real life;simulation	Alexander Schuller;Jens P.

Flaring emissions, especially intensive start-up flaring emissions from chemical plants, have potentially significant impacts on local air quality. Thus, when multiple plants in an industrial zone plan to start-up within a same time period, their start-up plans should be evaluated and optimally controlled so as to avoid unexpected air-quality violations in any air-quality concern regions (AQCRs). In this paper, a general systematic methodology for multi-plant start-up emission evaluation and control has been developed. The methodology starts with collecting regional meteorological information such as wind speed and temperature; geographical information of all of the involved chemical plants and AQCRs; as well as plant operation data such as the start-up time window, start-up duration, and estimated emission profile. Next, a regional air-quality evaluation based on Gaussian dispersion model will be conducted. If any air quality violation is predicted to an AQCR, a multi-objective scheduling problem will be generated and solved to optimize the start-up sequence and start-up beginning time for all chemical plants. The scheduling model minimizes the overall air quality impacts to all of the AQCRs as well as minimize the total start-up time mismatch of all plants, subject to the principles of atmospheric pollutant dispersion. This study may provide valuable quantitative decision supports for multiple stake holders, including government environmental agency, regional chemical plants, and local communities.	adobe air;internationalization and localization;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);uptime	Tianxing Cai;Sujing Wang;Qiang Xu	2013	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2013.03.027	control engineering;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;systems modeling;computer science;engineering;scheduling;scheduling	AI	5.477150348337942	6.637985063838435	79640

This paper analyzes the structural vulnerability of real power grids to impending disasters and presents intuitive graphical me trics to quantify the extent of damage. Two improved graph eigenvalue based bounds on the grid vulnerability are developed and demonstrated through simulations of failure propagati on on IEEE test cases and real networks. Finally this paper studie s adversarial attacks aimed at weakening the grid’s structural resilience and presents two approximate schemes to determi ne the critical transmission lines that may be attacked to mini mize grid resilience. The framework can be also be used to design protection schemes to secure the grid against such adversar i l attacks.

Much effort in cyber-physical system (CPS) protection has focused on protecting the borders of the system through traditional information security techniques. Less effort has been applied to the protection of cyber-physical systems from intelligent attacks launched after an attacker has defeated the information security protections to gain access to the control system. In this paper, attacks on actuator signals are analyzed from a system theoretic context. The threat surface is classified into finite energy and bounded attacks. These two broad classes encompass a large range of potential attacks. The effect of theses attacks on a linear quadratic (LQ) control are analyzed, and the optimal actuator attacks for both finite and infinite horizon LQ control are derived, therefore the worst case attack signals are obtained. The closed-loop system under the optimal attack signals is given and a numerical example illustrating the effect of an optimal bounded attack is provided.	as-interface;best, worst and average case;control system;cyber-physical system;information security;letter-quality printer;linear system;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;simulation;steady state;theory;vulnerability (computing)	Seddik M.

In the system, power companies can easily find suitable coal suppliers by comparing the price of coal, transportation cost, supply cycle, industry status, enterprise credit, etc. So they can reduce power generation cost and storage cost, match power generation plan, and understand regional situation. In addition, the system provides enterprise portrait for each coal company from many aspects, such as credit, risk information, service quality and so on. At the same time, we used actual data to verify the system. It is hoped that the application of this study can provide reference for peers and related industries.	big data	Xinyue Zhang;Yanmin Han;Wei Ge;Daqiang Yan;Yiming Chen	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94301-5_25	data mining;electricity generation;operations management;supply chain;big data;computer science;coal;service quality;electric power industry	ML	2.5303259896325034	8.879013710489858	80118

In this paper, we present a case in a hospital's emergency department (ED) where the queuing process can be modeled as a time-varying M/M/s queue with re-entrant patients. In order to improve patient flow in the department, we propose the use of a dynamic priority queue to dispatch patients to consultation with doctors. We test our proposed model using simulation and our experimental results show that a dynamic priority queue is effective in reducing the length of stay (LOS) of patients and hence improving patient flow. Furthermore, we show that a hybrid scheme is effective in preventing starvation.	dynamic dispatch;fifo (computing and electronics);mined;priority queue;real-time transcription;simulation;starvation (computer science);time of arrival	Kar Way Tan;Chao Wang;Hoong Chuin Lau	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2012.6386409	real-time computing;bulk queue;computer science;operations management;queue management system;computer network	Robotics	9.45251126747185	8.36884255625613	80928

At a technological level, there have been attempts to optimize coupling points between the electricity and water systems to reduce the water-intensity of technologies in the former and the energy-intensity of technologies in the latter. To our knowledge, there has been little discussion of the energy-water nexus from an engineering systems perspective. A previous work presented a meta-architecture of the energywater nexus in the electricity supply, engineered water supply and wastewater management systems developed using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). In this work, models have been developed that characterize the various transmissions of matter and energy in and between the electricity and water systems.	gams;mit engineering systems division;nexus file;numerical analysis;numerical method;solver;systems modeling language	William Naggaga Lubega;Amro M.

If an arriving customer finds the buffer filled up, this customer joins a special retrial waiting group (orbit) in order to seek service again in an exponentially distributed period of time. The customers seeking service for the first time have the preemptive priority over retrial ones, thus, one can think of the original system as of the priority one with retrial customers being low-priority. We also introduce a randomized push-out buffer management mechanism, which makes it possible to control the loss probability of the high-priority and low-priority customers efficiently.	preemption (computing);queueing theory;randomized algorithm	Alexander Ilyashenko;Oleg Zayats;Maria Korenevskaya;Vladimir Mulukha	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67380-6_39	real-time computing;queueing theory;exponential function;joins;markov process;poisson distribution;mathematics;exponential distribution	Metrics	8.270568947819038	10.737665220100693	82490
62f7e49f77ca13b7690ce0106235063f6b0771d1	electrical grid and supercomputing centers: an investigative analysis of emerging opportunities and challenges		Some of the largest supercomputing centers (SCs) in the United States are developing new relationships with their electricity service providers (ESPs). These relationships, similar to other commercial and industrial partnerships, are driven by a mutual interest to reduce energy costs and improve electrical grid reliability. While SCs are concerned about the quality, cost, environmental impact, and availability of electricity, ESPs are concerned about electrical grid reliability, particularly in terms of energy consumption, peak power demands, and power fluctuations. The power demand for SCs can be 20 MW or more – the theoretical peak power requirements are greater than 45 MW – and recurring intra-hour variability can exceed 8 MW. As a result of this, ESPs may request large SCs to engage in demand response and grid integration. This paper evaluates today’s relationships, potential partnerships, and possible integration between SCs and their ESPs. The paper uses feedback from a questionnaire submitted to supercomputing centers on the Top100 List in the United States to describe opportunities for overcoming the challenges of HPC-grid integration.	heart rate variability;microwave;requirement;supercomputer	Natalie J.

One of the challenges of Smart Cities is the design of an effective City Parking System that may contribute to improve the city life in terms of gas emission and air pollution in city centers, but also the everyday life of city dwellers by facilitating to park with the support of automatic parking services. In this work, an investigation on the use of software agents negotiation to accommodate both user and vendor requirements on a parking space is carried out. It is shown that agent negotiation allows to assign parking spaces in an automatic and intelligent manner by taking into account that users have their own needs regarding parking location and price, while parking vendors have their own needs regarding efficient allocation of parking spaces, and city regulations.

17e8f08f6d39b73c52935906f03c5cac9c711351	a new graphical technique for energy efficient design of heat recovery system in chemical/refining industries		Chemical processes are energy intensive industries; the majority of energy consumed in industrial processes is mainly used for heating and cooling requirements. This results in increasing the interest in obtaining the optimum design of the heat exchanger networks to reduce the energy consumption and face the growing energy crises. Most of the published literature over the last fifty years promotes the process integration technology as a main part of the process system engineering science. Graphical Pinch Analysis method normally includes two key steps, firstly obtaining the energy targets which include the minimum energy required for the HEN design, then designing the heat exchanger network (HEN). This paper introduces a new graphical approach for the design of new heat exchanger networks (HENs) based on pinch analysis rules. The HEN is represented on a simple graph, where the cold stream temperatures are plotted on the X-axis while the driving forces for each exchanger are plotted on the Y-axis. This graphical technique can describe the energy analysis problems in term of temperature driving force inside the heat exchanger, which is an important factor in the design process as the differences in these driving forces are involved in calculating the area of heat exchangers, and consequently affecting the cost.	statistical graphics	Dina Ahmed Kamel;Mamdouh A.

We take the agent-based carpooling application as an example scenario. The first problem is matching, which concerns finding the optimal pairing among agents. The second problem is partitioning, which is crucial for achieving scalability and for other problems that can be parallelized by separating the passenger population to sub-populations such that the interaction between different sub-populations is minimal. Since in real-life applications the agent population, as well as their preferences, very often change, we also discuss incremental solutions to these problems. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

779481ec73f592ec9a386f2a6a7830ef5b51e83c	stochastic scheduling		The field of stochastic scheduling is motivated by the design and operational problems arising in systems where scarce service resources must be al located over time to jobs with random features vying for their attention. Important examp les include manufacturing and computer-communication systems. Consider, e.g., the case of a manufacturing workstation processing different part types, where part arrival an d processing times are subject to random variability. The performance of such systems, as measured by a criterion s uch a the average time jobs stay in the system ( flowtime), may be significantly affected by the policy employed to prioritize over time jobs awaiting service ( scheduling policy ). The impact of scheduling policies, together with the high degree of discretional ity in the decisions they involve, explain the importance and difficulty of the fundamental pro blem of stochastic scheduling: to design relatively simple scheduling policies that ( nearly) achieve given performance objectives. The theory of stochastic scheduling addresses this problem in a variety of stochastic service system models. Random features such as job processi ng times are thus modeled by specifying their probability distributions, which are a ssumed to be known by the system manager. Model assumptions vary across several dimensi ons, including the class of scheduling policies considered admissible, job arrival an d processing time distributions, type and arrangement of service resources and performance o bjective to be optimized. Regarding methods and techniques, it seems fair to say that n o unified and practical approach has been developed to design and analyze (nearly) opt imal olicies across the range of stochastic scheduling models. Although many such models can be cast in the framework of dynamic programming, straightforward application of th is technique has not proven very effective, due to the large (or infinite) size of the resultin g formulations ( curse of dimensionality). Most results have been instead obtained through problemspecific arguments,	curse of dimensionality;dynamic programming;job stream;multiuser dos;scheduling (computing);spatial variability;stochastic optimization;system manager (hp lx);workstation	José Niño-Mora	2009		10.1007/978-0-387-74759-0_665	fair-share scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;rate-monotonic scheduling;stochastic optimization	HPC	6.893033882185435	10.609569643409298	83896

Members of a carpool face the daily challenge of deciding whether to go alone or with some or all members of their carpool, and further, to take their own vehicle or ride with others. These decisions may seem trivial in isolation but if not taken judiciously, over time, may disrupt the carpool. In this paper, we have designed a system which models daily carpool scheduling as a repeated stochastic game played among willing carpoolers which allows for individual choices and promotes carpooling as an equilibrium outcome through equitable payoff distribution using social credits. We empirically show the efficacy of our system through simulation and also discuss how game-theoretic design inherently helps to deploy the system as a mobile application.	game theory;mobile app;network congestion;promoting adversaries;scheduling (computing);simulation;smartphone;state space;the daily telegraph	Dipyaman Banerjee;Biplav Srivastava	2015	2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2015.298	simulation;economics;operations management;transport engineering	Robotics	-2.184886734214847	4.4486083573095465	84119

In this class of revision problems, the user provides a numerical ranking of the desirability of the subgoals in their specifications. When the specification cannot be satisfied on the system, then our algorithms automatically revise the specification so that the least desirable user goals are removed from the specification. We propose two different versions of the revision problem with preferences. In the first version, the algorithm returns an exact solution while in the second version the algorithm is an approximation algorithm with non-constant approximation ratio. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our algorithms and we experimentally study the approximation ratio of the approximation algorithm on random problem instances.	approximation algorithm;automata theory;automaton;belief revision;debugging;experiment;formal methods;loss function;numerical analysis;robotics;scalability;usability;user (computing)	Kangjin Kim;Georgios E.

Primarily, we provide conditions for stability and instability for general queueing models, and focus attention on multichannel queueing systems with servers that work at different rates. Stability analysis is important in computer applications and usually precedes any further investigation of the system in question. Our results complement and extend those of Gelenbe and Finkel by making weaker assumptions, allowing multichannel facilities with heterogeneous servers, and including more general queueing disciplines such as processor sharing and LCFS-PR. The key to our stability analysis is a deterministic version of the renewal-reward theorem which we call Y=i,X, and a relationship that shows the “operational analysis” definition of average service times, when considered as the observation period t --t cc, coincides with the standard definition of average service times for all stable queueing systems. Our analysis is completely deterministic and avoids any stochastic assumptions about the system under investigation; thus, it provides the practitioner with a method that often leads to a better and deeper understanding of the system under consideration. It also gives a powerful tool to determine which properties of the system are independent of the usually needed probabilistic assumptions. As an illustration, a sample-path relationship that gives the long-run average busy period (cycle) for a general queueing model is given and utilized to derive several well-known results under weaker conditions.	computer;instability;operations research;path analysis (statistics);queueing theory;standard-definition television;stationary process;stochastic process	Muhammad El-Taha;Shaler Stidham	1992	Theor.

32525e7b0ab72b659fcfce1a778144879609904e	optimal redundancy against disjoint vulnerabilities in networks		Redundancy is commonly used to guarantee continued functionality in networked systems. However, often many nodes are vulnerable to the same failure or adversary. A “backup” path is not sufficient if both paths depend on nodes which share a vulnerability. For example, if two nodes of the Internet cannot be connected without using routers belonging to a given untrusted entity, then all of their communication–regardless of the specific paths utilized–will be intercepted by the controlling entity. In this and many other cases, the vulnerabilities affecting the network are disjoint: each node has exactly one vulnerability but the same vulnerability can affect many nodes. To discover optimal redundancy in this scenario, we describe each vulnerability as a color and develop a “color-avoiding percolation” which uncovers a hidden color-avoiding connectivity. We present algorithms for coloravoiding percolation of general networks and an analytic theory for random graphs with uniformly distributed colors including critical phenomena. We demonstrate our theory by uncovering the hidden color-avoiding connectivity of the Internet. We find that less well-connected countries are more likely able to communicate securely through optimally redundant paths than highly connected countries like the US. Our results reveal a new layer of hidden structure in complex systems and can enhance security and robustness through optimal redundancy in a wide range of systems including biological, economic and communications networks.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;backup;color;complex systems;internet;percolation;random graph;router (computing);secure communication;telecommunications network;vulnerability (computing)	Sebastian M.

Therefore, an effective energy management and control system is required for residential buildings to utilize the energy resources in an efficient manner. The primary objective of energy management and control system is to improve the energy efficiency and achieve the occupant’s preferred indoor environmental comfort. Many approaches have been proposed in the literature to effectively manage the energy systems in residential buildings. In this paper, a new approach of Artificial Bee Colony with Knowledge Base (ABC-KB) is proposed for the management of power and occupant’s preferred environment inside the residential building. The complete energy efficient and user-friendly model has different components in which ABC-KB was used for the optimization purpose, whereas the status of different actuators was controlled using fuzzy controllers.

The European energetic policy aims to promote the installation of small renewable power sources, the use of highly efficient cogeneration, and the Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (NZEBs) that have to be pursued as much as possible by local generation sufficient to supply the residual amount of energy. To avoid future chaotic phenomena in the existing distribution network, this paper highlights that the power flow of local generators has to be maintained locally: The users have to remain net-loads organized in ever net-load microgrids at least in a first evolution. The actual distribution network for low-voltage customers appears inadequate to comply with these improvements, and it has to change in order to accept microgrids organized by the union of customer groups. The authors suggest the ecodesign of the microgrids able to constitute the NZEB and to accomplish the goals of enhanced safety, high local power quality, dc distribution systems, common emergency systems, efficient load shedding, and energy management. The microgrids guarantee a reduced impact as ever net-load on the net supply.	electric power quality;load shedding;logical volume management;microgrid	Giuseppe Parise;Luigi Martirano;Luigi Parise	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications	10.1109/IAS.2012.6374106	engineering;environmental resource management;operations management;transport engineering	Arch	2.1694926152503076	6.710691732563828	84573
020a84c5254b1e944c75783e8182fe10d751eca7	the complexity of general-valued csps		An instance of the Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problem (VCSP) is given by a finite set of variables, a finite domain of labels, and a sum of functions, each function depending on a subset of the variables. Each function can take finite values specifying costs of assignments of labels to its variables or the infinite value, which indicates infeasible assignments. The goal is to find an assignment of labels to the variables that minimizes the sum. We study (assuming that P a#x2260; NP) how the complexity of this very general problem depends on the set of functions allowed in the instances, the so-called constraint language. The case when all allowed functions take values in {0, a#x221E;} corresponds to ordinary CSPs, where one deals only with the feasibility issue and there is no optimization. This case is the subject of the Algebraic CSP Dichotomy Conjecture predicting for which constraint languages CSPs are tractable and for which NP-hard. The case when all allowed functions take only finite values corresponds to finite-valued CSP, where the feasibility aspect is trivial and one deals only with the optimization issue. The complexity of finite-valued CSPs was fully classified by Thapper and Zivny. An algebraic necessary condition for tractability of a general-valued CSP with a fixed constraint language was recently given by Kozik and Ochremiak. As our main result, we prove that if a constraint language satisfies this algebraic necessary condition, and the feasibility CSP corresponding to the VCSP with this language is tractable, then the VCSP is tractable. The algorithm is a simple combination of the assumed algorithm for the feasibility CSP and the standard LP relaxation. As a corollary, we obtain that a dichotomy for ordinary CSPs would imply a dichotomy for general-valued CSPs.	cryptographic service provider	Vladimir Kolmogorov;Andrei A.

In this paper, we study the extent to which program design and decisions based on models using whole-home energy consumption differ from decisions made with full knowledge of appliance-level end-use patterns. We develop a model assessment methodology for the case when model results are used to rank consumers by their potential for thermal demand-response. For this, we compare rankings of consumers in two scenarios—first, when only the aggregate outcome of the top consumers matters, then when the relative ordering of the consumers is important. We illustrate our methodology using two individual consumption models that extract thermal (temperature-sensitive) and occupant-driven components from single-point source smart meter data. Moreover, we discuss how a demand response program that selects the consumers with the most potential for energy reduction based on model results may achieve similar results as in the ideal case when separately monitored HVAC data is used.	aggregate data;breakpoint;consistency model;ground truth;norm (social);population;smart meter;statistical model;traction substation;user-generated content	Adrian Albert;Ram Rajagopal	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2555985	embedded system;electronic engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering	SE	5.347699294808484	7.305917660885077	84608

The optimal PEV-charging selection problem requires an exhaustive search for all possible combinations of PEVs in a power system, which cannot be solved for the practical number of PEVs. Inspired by the efficiency of the convex relaxation optimization tool in finding close-to-optimal results in huge search spaces, this paper proposes the application of the convex relaxation optimization method to solve the PEV-charging selection problem. Compared with the results of the uncontrolled case, the simulated results indicate that the proposed PEV-charging selection algorithm only slightly reduces user convenience levels, but significantly mitigates the impact of the PEV-charging on the power system. We also develop a distributed optimization algorithm to solve the PEV-charging selection problem in a decentralized manner, i.e., the binary charging decisions (charged or not charged) are made locally by each vehicle. Using the proposed distributed optimization algorithm, each vehicle is only required to report its power demand rather than report several of its private user state information, mitigating the security problems inherent in such problem. The proposed decentralized algorithm only requires low-speed communication capability, making it suitable for real-time implementation.	approximation error;brute-force search;centralized computing;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;distributed algorithm;ibm power systems;iteration;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;overhead (computing);plug-in (computing);real-time computing;real-time transcription;relaxation (approximation);relaxation (iterative method);selection algorithm;uncontrolled format string	Chao-Kai Wen;Jung-Chieh Chen;Jen-Hao Teng;Pangan Ting	2012	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2012.2217761	system on a chip;control engineering;optimization problem;distributed algorithm;mathematical optimization;convex optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering;smart grid;electric power system	EDA	3.8663746252331515	4.332750823965519	85141

A concern from the grid owner perspective is how the growing number of PV installations will influence the power quality in their grids. The power quality impact from the 1 MW park was demonstrated to fall within the regulating limitations in EIFS 2013:1 for the following aspects: voltage changes, voltage harmonics, interharmonics, and voltage unbalance. However, the slow voltage variations were exceeding the Swedish industry recommendations (AMP) governing a single production source. This deviation occurred during 0.74% of the studied two-month period. To meet AMP recommendations it would have been necessary to install a separate cable intended only for the solar park itself and connected closer to the substation. Perhaps a more appropriate alternative would have been to connect the solar park on the closest 20 kV grid.	electric power quality;logical volume management;microwave;traction substation;transformer	Bengt Stridh;Johanna Rosenlind;Patrik Bagge;Smruti R Sahoo;Patrik Zetterstrom	2016	2016 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2016.7781231	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;operations management	HPC	3.0377707032690786	7.571270714407443	85456

The paper addresses the control of such facilities and focuses more particularly on a “rail-road” PI-hub. After a review of the related control issues, an instance of the ORCA hybrid control architecture is proposed. The focus is held on the PI-containers routing in a perturbed environment. More specifically, predictive and reactive routing strategies are presented.

M. Harrison has proposed the use of formal heavy traffic approximations known as Brownian networks. A key step in this approach is a reduction in dimension of a Brownian network, due to Harrison and Van Mieghem [19], in which the “queue length” process is replaced by a “workload” process. In this paper, we establish two properties of these workload processes. Firstly, we derive a formula for the dimension of such processes. For a given Brownian network, this dimension is unique. However, there are infinitely many possible choices for the workload process. Harrison [14] has proposed a “canonical” choice, which reduces the possibilities to a finite number. Our second result provides sufficient conditions for this canonical choice to be valid and for it to yield a non-negative workload process. The assumptions and proofs for our results involve only first-order model parameters.

For the non-bottleneck nodes we show that the queue length distribution at timet converges in generalized sense to the stationary distribution of the M/M/1 queue whose parameters explicitly depend ont. For the bottleneck node a diffusion approximation with reflection is proved in the moderate usage regime while fluid and Gaussian diffusion approximations are established for the heavy usage regime.	bottleneck (software);stationary process	Yaakov Kogan;Robert Sh.

We implemented this capability in the commercial simulation software Extend®. The main issues we faced were (1) Specifying the products to evaluate, (2) Determining the batch sizes for output analysis, and (3) Defining the stopping conditions based on the confidence intervals. We implemented a significance test for correlation and used this test to dynamically adjust the batch sizes used in confidence interval estimation done using batch means. When the stability conditions have been met, the simulation prompts the user to consider stopping the simulation. On the other hand, if at the end of the run length selected by the user, the statistical conditions were not satisfied, the tool notifies the user of that fact. This capability enabled us to significantly reduce the simulation run lengths, and ensures, with little additional computational effort, that the results were reliable. We used this tool to control simulations of electronics, steel, automotive, and metal processing industries. In general, using this tool we realized a reduction of more than 40% in the time required for simulation.	computation;confidentiality;discrete manufacturing;real-time clock;run-length encoding;simulation software;test case	Peter W.

DSM programs allow consumers to participate in the operation of the electric grid by reducing or shifting their electricity usage during peak periods. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a two-tier cloud-based DSM to control the residential load of customers equipped with local power generation and storage facilities as auxiliary sources of energy. We consider a power system consisting of multiple regions and equipped with a number of microgrids. In each region, an edge cloud is utilized to find the optimal power consumption schedule for customer appliances in that region. We propose a two-level optimization algorithm with a linear multilevel cost function. At the edge cloud, the power consumption level of local storage and the amount of power being demanded from both local storage facilities and power grid are scheduled by using a bi-level optimization approach. The core cloud then gathers information of the total demand from consumers in different Regions and finds the optimal power consumption schedule for each microgrid in the power system. Simulation results show that the proposed model reduces consumption cost for the customers and improves the power grid in terms of peak load and peak-to-average load ratio.	algorithm;autonomous robot;black and burst;cloud computing;high-level programming language;load profile;loss function;mathematical optimization;microgrid;multitier architecture;scalability;simulation;software-defined infrastructure;thread-local storage	Mohammad Hossein Yaghmaee Moghaddam;Morteza Moghaddassian;Alberto Leon-Garcia	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2016.2619070	real-time computing;simulation;cloud computing;load balancing;schedule;computer science;operating system;peak demand;dynamic demand;smart grid	HPC	3.4825342580911283	4.949681650243719	86971

It is also common to observe manufacturing systems that deal with multiple products, resources shared between different products, and circulation due to random part failures. An example of such a system configuration is observed at a facility equipped to assemble and test web servers. The primary objective of this research was to develop analytical approximations to predict performance measures of a system with the above characteristics and evaluate its accuracy. Manufacturing systems with general distributions, multiple products, job circulation due to failures, resource sharing, and a fork and join system (to model parallel processing of some assembly operations) were studied using the parametric decomposition approach. The different work centers (or stations) in the manufacturing system is modeled as a network of queues and the parametric decomposition approach is applied to decompose the network of queues into individual queues to estimate the performance measure of the system. Existing analytical formulations were modified and appropriate correction terms were added to the approximations to bridge the gap in the error between the analytical approximation and the simulation models. Random instances were generated and the flow times from the approximations and simulation models were compared. The experimental study conducted indicates that the analytical approximations along with the correction terms can serve as a good estimate for the flow times of the manufacturing systems with the above characteristics. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

48ca0e79bef9b698e59587e966c6cf807f0f2538	two-node fluid network with a heavy-tailed random input: the strong stability case		We consider a two-node fluid network with batch arrivals of random size having a heavy-tailed distribution. We are interested in the tail asymptotics for the stationary distribution of a two-dimensional queue-length process. The tail asymptotics have been well studied for two-dimensional reflecting processes where jumps have either a bounded or an unbounded light-tailed distribution. However, presence of heavy tails totally changes the asymptotics. Here we focus on the case of strong stability where both nodes release fluid with sufficiently high speeds to minimise their mutual influence. We show that, like in the one-dimensional case, big jumps provide the main cause for queues to become large, but now they may have multidimensional features. We first find the weak tail asymptotics for a directional marginal of the stationary distribution in an arbitrary direction under Poisson arrival instants. In this case, decomposition formulas for the stationary distribution play a key role. Then we employ the sample-path arguments to find the exact tail asymptotics for the directional marginal under renewal arrival instants assuming one-dimensional batch arrivals.	marginal model;stationary process;tails	Sergey Foss;Masakiyo Miyazawa	2014	J.

The containment problem for weighted automata asks, given two weighted automataA and B, whether for all words w, the value that A assigns to w is less than or equal to the value B assigns to w. The problem is of great practical interest, yet is known to be undecidable. Efforts to approximate weighted containment by weighted variants of the simulation pre-order still have to cope with large state spaces. One of the leading approaches for coping with large state spaces is abstraction. We introduce an abstraction-refinement paradigm for weighted automata and show that it nicely combines with weighted simulation, giving rise to a feasible approach for the containment problem. The weighted-simulation pre-order we define is based on a quantitative two-player game, and the technical challenge in the setting origins from the fact the values that the automata assign to words are unbounded. The abstraction-refinement paradigm is based on underand over-approximation of the automata, where approximation, and hence also the refinement steps, refer not only to the languages of the automata but also to the values they assign to words.	approximation algorithm;automata theory;automaton;finite-state transducer;heuristic;programming paradigm;refinement (computing);simulation;undecidable problem	Guy Avni;Orna Kupferman	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32940-1_8	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Logic	-4.171267488245627	18.081113642669976	88162

This survey focuses on viewing this smart interactions from an algorithmic perspective. In particular, important dominating factors for coordinated charging from three different perspectives are studied, in terms of smart grid oriented, aggregator-oriented, and customer-oriented smart charging. Firstly, for smart grid oriented EV charging, we summarize various formulations proposed for load flattening, frequency regulation, and voltage regulation, then explore the nature and substantial similarity among them. Secondly, for aggregator-oriented EV charging, we categorize the algorithmic approaches proposed by research works sharing this perspective as direct and indirect coordinated control, and investigate these approaches in detail. Thirdly, for customer-oriented EV charging, based on a commonly shared objective of reducing charging cost, we generalize different formulations proposed by studied research works. Moreover, various uncertainty issues, e.g., EV fleet uncertainty, electricity price uncertainty, regulation demand uncertainty, etc., have been discussed according to the three perspectives classified. At last, we discuss challenging issues that are commonly confronted during modeling the smart interactions, and outline some future research topics in this exciting area.	algorithm;categorization;extended validation certificate;hash table;interaction;mathematical optimization;news aggregator;rechargeable battery;stochastic optimization;telecommunications network;voltage regulation	Qinglong Wang;Xue Liu;Jian Du;Fanxin Kong	2016	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2016.2518628	simulation;uncertainty;telecommunications;schedule;computer science;smart grid;operations research;computer security;statistics	AI	0.7337376923405349	7.164934943950508	88510

The non-linear constraints considered are power generation limits, reserve limits and ramp rate limits. The optimal dispatch in the presence of the wind generation is obtained using modified harmony search (MHS) algorithm. The wind generator cost model is developed and used in this dynamic economic load dispatch (ELD) problem. The forecasted wind speed is utilised to calculate the average wind power output and this power is included in the economic dispatch model by means of negative load approach. Numerical results for the sample test system having five thermal units, one wind farm and one diesel unit have been presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.	dynamic dispatch;harmony search	V.

We model the infrequent users’ requests for service by a Poisson process. However, noting that the Poisson process is unable to capture repeated interactions as well as retrials, we propose a Markovian on-off-hold model for the subscribers’ requests for service that takes into account retrials by subscribers denied service. We analyze this system in an asymptotic regime where the number of subscribers and the arrival rate of the Poisson stream, and consequently the number of servers, grow without bound. In this regime, we identify and prove convergence to diffusion limits for the system. We also prove the convergence of the invariant distributions to the invariant distribution of the limiting diffusions.		Ramandeep S. Randhawa;Sunil Kumar	2009	Math. Oper.

The integration of automation technologies into home is being driven by comfort and economic benefits to homeowners. The shift towards dynamic electricity pricing and demand response application for residential customers implies that the traditional building control strategies are no longer sufficient and flexible enough. A smarter and more efficient, flexible and intelligent energy management system is therefore required. Agent-based systems which implement distributed intelligence are capable of solving such complex and dynamic decision processes. This paper proposes a multi-agent based architecture for optimal energy management in smart homes. Four optimization strategies - comfort, cost, green (energy-efficient) and smart (demand side management) - are proposed and explained. The strategies are expected to provide savings (energy and cots), flexibility and control to homeowners in their energy use, and to support utility companies in the management of the electricity network.	agent-based model;home automation;intelligent agent;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;systems architecture	Ballard Asare-Bediako;Wil L.

This approach is very suitable to this kind of management problems given the large-scale and complex nature of DWNs, the relevant effect of persistent disturbances (water demands) over the network evolutions and their marginal stability feature. The performance improvement offered by DCG is compared with the consideration of two non-centralized model predictive control (MPC) approaches already proposed for the same management purposes and within the same context. The paper also discusses the effectiveness of all strategies and highlights the advantages of each approach.

Most studies are done under steady state assumptions. The inherent flexibility of FMS in terms of input, volume, and mix makes such an assumption hard to justify. In this paper, we investigate the convergence rate to steady state in simple queueing models that constitute the basic building blocks of more complex FMS models. The study reveals that steady-state conditions are not achieved during the execution of batches of moderate size. We therefore conclude that although equilibrium models are appropriate for studying long-term planning problems, for the operational control of FMSs, it is highly desirable to study the transient behaviour of the system. On a broader scope, our investigation also shows that steady-state assumptions used in the analysis of any inherently transient system should be carefully validated.	steady state	R. P. A.

The purpose of the framework is to plan network operation in order to minimise power curtailment from distributed generation and maintaining acceptable levels of voltage regulation throughout the network. For this purpose, both power flow control and rapid network reconfiguration have been considered as various acceptable levels of control available to the network operator to provide required levels of operational flexibility. The power flow control within the network is promised by the application of fully controlled back-back voltage source converters placed in key points (both normally-open and normally-close) in the network. Meanwhile, the network reconfiguration constraints guarantee that radial topology is always maintained in order to avoid tremendous changes in the protection system coordination. The operation of a modified 33-bus system exemplar is analysed in three case studies namely, passive network (base case), active network using remote-controlled switches and active network using intelligent power converters. Results show a significant saving in terms of operational costs as well as transmission losses in active cases despite the radial constraint condition in place.	active networking;centralisation;constraint algorithm;flow control (data);mathematical optimization;network switch;radial (radio);recursion;remote control;voltage regulation;voltage source	Ahmad Asrul Ibrahim;Behzad Kazemtabrizi;Chris J.

Traditional queueing models predict system performance under the assumption that all service facilities provide failure-free service. It must, however, be acknowledged that service facilities do experience failures and that they get repaired. In recent years, it has been increasingly recognized that this separation of performance and reliability/availability models is no longer adequate. An exact steady-state queueing analysis of such systems is considered by several authors and is carried out by means of generating functions, supplementary variables, imbedded Markov process and renewal theory, or probabilistic techniques [1,2,7,8]. Another approach is approximate, in which it is assumed that the time to reach the steady-state is much smaller than the times to failures/repairs. Therefore, it is reasonable to associate a performance measure (reward) with each state of the underlying Markov (or semi-Markov) model describing the failure/repair behavior of the system. Each of these performance measures is obtained from the steady-state queueing analysis of the system in the corresponding state [3,5]. Earlier we have developed models to derive the distribution of job completion time in a failure-prone environment [3,4]. In these models, we need to consider a possible loss of work due to the occurrence of a failure, i.e., the interrupted job may be resumed or restarted upon service resumption. Note that the job completion time analysis includes the delays due to failures and repairs. The purpose of this paper [9] is to extend our earlier analysis so as to account for the queueing delays. In effect, we consider an exact queueing analysis of fault-tolerant systems in order to obtain the steady-state distribution and the mean of the number of jobs in the system. In particular, we study a system in which jobs arrive in a Poisson fashion and are serviced according to FCFS discipline. The service requirements of the incoming jobs form a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. The failure/repair behaviour of the system is modelled by an irreducible continuous-time Markov chain, which is independent of the number of jobs in the system. Let the state-space be {1,2, …,n}. When the computer system is in state i it delivers service at rate ri ≥ 0. Furthermore, depending on the type of the state, the work done on the job is preserved or lost upon entering that state. The actual time required to complete a job depends in a complex way upon the service requirement of the job and the evolution of the state of the system. Note that even though the service requirements of jobs are independent and identically distributed, the actual times required to complete these jobs are neither independent nor identically distributed, and hence the model cannot be reduced to a standard M/G/1 queue [8]. As loss of work due to failures and interruptions is quite a common phenomenon in fault-tolerant computer systems, the model proposed here is of obvious interest. Using our earlier results on the distribution of job completion time we set up a queueing model and show that it has the block M/G/1 structure. Queueing models with such a structure have been studied by Neuts, Lucantoni and others [6]. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by performing the numerical analysis for a system with two processors subject to failures and repairs.	approximation algorithm;central processing unit;fault tolerance;fault-tolerant computer system;interrupt;irreducibility;job stream;markov chain;markov model;numerical analysis;queueing theory;requirement;semiconductor industry;state space;steady state;telecommunications network;the times	Victor F.

After entering the queue, a customer will wait a random length of time for service to begin. If service has not begun by this time she will abandon and be lost. For the GI/GI/s + M queue, we present some structural results to describe the relation between various performance measures and the scheduling policies. We next consider the LCFS M/M/s+M queue and focus on deriving new results for the virtual waiting time and the sojourn time in the queue (either before service or before abandonment). We provide an exact analysis using Laplace-Stieltjes transforms. We also conduct some numerical analysis to illustrate the impact of customer impatience and the discipline of service on performance.	customer relationship management;ergodic theory;numerical analysis;queueing theory;scheduling (computing);server (computing)	Oualid Jouini	2012	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2012.03.009	real-time computing;simulation;multilevel queue;bulk queue;computer science;mathematics;fork–join queue;queueing theory;statistics	Metrics	8.043515789078237	10.807137334530987	90287

We first introduce a solution-base-matrix and then give a tractable mathematical logic representation of all minimal solutions. Next, we design a new universal algorithm to get them. Two simplification rules are found to simplify the solution-base-matrix. We show that a polynomial time algorithm to find all minimal solutions for a general system of fuzzy relation equations simply does not exist with expectation of P 1⁄4 NP. Hence, the problem of solving fuzzy relation equations is an NP-hard problem in terms of computational complexity. Our universal algorithm is still useful when one does not solve a large number of equations. In many real applications the problem of solving fuzzy relation equations can be simplified in polynomial time problems. In this article, we will discuss several cases of practical applications which have such polynomial algorithms.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;computational complexity theory;level of detail;np-hardness;p (complexity);p versus np problem;polynomial;time complexity	Li Chen;Paul P.

In addition, more and more small-scale dispersed generators are deployed in distribution nets. This puts extra stress on the power grid, in an era when electricity is one of the most important commodities for economic, industrial and everyday activities. Therefore, new control strategies are proposed to maintain the desired degree of availability. This paper proposes a general multi-agent approach to cope with these changes, and presents a scheme for distributed control of dispersed generators in a low-voltage distribution net. Based on a thorough investigation of this scheme, we underline the importance of understanding the interdependencies between the power grid and the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure controlling it, which may introduce new or amplify existing vulnerabilities. Some mitigation strategies are presented to avoid or deal with these vulnerabilities.	agent-based model;control theory;distributed control system;itil;interdependence;intrusion tolerance;multi-agent system;reliability engineering;single point of failure	Tom Rigole;Koen Vanthournout;K.

With the aid of communication technologies, the smart grid can enhance the efficiency and reliability of the grid system through intelligent energy management. However, with the development of new energy sources, storage and transmission technologies together with the heterogeneous architecture of the grid network, several new features have been incorporated into the smart grid. These features make the energy trading more complex and pose a significant challenge on designing efficient trading schemes. Based on this motivation, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review of several typical economic incentive approaches adopted in the energy-trading control mechanisms. We focus on the technologies that address the challenges specific to the new features of the smart grid. Furthermore, we investigate the energy trading in a new cloud-based vehicle-to-vehicle energy exchange scenario.

7b1971e9a1798b9939da89853af213127932ca71	distributed optimization for a cost efficient operation of a network of island energy systems		The accumulation of energy systems, comprising of diesel generators, storage devices and renewable sources, to a large interacting network is a promising approach to achieve a low cost energy supply in remote areas. The main potential for cost reduction is through optimized operation of the network. Power management of these networks can be challenging due to sudden variations in load demand and high fluctuations in power supplied by renewables. A distributed optimization approach for efficient operation guaranteeing improved robustness towards faults, reduced complexity, and an uninterrupted energy supply is presented. The approach includes detailed component modeling to assure the satisfaction of all operation constraints during the system operation. An extended Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers approach is used for the distributed optimization separating the mixed integer linear optimization problem into sub-problems. Case studies are carried out by using real-world data to illustrate the performance and economic benefits of the proposed method in comparison to the centralized approach. Results show the effectiveness of the optimization strategy in terms of computational feasibility, accuracy, and increased robustness towards failures of individual systems and its suitability for the integration into a distributed model predictive control.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;centralized computing;computation;diesel;embedded system;embedding;integer (number);integer programming;interaction;linear programming;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;power management;providing (action);real-time clock;tree accumulation;benefit	Dmitriy Kovtun;Charles Link Patrick;Giulia Calusi;Oliver Sawodny	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	10.1109/CCTA.2018.8511332	energy supply;robustness (computer science);power management;cost efficiency;distributed element model;control engineering;model predictive control;cost reduction;optimal control;computer science	EDA	4.19906361243588	4.654094930772091	91544

Key findings that underpin the approximation are that time lags between peaks in arrival rates and congestion levels can be ignored; queue behaviour is insensitive to distribution of service time beyond its mean; and distribution of number in the system is near Normal. This model is then used to derive valuable management implications for service-orientated systems where delays are frequent and abandonments are an important feature. Key insights are that such systems can often adopt very ‘sub-optimal’ behaviour, and that customer impatience can be very beneficial where management wishes to improve system performance. ‘Optimal’ performance is defined, and practical measures for queue managers to move system performance towards ‘optimality’ are identified.	server (computing);stationary process	Efi Chassioti;David J.

3b1d6a8e27c5b4ea4ff299c66be39e6a430544aa	post's problem for supertasks has both positive and negative solutions	turing machine;legacy	The infinite time Turing machine analogue of Post’s problem, the question whether there are supertask degrees between 0 and the supertask jump 0▽, has in a sense both positive and negative solutions. Namely, in the context of the reals there are no degrees between 0 and 0▽, but in the context of sets of reals, there are; indeed, there are incomparable semi-decidable supertask degrees. Both arguments employ a kind of transfinite-injury construction which generalizes canonically to oracles. The supertask model of infinitary computation extends the operation of an ordinary Turing machine into transfinite ordinal time. The theory, of which we gave a full introductory account in [HamLew], leads naturally to notions of computability and semi-decidability for reals and sets of reals, as well as an oracle concept and two jump operators: the lightface ▽ and boldface H jumps. Left open in [HamLew] was the supertask analogue of Post’s problem, the question whether there are semidecidable degrees between 0 and the jump 0, or indeed, whether there are any degrees between 0 and 0 at all. Here, we prove that the answer is in a sense both positive and negative. The first author wishes to thank his hosts at Kobe University and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for their gracious support during the 1998 calendar year, as well as the CUNY Scholar Incentive program. His research has been supported in part by a grant from the PSC-CUNY Research Foundation. §1 The supertask machines 2 Main Theorem. Depending on the context, the supertask analogue of Post’s problem has both positive and negative solutions. Specifically: 1. In the context of the reals, there are no degrees strictly between 0 and 0. 2. In the context of sets of reals, there are degrees strictly between 0 and 0. Indeed, there are incomparable semi-decidable degrees. While the first statement illustrates how sharply the supertask recursion theory departs from the classical theory, the second hints at a broader analogy in the context of degrees on sets of reals. Indeed, the second statement is proved by adapting the classical Friedburg-Munchnik priority argument to construct countable incomparable semi-decidable sets. Both of these arguments employ a kind of transfinite-injury construction which relativizes canonically to any oracle A, so that first, there is no real z such that A ⊕ z is strictly between A and A, and second, there are A-incomparable A-semidecidable sets below A. §1 The supertask machines Let us quickly review here how the machines work. For a full account, see [HamLew]. The basic idea is to extend the operation of an ordinary Turing machine into transfinite ordinal time by defining the limit stages of computation. For convenience, we use a three-tape Turing machine model, with separate input, scratch, and output tapes. The successor stages of computation proceed, just as for an ordinary Turing machine, according to a finite program running with finitely many states. Thus, the head reads the tape, reflects on its state and then writes 0 or 1 on the tape and moves left, right or not at all according to the program’s rigid instructions. The new behavior occurs at a limit stage: the head is reset to the initial starting position; the machine is placed in the special limit state, just another of the finitely many states; and the values on the cells of the tape are updated by computing the lim sup of the previous cell values. With the limit stage configuration thus completely specified, the machine simply continues the computation. If the halt state is eventually reached, the machine gives as output whatever is written on the output tape. Since there is plenty of time for the machines to deal with infinite input and output, the natural context for the machines is Cantor space 2, which in this paper we denote by R and refer to as the set of reals. Thus, the machines provide notions of computable partial functions f .. R → R on the reals, as well as notions of decidable and semi-decidable sets of reals A ⊆ R. §1 The supertask machines 3 Just as with Turing machines, we can use a real as an oracle by simply adding an extra oracle tape on which the oracle real is written, and allow the machine freely to consult this oracle tape during the computations. But because the machines provide a notion of decidability and semi-decidability for sets of reals A ⊆ R, we really want an oracle concept also in this case, though of course we can’t expect to somehow write out an uncountable set A on the tape. Instead, for an oracle A ⊆ R, we allow the machine to make membership queries of A, by writing out any real x on a special oracle tape and when in the query state receiving the answer yes or no whether x ∈ A or not. Thus, in parallel with the notion of constructibility from a predicate, as in the definition of L[A], the machine is allowed to know whether x ∈ A or not for any x which it is able to produce. The oracle concept leads in turn to the notions of relative decidability and the infinite time Turing degrees. In [HamLew] we presented the basic structural properties of the infinite time Turing degrees, and we aim now to build on that foundation. We will follow as closely as possible the notation of [HamLew]. In particular, we write φp (x) to denote the output of program p on input x with oracle A, and we write φp,α(x) ↓ to mean that the computation of program p on input x converges in fewer than α many steps. We will generally denote reals by a, b, c and x, y, z and sets of reals by A, B and C. Thus, when we mention oracles A and a without further explanation, we intend that A should be taken as a set of reals and a as an individual real. Since we proved in [HamLew] that every real x is equivalent to the set Ax of truncated initial segments of x (with 0s appended), the case of set oracles A subsumes that of real oracles a. We write A ≤ ∞ B to mean that the characteristic function of A is computable from B. This leads naturally to the strict computability relation < ∞ and the degree relation ≡ ∞ . The lightface halting problem is 0 = h = { p | φp(0) ↓ }, with the corresponding lightface jump defined by A = A⊕ h where h is the set { p | φp (0) ↓ }. Similarly, the boldface halting problem is 0 = { 〈 p, x 〉 | φp(x) ↓ }, with the corresponding boldface jump defined by A = { 〈 p, x 〉 | φp (x) ↓ }. In [HamLew] we proved, for example, that A < ∞ A < ∞ A. If y is a real coding a relation ⊳ on (a subset of) ω with order type α, then y ↾ β is the real coding the restriction of the relation ⊳ to its first β many elements. An ordinal is writable if there is a machine which on input 0 gives as output a real coding that ordinal. An §1 The supertask machines 4 ordinal is clockable when it is the length of a halting infinite time Turing machine computation. As always, we denote the supremum of the writable ordinals by λ and the supremum of the clockable ordinals by γ. A real is eventually writable when it eventually appears on the output tape during the computation of an infinite time Turing machine on input 0, never subsequently to be changed (but the machine need not halt). A real is accidently writable when it appears on one of the tapes during a computation on input 0. We say that an ordinal is eventually or accidentally writable when it is coded by a real which is, respectively, eventually or accidentally writable. We denote the supremum of the eventually writable ordinals by ζ and the supremum of the accidently writable ordinals by Σ. The results of [HamLew] establish, for example, that λ ≤ γ and λ < ζ < Σ. The proof of our Main Theorem has been considerably simplified by the recent result of Philip Welch [Wel98a] which answers what was probably the primary open question of [HamLew], namely, the question whether every clockable ordinal is writable. Let us therefore paraphrase Welch’s argument here. Theorem 1.1 (Welch) Every clockable ordinal is writable. In particular, λ = γ. Proof: By results of [HamLew], it suffices to show that ζ > γ. (The basic reason for this is that there can be no clockable ordinals between λ and ζ, indeed, between λ and Σ, for if β is clockable and accidently writable, then we can search for a real coding an ordinal which is long enough to support that computation, and halt when we find one. So β would be writable. Thus, in order to prove γ = λ it suffices to show that ζ > γ.) We begin by showing that in any computation on input 0, if a cell is 0 at Σ, then in fact it must be 0 for the entire time between ζ and Σ. Thus in fact it must stabilize before ζ, being 0 from some point on. Suppose some cell is 0 at Σ for the computation of program p on input 0. We will describe an algorithm which eventually writes a real coding an ordinal which is at least as large as the stabilizing stage of that cell, the stage at which it turns 0 never to change again before Σ. On the side, our algorithm simulates all programs on input 0, and thereby produces a steady stream of all accidentally writable reals coding ordinals. For each such real w produced, the algorithm simultates the computation of p along the ordinal α coded by w, and looks for the stage β when the values of the cell have stabilized at 0, if indeed they have stabilized before α. Using w the algorithm is able to write a real coding β. Now, the algorithm checks the output tape to see if the real on the output tape codes an ordinal at least as large as β. If so, the algorithm leaves §2 A negative solution to Post’s problem for supertasks 5 the output tape unchanged. If β is larger than what appears on the output tape, then the algorithm replaces the output tape with the real coding β. The key idea is that eventually the algorithm will see accidentally writable ordinals which are larger than the true stabilizing point below Σ, and at such a stage, we will write an ordinal which is at least as large as the true stabilizing point on the output tape. After this, the output tape will never change, because 	algorithm;cantor;characteristic function (convex analysis);code;computability theory;computable function;computation;emoticon;expanded memory;halting problem;hypercomputation;input/output;multi-function printer;oracle database;oracle machine;ordinal data;recurrence relation;recursion;recursive ordinal;recursive set;recursively enumerable set;semiconductor industry;supertask;transfinite induction;turing degree;turing machine;undecidable problem;welch's method	Joel David Hamkins;Andrew Lewis	2002	Arch.

We consider the classical cyclic polling model with exhaustive service at each queue, and with general service-time and switch-over time distributions, and study its behavior when the load tends to one. For this model, we explore the recently proposed mean value analysis (MVA), which takes a new view on the dynamics of the system, and use this view to provide an alternative way to derive closed-from expressions for the expected asymptotic delay; the expressions were derived earlier in [31], but in a different way. Moreover, the MVA-based approach enables us to derive closed-form expressions for the heavy-traffic limits of the covariances between the successive visit periods, which are key performance metrics in many application areas. These results, which have not been obtained before, reveal a number of insensitivity properties of the covariances with respect to the system parameters under heavy-traffic assumptions, and moreover, lead to simple approximations for the covariances between the successive visit times for stable systems. Numerical examples demonstrate that the approximations are accurate when the load is close enough to one.	approximation;model–view–adapter;polling (computer science)	Robert D. van der Mei;Erik M. M.

The interaction of cyber and power components will affect system reliability. This paper focuses on developing an analytical reliability model for fault detection, isolation, and service restoration for smart distribution feeders. The impact of end-to-end outage probability of data communication along with sending, receiving, and relaying communication node failures is incorporated into the model. Vulnerability of system to cyber attack as an emerging cause of reliability degradation is also investigated. An optimal placement of fault detectors and switching devices are determined in this work to improve reliability. The sum of customer service interruption cost and investment cost is considered as an objective function to be minimized. Bus 2 of the Roy Billinton test system and a typical 27-node distribution network are used to illustrate the role of communication infrastructure malfunction on the planning problem in a distribution feeder. Results and discussions show the necessity of incorporating communication infrastructure failure into the power distribution system planning problem.	byzantine fault tolerance;circuit restoration;downtime;elegant degradation;end-to-end encryption;fault detection and isolation;interrupt;loss function;network switch;optimization problem;sensor;systems design	Mohammad Heidari Kapourchali;Mojtaba Sepehry;Visvakumar Aravinthan	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2573261	embedded system;electronic engineering;fault indicator;computer science;engineering;computer security	HPC	-1.301484532831474	6.544395466002473	92642

Owing to changes in technology, the additional server may be of a service rate different from that of the existing servers. Moreover, with heterogeneous servers, consideration must be given to what service discipline should be employed. An analysis is provided of the effect on waiting time using two service disciplines (1) weighted-priority and (2) priority to the faster server.

For an expression in star normal form, the paper shows that the derivatives are either (emptyset ) or unique, while in general Berry and Sethi’s result shows the derivatives are either (emptyset ) or similar. It is known that the partial derivative automaton and the follow automaton are two small automata, each of which is a quotient of the position automaton. For the relation between the partial derivative and follow automata, however, Ilie and Yu stated that a rigorous analysis is necessary but difficult. The paper tackles the issue, and presents several results.

Such problems include determining whether an attribute is prime and testing if a schema is in normal form. Algorithms for these problems are needed in database design tools. The problems can be solved by trivial exponential algorithms. Although the size of the instance is usually given by the number of attributes and hence is fairly small, such exponential algorithms are not usable for all design tasks. We give algorithms for these problems whose running time is polynomial in the number of maximal sets not determining an attribute or, equivalently, the number of generators of the family of closed attribute sets.

Our paper describes iVMp an interactive VM placement algorithm, that allows CAs to become 'agile' capital allocators that can interactively propose and update constraints and preferences as placements are recommended by the system. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this interactive VM placement recommendation problem has been addressed in the academic literature.

The operating policy is (s, S) policy, i.e., whenever the inventory level drops to s, an order for Q(=S - s) items is placed. The ordered items are received after a random time which is distributed as exponential. The service may be interrupted according to the Poisson process in which case it restarts after an exponentially distributed time. The demands that occur during the server breakdown period or stock-out period may turn out to be ordinary or a negative demand and then they enter into the orbit of infinite size. These orbiting demands send out a signal to compete for their demand which is distributed as exponential. The matrix analytic method is used for the steady state distribution of the model. Various performance measures and cost analysis are shown with numerical results.		P. Vijaya Laxmi;L. M.

Since these backup solutions are expensive and inefficient, they form a significant proportion of the operating expenses. To address this problem, we propose using a personal comfort system (an illustrative configuration can comprise a LED light and a DC desk fan) that is powered by batteries in computing devices. With this approach, cost savings are realized through two mechanisms, (i) by reducing the dependence on high-power lighting and air conditioning during times of power outage, and (ii) by charging the batteries at optimal times, taking advantage of the variable cost of power supply. Simulations show that the expected energy savings from this methodology are in the region of 26%, compared with the current system. In this paper, we present various architectures for the load-battery combination, a dynamic programming based framework that generates optimal charging/discharging schedules, and an experimental evaluation of the proposed approach.	backup;computer simulation;diesel;downtime;dynamic programming;emergency power system;entity;experiment;fossil;inverter (logic gate);laptop;power supply;software as a service;usb	Harshad Khadilkar;Vikas Chandan;Sandeep Kalra;Sunil Kumar Ghai;Zainul Charbiwala;Tanuja Ganu;Rajesh Kunnath;Chee Ming Lim;Deva P.

In order to apply optimizations almost all conventional optimization techniques require a runtime system model. However, system models and their solution techniques vary in their strengths and limitations. For a rigid system, a single system model is acceptable. But if the system is constantly changing its structure then a rigid model is not able to represent the system properly, resulting in an inefficient use of technique in some cases. Therefore, in this paper we propose a framework for an optimization engine that adapts the optimization technique based on the system state. The adaptation involves selection of techniques based on historical statistics and current data, and dynamic generation of a model at runtime. This runtime model is then used to apply a relevant optimization technique to find a desired optimization plan for the system. We have evaluated the proposed framework on an electricity distribution system. Our results show that the proposed framework is adaptable, fast and able to manage numerous situations.	adaptive optimization;cloud computing;computer science;grand challenges;mathematical optimization;optimizing compiler;run time (program lifecycle phase);runtime system	Fahad Javed;Naveed Arshad	2009	2009 Third IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems	10.1109/SASO.2009.26	planning;adaptive optimization;real-time computing;adaptability;simulation;systems modeling;computer science;power;mathematical model;management system;management	EDA	6.5466208312073535	4.580067325659968	95715

QoS is generally used to represent non-functional properties of web services and differentiate them with the same functionality. Studying how to select appropriate services for a composition from a very large number of similar candidate services is an NP-hard problem. However, there are limitations among existing methods, e.g. poor scalability and massive calculation in the exhaustion method, slow convergence speed and easy to fall into local optimum in the traditional evolutionary computation method. Thus, in this paper, an improved fruit fly optimisation algorithm called IFOA4WSC is proposed, which is quick and effective for web service composition. We analyse the convergence of fruit fly swarms in IFOA4WSC algorithm, and carry out a large number of simulation experiments in the common and random data sets. Experimental results show that IFOA4WSC is effective and highly efficient, and has better stability against classical PSO, GA and FOA.	algorithm;quality of service	Yiwen Zhang;Guangming Cui;Shu Zhao;Jie Tang	2016	IJWGS	10.1504/IJWGS.2016.074186	real-time computing;simulation;quality of service;swarm intelligence;computer science;law;world wide web;computer network	EDA	4.35444640013663	13.81316651997154	95724

For this, queries on how the underlying system behaves may be issued. A popular setup is that of Angluin’s L algorithm[Ang87], here adapted to the case of finite-state machines, in which a minimal deterministic finite-state machine for a regular language is learned based on so-called membership and equivalence queries. Using a pictorial language, we have a learner whose job is to come up with the automaton to learn, a teacher who may answer the output for a given input string as well an oracle answering whether the automatonH currently proposed by the learner is correct or not. This setting is depicted in Figure 1(a) (though assume that the don’t know is not there). In Angluin’s setting, a teacher will always answer with the correct output symbol. In many application scenarios, however, parts of the machine to learn are not completely specified or not observable. Then, queries may be answered inconclusively, by don’t know, also denoted by ?. In the full version of this paper [GL06], we study a learning algorithm (and variants thereof), called ABSAT, ABSATI, and ABSATI2, that are designed to work with such an inexperienced teacher. The oracle, however, does not change its functionality in the setting discussed here (see Figure 1(a), the don’t know is new).	algorithm;deterministic finite automaton;experience;finite-state machine;image;machine learning;observable;regular language;turing completeness	Olga Grinchtein;Martin Leucker	2006		10.1007/11872436_30	pointer machine;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;online machine learning;machine learning;finite-state machine;computational learning theory;active learning;algorithm;virtual finite-state machine	AI	3.388953562214319	18.17271419031702	95964

Given an initial set of such independence relationships, the axioms established permits us to infer new independencies by non-numeric, logical manipulations. Additionally, the paper legitimizes the use of inference networks to represent probabilistic dependencies by establishing a clear correspondence between the two relational structures. Given an arbitrary probabilistic model, P, we demonstrate a construction of a unique edgeminimum graph G such that each time we observe a vertex x separated from y by a subset S of vertices, we can be guaranteed that variables x and y are independent in P, given the values of the variables in S .	statistical model	Judea Pearl	1986			statistical model;probabilistic ctl;computer science;machine learning;probabilistic logic;probabilistic argumentation;algorithm	Theory	-1.4370793279882892	12.161426063978793	97436

b3536cf6d429fc31a65fa078cff27f22b10beff3	algorithmic approach to minimize the energy cost of commercial buildings in developing countries		Energy costs from Heating-Ventilation-Air-Conditioners (HVAC) systems form the third largest component of the overall operational costs of commercial buildings. Moreover, in developing countries such as India where grid connectivity in remote areas is inadequate, diesel generators (DGs) are used as a source of backup power. While DGs solve the problem of power outages, the cost of energy from diesel generators is very high, typically 3 to 5 times the grid price. Although using solar power in conjunction with battery storage can offset the high costs of diesel power, the overall energy management system of the building becomes complex. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic approach that reduces the energy cost associated with HVAC systems in the presence of outages and a mix of supply side resources including grid, DG, solar and battery storage. The algorithm schedules supply resources and the HVAC by leveraging weather forecasts and the passive thermal storage capacity of the building. The algorithm is computationally light-weight and can easily be integrated with existing building management systems. Additionally, we validate its performance against an optimization framework that yields optimal solutions. We show that both the algorithm and the optimization framework yield an average savings of 20% relative to business as usual in real world scenarios such as cell towers and office buildings.	adobe air;algorithm;backup;diesel;discontinuous galerkin method;emergency power system;mathematical optimization	Kumar Saurav;Heena Bansal;Megha Nawhal;Vijay Arya;Vikas Chandan	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2017.8340738	grid;real-time computing;hvac;thermal energy storage;energy consumption;solar power;building management system;engineering;backup;energy management system	HPC	3.9375210247701578	6.323987932256735	97771

This is done in a context where the field K and the module are represented by sorts in the theory, so that constructible sets associated with a module can be interpreted in this language. The language is expanded by additional sorts for the Grassmanians of all powers of K, which are necessary to achieve quantifier elimination. The result turns out to be that the model completion is the theory of a certain class of “big” injective modules. In particular, it is shown that the class of injective modules is itself elementary. We also obtain an explicit description of the types in this theory.	elementary;quantifier (logic)	Moshe Kamensky	2009	J. Symb.

bf9bfa7888dc523c99bdd0cd3929a890a2f2bf4c	a multi-class dispatching and charging scheme for autonomous electric mobility on-demand		Despite the significant advances in vehicle automation and electrification, the next-decade aspirations for massive deployments of autonomous electric mobility on demand (AEMoD) services are still threatened by two major bottlenecks, namely the computational and charging delays. This paper proposes a solution for these two challenges by suggesting the use of fog computing for AEMoD systems, and developing an optimized multi-class charging and dispatching scheme for its vehicles. A queuing model representing the proposed multi-class charging and dispatching scheme is first introduced. The stability conditions of this model and the number of classes that fit the charging capabilities of any given city zone are then derived. Decisions on the proportions of each class vehicles to partially/fully charge, or directly serve customers are then optimized using a stochastic linear program that minimizes the maximum response time of the system. Results show the merits of our proposed model and optimized decision scheme compared to both the always-charge and the equal split schemes.	autonomous robot;fog computing;linear programming;queueing theory;response time (technology);stochastic programming	Syrine Belakaria;Mustafa Ammous;Sameh Sorour;Ahmed Abdel-Rahim	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288319	automation;real-time computing;computer network;computer science;queueing theory;response time;linear programming;edge computing	Embedded	4.9435284359133	6.285694280106608	98738

As a consequence, many proprietary solutions for “smart” energy applications are flooding the market. This turns out to be rather a problem than part of the solution for the systematic development of future energy grids. Additionally, the absence of necessary standards blocks further developments that enable the creation of novel, market-driven and hybrid control solutions. To overcome these problems, we suggest a standardized control approach for hybrid energy systems by means of a so called Energy Option Model (EOM). This unifying model and the therewith developed decision support system provides the necessary technical understanding and the economic assessment options for network-connected energy conversion systems. Thus, it can be used for single on-site systems as well as for aggregated systems that are controlled in centralized or decentralized manner. This paper presents and discusses exemplary use cases for our EOM that illustrate the centralized as well as the decentralized use of our approach within hybrid energy systems.

Therefore, this work proposes an implementable, centralized control algorithm that manages EV charging points to mitigate congestion in LV networks. To assess the need of control actions to avoid congestion issues, this work initially quantifies the potential impacts of different EV penetration levels on a real UK LV network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm, analyses for uncontrolled and controlled charging of EVs are carried out. Monte Carlo simulations (considering 1-min resolution data) are undertaken to cater for domestic and EV load profile uncertainties. Results for this particular LV network indicate that asset congestion might occur for EV penetration levels larger than 40%. More importantly, the results show the effectiveness of the proposed centralized control algorithm in avoiding the congestion effects on the LV network, even for a 100% penetration of EVs.	algorithm;centralized computing;extended validation certificate;load profile;logical volume management;monte carlo method;network congestion;simulation;transformers;uncontrolled format string	Kyriacos Petrou;Jairo Quiros Tortos;Luis F.

This paper describes a technology whereby renewable energy can be seamlessly integrated into a local network keeping the network load constant, but using all the fluctuating energy locally when it is available. This technique is a type of demand side management (DSM)whereby consumption of deferrable electric loads is adjusted in order to provide maximum utility to the electricity network without impacting the end user. Many household loads are already suitable for DSM, and with an increased uptake of EVs, a sizable amount of demand could be controlled in this manner, which could in turn significantly improve the viability of fluctuating energy sources. In this paper a new DSM scheme, termed localized demand control (LDC), has been designed, and its operation and performance is compared with the classical DSM method of dynamic demand control. It is shown that the system dynamics of both controllers are similar, but LDC is intrinsically more stable over a wider range of applications.	computation;control system;display data channel;linguistic data consortium;software deployment;system dynamics;transformer;whole earth 'lectronic link	Joshua R.

Probab. 48A:209–216, 2011b), a first exact simulation algorithm was presented for the stationary distribution of customer delay for FIFO M/G/c queues in which ρ = λ/μ < 1 (super stable case). The key idea involves dominated coupling from the past while using the M/G/1 queue under the processor sharing (PS) discipline as a sample-path upper bound, taking advantage of its time-reversibility properties so as to be able to simulate it backwards in time. Here, we expand upon this method and give several examples of other queueing models for which this method can be used to exactly simulate from their stationary distributions. Examples include sojourn times for single-server queues under various service disciplines, tandem queues, and multi-class networks with general routing.	algorithm;coupling from the past;fifo (computing and electronics);queueing theory;reversible computing;routing;server (computing);simulation;stationary process;tandem computers	Karl Sigman	2016	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-013-1408-2	m/m/1 queue;parallel computing;real-time computing;m/m/c queue;computer science;distributed computing;m/g/k queue;m/g/1 queue;fork–join queue;queueing theory;burke's theorem;g/g/1 queue	Metrics	8.489940077410589	11.410375463814129	99774

It plays a major role in the creation and the development of smart home environments. Smart homes creates home area network (HAN) to be used in different applications including smart grids. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to in-Home Energy Management (iHEM) scheme, namely EHEM, to reduce energy consumption by shifting the residents’ demands to mid-peak or off-peak periods depending on the appliances priorities and delays. The proposed system handles challenging cases by using internal storage battery. The performance of the proposed system is compared against iHEM and the traditional iHEM scheme, based on the total cost of the power consumption. Obtained results show slight improvement over the existing iHEM scheme.	home automation;rechargeable battery	Muneer O.

However, few attentions have been paid to integrate knowledge based systems into such networks. The objective of this work is to optimize the design of a distributed Fuzzy Rule-Based System embedded in Wireless Sensor Networks. The proposed system is composed of: a central computer, which includes a module to carry out knowledge bases edition, redundant rules reduction and transformation of knowledge bases with linguistic labels in others without labels; access point; sensor network; communication protocol; and Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems adapted to be executed in a sensor. Results have shown that, starting from knowledge bases generated by a human expert, it is possible to obtain an optimized one with a design of rules adapted to the problem, and a reduction in number of rules without a substantial decrease in accuracy. Results have shown that the use of optimized knowledge bases increases the sensor performance, decreasing their run time and battery consumption. To illustrate these results, the proposed methodology has been applied to model the behavior of agriculture plagues.	fuzzy rule;rule-based system	Manuel-Ángel Gadeo-Martos;Jose-Ángel Fernández-Prieto;Joaquín Cañada Bago;Juan-Ramón Velasco	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13025-0_22	knowledge base;fuzzy electronics;wireless sensor network;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;computer science;artificial intelligence;neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;data mining;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;artificial neural network;visual sensor network	Embedded	-1.593259786273745	9.736378446080208	99868

Finding the important triggers for large blackouts is the first and standard step. Next, the cascading part of the extreme event (which can be long or short) is critically dependent on the """"state"""" of the system, how heavily the lines are loaded, how much generation margin exists, and where the generation exists relative to the load. However, during large cascading events there are some lines whose probability of overloading is higher that the others. Statistical studies of blackouts using the OPA code allow the identification of such lines or groups of line for a given network model, thereby providing a technique for identifying at risk (or critical) clusters.

Our approach reveals that Rogers’ trees are canonical constructi ons which are also particularly beautiful. We also provide new theoretical results concern ing higher dimensional trees.

Firstly this paper analyzes the position of power retailers in the electricity market, and the concept of demand side aggregator was proposed. The model of incentive demand side was built. Compared with the conventional power plant(CPP), the demand response aggregator cost model is established. Considering the optional constraints of DR, the system scheduling model is established including demand response aggregator, power retailers and traditional generators to maximize the efficiency of a day-ahead scheduling strategy. Simulation results demonstrated that the demand response aggregator can replace part of the traditional power generation resources, reduce the operation cost, and reduce the wind and solar curtailment and avoid load shedding.	analysis of algorithms;demand optimization;load shedding;plan 9 from bell labs;power supply;scheduling (computing);simulation;terminator 2: judgment day	Huaguang Yan;Songsong Chen;Mingyu Dong;Xiaowei Zhou;Xinru Chen	2017	2017 4th International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI)	10.1109/ICSAI.2017.8248307	computer science;control engineering;electricity generation;news aggregator;electricity market;scheduling (computing);power station;demand response;load management;microeconomics;incentive	EDA	3.19886481188706	4.626743996807497	100252

Transactive control will provide a means of coordinating the response of smart grid assets at all levels of the power system. In simple terms transactive control may be thought of as extending the notion of locational marginal pricing throughout the power system from generation to end-use.

This is related to some of the classical combinatorial problems, such as colorings of graphs and hypergraphs, and also to recently intensively studied Constraint Satisfaction Problems. On the other side dualities are related to the descriptive complexity and First Order definability as well as to universal graphs. And in yet another context they can be expressed as properties of the homomorphism order of structures. In the contemporary context homomorphism dualities are a complex area and it is our aim to describe some of the main ideas only. However we introduce the four conceptually different proofs of the existence of duals thus indicating the versatility of this notion. Particularly we describe setting of restricted dualities and the role of bounded expansion classes.	bounded expansion;constraint satisfaction;descriptive complexity theory;yet another	Jaroslav Nesetril	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-76796-1_13	descriptive complexity theory;combinatorics;homomorphism;mathematical proof;constraint satisfaction problem;dual polyhedron;constraint graph;bounded expansion;mathematics;graph	Theory	7.179999849332218	17.478104816547294	100524

Sequential reductions may delete just one point at a time, while parallel reductions can alter a set of points simultaneously. Two reductions are called equivalent if they produce the same result for each input picture. This work lays a bridge between the parallel and the sequential strategies. A class of deletion rules are proposed that provide 2D parallel reductions being equivalent to sequential reductions. Some new sufficient conditions for topology-preserving parallel reductions are also reported.

e5d4d8d1d54361e9e063f39ca9910d9fddd192f6	battery soc management strategy for enhanced frequency response and day-ahead energy scheduling of bess for energy arbitrage		The electricity system has to balance demand and supply every second, a task that is becoming evermore challenging due to the increased penetration of renewable energy sources and subsequent inertial levels. In the UK, a number of grid frequency support services are available, which are developed to provide a real-time response to changes in the grid frequency. The National Grid Electricity Transmission (NGET) — the primary electricity transmission network operator in the UK — has introduced a new faster frequency response service, called the Enhanced Frequency Response (EFR), which requires a response time of under one second. Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are ideal choice for delivering such a service. In this paper a control algorithm is presented which supplies a charge/discharge power output with respect to deviations in the grid frequency and the ramp-rate limits imposed by NGET, whilst managing the state-of-charge (SOC) of the BESS to maximise the utilisation of the available energy capacity. Using the real UK market clearing prices, a forecasted battery state of charge (SOC) management strategy has been also developed to deliver EFR service whilst scheduling throughout the day for energy arbitrage. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm delivers an EFR service within the specification whilst generating arbitrage revenue. A comparative study is also presented to compare the yearly arbitrage revenue obtained from the model of the Willenhall and an experimental Leighton Buzzard battery storage system. Simulation results on a 2MW/1MWh lithium-titanate BESS are provided to verify the proposed algorithm based on the control of an experimentally validated battery model.

5be344df33ed1fc44384f88fbb1cc4af22286b07	a computational intelligence approach for residential home energy management considering reward incentives		The residential sector's energy consumption share is increasing in recent years. Demand response (DR) is a typical way to schedule consumers' energy consumption and help utility to reduce the peak load demand. This paper proposes a new incentive-based DR program for residential houses based on a coordinated two-level optimization framework. A central controller is used to consider the demand response potential (DRP) of the local controllers and allocates the demand reduction according to the DRP information. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm is employed to optimize the residential appliances. The thermal comfort of resident is evaluated using comfort indicator, and rewards are used to evaluate the demand response performance. The results demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed system.	algorithm;computational intelligence;disaster recovery plan;fuzzy logic;home automation;integer programming;linear programming;load profile;mathematical optimization;ritz dakota digital;virtual appliance	Zhen Ni;Priti Paudyal;Xiangnan Zhong	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)	10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285256	operations management;energy consumption;control theory;demand response;energy management;demand reduction;business;computational intelligence;integer programming;incentive	Embedded	3.604335072670059	5.17058568505651	101391

This paper reports fuel usage and exhaust emission rates from on-board measurements of 12 diesel tractors operated in real-world mowing conditions by the New York State Department of Transportation. The operating conditions and the mower type were the dominant variables determining area-based fuel consumption requirements. Fuel consumption rates were consistent across the different conventional tractor mowing equipment (sickle bar, flail, and rotary mowers), with an average fuel-consumption ± standard deviation of 5.1 ± 2.3 kg-fuel/ha roadside area mowed. Mowing over the guiderails, using a large tractor and a small cutting head, demanded an average fuel-consumption ± standard deviation of 44 ± 15 kg-fuel/ha, which is almost ten times as much fuel per unit area than other conventional mowing activities. Fuel-based emission factors (g-emission/kg-fuel) better reflect the difference across tractor technologies in terms of emission rates of criteria pollutants [e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide (NO), and particulate matter (PM)]. Fuel-based emission factors measured from the in-use tractors compared quite well with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) NONROAD emission factors and confirmed the effectiveness of the U.S. EPA nonroad standards to lower emissions from agricultural tractors. The analysis presents methods for estimating fuel usage and emissions from mowing activities and makes observations about mitigating the environmental impact of mowing activities. Study results can assist in better procurement of appropriate size tractors to yield both fuel savings and emissions benefits.	ap 42 compilation of air pollutant emission factors;cmos;carbon cycle;diesel;on-board data handling;procurement;requirement;rotary woofer	Darrell B.

The analysis of past blackouts studied by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) shows that protection relays are involved in about 75% of all major disturbances. One reason for that is the non adequate adaption of the protection systems to the changing network conditions. In particular the relay hidden failures causes relay malfunctions and unintended supply interruptions in the past.	relay	Johann Jaeger;Thomas Bopp	2011	2011 2nd IEEE PES International Conference and Exhibition on Innovative Smart Grid Technologies	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2011.6162838	reliability engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;computer security	EDA	-1.115690476824826	7.534112126985848	101799

Depending on the kind of software, there are several different license types that allow controlled access of services. The two most popular types are the fixed license, which gives access rights for an identified workstation, and the floating license, which restricts the number of simultaneous users to a certain bound. The latter of these types is advantageous when the users do not demand full-time services and occasional lack of access is bearable. The problem of deciding the number of floating licenses is studied in the present paper. Based on the expected usage profile of the software, we calculate the minimal number of licenses that guarantees that the customers get service better than a given lower bound. The problem is studied by using certain queuing models, known as the Erlang toss system, the Erlang delay system, and the Engset model. None of these analytic models consider, however, the transient period that we analyze by means of simulation and by the so-called modified offered load approximation. We also give simple formulas presenting how the number of software licenses needed to keep the probability of nonaccess below a given blocking level grows as a function of the offered load, which is the proportion of the time used in the case that all requests were successful. Results of the study may be used for setting license prices and for determining the proper number of licenses.	approximation;blocking (computing);component-based software engineering;erlang (programming language);erlang (unit);experiment;gary kimura;mathematical model;network scheduler;queueing theory;simulation;software house;software license;stationary process;user profile;workstation	Mika Murtojärvi;Jouni Järvinen;Mika Johnsson;Timo Leipälä;Olli Nevalainen	2007	IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering	10.1109/TSE.2007.1003	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;operating system;mathematical model;queueing theory;statistics	SE	7.934958177284709	10.250615460154092	101889

The integration cost can, for example, be defined as the extra costs in the rest of the system when wind power is introduced, compared with the situation without wind power. The result of the studies depends on both parameters and the method used. The aim of this paper is to structure the methods in order to get some understanding on the impact of different modelling approaches. In general, it can be noted that approximations are always needed since the integration of wind power includes so many complexities including stability of power systems, grid codes, market behaviour, uncertainties and trading possibilities. All these items have to be considered in both the wind power case and in the reference case to obtain an estimation of the integration cost.	approximation;code;ibm power systems;power supply	Stephen A.

We also prove that recurrent balanced rich infinite words are episturmian; hence they satisfy Fraenkel’s conjecture, as does a certain class of ‘almost rich’ words. Even further, we consider the action of morphisms on (almost) rich words with particular interest in morphisms that preserve (almost) richness.	link-richness;recurrent neural network	Amy Glen;Jacques Justin;Steve Widmer;Luca Q.

Arikawa and his co-workers proposed elementary formal systems as a unifying framework for formal language learning. In the present paper, we introduce advanced elementary formal systems (AEFSs), i.e., elementary formal systems which allow for the use of a certain kind of negation, which is nonmonotonic, in essence, and which is conceptually close to negation as failure. We study the expressiveness of this approach by comparing certain AEFS definable language classes to the levels in the Chomsky hierarchy and to the language classes that are definable by EFSs that meet the same syntactical constraints. Moreover, we investigate the learnability of the corresponding AEFS definable language classes in two major learning paradigms, namely in Gold’s model of learning in the limit and Valiant’s model of probably approximately correct learning. In particular, we show which learnability results achieved for EFSs extend to AEFSs and which do not.	chomsky hierarchy;encrypting file system;formal language;formal system;information extraction;internet;language identification in the limit;learnability;logic programming;negation as failure;polynomial;probably approximately correct learning;programming paradigm;prolog;time complexity;world wide web	Steffen Lange;Gunter Grieser;Klaus P.

Undirected graphs and DAGs (Directed acyclic Graphs) were used and investigated as two schemes for the purpose of representing irrelevance relations. It is known that, although both schemes can approximate irrelevance, they are both inadequate in the sense that there are rela­ tions which can not be fully represented by anyone of them. In this paper annotated graphs are defined and suggested as a new model for representation. It is shown that this new model is a proper generalization of both the fonner models: any irrelevance relation that can be represented by either one of the previous models can also be represented by an annotated graph, and there are relations that can be represented by an annotated graph but can not be represented by either one of the fonner models. The questions of whether this new model is powerful enough to represent all the irrelevance rela­ tions, as well as some other related questions, is still open.

This paper analyzes the energy consumption constitutions in different production process. It is based on the study focusing on the running state and energy saving countermeasure of the high energy consuming mechanical equipment. The research is organized by the Chinese Academy of Engineering. The high energy consumption cause is studied by investigating and analyzing the running state of the principle energy consuming equipment in oil field and the design and manufacture level of the key large equipment in cloud computing. This thesis provides concurrent data processing model for shortening the production cycle and the fuzzy weighting subspace clustering algorithm to implement the equipment comparability, applying the big data on the running status statistics and applying cloud computation analysis on the corresponding energy saving countermeasure. The proposed approach is providing the method of eliminating equipment and the advice of the research directions in order to address the energy saving counter measure issues. The findings of this paper can be referenced as the energy saving counter measure in the petroleum industry.

In some recent works of ours, we have proposed the traffic coordination in this class of systems according to a model predictive control (MPC) scheme that seeks to maximize the traffic throughput while retaining computational tractability for the corresponding scheduling problem. In this work we perform a more systematic investigation of the conditions that must be observed by the adopted MPC scheme in order to ensure the liveness of the resulting traffic. The presented results span a number of possible configurations of the underlying guidepath-based transport systems, and integrate and extend a variety of past results concerning the liveness-enforcing supervision of AGV and other complex resource allocation systems.1		Spyros A.

Most scheduling studies on cluster tools have focused on steady cyclic cycles where identical work cycles are repeated. However, as the lot size tends to be smaller, a tool has longer noncyclic operation cycles such as the start-up and the close-down. Therefore, we examine a way of scheduling for noncyclic cycles of single-armed cluster tools so as to minimize the makespan. To do this, we first analyse fundamental properties of tool behaviours including noncyclic transient cycles. Using the properties, we identify the workload of processing a lot with a number of wafers. Then, we develop the condition for which the conventional backward sequence, which is known to be optimal for cyclic work cycles, has the optimal makespan. Finally, we develop a linear programming model to find the minimum makespan of the backward sequence.	deadlock;linear programming;makespan;paging;plasma cleaning;programming model;robot;scheduling (computing);wafer (electronics);wafer fabrication;whole earth 'lectronic link	Dae-Kyu Kim;Tae-Eog Lee;Hyun-Jung Kim	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/TASE.2015.2443107	robot;database index;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;simulation;schedule;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;operating system	Robotics	9.897891194130835	5.582231714835549	103909

In this letter, we introduce an iteration method to study the key performance indicator (KPI) of closed-loop production lines with geometric reliability machines. First, analysis of two-machine loops is carried out to derive the distribution of carriers in the system. Then the larger loop systems are decomposed into multiple smaller loop lines hierarchically until two-machine loops are obtained. Through an iteration procedure, the interactions between the small loops are estimated to adjust the carrier distributions using the two-machine formula. When the procedure converges, the system KPI, i.e., line production rate, can be estimated. It is shown that the procedure is convergent and results in high accuracy of estimation. Finally, an application study at an automotive body shop is presented.	interaction;iteration	Yuan Feng;Xiang Zhong;Jingshan Li;Wenhui Fan;Shaw C.

The approach proposed in (Marzuoli and Rasetti, 2002, 2005a) relies on the (re)coupling theory of SU(2) angular momenta and can be viewed as a generalization to arbitrary values of the spin variables of the usual quantum-circuit model based on ‘qubits’ and Boolean gates. Computational states belong to finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces labelled by both discrete and continuous parameters, and unitary gates may depend on quantum numbers ranging over finite sets of values as well as continuous (angular) variables. Such a framework is an ideal playground to discuss discrete (digital) and analogic computational processes, together with their relationships occurring when a consistent semiclassical limit takes place on discrete quantum gates. When working with purely discrete unitary gates, the simulator is naturally modelled as families of quantum finite states-machines which in turn represent discrete versions of topological quantum computation models. We argue that our model embodies a sort of unifying paradigm for computing inspired by Nature and, even more ambitiously, a universal setting in which suitably encoded quantum symbolic manipulations of combinatorial, topological and algebraic problems might find their ‘natural’ computational reference model.	angularjs;hilbert space;linear algebra;model of computation;programming paradigm;quantum circuit;quantum computing;quantum gate;quantum number;qubit;reference model;semiclassical physics;symbolic computation;topological quantum computer	Annalisa Marzuoli;Mario Rasetti	2006	Natural Computing	10.1007/s11047-006-9018-4	model of computation;quantum fourier transform;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;reference model;quantum complexity theory;computer science;quantum network;open quantum system;discrete system;pure mathematics;quantum circuit;mathematics;finite-state machine;quantum computer;quantum algorithm;algorithm;quantum turing machine;quantum mechanics;quantum gate;quantum error correction;hilbert space	Theory	-2.852252769787377	12.676503343139395	105286
c0983d0fd2e2421e59b5904abd16146fc3d6c3e8	electricity storage systems and their allocation in the german power system		The need for daily electricity storage systems increases with the growing share of volatile renewable energy in the generation mix. Since the location of decentralized electricity generation (based on reneweable energy resource potentials) and electricity demand (depending on industrial facilities and population density) in Germany are geographically apart from each other, at the same time more electricity has to be transported. At certain times, this might challenge the transmission grid. Storage systems can be used for storing the surplus production of renewable energy and also help to prevent congestions in the grid. However, besides the technical feasibility there are economic criteria decisive for the installation of storage systems. These depend firstly on potential alternative technologies as gas turbines or the load shift potential of electric vehicles and secondly on the price development of storage systems. In order to estimate the future demand and the strategic allocation of daily storage systems in this context, expansion options for storage systems are implemented in the optimizing energy system model PERSEUS-NET-TS. This is a myopic material and energy flowmodel with an integrated nodal pricing approach. A mixed-integer optimization calculates the expansion and use of power plants in Germany until 2040 considering the DC restrictions of the transmission grid. Hence, the commissioning and allocation of storage systems in the German transmission grid is determined when the government target of 60 % renewable feed-in by 2040 is met. For this paper about every forth car in Germany is considered to drive electrically by 2040. When they are charged uncontrolled, directly after arrival the results are that by 2040 about 19 GW of storage systems are commissioned. Most are built closely to generation centers, but some are allocated close to bottlenecks in the transmission grid instead. When load shifting of the demand for electric mobility is allowed in terms of a controlled charging the required daily storage capacity could be reduced by more than half, so that only 8 GW are needed in 2040.

a03bfa30a20f90d9aaeab90a63a674347f66eb31	free floating electric car sharing in smart cities: data driven system dimensioning		Car sharing is a popular means of transport in smart cities. The free floating paradigm lets the customers autonomously pick and drop available cars freely, within city limits. In this work we study the different policies when designing an electric Free Floating Car Sharing (FFCS) system. This system has the need to guarantee battery charge, a time-consuming operation, for which charging stations availability becomes a key factor for the sustainability of the whole system. We harvest the data of an already operative FFCS provider, and extract information about actual users' driving patterns. We implement a trace driven simulator to replay collected users' trips and simulate car batteries consumption for different design parameters. In this work, we limit the study to a single city, Turin (Italy), where we leverage actual trips registered over 2 months. We analyse and discuss several system design alternatives: the number of charging stations, their placement, and when to force users to return cars for charge. We identify regimes where cars never discharge and users can freely drop cars anywhere, albeit they are rarely rerouted to a charging station, possibly located in a nearby area to their original destination. Surprisingly, our data shows that even few charging stations (15 or more, i.e., 6% of city areas) guarantees the system to work almost autonomously, making thus possible free floating car sharing a feasible solution with electric cars.

In this short note we prove convergence to this invariant measure: if we have an arbitrary continuous process satisfying some mild conditions as initial arrival process and pass it through an infinite tandem network of queues, the resulting process weakly converges to a Brownian motion. We assume independent and exponential initial workloads for all queues.	brownian motion	Sergio I. López	2016	J.

In conventional UC formulations, power outputs are considered fixed between two periods, yielding a staircase pattern with respect to the energy balance of the generation and demand for a typical dispatch time horizon (e.g., 24 h). However, in practice generation units that participate in frequency control may see a change in their output within a single dispatch time interval (e.g., 5 min), depending on the changes in the demand and/or renewable generation. The proposed approach considers these changes in the generation output using a linear model, and based on that, a novel UC mixed integer quadratic programming, with linear constraints and quadratic objective function, is developed which yields a more cost efficient solution for isolated microgrids. The proposed UC is formulated based on a day-ahead with model predictive control approach. To test and validate the proposed UC, a modified version of a CIGRE benchmark test system is used. The results demonstrate that the proposed UC would reduce the operational costs of isolated microgrids compared to conventional UC methods, at similar complexity levels and computational costs.	benchmark (computing);computation;control theory;cost efficiency;dynamic dispatch;linear model;mathematical model;microgrid;multistage interconnection networks;optimization problem;quadratic function;quadratic programming;uc browser	Mostafa Farrokhabadi;Claudio A.

At DAI-Labor, we have a large number of both, past and upcoming projects concerned with those two aspects of managing electric vehicles: energy and mobility. To unify and facilitate developments in those projects, we developed common domain models describing the different aspects of the e-mobility domain. Those domain models are used in many of our projects for optimising charging schedules and for ensuring the user’s mobility. c © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Hybrid and fully electric vehicles are increasingly popular, to reduce fuel consumption and gas emissions, and car makers are also starting to equip vehicles with solar panels to extend driving range. These photovoltaic installations pose many challenges, e.g., how to increase their efficiency and decide where and how the solar energy is stored.

In recent years, a large number of large-scale renewable energy farms such as photovoltaic (PV) farms have been installed worldwide and these farms provide a large amount of energy into the main grid. However, due to variability and uncertainty of renewable energies, the power grid requires strict regulations to accommodate abundant renewable energy resources. Focusing on solar energy, in this paper, we evaluate an aggregation effect of multi-site PV farms in South Korea based on 4 years' meteorological satellite images. We can expect a positive effect of PV power aggregation from multiple sites in terms of smaller power fluctuations due to any uncorrelated characteristics of solar irradiance among multiple sites placed in the distance. Furthermore, based on the evaluation results, we can find the best combination of multi-site PV farms for achieving the smallest fluctuations.	grid computing;page view;power glove;quantum fluctuation;server farm;simulation;smoothing;spatial variability;vii	Han Seung Jang;Kuk Yeol Bae;Hong-Shik Park;Dan Keun Sung	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2015.7436370	wind power;environmental engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;operations management;grid parity;photovoltaic system;smart grid;photovoltaics;distributed generation;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;intermittent energy source	HPC	2.6166302858642414	7.347915915472973	107009

By exploiting time scales, these problems can be decomposed and solved layer by layer. In the top layer, at a long time scale, with grid power price and renewable energy represented by their long-term averages, and total demand following the price-demand curve, the optimal pricing scheme is obtained. The real-time charging and discharging operation of the battery, is considered in the middle layer. With average number of customers arriving determined by the price set at the top layer, the middle layer determines the optimal amounts of energy to buy from the grid and to use for charging. At the bottom layer, the scheduling policy of EV charging is determined while satisfying the total battery consumption obtained at the middle layer. We illustrate the algorithms with a simple example using ERCOT data, demonstrating the implementability of the architectural solution in real-time market operation of an EV charging station. Simulations show that the architectural decomposition does not incur any significant cost penalty.	algorithm;extended validation certificate;holism;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);simulation	Ke Ma;Le Xie;Panganamala Ramana Kumar	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007725	simulation;engineering;electrical engineering;operations management	Robotics	3.136117424492175	4.2566702687901685	107531

We prove that every SPN can be converted into a BN in linear time and space in terms of the network size. The key insight is to use Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs) to compactly represent the local conditional probability distributions at each node in the resulting BN by exploiting context-specific independence (CSI). The generated BN has a simple directed bipartite graphical structure. We show that by applying the Variable Elimination algorithm (VE) to the generated BN with ADD representations, we can recover the original SPN where the SPN can be viewed as a history record or caching of the VE inference process. To help state the proof clearly, we introduce the notion of normal SPN and present a theoretical analysis of the consistency and decomposability properties. We conclude the paper with some discussion of the implications of the proof and establish a connection between the depth of an SPN and the tree-width of its corresponding BN.	algorithm;bayesian network;causality;graphical user interface;hidden variable theory;machine learning;probabilistic turing machine;substitution-permutation network;time complexity;treewidth;variable elimination	Han Zhao;Mazen Melibari;Pascal Poupart	2015			computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;bayesian network;mathematics;graphical model;algorithm;statistics	ML	-1.2300377159204985	12.359512174883738	107720

Electricity constitutes the largest part of energy carriers, and the power sector is identified as the key sector with great carbon dioxide mitigation potential. Therefore, power generation expansion planning (GEP) problem has drawn great attention due to its important role in global energy supply, renewable energy utilization and carbon dioxide mitigation. Several important issues, including renewable energy sources integration, operating reserve, deregulated power market, demand response and carbon pricing mechanism should be incorporated in a GEP problem. Energy system engineering provides a methodological framework to address the complex energy, economic and environmental problems by adopting an integrated systematic approach, featuring superstructure-based modeling, mixed-integer programming, multi-objective optimization, and optimization under uncertainty. Recent advances of these approaches in GEP problems related to the five issues mentioned above are reviewed and discussed in this article.	automated planning and scheduling	Siyuan Chen;Zheng Guo;Pei Liu;Zheng Li	2018	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.02.012	environmental resource management;control engineering;electricity generation;renewable energy;energy supply;sustainable development;low-carbon power;energy consumption;mathematics;greenhouse gas;demand response	AI	3.6120821698813157	7.792890900890451	107884

We show that as the capacity and the number of flows aggregated at the upstream queue increases, the overflow probability at the downstream queue converges to that of a simplified single queue obtained by removing the upstream queue from the original two-stage queueing system. Earlier work shows such convergence for fluid traffic, by exploiting the large deviation result that the workload goes to zero almost surely, as the number of flows and capacity is scaled. However, the analysis is quite different and more difficult for the point process traffic considered in this paper. The reason is that for point process traffic the large deviation rate function need not be strictly positive (i.e., I(0)e0), hence the workload at the upstream queue may not go to zero even though the number of flows and capacity go to infinity. The results in this paper thus make it possible to decompose the original two-stage queueing system into a simple single-stage queueing system.	point process;queueing theory	Do Young Eun;Ness B.

This work addresses the study of Chilean Internet robustness in how an outage at the physical layer (Internet backbone) affects the upper layer (BGP network) that routes from/to Internet Service Providers. We propose a novel way to model the Internet physical and logical networks coupled as an interdependent system, and study the effect of the shape in which the physical network is built and the interconnection level on the robustness of the whole interdependent system. We study three cases of simulated Internet structures with width and length proportions ranging from 1:1 to 1:25, where each case has the same overall area. Here 1:25 corresponds to the proportions of Chile, while 1:1 represents a square space. For each case we studied five scenarios of interdependent connections in order to determine the relation between network robustness, and its shape and interconnections. Our main findings are: (1) the shape area where physical network is located affects the overall robustness making the interdependent networks more fragile as the shape becomes narrower, and (2) this effect can be diminished on interdependent systems increasing the number of inter-links.	interdependence	Ivana Bachmann;Javier Bustos-Jiménez	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-72150-7_52	interconnection;internet backbone;the internet;service provider;robustness (computer science);physical layer;computer network;commerce;interdependent networks;ranging;geography	Vision	-3.761283338611963	6.553167344420544	108670

A hybrid energy system can include different means of generation such as renewables (e.g., solar PV, wind power) and conventionals (e.g., diesel engines) as well as energy storage systems (ESSs) such as batteries, fuel cells and flywheels. To optimally manage different energy sources in a shipboard microgrid while meeting different technical/environmental constraints, it is necessary to set up an energy management system. This paper provides an overview of hybrid shipboard microgrids and discusses different methods of power and energy management in such systems which are essential for control, monitoring and optimizing the overall system performance in various mission profiles.	air pollutants;air pollution;architecture as topic;converter device component;diesel;emergency medical service;emission - male genitalia finding;energy systems language;epworth sleepiness scale questionnaire;ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;ibm power systems;microgrid;penicillin v;preparation;rule (guideline);sephs1 gene;ships;space-filling curve	Muzaidi B.

Upon arrival, the order is queued if the inventory level is positive or, otherwise, leaves the system unserviced. One server handles the queued orders one-by-one in the sequence of their arrival. If the inventory level exceeds s, then the service time has the exponential distribution of intensity μ; otherwise, of intensity αμ, 0 u003c α ⩽ 1. The product in the inventory is consumed only at the instant when the service (of the order) ends. Inventory deficit is not allowed. When the inventory is empty new orders are not admitted into the system, and the service process of the queued orders (if any) is stopped. The lead time is assumed to be exponentially distributed.

8286d9432263bbe14d04018efbfdf43246b44f59	towards double auction for assisting electric vehicles demand response in smart grid		In the smart grid, the online double auction scheme is useful to ensure energy trading between Electric Vehicles (EVs) that have surplus or insufficient energy. In this paper we present a new online double auction scheme, which enables multi-unit energy trading among EVs. Particularly, EVs that have surplus and insufficient energy act as sellers and buyers, while the MicroGrid Center Controller (MGCC) is responsible for maximizing the market social welfare by matching buyers and sellers. We conduct a theoretical analysis and show that our proposed scheme achieves the desired economic properties. Through extensive performance evaluation, our experimental results show that our scheme can not only achieve good performance with respect to social welfare, EVs' satisfaction ratio, efficiency ratio, and computational overhead, but also help the power system shift peak load and save charging costs to the EV owners.	auction algorithm;computation;experiment;extended validation certificate;load profile;mg (editor);microgrid;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;rationality	Donghe Li;Qingyu Yang;Wei Yu;Dou An;Xinyu Yang	2017	2017 13th IEEE Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/COASE.2017.8256333	overhead (computing);electric power system;smart grid;cost accounting;load management;demand response;double auction;business;microeconomics;microgrid	Robotics	2.387695034892961	4.396868913982681	109405

The investigated approach is based on the use of standard Linear Programming (LP) algorithm in association with a coarse linear model of the microgrid. The resulting computational time is compatible with simulations over long periods of time allowing the integration of seasonal and stochastic features related to renewable energies. By using this fast scheduling strategy over a complete year of simulation, the microgrid cost effectiveness is considered. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out in order to identify the most influent parameters that should be considered in a sizing loop. Different microgrid configurations are also investigated and compared in terms of cost-effectiveness.	algorithm;computation;linear model;linear programming;microgrid;scheduling (computing);simulation;stochastic process;time complexity	Remy Rigo-Mariani;Bruno Sareni;Xavier Roboam	2017	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2015.11.010	mathematical optimization;smart grid;sensitivity analysis;statistics	HPC	4.687950513849623	4.48197985199193	109923

In this paper we investigate the computational complexity of tournament schedule control, i.e., designing a tournament that maximizes the winning probability a target player. We start with a generic probabilistic model consisting of a matrix of pairwise winning probabilities, and then investigate the problem under two types of constraint: constraints on the probability matrix, and constraints on the allowable tournament structure. While the complexity of the general problem is as yet unknown, these various constraints – all naturally occurring in practice – serve to push to the problem to one side or the other: easy (polynomial) or hard (NP-complete).	binary tree;computational complexity theory;knockout;np-completeness;polynomial;statistical model;stochastic matrix	Thuc Vu;Alon Altman;Yoav Shoham	2009		10.1145/1558013.1558044	mathematical optimization;complexity;simulation;binary tree;computer science;computational complexity theory	AI	5.650080103320153	16.026624709094442	110047

Customers of class <i>k</i> arrive to queue <i>k</i> according to a Poisson process with rate λ<i><inf>k</inf>, k</i> = 1, 2. The service times of class <i>k</i> customers at class ℓ servers are i.i.d. following an exponential distribution with mean μ<inf><i>k</i>ℓ</inf><sup>-1</sup>, ∀<i>k</i>, ℓ = 1, 2, where 0 < μ<inf>11</inf>, μ<inf>12</inf>, μ<inf>22</inf> < ∞ and μ<inf>21</inf> = 0. Hence, class 1 customers can be served at both classes of servers, but class 2 customers can only be served at class 2 servers. A FCFS queueing discipline is employed at each queue. The customer arrival and service processes are mutually independent of each other and of all resource allocation decisions.	active queue management;network scheduler;queueing theory;scheduling (computing);time complexity	Mohsen Bayati;Mayank Sharma;Mark S.

This problem is exacerbated when interarrival and service distributions are irregular. For the GI/G/1 queue, delay moments can be expressed in terms of moments of idle period I. Instead of estimating d directly by a standard regenerative estimator that we call DD, a method we call DI estimates d from estimated moments of I. DI was investigated some time ago and shown to be much more efficient than DD in heavy traffic. We measure efficiency as the factor by which variance is reduced. For the GI/G/1 queue, we show how to generate a sequence of realized values of the equilibrium idle period, Ie, that are not independent and identically distributed, but have the correct statistical properties in the long run. We show how to use this sequence to construct a new estimator of d, called DE, and of higher moments of delay as well. When arrivals are irregular, we show that DE is more efficient than DI, in some cases by a large factor, independent of the traffic intensity. Comparing DE with DD, these factors multiply. For GI/G/c, we construct a control-variates estimator of average delay in queue dc that is efficient in heavy traffic. It uses DE to estimate the average delay for the corresponding fast single server. We compare the efficiency of this method with another method in the literature. For M/G/c, we use insensitivity to construct another control-variates estimator of dc. We compare the efficiency of this estimator with the two c-server estimators above.	control variates;converge;dd (unix);queuing delay;server (computing);simulation	Chia-Li Wang;Ronald W.

On the other hand, wind energy as an alternative to thermal power plants is a clean source of energy that produces no greenhouse gas emissions, wastewaters and solid waste, and last but not least, there is no fuel requirement for WindPark. The percentage of participation of RES in the total consumption of final energy by 2020 in Macedonia should be equal to 21%. Following the principle of the promotion of sustainable regional and environmental development as direct implementation of EU policies, the aim of the study presented in this paper is to deliver a framework for spatial planning and sustainable development by detecting the potential areas for investment in wind energy sources. The study presented in this paper promotes eight potential locations for building of wind parks, presents the requirements and procedures to local and international investors, and facilitates the building of wind parks in a very short time. The evaluation of the impact analyses that wind parks may have on the environment and to offer possible mitigation techniques, this study presents the results of the detailed analysis for selection of potential locations for building of wind parks by mapping of: potential number of wind generators on selected wind parks sites; locations of neighbouring objects which might cause interaction and the effect of cumulative influence; the impact of sound emission (in terms of loudness) to local population; energy connection to existing or new energy infrastructure (layout of lines, location of substations); ground transportation and traffic infrastructure; geological aspects (terrain stability, erosion of the soil); seismological activity of the terrain, conformity of urban planning with respect to protection of natural disasters, protection of cultural and historic heritage; touristic regions, zones and locations; biological diversity including the fatalities of birds and bats from collisions with wind turbines; etc. In addition, software Arc GIS is applied also for analysis of the crossing points with respect to the existing and planned transmission power lines on 110 kV, 220 kV and 400 kV, but also with proposed oil-pipeline AMBO, constructed oil-pipeline Thessaloniki-Skopje, new proposed route of the pipeline, by applying safety measures and minimum allowed distance.	arcgis;conformity;geographic information system;power supply;requirement;sensor;tandy video information system	Melita Jancevska;Vlastimir Glamocanin	2013	Eurocon 2013	10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6625083	wind power;offshore wind power;environmental engineering;civil engineering	HCI	2.538649813281615	8.279595558871062	111029

The matching process is carried out by using a State Space Representation: a state represents a partial solution of the matching between the graphs, and a transition between two states corresponds to the addition of a new pair of matched nodes. A set of feasibility rules are introduced for pruning states associated to partial matching solutions which do not satisfy the required graphs morphism. Results outlining the computational cost reduction achieved by the method are given with reference to a set of randomly generated graphs.		Luigi P.

To accomplish this, we develop a technique for performance evaluation of cellular lines with asymptotically reliable Bernoulli machines and use it for analysis and control of LT.	asymptote;bernoulli polynomials;feedback;obedience (human behavior);optimal control;performance evaluation;point of view (computer hardware company);time complexity	Semyon M.

At the same time, in densely populated areas with high vehicle traffic, central information gathering and distribution to vehicles takes too long for providing accurate, let alone optimal routing directions (which would have to be available in due time before vehicles arrive at road intersections). Accurate information provided too late may even add to congestion problems. In this paper we present a bottom-up, multi-agent online approach termed BeeJamA (Bee-Inspired Traffic Jam Avoidance) for individual vehicle routing which, on its network communication layer, is taking advantage of our novel self — organizing network routing algorithm BeeHive/BeeAdhoc. This Swarm Intelligence based method has been largely inspired by the behavior of honey bees. As a distributed algorithm BeeJamA does not rely on global information, and scalability is not a critical issue. BeeJamA features dynamic deadlines. The quality of the algorithm has a strong impact on the acceptance rate through the drivers, for installing and operating communication features (navigators and routing-related software) as well as on driver adherence to routing directions. This, in turn, requires a high amount of flexibility for routing algorithms considering (unpredictable) resetting of destinations by drivers, making dynamic real-time reactions a critical issue. For a comprehensive and comparative realistic evaluation reflecting the aforementioned aspects/parameters we have developed a generic routing framework (GRF) which allows to run BeeJamA and other routing algorithms on different scientific or commercial traffic simulators. (Each of them serves different purposes and is therefore considerably abstracting from reality.) While we (briefly) report on extensive simulation experiments on the MAT-Sim simulator which verify BeeJamA's superior performance compared to existing models we will also outline — as part of our current research — how to create an incremental procedure for performing realistic field studies where in ever larger areas the abstract simulation is replaced, and observed, through real traffic. This imposes very strict requirements for the real-time, or online, performance of the simulator. Comprehensive results results of these altogether novel experimental investigations will be subject of upcoming publications.	control function (econometrics);distributed algorithm;experiment;internet;jam;multi-agent system;network congestion;norm (social);organizing (structure);population;real-time transcription;requirement;scalability;self-organization;shortest path problem;simulation;stepwise regression;swarm intelligence;top-down and bottom-up design;vehicle routing problem	Horst F.

The closed-form analysis is based on the roots of the underlying characteristic equation. Numerical aspects have been tested for a variety of arrival and service-time distributions and results are matched with those obtained using the matrix-analytic method (MAM). Further, a comparative study of computation time of the proposed method with the MAM has been carried out. Finally, we also present closed-form expressions for the distribution of the virtual (actual) system time. The proposed method is analytically quite simple and easy to implement.	brookgpu;computation;continuation;emoticon;system time;terms of service;the matrix;time complexity	Gagandeep Singh;U. C.

850b34ed4fd4c7f283eb1d935ebf87a420b0bdf0	algorithms and limits for compact plan representations	engineering and technology;teknik och teknologier	Compact representations of objects is a common concept in computer science. Automated planning can be viewed as a case of this concept: a planning instance is a compact implicit representation of a graph and the problem is to find a path (a plan) in this graph. While the graphs themselves are represented compactly as planning instances, the paths are usually represented explicitly as sequences of actions. Some cases are known where the plans always have compact representations, for example, using macros. We show that these results do not extend to the general case, by proving a number of bounds for compact representations of plans under various criteria, like efficient sequential or random access of actions. In addition to this, we show that our results have consequences for what can be gained from reformulating planning into some other problem. As a contrast to this we also prove a number of positive results, demonstrating restricted cases where plans do have useful compact representations, as well as proving that macro plans have favourable access properties. Our results are finally discussed in relation to other relevant contexts.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;blum axioms;computational complexity theory;computer science;decision problem;encode;fractal dimension;general frame;grammar-based code;graph (discrete mathematics);p versus np problem;pspace;padding (cryptography);polynomial hierarchy;random access;strips;single-instance storage;tower of hanoi;true quantified boolean formula;unary operation	Christer Bäckström;Peter Jonsson	2012	J.

5646bb439d8a0062df704135f1d23194b2017a19	an algorithm solving sat problem based on splitting rule and extension rule		The satisfiability problem is always a core problem in artificial intelligence (AI). And how to improve the efficiency of algorithms solving the satisfiability problem is widely concerned. Algorithm IER (Improved Extension Rule) is based on extension rule. The number of atoms and the number of clauses affect the efficiency of the algorithm IER. DPLL rules are helpful to reduce these numbers. Then a complete algorithm CIER based on splitting rule and extension rule is proposed in this paper in order to improve the efficiency. At first, the algorithm CIER (Complete Improved Extension Rule) reduces the scale of a clause set with DPLL rules. Then, the clause set is split into a group of small clause sets. In the end, the satisfiability of the clause set is got from these small clause sets’. A strategy MOAMD (maximum occurrences and maximum difference) for the algorithm CIER is given. With this strategy, a better arrangement of atoms could be got. This arrangement could make the number of small clause sets fewer and the scale of these sets smaller. So, the algorithm CIER will be more efficient.		Youjun Xu	2017	JIPS	10.3745/JIPS.02.0071	computer science;mathematical optimization;algorithm	AI	0.4793746193959239	14.097016158120022	111820

This allows for the creation of timetables with even average maximum passenger loads on individual vehicles. The maximum load attained is a load standard desired at the maximum-load stop. These timetables minimize overcrowding and produce more reliable and efficient schedules than other timetables from both passenger and operator perspectives. Thus, it will make the transit service more attractive. This paper provides a procedure for the creation of transit timetables to improve the correspondence of vehicle departure times with passenger demand. The algorithm developed yields departure times (a timetable) for vehicles to achieve an even maximum load on each vehicle and a smoothing consideration in the transition between time periods. A case study was carried out using the data of one bus route in Auckland, New Zealand, with modeling and simulation analyses. The results of the even maximum load on individual vehicles, in terms of the elimination of overcrowding and schedule adherence, exhibit significant improvement over timetables with even headways or with headways based on hourly even maximum loads.	algorithm;information system;schedule (computer science);simulation;smoothing	Avishai Ceder;Lucas Philibert	2014	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2014.2318834	simulation;engineering;transport engineering	Robotics	5.698837168516539	5.539701477775642	111840

In fact, the use of ICT to support a sustainable development already today comprises virtually all fields of our daily lives: It spans from automation and control systems in industry, the mobility sector, and households to system that motivate and enable citizens to make decision and form habits in favour of a low environmental footprint. The majority of applications focuses on electricity, transportation systems, and space heating and include issues related to smart grids, e-mobility, and home automation. Recently, the use of ICT to promote water conservation has also gained considerable attention. This development is driven by the eminent water stress in many parts of the world as well as by the considerable amount of energy that is used for water heating in countries where water is abundant.	conservation geoportal;control system;home automation;smart tv;stress ball	Thorsten Staake;Anna Kupfer	2016			energy conservation;environmental planning;psychological intervention;environmental science;information and communications technology	HCI	1.0597934821085153	8.415832598755946	112199
faed1e3ec36405c973d871b179b5a65e2a459b07	overview of modelling and control strategies for wind turbines and wave energy devices: comparisons and contrasts	wind turbines;wave energy devices;nonlinear modelling;model–based control;actuators and measurements	Increasingly, there is a focus on utilising renewable energy resources in a bid to fulfil increasing energy requirements and mitigate the climate change impacts of fossil fuels. While most renewable resources are free, the technology used to usefully convert such resources is not and there is an increasing focus on improving the conversion economy and efficiency. To this end, advanced control technology can have a significant impact and is already a relatively mature technology for wind turbines. Though wave energy systems are still in their infancy, significant benefits have been shown to accrue from the appropriate use of control technology. To date, the application communities connected with wind and wave energy have had little communication, resulting in little cross fertilisation of control ideas and experience, particularly from the more mature wind area to wave. This paper examines the application of control technology across both domains, both from a comparative and contrasting point of view, with the aim of identifying commonalities in control objectives and potential solutions. Key comparative reference points include the articulation of the stochastic resource models, specification of control objectives, development of realistic device models, and development of solution concepts. Not least, in terms of realistic system requirements are the set of physical and legislative constraints under which such renewable energy systems must operate, and the need to provide reliable and fault-tolerant control solutions, which respect the often remote and relatively inaccessible location of many offshore deployments. © 2015 International Federation of Automatic Control .

2c9f16d7e65af01cd4a367d550d2cfe5013085af	analysis of cascade fault optimization based on regional fault and traffic reallocation in complex networks		With the development of complex networks and demand for information services, more and more businesses are turning to complex networks for their hosting needs. Due to the growing service, attention must be paid to the problem of complex network cascade failures. A cascade failure is a large-scale failure caused by several small-scale failures. This phenomenon initially attracted attention in the power grid field. Currently, complex network cascade failures also deserve attention. In this paper, we focus on mitigating the impact of cascade failures. First, we propose a model to simulate the cascade fault propagation process based on a virus propagation model. We introduce an SDN control plane to the communication network to monitor the overall network. We consider regional failures and optimize traffic redistribution strategies to reduce the impact of cascade failure. Finally, we compare several simulation results based on proposed fault propagation models. The mechanism, we proposed, shows better performance in the remaining available nodes and the remaining network traffic.	cascading failure;complex network;control plane;network traffic control;simulation;software propagation;software-defined networking;telecommunications network	Lanlan Rui;Xiaomei Wang;Xuesong Qiu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2829979	telecommunications network;cascading failure;grid;cascade;information system;distributed computing;complex network;computer science;phenomenon;power-system protection	HPC	-3.24419508084934	7.273636760062515	113475

The accuracy requirement implies the need to model the system in great detail, and hence the need to address the problems of large state space, non-exponential distributions, and error analysis. The efficiency requirement implies the need for new model solution techniques, in particular the use of decomposition/aggregation in the context of a hybrid model. We describe a model for reliability prediction which meets both requirements. Specifically, our model is partitioned into fault occurrence and fault/error handling submodels, which are represented by non-homogeneous Markov processes and extended stochastic Petri nets, respectively. The overall aggregated model is a stochastic process that is solved by numerical techniques. Methods to analyze the effects of variations in input parameters on the resulting reliability predictions are also provided.	computer;error analysis (mathematics);exception handling;fault tolerance;markov property;numerical analysis;petri net;reliability engineering;requirement;state space;stochastic process;time complexity	Robert Geist;Mark Smotherman;Kishor S.

Multi-server queueing model considered in this paper allows to evaluate characteristics of the systems under much more general assumptions about the probabilistic distributions describing behavior of the system than models known in existing literature. We analyse the multi-server queue with infinite buffer and the Batch Markovian Arrival Process ( BMAP ) of customers. The servers are identical and independent of each other. Service time of a customer has phase-type ( PH ) distribution. Servers are subject to breakdowns and repairs. Breakdowns occurrence moments are defined by the Markovian Arrival Process ( MAP ). The breakdown causes a failure of any server, which is not under repair. When a server fails the repair period starts immediately. The duration of this period has PH distribution. A customer whose service is interrupted occupies an idle server, if any, and continues his/her service. If he/she does not see an idle server, the customer goes to the buffer with some probability and permanently leaves the system with the complementary probability. We derive the constructive ergodicity condition and calculate the stationary distribution and the main performance characteristics of the system. Illustrative numerical examples are presented.

27e9f60cc6b7985e8b073a1357c7fe7fafa4832f	multi-agent autonomous decision making in smart micro-grids' energy management: a decentralized approach		Current energy grids are moving toward utilization of renewable and non-polluting energy sources. Micro-grids, as an emerging means for a localized management, supervision, and control of energy production and consumption are changing the traditional centralized grid topology, making it more distributed and autonomous. However, the fluctuating nature of renewable energy systems make the energy demand control very complex. Hence, one of the challenges in Micro-grid energy control and management is to handle any deviation from the prior forecasted power generation/consumption by optimizing the usage of storage and backup generation units in a way that preserves the users’ convenience level. The majority of the proposed optimization approaches only use the centralized load shedding schemes, neglecting the effect of inconvenience it may cause to the users. In this paper, we propose a Multi-agent based decentralized algorithm for a residential grid-connected Microgrid. The focus of our work is on how to handle possible power imbalance situations with the help of an Autonomous Decentralized Multi-agent approach consisting of user agents, storage agent, and grid agent considering the users’ consumption preferences as an important factor in the decision making. We investigate the application of our proposed algorithm over a PV-based Microgrid scenario.	agent-based model;algorithm;autonomous robot;backup;centralized computing;grid computing;load shedding;mathematical optimization;microgrid;multi-agent system;user agent	Sajad Ghorbani;R.

Shared spaces constitute considerable office space area, in which most office employees perform their meetings and daily tasks, and therefore the ACs in these areas have significant impact on the energy usage of the entire office building. The cost of this energy consumption, however, is not paid by the shared space users, and the AC’s temperature set-point is not determined based on the users’ preferences. This latter factor is compounded by the fact that different people may have different choices of temperature set-points and sensitivities to change of temperature. Therefore, it is a challenging task to design an office policy to decide on a particular set-point based on such a diverse preference set. As a consequence, users are not aware of the energy consumption in shared spaces, which may potentially increase the energy wastage and related cost of office buildings. In this context, this paper proposes an energy policy for an office shared space by exploiting an established temperature control mechanism. In particular, we choose meeting rooms in an office building as the test case and design a policy according to which each user of the room can give a preference on the temperature set-point and is “paid” for felt discomfort if the set-point is not fixed according to the given preference. On the other hand, users who enjoy the thermal comfort compensate the other users of the room. Thus, the policy enables the users to be cognizant and responsible for the “payment” on the energy consumption of the office space they are sharing, and at the same time ensures that the users are satisfied either via thermal comfort or through incentives. The policy is also shown to be beneficial for building management. Through experiment based case studies, we show the effectiveness of the proposed policy.	data center;experiment;spaces;test case	Wayes Tushar;Wang Tao;Lan Lan;Yunjian Xu;Chathura Withanage;Chau Yuen;Kristin L.

One way to accommodate these rising consumption patterns involves the deployment of high capacity dispatchable, but largely unsustainable peak generation systems. To avert these extravagant costs and the likelihood of grid overload, demand response (DR) strategies can be employed to curtail overall consumption, thus reducing peak patterns. In this paper, we propose a distributed real-time DR approach. The proposed method fosters seamless cooperation between DR participants for rapid convergence to expected aggregate load curtailment, while accounting for individual consumer satisfaction needs. We assess this paper through theoretical analysis based on population game theory and simulations to demonstrate its inherent flexibility, scalability, and resilience making it attractive for practical widespread deployment.	aggregate data;convex function;convex optimization;dynamical system;evolutionary governance theory;game theory;home automation;interaction;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;linear programming;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;optimization problem;overhead (computing);real-time clock;real-time transcription;scalability;seamless3d;simulation;software deployment;stationary process	Pirathayini Srikantha;Deepa Kundur	2017	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2526651	real-time computing;simulation;economics;computer science;computer security	Mobile	1.701919207523501	5.024381971363296	114615

Preliminaries A state space a~Droach was proposed by Lee [i] as an alternative way to analyze a finite automata. Some useful algorithms associated with the state space approach were discussed by Yang and Huang[2]. Let M =(Q,Z,6,ql) be a finite(deterministic) auto-mata, where Q is the set of states,Z is the set of inputs,~ is the transition function and o. is the initial state. We consider only the binary alphabet ={o,i}. Let F be field of integers modulo 2 and F<x> be the set of all expressions of the form k f(x) = E akx , akC F which contain at most a finite number of terms containing a negative k. The mapping D : F<X>~ F<X> defined by D(z) z 2 = , z EF<x> is an automorphism of F<x>. The mapping can easily be extended from F<x> to (F<x>) n by applying it component-wise. The P-representation of a set E~E* is given by ~(E) = Z x~(W) , weE where p(A)= 0 and U(w.i)= 2 ~(w)+ i + i, i=0,1. Here A is the emoty word. be the states of a finite automata.

843058beb85bdea0f656dd82bd1fba2590fceb34	optimization mechanism of energy cluster for zero energy town		This paper proposes an optimization mechanism of energy cluster for a zero energy town (ZET), which is to maximize the efficiency of energy cluster. The energy cluster includes energy loads, distributed energy resources, energy storage systems and a connection to grids in a town. Even a town consists of a mix of zero energy buildings (ZEBs) and non-ZEBs, the town could be a ZET by using energy cluster. However, if peak power is not properly managed, the energy cost of a town may not be similarly reduced. To optimize the energy cluster in a ZET, the proposed mechanism predicts energy demand and energy generation, decides whether to import energy from grids or export energy to grids and controls the energy resources in the town. In addition, the mechanism mitigates the peak power of the delivered and exported energy.	computer cluster;mathematical optimization;optimization mechanism	Hong-Soon Nam;Seok-Jin Lee;Tae-Hyung Kim;Yoon-Kee Hong;Youn-Kwae Jeong	2017	2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190873	business;electricity generation;zero-point energy;zero-energy building;distributed generation;real-time computing;energy storage	HPC	3.1114734924439675	5.213894328519895	115089

Traditionally, however, IT and mechanical engineers have separately optimized the cyber and physical aspects of data center operations. This paper considers both of these aspects with the eventual goal of developing performance and power management techniques that operate holistically to control the entire cyber-physical complex of data center installations. Toward this end, we propose a balance of payments model for holistic power and performance management. As an example of coordinated cyber-physical system management, the energy-aware cyber-physical system (EaCPS) uses an application controller on the cyber side to guarantee application performance, and on the physical side, it utilizes electric current-aware capacity management (CACM) to smartly place executables to reduce the energy consumption of each chassis present in a data center rack. A web application, representative of a multi-tier web site, is used to evaluate the performance of the controller on the cyber side, the CACM control on the physical side, and the holistic EaCPS methods in a mid-size instrumented data center. Results indicate that coordinated EaCPS outperforms separate cyber and physical control modules.	benchmark (computing);chassis;configuration management;control system;cyber-physical system;data center;executable;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;holism;multitier architecture;power management;provisioning;service-level agreement;system configuration;systems management;web application	Hui Chen;Ping Lu;Pengcheng Xiong;Cheng-Zhong Xu;Zhiping Wang	2012	Frontiers of Computer Science	10.1007/s11704-012-2107-x	embedded system;data center;virtualization;simulation;computer science;resource management;operating system;database;cyber-physical system;computer security;computer network;energy management	OS	0.48224068420090604	5.706352735474411	115233

61ce34bde7c6691d9a8038be75407e3da6838951	on-line power management optimization of a hybrid electric vehicle with non linear mpc and battery re-charge equivalent cost		This paper proposes a power management strategy for an hybrid electrical vehicle based on the Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NLMPC) that uses an equivalent consumption cost to control the state of charge of the battery. The predictive control is formulated as a repeated solution of a finite horizon minimum consumption problem which respects input and state constraints and vehicle dynamics also including the efficiency of the gear box. The reference speed and acceleration in the prediction step of NLMPC horizon is obtained by integrating forward the dynamic equations of the vehicle model with a fast semi-analytical method that does not use information about the past behaviour of the vehicle. The corresponding demanded torque is then optimally split between the two energy sources as solution of NLMPC and used in each instant for the definition of the power management strategy. The proposed NLMPC is tested on a simplified driver simulator of the hybrid vehicle and the on-line results are compared both with conventional Adaptive-Equivalent Consumption Minimisation Strategy (AECMS) strategies and with the global optimal strategy off-line computed that serves as benchmark.	benchmark (computing);horizon effect;linear model;mathematical optimization;online and offline;power management;semiconductor industry;simulation;state of charge;time-scale calculus	Umberto Sartori;Francesco Biral;Enrico Bertolazzi;Simona Onori	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793803	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	4.769467367323911	4.730050926601872	115500

Traditional infrastructure owners will be able to take advantage of the new capabilities in order to not only better manage their costs, but also potentially increase their revenue by tapping into their flexibility of adjusting energy behaviour. The latter is of growing interest to, for instance, facility managers of municipalities who are reassessing cost-benefit issues for their infrastructures which include buildings, offices, arenas, schools, convention centres, shopping complexes, hospitals, hotels, and among other things the public lighting system.

Now, assume that we can control the service rates of these service stations and also the arrival rates to the service stations, in which the arrival rate to each service station corresponds to the total rates of demands for the products which are processed by this service station. In this paper, we develop a new model for optimal control of service rates of all service stations and also the arrival rates to these service stations in a class of Jackson networks, in which the expected value of shortest path of the network and also the total operating costs of all service stations of the network per period are minimized. The expected value of shortest path of such networks of queues is equal to the expected value of the completion time of the first product, which is an important factor in production systems. The networks of queues, which we analyze in this paper, have all specifications of Jackson networks, except they do not include M/M/C queueing systems. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The proposed algorithm reduces the peak load and the electricity bill by shifting the starting times of delay-tolerant home appliances from peak to off-peak hours. However, the maximum allowable delay of the starting time of a home appliance is constrained by a given QoE threshold. Several QoE mapping functions for various appliances were also proposed in this paper. Simulation results indicate that the proposed QoE-aware smart control algorithm significantly reduces the peak load and electricity bill while preserving the user comfort or QoE.	algorithm;cost efficiency;intermediate representation;linear algebra;load profile;simulation;summit	Mingfu Li;Cheng-Wei Jiang	2017	2017 Ninth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)	10.1109/ICUFN.2017.7993834	computer network;cost efficiency;computer science;cost of electricity by source;home automation;energy management;energy management system;electricity	EDA	3.639015072728989	4.576233781895048	116477

The input, At, is a list which specifies qualitative resistance changes between the nodes of a previously defined circuit and the output is a pair, (Pa, Pal), of sets of activated and deactivated paths, identifying the components that have changed state. The system has a layered priority approach precisely in keeping with failure mode analysis tasks and has been successfully tested in real applications.	algorithm;failure cause;failure mode and effects analysis;hazard analysis;pal	Mark H.

Holding costs are incurred for each unit of time that a job waits in the system before being served, and the objective is to minimize the long-run average cost per unit time. We first determine optimal policies for the static problem where all jobs are available simultaneously. We next characterize the optimal policies for certain problems with dynamic arrivals of jobs under the restriction that the machine is not allowed to idle. Finally, we develop a simple heuristic scheduling policy to control the machine. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our heuristic over a wide range of problem instances and to compare its performance with existing heuristics.

In this paper, a stochastic game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the optimal strategies that a power grid defender can adopt to protect the grid against coordinated attacks. First, an optimal load shedding technique is devised to quantify the physical impacts of coordinated attacks. Taking these quantified impacts as input parameters, the interactions between a malicious attacker and the defender are modeled using a resource allocation stochastic game. The game is shown to admit a Nash equilibrium and a novel learning algorithm is introduced to enable the two players to reach their equilibrium strategies while maximizing their respective minimum rewards in a sequence of stages. The convergence of the proposed algorithm to a Nash equilibrium point is proved and its properties are studied. Simulation results of the stochastic game model on the WSCC 9-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system are contrasted with those of static games, and show that different defense resources owned lead to different defense strategies.	algorithm;game theory;interaction;load shedding;nash equilibrium;simulation	Longfei Wei;Arif I.

The cost arising from the battery charging and the revenue obtained by providing the regulation are investigated and represented mathematically. Some design considerations of the aggregator are also discussed together with practical constraints such as the energy restriction of the batteries. The cost function with constraints enables us to construct an optimization problem. Based on the developed optimization problem, we apply the dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal charging control for each vehicle.

These energy sources are typically sustainable and cost-effective but are highly variable based on local environmental conditions. This variability poses many challenges to the practical deployment of DGs in the grid. In this work, a novel distributed power dispatch strategy based on bifurcation control that capitalizes upon the recent cyber enablement of the grid is proposed to effectively manage DGs implemented at the distribution substation level of the power grid. This scheme enables every participating DG to locally compute its dispatch strategy based on simple cyber signals broadcasted by the utility. Results indicate that the DGs are able to rapidly converge to the optimal economical power dispatch with significantly less concentrated computational effort and communication overhead.	bifurcation theory;computation;converge;discontinuous galerkin method;distributed computing;dynamic dispatch;heart rate variability;overhead (computing);real-time clock;scalability;software deployment;traction substation	Pirathayini Srikantha;Deepa Kundur	2014	2014 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2014.7032112	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;economic dispatch	HPC	1.8466185224591658	5.816544009764883	117734

The interarrival times of each type and the service times of each type at each station are independent random variables with general distributions, but the load on each station is assumed to be identical. A setup time is incurred when a server switches from one customer type to the other, and each server employs an exhaustive polling scheme. We conjecture that a time scale decomposition, which is known to occur at the first station under heavy traffic conditions, holds for the entire tandem system, and we employ heavy traffic approximations to compute the sojourn time distribution for a customer that arrives to find the network in a particular state. When setup times are zero (except perhaps at the first station) and additional “product-form” type assumptions are imposed, we find the steady-state sojourn time distribution for each customer type.	approximation;ergodic theory;flip-flop (electronics);network switch;population;queueing theory;server (computing);steady state;tandem computers;traffic analysis	Martin I.

These models, the equivalent rate model and the Markov chain model, provide for variable connection times between processors and memories if these times can be characterized by a discrete random variable X. The equivalent rate model, which is the simpler, requires only the first moment of X, while the Markov chain model requires the first and second moments. The models yield estimates of the bandwidth BW, the probability of acceptance Pa, and processor utilization Up. Both models give good estimates of BW when the coefficient of variation Cv of X is small. When Cv reaches 2.0 the Markov chain model still shows an error of less than 4 percent while the equivalent rate model exhibits a 50 percent error that, unlike the Markov chain model, continues to increase with increase in Cv. Finally, it is shown that BW drops significantly with increase in Cv. suggesting that processor-memory transfers should use a fixed block size if memory conflict is to be minimized.	approximation error;block size (cryptography);central processing unit;coefficient;interference (communication);markov chain;memory bandwidth;sap netweaver business warehouse;starcraft: brood war	Trevor N.

It is shown how to employ this numerical method for calculating the time-dependent quanti­ ties required by the solution process of DSPN models. The benefit of the described method is illustrated by stochastic Petri net models for two queueing systems. The evaluation of the transient behavior of the M/M/IIK queue is performed by means of a GSPN model. The steady-state solution of the E lO/D/IIK queue is obtained using a DSPN model. The presented results show that the model solutions are calculated with significantly less computational effort and a better error control by the refined randomization method than by an adaptive matrix exponentiation method implemented in the version 1.4 of the software package GreatSPN.	petri net	Christoph Lindemann	1991		10.1007/978-3-642-76934-4_21	discrete mathematics;stochastic petri net;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	SE	7.125402508506788	13.614110103612061	117906

In particular, we exploit the idea of flow equivalence to reduce the size of the model. It is well-known that flow equivalent servers lead to exact steady state solution in many cases. Our goal is to investigate the applicability of flow equivalence to transient analysis. We show that exact results can be obtained even in the tran- sient phase, but the definition of the equivalent server requires the anal- ysis of the whole original network. We propose thus to use approximate aggregate servers whose characterization demands much less computa- tion. Specifically, the characterization corresponds to the steady state equivalent server of the stations that we aim to aggregate and thus can be achieved by analyzing the involved stations in isolation. This way, approximations can be derived for any queuing network, but the preci- sion of the results depends heavily on the topology and on the param- eters of the model. We illustrate the approach on numerical examples and briefly discuss a set of criteria to identify the cases when it leads to satisfactory approximation.		Alessio Angius;András Horváth;Sami M.

10f3f2bbdc0d3ec488c36e1341008a286b23224a	optimal residential load scheduling under utility and rooftop photovoltaic units		In the smart grid (SG) users in residential sector adopt various load scheduling methods to manage their consumption behavior with specific objectives. In this paper, we focus on the problem of load scheduling under utility and rooftop photovoltaic (PV) units. We adopt genetic algorithm (GA), binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), wind driven optimization (WDO), and proposed genetic wind driven optimization (GWDO) algorithm to schedule the operation of interruptible appliances (IA) and non interruptible appliances (Non-IA) in order to reduce electricity cost and peak to average ratio (PAR). For energy pricing combined real time pricing (RTP) and inclined block rate (IBR) is used because in case of only RTP their is possibility of building peaks during off peak hours that may damage the entire power system. The proposed algorithm shift load from peak consumption hours to off peak hours and to hours with high generation from rooftop PV units. For practical consideration, we also take into consideration pricing scheme, rooftop PV units, and ESS in our system model, and analyze their impacts on electricity cost and PAR. Simulation results show that our proposed scheduling algorithm can affectively reflect and affect users consumption behavior and achieve the optimal electricity cost and PAR.

Especially in complex real-world systems such as electric power grids, dynamic problems occur where robust solutions need to be found that enable (near-) optimal control over time in volatile as well as uncertain power grid operation. The authors of this work identified the application of policy-function approximation for suchlike problems. Here, an analytic function is aimed to be found, that takes a state of the dynamic system as input and directly derives control actions that lead to approximate optimal operation at runtime, without the need of doing imbedded optimisation. Applying this approach to two popular and scientifically challenging problem classes in power grids research, this work aims at providing a general view on this optimisation concept. Therefore, a dynamic generation unit control task will be experimentally treated on the one hand, while dynamic load control under uncertainty with electric vehicles represents the second use case. Both applications are related to dynamic stochastic optimal power flow problems. Hence, this paper shows the successful application of policy-function approximation to this problem domain.	approximation algorithm;dynamical system;experiment;flow control (data);generic function;load management;mathematical optimization;metamodeling;operations research;optimal control;problem domain;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;software deployment;uninterruptible power supply;world-system	Stephan Hutterer;Michael Affenzeller	2015	IJSPM	10.1504/IJSPM.2015.071379	control engineering;mathematical optimization;simulation;uncertainty;computer science;artificial intelligence;statistics	Robotics	6.6609733699759905	4.378878900352993	118765

Thus, government regulatory agencies, academicians, and various industries have a heightened interest in IT data centers. Because almost all the electrical energy consumed in a data center is released in the form of heat, the energy required for cooling the data center contributes to a major fraction of the total data center energy consumption and is the focus of this study. Traditional data center facilities utilize vapor-compression refrigeration chiller plants, heat exchanger-based room air conditioners, pumps, and evaporative cooling towers. In servers, air cooling via heat sinks and fans is used for heat extraction and heat rejection into the room. Holistic thermodynamic models are developed using system and component physics to facilitate the prediction of the energy consumption and heat-transfer phenomenon in a data center. These models help technologists understand the distribution of energy consumption for cooling purposes among various components of a facility. Finally, we provide a summary of the emerging trends in data center thermodynamics.		Roger R. Schmidt;Madhusudan K.

The arrival processes are Poisson. Classes differ with respect to arrival rates and service time distributions. Moreover, classes have different priority levels. All jobs present are served simultaneously but the fraction of the server’s capacity allocated to each one of them is proportional to their class priority parameter (while the total capacity is of course fixed). For the case of exponential service requirements, we find the mean sojourn times of various job classes, conditioning on the system’s state, namely how many of each class are present. Next we derive the well-known system of linear equations solved by the unconditional values. We then switch to the much weaker assumption of phase-type service requirements, different across classes, where additionally the priority parameters may depend both on class and phase (and not only on class as assumed in existing papers). We determine mean sojourn times for a job belonging to any class, firstly conditional on the numbers of jobs from all classes present (which are shown to be affine functions) and secondly, unconditionally (as solutions of a system of linear equations). 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In order to cope with the possibly occurring voltage limit violation, the active power injected by the distributed generators is typically curtailed, being, however, such an approach suboptimal from an economical point of view and presenting several other disadvantages. To address this issue, the online management and coordination of the reactive power injected/absorbed by the distributed generators acting on the grid are proposed here. The approach is based on command governor ideas that are used here to optimally solve constrained voltage control problems in both centralized and distributed ways. The approach foresees an active coordination between some controllable devices of the grid, e.g., distributed generators and MV/high voltage transformers, in order to maintain relevant system variables within prescribed operative constraints in response to unexpected adverse conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is more effective than approaches suggested by the current Italian norms on DGs connection.	centralized computing;definite clause grammar;discontinuous galerkin method;heart rate variability;point of view (computer hardware company);simulation;transformers	Alessandro Casavola;Francesco Saverio Tedesco;Maurizio Vizza	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2017.2655460	control engineering;electronic engineering;power control;engineering;electrical engineering;smart grid;ac power;voltage optimisation;voltage regulation	HPC	2.212335437539281	6.1883599357901025	119653
f4befcdb91f71dd6bb855ecc2dc6b7366c3914a0	a data-driven stochastic optimization approach to the seasonal storage energy management		Several studies in the literature have shown the potential energy savings emerging from the cooperative management of the aggregated building energy demands. Sophisticated predictive control schemes have recently been developed that achieve these gains by exploiting the energy generation, conversion, and storage equipment shared by the building community. A common difficulty with all these methods is integrating knowledge about the long term evolution of the disturbances affecting the system dynamics (e.g., ambient temperature and solar radiation). In this context, the seasonal storage capabilities of the system are difficult to be optimally managed. This letter addresses this issue by exploiting available historical data to: (i) construct bounds that confine with high probability the optimal charging trajectory of the seasonal storage and (ii) generate a piece-wise affine approximation of the value function of the energy stored in the seasonal storage at each time step. Using these bounds and value functions, we formulate a multistage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption of the system. In a numerical study based on a realistic system configuration, the proposed method is shown to operate the system close to global optimality.	bellman equation;linear approximation;mathematical optimization;multistage amplifier;numerical analysis;optimization problem;stochastic optimization;system configuration;system dynamics;with high probability	Georgios Darivianakis;Annika Eichler;Roy S.

The HVAC system considered comprises two rooftop units that each provide cool air to two zones. The compressor, fan and expansion valve of each rooftop unit are controlled by three inner loop proportional-integral (PI) controllers to meet specified control requirements. The objective is to determine the optimal supply air temperature setpoint for each rooftop unit that minimizes the overall power consumption of the units. In addition, each setpoint must satisfy the control objectives of the three inner loop PI controllers.

In addition to the reduction of capital investment (cap-ex), power shaving also helps cut the electricity bills (op-ex) of a data center by reducing the high utility tariffs related to peak power. However, existing work on power shaving focuses exclusively on electrical ESDs (e.g., UPS batteries) to shave the server-side power demand. In this paper, we propose TE-Shave, a generalized power shaving framework that exploits both UPS batteries and a new knob, thermal energy storage (TES) tanks equipped in many data centers. Specifically, TE-Shave utilizes stored cold water or ice to manipulate the cooling power, which accounts for 30-40 percent of the total power cost of a data center. Our extensive evaluation with real-world workload traces shows that TE-Shave saves cap-ex and op-ex up to $2,668/day and $825/day, respectively, for a data center with 17,920 servers. Even for future data centers that are projected to have more efficient cooling and thus a smaller portion of cooling power, e.g., a quarter of today's level, TE-Shave still leads to 28 percent more savings than existing work that focuses only on the server-side power. TE-Shave is also coordinated with traditional TES solutions for further reduced op-ex, and integrated with processor throttling to cap the power draw (i.e., power capping). Our hardware testbed results show that TE-Shave can improve the system performance up to 23 percent.	computer cooling;control knob;data center;frequency capping;rsvp-te;server (computing);server-side;test engineer;testbed;tracing (software);uninterruptible power supply	Wenli Zheng;Kai Ma;Xiaorui Wang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.2015.2394381	embedded system;data center;operating expense;computer science;operating system;thermal energy storage;capital expenditure;server	Arch	3.3141921913912418	6.414734991138823	120102

However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy generations hinders the reliable operation of microgrids. Besides the commonly adopted methods such as deploying energy storage system (ESS) and supplementary fuel generator to address the intermittency issue, energy cooperation among microgrids by enabling their energy exchange for sharing is an appealing new solution. In this paper, we consider the energy management problem for two cooperative microgrids each with individual renewable energy generator and ESS. First, by assuming that the microgrids’ renewable energy generation/load amounts are perfectly known ahead of time, we solve the off-line energy management problem optimally. Based on the obtained solution, we study the impacts of microgrids’ energy cooperation and their ESSs on the total energy cost. Next, inspired by the off-line optimization solution, we propose online algorithms for the real-time energy management of the two cooperative microgrids. It is shown via simulations that the proposed online algorithms perform well in practice, have low complexity, and are also valid under arbitrary realizations of renewable energy generations/loads. Finally, we present one method to extend our proposed online algorithms to the general case of more than two microgrids based on a clustering approach.	cluster analysis;computer data storage;mathematical optimization;microgrid;online algorithm;online and offline;real-time clock;simulation	Katayoun Rahbar;Chin Choy Chai;Rui Zhang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2600863	computer science;intermittent energy source	Embedded	3.841783166888041	4.53622047847274	120391
ad19ae55e1ff2beb8e1d81bbee8ef726e94d60fb	discrete time model of a two-station one-buffer serial system with inventory level-dependent operation		Abstract The paper deals with the discrete-time discrete-state modeling of two-station one-buffer serial systems in which the condition of the first station (operative/idle) is controlled according to the inventory level of the intermediate buffer. Briefly, the first station is forced to remain idle each time the buffer fills up until it empties to a predefined inventory level (referred to as restarting-inventory level ). Previous works have proved that this control policy, called restart policy , is effective when outage costs (e.g., waste production) are generated each time the first station restarts production after an interruption. While the works currently available in the literature assume that the buffer has to become completely empty before allowing the first station to resume production, the proposed paper develops a new analytical Markov model in which the restarting-inventory level can be greater than zero and arbitrarily set in the range 2 , N - 2 , where N is the buffer size. The proposed model is solved in closed form by means of a partitioning procedure and a solution technique described in detail. Then, the most important performance measures are obtained as a function of the restarting-inventory level, the buffer size and the reliability parameters of both stations. Finally, some numerical results are discussed in order to validate the model and draw some concluding remarks about the values of the restarting-inventory level which maximize the effective efficiency of the system.

457e8f4b495c11fee20f201a53e6a3081a35130a	battery energy storage scheduling for optimal load variance minimization		Generation portfolio can be significantly altered due to the deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) in distribution networks and the concept of microgrid. Generally, distribution networks can operate in a more resilient and economic fashion through proper coordination of DER. However, due to the partially uncontrollable and stochastic nature of some DER, the variance of net load of distribution systems increases, which raises the operational cost and complicates operation for transmission companies. This motivates peak shaving and valley filling using energy storage units deployed in distribution systems. This paper aims at theoretical formulation of optimal load variance minimization, where the infinity norm of net load is minimized. Then, the problem is reformulated equivalently as a linear program. A case study is performed with capacity-limited battery energy storage model and the simplified power flow model of a radial distribution network. The influence of capacity limit and deployment location are studied.	digital distribution;empirical risk minimization;linear programming;load management;mathematical optimization;microgrid;portable c compiler;proof-carrying code;radial (radio);regular expression;scheduling (computing);software deployment;storage model;turing completeness	Yichen Zhang;Alexander Melin;Mohammed M.

To analyze the security of these systems, we need a complexity theory which is less worst-case oriented and which takes into account the extra conditions imposed on the problems to make them cryptographically useful. In this paper we consider the two classes of one-to-one and onto knapsack systems, analyze the complexity of recognizing them and of solving their instances, introduce a new complexity measure (median complexity), and show that this complexity is inversely proportional to the density of the knapsack system. The tradeoff result is based on a fast probabilistic knapsack solving algorithm which is applicable only to one-to-one systems, and it indicates that knapsack-based cryptographic systems in which one can both encrypt and sign messages are relatively insecure. We end the paper with new results about the security of some specific knapsack systems.	algorithm;ampersand;best, worst and average case;blum axioms;computational complexity theory;encryption;knapsack problem;kolmogorov complexity;np-completeness;one-to-one (data model)	Adi Shamir	1979		10.1145/800135.804405	continuous knapsack problem;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;integer programming;data structure;cryptography;analysis of algorithms;theoretical computer science;change-making problem;mathematics;orthogonal polynomials;coding;computer applications;knapsack problem;algorithm	Crypto	7.629832386898907	18.145260425623217	120997

An intriguing idea that was recently proposed is to use a fleet of electrically-assisted bicycles (eBikes) to model the usage and charging patterns of a fleet of EVs at a much lower pricepoint. In this paper, we make a first attempt to explore this idea using usage data from an EV field trial and an eBike field trial taking place in the same city. Unfortunately, we find that for most features of interest, our eBike and EV datasets are statistically different. However, since both datasets were based on only 10-30 participants, further research into this question is required as more data become available.	battery charger;distortion;electric sheep;extended validation certificate;futures studies;population;real life;system on a chip;usage data	Simon Dominik Fink;Lukasz Golab;Srinivasan Keshav;Hermann de Meer	2017		10.1145/3077839.3078464		HCI	4.616898483460272	9.347829755471267	121191

For certain special cases, the new algorithm is faster than the """"Lifting Algorithm"""" described in [1]. Moreover, the new approach is based on different ideas and in fact exploits several properties of Horn constraint systems (HCS) which are not known to be part of the literature. In the case of constraints of bounded width (corresponding to """"loosely coupled"""" systems), our algorithm can be modified to run in O(n3+mċn+ mċn2/log(max(m,n))) time. Our main result establishes that checking the feasibility of an HCS can be reduced to three subproblems: negative-cost cycle detection in networks (NCCD), matrix-vector multiplication (MV), and the conversion of an HCS to a non-redundant set of difference constraints (H2D). The MV and NCCD problems have been extremely well-studied, and specialized, fast algorithms exist for relevant special cases. We have identified a new problem, H2D, which warrants future research, since improved algorithms for H2D could be implemented in our algorithm to decrease the running time."""	algorithm	K.

Based on load forecasts provided one day in advance, DG reactive power is dispatched on the hour in coordination with the switching operations of an on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitors (SCs). This aims to reduce not only distribution line power losses but also the number of switching operations of the OLTC and the SCs, which affect the feeder voltage quality and switching device lifetime. For the reactive power dispatch, a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem is formulated using a multiobjective function and solved using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Modules using evolutionary and dynamic programming are incorporated into the PSO algorithm to be less susceptible to becoming trapped in local optima and have a better chance of reaching global optimum. Simulation case studies using small- and large-scale distribution networks were performed using MATLAB to demonstrate that the coordinated reactive power support of the DGs, OLTC, and SCs can achieve the objective effectively, resulting in improved voltage quality.	computation;davis–putnam algorithm;discontinuous galerkin method;discretization;distributed shared memory;dynamic dispatch;dynamic programming;expectation propagation;global optimization;local optimum;matlab;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;phasor;simulation;smart meter;steady state;time complexity;voltage regulation	Young-Jin Kim;James L.

The service and vacation times are exponentially distributed. The server begins service if there are at least c units in the queue and the service takes place in batches with a minimum of size a and a maximum of size b (a ≤ c ≤ b). At service completion instant, if the queue size is less than c but not less than a secondary limit a, the server continues to serve and takes vacation if the queue size is less than a – 1. The server is in change over period whenever the queue size is a – 1 at service completion instant and c – 1 at vacation completion instant. The steady state queue length distributions at both arbitrary and pre-arrival epochs are obtained and an optimal cost policy is presented with some numerical experiences for some particular values of the parameters using genetic algorithm.	emoticon	P.

Design/methodology/approach – Based on the study of cascading failure models of complex power networks, an extended dynamical cascading failure model is proposed. Based on this model, two representatives of the complex power grids, the small-world network and the scale-free network, were simulated for line cascading failure. The power loss caused by cascading failures and the spreading speed of cascading failure are discussed. Findings – Power loss caused by cascading failures in the small-world network is much larger than that in the scale-free network, and the speed of cascading failure propagation in the small-world network is much faster than that in the scale-free network. Research limitations/implications – The establishment of the dynamical cascading failure model considering other protection devices needs further study. Practical implications – The results of this study can be beneficial in system planning and upgrading. Originality/value – An extended dynamical cascading failure model is proposed and cascading failures in different topology of power grid are discussed.	cascading failure;dynamic dispatch;dynamical system;failure cause;instability;linear algebra;nl (complexity);rationality;simulation;software propagation;suicidegirls;triangulated irregular network	Lijie Ding;Yijia Cao;Guangzeng Wang;Meijun Liu	2011	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684921111142359	simulation;cybernetics;cascading failure;computer science;artificial intelligence;distributed computing;interdependent networks;failure mode and effects analysis	HPC	-2.9892397105180537	7.385102891346425	122684

Arrivals of both positive customers and negative customers are two independent Poisson processes. A breakdown at the busy server is represented by the arrival of a negative customer which causes the customer being in service to be lost. The server takes a vacation of random length after an exponential time when the server is up. We develop a new method to discuss the stable condition by finding absorb distribution and using the stable condition of a classical M/G/1 queue. By applying the supplementary variable method, we obtain the steady-state solutions for both queueing measures and reliability quantities. Moreover, we investigate the stochastic decomposition law. We also analyse the busy period of the system. Some special cases of interest are discussed and some known results have been derived. Finally, an application to cellular mobile networks is provided and the effects of various parameters on the system performance are analysed numerically.	cobham's thesis;markov chain;numerical analysis;queueing theory;server (computing);steady state;stochastic process;time complexity	Jinbiao Wu;Xiaoling Yin	2011	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2011.07.018	m/m/1 queue;markov chain;m/d/c queue;real-time computing;m/m/c queue;m/m/∞ queue;poisson process;computer science;m/d/1 queue;reliability;mathematics;distributed computing;computer performance;m/g/k queue;m/g/1 queue;fork–join queue;d/m/1 queue;steady state;g/g/1 queue;statistics	Metrics	8.278421764089549	11.097660808369493	122828

Firstly, the potential of EVs to provide regulating and operating reserve power is investigated. Secondly, EVs' potential as energy storage system is considered. A real time electricity price signal which depends on the fluctuating wind power generation is used to provide incentives for EVs charging. The case of Shenzhen city which is expected to be a forerunner of massive EVs deployment in China is preliminarily studied to estimate the potential of EVs under 2050 scenario assuming 17% wind penetration. Result shows that about 15.25% of plugged EVs could meet the increased regulating reserve need, and 46.70% could satisfy the increased operating reserve need when 50% of EVs is plugged into grid at the same moment. In addition, EVs have the potential to provide back-up power for wind shortage and absorb the excess wind power as energy storage system.	backup;computer data storage;offset binary;software deployment;uninterruptible power supply	Ying Li;Zofia Lukszo;Margot P.

Thus far, the literature has solely focused on the problem of privately aggregating energy reports and has not addressed the privacy threats that can occur through other intelligent operations which take place in the smart grid, such as planning the energy distribution.  In this paper, we propose a novel solution that enables the planning of energy distribution in the grid without leaking any information about the energy requests of individual smart meters. We also implement a prototype based on our proposal and we evaluate its performance in realistic deployment settings.	privacy;prototype;query expansion;smart tv;smart meter;software deployment	Tassos Dimitriou;Ghassan O.

The durations of periods of interruption constitute a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables. Independently, the times measured from the termination of one period of interruption to the beginning of the next form a sequence of independent, exponentially distributed random variables. Preempted customers resume service at the terminations of interrupt periods.		François Baccelli;Edward G.

Cost reduction and frequency regulation are among the major concerns in this context. This paper aims to study the mutual impacts of these issues and to propose an integrated mathematical framework in order to achieve minimum costs while maintaining frequency-regulation requirements. Inspired by the operational practices and requisites of the real-world microgrid applications, different methods of frequency control are reviewed and discussed. This is followed by developing adequate models for the different types of frequency-regulation mechanisms in the framework of the microgrid generation scheduling problem. The application of the proposed methodology to the Bella Coola microgrid in British Columbia, Canada, is explained, and several numerical results are presented and discussed.	columbia (supercomputer);control system;microgrid;numerical analysis;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Amir H.

It is shown how the configuration affects the optimal size of the ESS. The problem of optimal sizing of the storage system for the PECB is formulated and solved for a specific set of vehicle parameters, battery, and ultracapacitor cell data, as well as a specific daily drive cycle. A modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimal sizing problem. The optimization platform developed by the authors and used for this study is highly flexible and accepts different component data, vehicle parameters, and drive cycles as the input for determining the optimal sizes of the storage system.	algorithm;computer data storage;discretization;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;nonlinear system;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;plug-in (computing);qualitative comparative analysis;rechargeable battery;sampling (signal processing)	Amir Ostadi;Mehrdad Kazerani	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2371912	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;capacitor;engineering;electrical engineering;supercapacitor;energy storage	Embedded	5.0264224061409335	4.898972306351791	123642

It is known that these disciplines do not satisfy the well-known branching property in polling system, therefore, hardly any exact result exists in the literature for them. Our strategy is to apply an iterative scheme that is based on relating in closed-form the joint queue-length at the beginning and the end of a server visit to a queue. These kernel relations are derived using the theory of absorbing Markov chains. Finally, we will show that our tool works also in the case of a tandem queueing network with a single server that can serve one queue at a time.	autonomous robot;bandlimiting;iterative method;markov chain;queueing theory;server (computing);tandem computers;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ahmad Al Hanbali;Roland de Haan;Richard J.

The fundamental idea behind the system is that a large number of small local decisions taken all in all have great impact on the overall system performance.

Calls from a node can either all be accepted or all be rejected by the service system. Two models are considered. In the first model a call can be rejected independent of the state of the system when the call arrives. In the second model, an arriving call can be rejected only if it finds the server busy. The queueing systems are analyzed for both models. A greedy heuristic is developed which, parametrically in the arrival rate of calls, determines the location of the server and the rejection strategies at nodes. Extreme case analysis with respect to the arrival rate is investigated. A numerical example illustrates our results. Our major observation is that the rejection strategies for calls are dependent on the arrival rate, and the choice of model.	rejection sampling	Rajan Batta	1988	Transportation Science	10.1287/trsc.22.3.209	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;operations management;mathematical model;mathematics;queueing theory;location;statistics;computer network	Vision	8.662192463813597	9.31129021044208	125083

This approach gives the stationary buffer content distribution in terms of the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order one. By using a suitable integral representation for this Bessel function we show that our results coincide with the ones of Virtamo and Norros.		Ivo J. B. F.

The common ground to this problems is satisfying proximity queries with an abstract metric database. In this paper we introduce a new technique for making practical indexes for metric range queries. This technique improves existing algorithms based on pivots and signatures, and introduces a new data structure, the Fixed Queries Trie to speedup metric range queries. The result is an O(n) construction time index, with query complexity O(n), α ≤ 1.

548cf21af92dd17fc436d635f9872bcee4e34ffd	hierarchical energy management strategy for a community of multi smart homes		In this paper., a hierarchical energy management strategy for a community of multiple smart homes is proposed. This strategy reduces the stress on the power grid caused by uncoordinated energy scheduling of smart homes. Different stochastic operational conditions for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)and household battery storages are considered. First., cost-effective day-ahead energy schedules under these operational conditions are calculated by individual home energy management systems (HEMSs). Then., a centralized decision making unit determines the day-ahead schedule for each household with the aim of reducing the stress on the grid. Comprehensive results obtained from simulations show that the proposed hierarchical energy management strategy not only maintains a low energy purchase cost for each individual household., but also smooths the overall grid power profile requested by all smart homes combined.

In this short paper we show that for a left-regular grammar G we can obtain a right-regular grammar G’ (which is by definition in Greibach normal form) which left-to-right covers G (in this case left parses of G’ can be mapped by a homomorphism on right parses of G. Moreover, it is possible to obtain a context-free grammar G” in Greibach normal form which right covers the left-regular grammar G (in this case right parses of G” are mapped on right parses of G).

M. Wein (1992) addressed the problem of scheduling a network of queues. Given a multistation, multiclass queueing network, the problem involves deciding when to release a job to the network as well as how to sequence jobs at each machine in the network to meet a desired throughput level. By approximating this problem by a control problem involving Brownian motion, Wein derived effective heuristics, which easily outperformed traditional work release and sequencing rules. However, Wein's work release rules are complex and his sequencing rules are dynamic. In this paper, we test the performance of a simpler work release policy based on CONWIP (constant work-in-process) in conjunction with static sequencing rules. The results of our simulation study indicate that this simple work release rule can be effective.

Currently, many proposals have leveraged energy storage devices (in the form of UPS batteries) to provide buffered energy during peak power demands for reducing data center power cost. In addition, energy storage devices are also used to smooth out power supply variation in renewable energy powered data centers for effectively cutting down carbon emissions. However, a joint management of peak power shaving and renewable energy harvesting in data centers is still lacking. Existing schemes either incur green energy efficiency degradation or sacrifice data center availability and workload performance. In this paper, we propose a novel power delivery scheme Re-UPS, which is based on existing UPS infrastructures and employs renewable energy to cap peak power consumption and carbon emission in data centers.

While most of the prior works in the literature are successful in achieving power system optimality, i.e, minimizing the total system cost or minimizing the demand profile peak-to-average ratio, most of them ignore the significance of customers' role in achieving the system objectives. Devising a fair billing mechanism is of a major importance to incentivize customers to contribute to the system. In this paper, an optimal billing mechanism that charges customers fairly based on their power consumption while rewards them based on their commitment and contribution to achieve the optimal energy consumption scheduling is proposed. Simulation results confirm that the proposed mechanism can enhance the fairness level of the system while maintaining its optimality.	autonomous robot;conformity;electronic billing;ftc fair information practice;fairness measure;scheduling (computing);simulation	Tasneem Assaf;Ahmed Hesham Osman;Mohamed Hassan	2016	2016 UKSim-AMSS 18th International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation (UKSim)	10.1109/UKSim.2016.67	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;operations management	Robotics	2.410885925264737	4.233806622427887	126534

This paper focuses on proposing scalable, efficient and simple thermal control approach based on imprecise knowledge of buildings’ specificities. Its main principle is a weak data-dependency which ensures the scalability and simplicity of our thermal enhancement approach. For this, an extended thermal qualitative model is proposed. It is based on a qualitative description of influences that actions’ parameters may have on buildings’ thermal performances. Our thermal qualitative model is enriched by collecting and assessing previous thermal control performances. Thus, an approximate reasoning for a smart thermal control becomes effective based on our extended thermal qualitative model.	approximation algorithm;data dependency;performance;scalability	Afef Denguir-Rekik;François Trousset;Jacky Montmain	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08795-5_43	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;machine learning	AI	6.267277792065924	6.922720009269473	126736
0496e409306b8cdc90154ff4bd1db77c3cd67cc1	running genetic algorithms in the edge: a first analysis		Nowadays, the volume of data produced by different kinds of devices is continuously growing, making even more difficult to solve the many optimization problems that impact directly on our living quality. For instance, Cisco projected that by 2019 the volume of data will reach 507.5 zettabytes per year, and the cloud traffic will quadruple. This is not sustainable in the long term, so it is a need to move part of the intelligence from the cloud to a highly decentralized computing model. Considering this, we propose a ubiquitous intelligent system which is composed by different kinds of endpoint devices such as smartphones, tablets, routers, wearables, and any other CPU powered device. We want to use this to solve tasks useful for smart cities. In this paper, we analyze if these devices are suitable for this purpose and how we have to adapt the optimization algorithms to be efficient using heterogeneous hardware. To do this, we perform a set of experiments in which we measure the speed, memory usage, and battery consumption of these devices for a set of binary and combinatorial problems. Our conclusions reveal the strong and weak features of each device to run future algorihms in the border of the cyber-physical system.	genetic algorithm	Luis Antonio Rivera Alvarado;Enrique Alba	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-00374-6_24	genetic algorithm;evolutionary algorithm;cloud computing;decentralized computing;zettabyte;metaheuristic;computer science;optimization problem;distributed computing;edge computing	Theory	2.9584117501050233	11.235278245884738	126756

Sequential machine decomposition consists in representation of a given machine as a network of collaborating partial machines that together realize behavior of the given machine. A good understanding of possible decomposition structures and of conditions under which the corresponding structures exist is a prerequisite for any adequate circuit or system synthesis. The paper discusses the theory of general decomposition of incompletely specified sequential machines with multistate behavior realization. The central point of this theory is a constructive theorem on the existence of the general decomposition structures and conditions under which the corresponding structures exist. The theory of general decomposition presented in this paper is the most general known theory of the binary, multi-valued and symbolic sequential and combinational discrete network structures. The correct circuit generator defined by the general decomposition theorem covers all other known structural models of sequential and combinational circuits as its special cases. Using this theory, in recent years we developed a number of effective and efficient methods and EDA tools for sequential and combinational circuit synthesis that consistently construct much better circuits than other academic and commercial state-of-the-art synthesis tools. This demonstrates the practical soundness of our theory. This theory can be applied to any sort of binary, multi-valued and symbolic systems expressed as networks of relations, functions or sequential machines, and can be very useful in such fields as circuit and architecture synthesis of VLSI systems, knowledge engineering, machine learning, neural network training, pattern analysis, etc.		Lech Józwiak;Aleksander Slusarczyk	2004	Journal of Systems Architecture	10.1016/j.sysarc.2003.11.002	embedded system;parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;knowledge engineering;distributed computing;sequential logic;combinational logic;algorithm	Arch	1.45732655795278	13.91155930590853	127211

When clouds are moving over PV panels, it will result in a significant voltage drop. Aimed at this case, electric vehicle (EV) can be a strategic source to mitigate the effects of voltage drop on account of the fluctuating cloud cover in PV micro-grid. This paper proposes a new methodology to determine the optimal EV charging-discharging strategy based on the uncertainty of voltage drop. Moreover, the optimal policy is obtained by Markov Decision Process model, with the aim of maximizing power quality benefits. The control strategy of EV is raised to help the PV micro-grid react the external changes and future events proactively.	control theory;electric power quality;extended validation certificate;markov chain;markov decision process;proactive parallel suite	Zhuang Yang;Bin Duan;Mingjie Chen;Zhiyong Zhu	2016	2016 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2016.7781172	simulation;engineering;operations management;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;computer security	EDA	2.3370134510827447	6.385364561400308	127685
a056559dc160e083f918ea2bfe4945007bd1d7d7	demand response minimizing the impact on the consumers' utility considering forecast error on renewable energy resource		In the smart grid, which is a new generation grid integrated with bidirectional communication and advanced information technology, it is supposed that the number of energy suppliers will increase because many renewable resources will be connected to the grid. The increase in the number of suppliers that use renewable energy resources introduces new challenges in scheduling and dispatching controllable resources to control the load of the power grid in the system. By using the pricing method that maximizes social welfare, consumers/suppliers can determine the optimal power consumption/generation that maximizes own welfare. However, when a forecast error of renewable energy output occurs, the gap between the total power consumption and generation causes unless consumers decrease power consumption from the optimal consumption. Decreasing consumers' power consumption might lower their utility. In this paper, we define impact on consumers' utility and propose two demand response methods which aim to minimize the impact. The first method, called One-Time Demand Response, minimizes the impact on consumers' utility of a certain time slot by using a Lagrange multiplier. In the second method, called Foresight Demand Response, all consumers can forecast the electricity market price of the next time slot by using linear regression, and consumers do not reduce power consumption when the incentive of a certain time slot is cheaper than the forecast electricity market price of the next time slot. From the performance evaluation, we confirm the impact on consumers' utility in One-Time Demand Response and Foresight Demand Response. We also confirm that both two proposals can increase consumers' welfare compared to not carrying out demand response.	algorithm;grid computing;lagrange multiplier;performance evaluation;scheduling (computing)	Yuya Taniguchi;Ryo Kutsuzawa;Akira Yamashita;Jun Matsumoto;Naoaki Yamanaka	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Local and Metropolitan Area Networks (LANMAN)	10.1109/LANMAN.2017.7972173	electricity generation;renewable energy;computer network;electricity market;demand response;peak demand;smart grid;computer science;load management;demand curve;microeconomics	Embedded	2.9037485414056037	4.587769992037332	127760

We use the steady-state distribution of that diffusion process to obtain approximations for steady-state performance measures of the queueing model, focusing especially upon the steady-state delay probability. The approximations are based on heavy-traffic limits in which n tends to infinity as the traffic intensity increases. Thus the approximations are intended for large n. For the GI/M/n/∞ special case, Halfin and Whitt (1981) showed that scaled versions of the queue-length process converge to a diffusion process when the traffic intensity ρn approaches 1 with (1− ρn) √ n → β for 0 < β < ∞. A companion paper, Whitt (2004a), extends that limit to a special class of G/GI/n/mn models in which the number of waiting places depends on n and the service-time distribution is a mixture of an exponential distribution with probability p and a unit point mass at 0 with probability 1− p. Finite waiting rooms are treated by incorporating the additional limit mn/ √ n → κ for 0 < κ ≤ ∞. The approximation for the more general G/GI/n/m model developed here is consistent with those heavy-traffic limits. Heavy-traffic limits for the GI/PH/n/∞ model with phase-type service-time distributions established by Puhalskii and Reiman (2000) imply that our approximating process is not asymptotically correct for non-exponential phase-type service-time distributions, but nevertheless the heuristic diffusion approximation developed here yields useful approximations for key performance measures, such as the steady-state delay probability. The accuracy is confirmed by making comparisons with exact numerical results and simulations. American Mathematical Society 1991 subject classifications.

In the storage facilities, climate control of the storage rooms consumes considerable energy; thus, in this paper, a mathematical model of storage facilities appropriate for their optimal operation is developed, so that it can be implemented as a supervisory control in existing climate controllers. The proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing climate control systems in storage facilities. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and demand charges while considering important parameters of storage facilities, i.e., inside temperature and humidity should be kept within acceptable ranges. The performance of the proposed model for various electricity prices and weather conditions and their variations are studied via Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). The presented simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model to reduce total energy costs while maintaining required operational constraints.	computer simulation;control system;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;user (computing)	Mohammad Chehreghani Bozchalui;Claudio A.

The arrival process of customers is assumed to be a nonstationary Poisson process with an intensity function whose evolution is governed by a two-state continuous time Markov chain. Different service distributions for different types of customers are allowed. The explicit loss formula for the model considered is obtained. In a special case, it is shown that as the arrival process becomes more regular the loss decreases. For single server loss systems with renewal arrivals, counterexamples are given to show that regularity of arrival and service distributions do not work to good effect in general. Two sufficient conditions for it to be true are given.

Since basic replication techniques are extremely costly at scale, storage space requirements can be reduced by means of erasure and/or repairing codes.In this paper we address storage regeneration using repair codes, a robust distributed storage technique with no need to fully restore the whole state in case of failure. In fact, only the lost servers’ content is replaced. To do so, new clean-slate storage units are made operational at a cost for activating new storage servers and a cost for the transfer of repair data.Our goal is to guarantee maximal availability of containers’ state files by a given deadline. Upon a fault occurring at a subset of the storage servers, we aim at ensuring that they are repaired by a given deadline. We introduce a controlled fluid model and derive the optimal activation policy to replace servers under such correlated faults. The solution concept is the optimal control of regeneration via the Pontryagin minimum principle. We characterize feasibility conditions and we prove that the optimal policy is of threshold type. Numerical results describe how to apply the model for system dimensioning and show the tradeoff between activation of servers and communication cost.	activation function;cascading failure;circuit restoration;clean slate program;cloud computing;clustered file system;computation;erasure code;high availability;maximal set;online machine learning;optimal control;pontryagin's maximum principle;requirement;server (computing);stateful firewall;symposium on principles of database systems	Francesco De Pellegrini;Rachid El Azouzi;Alonso Silva;Olfa Hassani	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom)	10.1109/CloudCom.2017.65	real-time computing;pontryagin's minimum principle;solution concept;high availability;erasure;distributed data store;distributed computing;server;dimensioning;computer science;optimal control	Embedded	7.059758564639615	7.119474679877339	128092
923bda6897a52e390937dfd57a1a97ffafdb118b	contribution to modeling smart grid problem with the constraint satisfaction problem formalism		Smart Grids are electricity distribution networks that use intelligent IT methods to match the adequacy between consumer demand and provider offer (electric power plants and various clean energy sources such as wind turbines and solar panels). Smart Grids are derived from the fact that the use of electricity is not stable throughout the day. There are schedules where the use of electricity remains minimal, and others the opposite. Hence the need to optimize the use of electricity. In silence periods (work), solar panels or wind turbines will be enough to power the small number of devices that are running. The modeling of these networks using computer methods is a rather complex task, due to the large amount of informations offered by these networks and their complexity. Especially since it consists of multiple levels: i) the local level (house, building), ii) the microgrid level (the intermediate between locals and the third level) and iii) the level of transmission and distribution. But a mathematical solution can solve this kind of problem.  Among the concepts, modeling such problem mathematically is the CSP (for Constraint Satisfaction Problem). In this paper we propose a CSP modeling of the local level of the Smart Grid problem. The results show the effectiveness of our contribution.	complexity;constraint satisfaction problem;equation solving;microgrid;schedule (computer science);semantics (computer science);smart tv	Ghizlane El Khattabi;Soumia Lahboub;El-Houssine Bouyakhf;Imade Benelallam	2018		10.1145/3177148.3180084	real-time computing;wind power;electric power;smart grid;small number;constraint satisfaction problem;electricity;electric power distribution;computer science;microgrid	AI	3.1604582358245756	5.413713075634274	128111

5b70a86f314e0bd7f7dc3ebbcee33857940f47c5	detecting consumer devices by applying pattern recognition to smart meter signals.		Future energy supply requires an intelligent load management for efficient distribution of the available energy, at national level, as well as on a regional scale. For this purpose, one necessary prerequisite is the immediate detection of the currently connected appliances (loads), for example white or brown goods. If the devices that are currently active at the time of a data point are known, it is possible to level the load curve by means of selectively connecting and disconnecting appliances, which results in an optimized usage of the available energy. To realize the measurement of the energy consumption, we devised a low-investment system for centralized data acquisition and recorded and digitized characteristic load profiles. Afterwards, the application of different pattern matching algorithms allowed for recognizing and assigning individual loads from the measured sum signal. In the course of laboratory experiments, we could identify individual appliances and their combinations with this system.	algorithm;centralized computing;data acquisition;data point;experiment;load management;load profile;pattern matching;pattern recognition;sensor;smart meter	Achim Guldner;Sebastian Arns;Tobias Schunk;Klaus-Uwe Gollmer;Rainer Michels;Stefan Naumann	2013			embedded system;internet privacy;computer security	Robotics	0.9939541781763754	9.791427228844922	128545

To analyze and design detection and defense mechanisms for CPSs requires new system frameworks. In this paper, we establish a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model, that can be used for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against attackers of different types. The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. This approach leads to a real-time algorithm that yields a sequence of Nash equilibrium strategies which can be shown to converge. The paper illustrates these concepts using numerical examples, and we compare the results with previously known designs.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;converge;cyber-physical system;interaction;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;numerical method;overhead (computing);real-time clock;scalability;system dynamics	Fei Miao;Quanyan Zhu;Miroslav Pajic;George J.

3a831822c4d5274650036991e1151d68112266fc	priority assignment in queuing systems with unknown characteristics using learning automata and adaptive stochastic petri nets		Abstract In a queuing system with multiple queues and one server, a Priority Assignment (PA) mechanism is needed to assign the highest selection priority to the jobs from a class of jobs with the highest service rate. In this order, the shortest total waiting time of the system is achieved. The PA mechanism can be considered as an adaptive mechanism when some parameters of the queuing system, such as service rates, are unknown for this mechanism. In such queuing system, in order to the selection priorities to classes of jobs, an adaptive Probabilistic PA (PPA) mechanism can be utilized. The total waiting time of the queuing systems with unknown characteristics can be shortened by assigning the highest selection probability, rather than priority, to the jobs from a class of jobs with the highest service rate. In this paper, first Learning Automaton (LA) is introduced as an adaptive PPA mechanism in a queuing system with unknown characteristics consists of a server and m queues. Then, the proposed PPA mechanism is analyzed using a recently introduced model, which is the Adaptive Stochastic Petri Net (ASPN-LA). The results of this analysis enable us to establish a set of conditions for the termination of the adaptation in the LA-based mechanism. Thus, using this set of conditions, another adaptive mechanism is proposed, which consists of two phases: In the first phase, the LA is used to assign the selection probabilities to the classes of jobs and in the second phase, fixed levels of priorities are calculated using LA and then, instead of selection probabilistic, these priorities are used to select jobs for the service. The second phase of the mechanism is started when the proposed termination conditions are hold in the queuing system. Extensive computer simulations– reported in the paper –support the theoretical results. The results of these simulations indicate that the newly adaptive PPA mechanism with two phases is significantly better than or equal to the LA based PPA mechanism, over the average waiting time of the queuing system with three number of queues, in 86% of cases.	automata theory;learning automata;queueing theory;stochastic petri net	Seyed Mehdi Vahidipour;Mehdi Esnaashari	2018	J.

An agent-based management and control system is being developed to enable large-scale deployment of distributed energy resources. Local intelligent agents will allow consumers who are connected at low levels in the distribution network to manage their energy requirements and participate in coordination responses to network stimuli. Such responses can be used to reduce the volatility of wholesale electricity prices and assist constrained networks during summer and winter demand peaks. In our system, the coordination of energy resources is decentralized. Energy resources coordinate each other to realize efficient autonomous matching of supply and demand in large power distribution networks. The information exchange is through indirect (or stigmergic) communications between agents. The coordination mechanism is asynchronous and adapts to change in an unsupervised manner, making it intrinsically scalable and robust.

More specifically, using a population game model, we examine how the degree distribution of nodes influences their choices at Nash equilibria (NEs) and overall security level. We first show that there exists a degree threshold at NEs so that only the populations with degrees greater than or equal to the threshold invest in protection. Second, as the weighted degree distribution of nodes becomes stochastically larger, the risk or threat posed by a neighbor decreases, even though the aforementioned degree threshold tends to rise, hence only nodes with increasingly higher degrees invest in protection, at the same time. Third, we show that the social optimum also possesses similar properties. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the price of anarchy, which is an affine function of the average degree of nodes. This upper bound is tight in that it is achieved in some scenarios.	anarchy;assortativity;computer security;degree distribution;nash equilibrium;network security;network topology;population;threat (computer)	Richard J.

This new methodology treats residential electricity customers as peers in a BitTorrent-like power swarm, designed to efficiently dispatch local generation, storage, and demand response capacity to perform real-time demand-side load balancing without centralized control. It is envisioned that the technology could be implemented by utilities as an internet-based service layer that would allow more widespread integration of DER and smart devices within the existing power system. Initial MATLAB simulations of a 10-residence neighborhood with distributed generation (DG) demonstrate that BitTorrent is an effective protocol for decentralized load balancing, significantly reducing both local (peer) and aggregate (swarm) demand spikes.	aggregate data;algorithm;bittorrent;centralized computing;discontinuous galerkin method;dynamic dispatch;internet;load balancing (computing);matlab;real-time transcription;service layer;simulation;smart device;swarm;variable pricing	Matthew C.

Uncertainty affects the system since the cooling load depends on the building occupancy. The goal is to minimize the energy consumption of the cooling system, while preserving comfort in the building. This is achieved by optimally distributing the cooling load demand among the chillers and the thermal storage unit, and modulating the building temperature set-point to some (limited) extent. The problem can be decomposed into a static optimization problem, and a dynamic programming problem, which is solved based on the abstraction to a Markov chain of the stochastic hybrid system modeling the cooling system.	computer cooling;dynamic programming;hybrid system;markov chain;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;systems modeling	Francesco Borghesan;Riccardo Vignali;Luigi Piroddi;Maria Prandini;Martin Strelec	2013	IEEE PES ISGT Europe 2013	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2013.6695463	control engineering;mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering	Embedded	4.356805203977941	4.517634770866261	130366
c9cb0f9cf78850d9008377daa47070cf90a51392	on the assessment of systematic risk in networked systems		In a networked system, the risk of security compromises depends not only on each node’s security but also on the topological structure formed by the connected individuals, businesses, and computer systems. Research in network security has been exploring this phenomenon for a long time, with a variety of modeling frameworks predicting how many nodes we should expect to lose, on average, for a given network topology, after certain types of incidents. Meanwhile, the pricing of insurance contracts for risks related to information technology (better known as cyber-insurance) requires determining additional information, for example, the maximum number of nodes we should expect to lose within a 99.5% confidence interval. Previous modeling research in network security has not addressed these types of questions, while research on cyber-insurance pricing for networked systems has not taken into account the network’s topology. Our goal is to bridge that gap, by providing a mathematical basis for the assessment of systematic risk in networked systems.  We define a loss-number distribution to be a probability distribution on the total number of compromised nodes within a network following the occurrence of a given incident, and we provide a number of modeling results that aim to be useful for cyber-insurers in this context. We prove NP-hardness for the general case of computing the loss-number distribution for an arbitrary network topology but obtain simplified computable formulas for the special cases of star topologies, ER-random topologies, and uniform topologies. We also provide a simulation algorithm that approximates the loss-number distribution for an arbitrary network topology and that appears to converge efficiently for many common classes of topologies.  Scale-free network topologies have a degree distribution that follows a power law and are commonly found in real-world networks. We provide an example of a scale-free network in which a cyber-insurance pricing mechanism that relies naively on incidence reporting data will fail to accurately predict the true risk level of the entire system. We offer an alternative mechanism that yields an accurate forecast by taking into account the network topology, thus highlighting the lack/importance of topological data in security incident reporting. Our results constitute important steps toward the understanding of systematic risk and help to contribute to the emergence of a viable cyber-insurance market.	anatomic node;anatomy, regional;class;computable function;computation (action);computer systems;confidence intervals;contract agreement;converge;cyber-insurance;degree distribution;emergence;erdős–rényi model;gucy2c protein, human;incidence matrix;information sciences;insurance carriers;mathematics;np-hardness;network security;network topology;projections and predictions;simulation;star network;total number;algorithm	Aron Laszka;Benjamin Johnson;Jens Grossklags	2018	ACM Trans.

Therefore, we focus on joint cyber and physical attacks and develop methods to retrieve the grid state information following such an attack. We consider a model in which an adversary attacks a zone by physically disconnecting some of its power lines and blocking the information flow from the zone to the grid's control center. We use tools from linear algebra and graph theory and leverage the properties of the power flow DC approximation to develop methods for information recovery. Using information observed outside the attacked zone, these methods recover information about the disconnected lines and the phase angles at the buses. We identify sufficient conditions on the zone structure and constraints on the attack characteristics such that these methods can recover the information. We also show that it is NP-hard to find an approximate solution to the problem of partitioning the power grid into the minimum number of attack-resilient zones. However, since power grids can often be represented by planar graphs, we develop a constant approximation partitioning algorithm for these graphs. Finally, we numerically study the relationships between the grid's resilience and its structural properties, and demonstrate the partitioning algorithm on real power grids. The results can provide insights into the design of a secure control network for the smart grid.	adversary (cryptography);approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);graph theory;linear algebra;np-hardness;numerical analysis;planar graph	Saleh Soltan;Mihalis Yannakakis;Gil Zussman	2015		10.1145/2745844.2745846	cyber-attack;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-2.7968536676651077	8.181472584838078	130632

In this paper, we establish a game-theoretic framework to capture the uncoordinated nature of the decision making at different layers of the multi-level networks. To study the network resiliency, we introduce two adversarial attack models and quantify their impacts, and design a decentralized and resilient alternating-play algorithm that aims to maximize the algebraic connectivity of the global network under attack. We show that the designed algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium in a finite number of steps, and yields an equilibrium network.

We derive an approximated solution to the differential equations that define the SIR model. Unlike the exact SIR solution, the approximate solution is analytical and has a closed form expression. We use this approximate model as an inspiration to cyber defence. Such a model allows us to investigate the characteristics of the propagation of electronic viruses. That is, we can determine the number of susceptible units, the number of infected units and the number of removed units as a function of time. This information will eventually permit the defence to find ways to eradicate a virus attack and to show how viruses affect the defence effectiveness.	approximation algorithm;computer virus;software propagation	Bao Nguyen	2017		10.5220/0006401902320239	simulation;computer science;vulnerability	ML	-4.156190331078831	6.00149856532553	131173

Additionally, the development in communication technologies will allow small end-consumers and small-scale distributed energy resources (DER) to participate in electricity markets. Current electricity markets need to be tailored to incorporate these changes regarding how electricity will be generated and consumed in the future. The EcoGrid EU is a large-scale EU-funded project, which establishes the first prototype of the future European intelligent grids. In this project, small-scale DERs and small end-consumers can actively participate in a new real-time electricity market by responding to 5-min real time electricity prices. In this way, the market operator will also obtain additional balancing power to cancel out the production variation introduced by renewable electricity generation. The real-time market concept architecture for EcoGrid EU is introduced in this paper, which provides a market-based platform and information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure that extends the current electricity market to a shorter time horizon and to smaller assets.	algorithm;control theory;elasticity (data store);feedback;ibm power systems;itil;loss function;maxima and minima;mike lesser;one-way function;optimization problem;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;scalability;shading;smart tv;xfig	Yi Ding;Salvador Pineda;Preben Nyeng;Jacob Østergaard;Emil Mahler Larsen;Qiuwei Wu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2013.2258048	renewable energy;electricity market;engineering;operations management;electricity retailing;stand-alone power system;economy;commerce	Robotics	2.192035775707441	6.028238956699579	131204

Our new model, though based on the classical teaching dimension model, allows to study the influence of the learner’s memory size and of the presence or absence of feedback. Moreover, in the new model the order in which examples are presented may influence the teaching process. The resulting models are related to Markov decision processes, and characterizations of optimal teachers for memoryless learners with feedback and for learners with infinite memory and feedback are shown. Furthermore, in the new model it is possible to investigate new aspects of teaching like teaching from positive data only or teaching with inconsistent teachers. Characterization theorems for teachability from positive data for both ordinary teachers and inconsistent teachers with and without feedback are provided.		Frank J. Balbach;Thomas Zeugmann	2011	Inf.

The standard objective of minimizing the mean sojourn time (delay) does not enforce any kind of fairness in the system and it is acceptable, e.g., to delay one job a lot if it reduces the sojourn time of some other jobs. We take fairness into account by defining a linearly increasing instantaneous holding cost rate by two job-specific non-negative random variables, (ai; ßi), that can depend on the service time. We focus on first-come-first-served (FCFS) and preemptive last-come-first-served (LCFS) scheduling, and derive the so-called value functions for the corresponding M/G/1 queues. Then we apply these results and obtain cost aware dispatching policies by means of policy improvement and lookahead. The policies are finally evaluated numerically.	ergodic theory;fairness measure;fixed-point iteration;job stream;lh (complexity);numerical analysis;parsing;routing;scheduling (computing);server (computing)	Esa Hyytiä;Rhonda Righter	2015	2015 27th International Teletraffic Congress	10.1109/ITC.2015.24	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing	Metrics	8.687987211325325	9.69726269728402	131386

DNA strands can be viewed as finite strings over the alphabet {A, G, C, T}, and are used in DNA computing to encode information. Due to the fact that A is Watson-Crick complementary to T and G to C, DNA single strands that are Watson-Crick complementary can bind to each other or to themselves in either intended or unintended ways. One of the structures that is usually undesirable for biocomputation, since it makes the affected DNA string unavailable for future interactions, is the hairpin: If some subsequences of a DNA single string are complementary to each other, the string will bind to itself forming a hairpin-like structure. This paper studies a mathematical formalization of a particular case of hairpins, the Watson-Crick bordered words. A Watson-Crick bordered word is a word with the property that it has a prefix that is Watson-Crick complementary to its suffix. More generally, we investigate the notion of θ-bordered words, where θ is a morphic or antimorphic involution. We show that the set of all θ-bordered words is regular, when θ is an antimorphic involution and the set of all θ-bordered words is context-sensitive when θ is a morphic involution. We study the properties of θ-bordered and θ-unbordered words and also the relation between θ-bordered and θ-unbordered words and certain type of involution codes.	bioinformatics;code;context-sensitive grammar;dna computing;encode;interaction;morphic (software)	Lila Kari;Kalpana Mahalingam	2007	Int.

However, integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid could be a difficult task, because of the generation source intermittency and inconsistency with energy usage. In this paper, we present results of our study on the problem of allocating energy from renewable sources to EVs in a cost efficient manner. We have assumed that the renewable energy supply is time variant and in many ways unpredictable. EVs' charging requests should be satisfied within a specified time frame, which may incur a cost of drawing additional energy (possibly non-renewable energy) from the power grid if the renewable energy supply is not sufficient to meet the deadlines and may also reduce energy efficiency. We have formulated a stochastic optimization problem based on queuing model to minimize the time average cost of using non-renewable energy sources. The proposed approach fully considers the individual charging rate limit and deadline of each EV. The Lyapunov optimization technique is used to solve the problem. The developed dynamic control algorithm does not require knowledge of the statistical distribution of the time-varying renewable energy generation, EV charging demand, or extra energy pricing. Simulation results using different wind power generation profiles were performed and analyzed in the study. The results show that our EV charging scheduling method based on Lyapunov optimization can reduce both charging cost and mean delay time of fulfilling EV charging requests.	algorithm;charging argument;computer simulation;cost efficiency;dynamic programming;extended validation certificate;greedy algorithm;lyapunov fractal;lyapunov optimization;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;queueing theory;rate limiting;real-time transcription;robust optimization;scheduling (computing);simulation;stochastic optimization;usb hub	Chenrui Jin;Xiang Sheng;Prasanta Ghosh	2014	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2336624	renewable energy;mathematical optimization;mathematics;efficient energy use;lyapunov optimization;intermittent energy source	Embedded	3.818202830386945	4.352905684606405	131676

As renewable power sources (that cannot be dispatched) are added to the network many have advocated the additional introduction of massive energy storage facilities. However, the inherent dynamic nature of energy storage suggests an expanded view of the classic UC operating policy. In this work, the notion of Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) is investigated as a generalization of the classic UC policy. Of particular interest is the selection of EMPC prediction horizon size and its impact on storage utilization.	dynamic dispatch;numerical weather prediction;operating system;uc browser	Oluwasanmi Adeodu;Donald J.

It is well-known that an optimal policy is determined by the largest-index policy. There is an index for each given queue and one allocates the server to a queue with largest current index. Using discounted dynamic programming we give a new and short proof of this result and derive some characterizations and bounds of the indices. Moreover, it is shown that an approximate largest-index policy yields an approximately optimal policy. These results lead to efficient methods for computing the indices. In particular, we present a general largest-remaining-index method.	optimal control;server (computing)	Svend-Holger Friis;Ulrich Rieder;Jürgen Weishaupt	1993	ZOR - Meth. & Mod. of OR	10.1007/BF01414156	mathematical optimization;simulation;bulk queue;computer science;layered queueing network;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;algorithm	Metrics	9.718469993960333	10.534051050374297	131983

1f8eead4c98a69b7a4e08c13c99bb437093d61ba	non-polynomial worst-case analysis of recursive programs		We study the problem of developing efficient approaches for proving worst-case bounds of non-deterministic recursive programs. Ranking functions are sound and complete for proving termination and worst-case bounds of nonrecursive programs. First, we apply ranking functions to recursion, resulting in measure functions. We show that measure functions provide a sound and complete approach to prove worst-case bounds of non-deterministic recursive programs. Our second contribution is the synthesis of measure functions in nonpolynomial forms. We show that non-polynomial measure functions with logarithm and exponentiation can be synthesized through abstraction of logarithmic or exponentiation terms, Farkas’ Lemma, and Handelman’s Theorem using linear programming. While previous methods obtain worst-case polynomial bounds, our approach can synthesize bounds of the form O(n log n) as well as O(n) where r is not an integer. We present experimental results to demonstrate that our approach can obtain efficiently worst-case bounds of classical recursive algorithms such as (i) Merge-Sort, the divide-and-conquer algorithm for the ClosestPair problem, where we obtainO(n log n) worst-case bound, and (ii) Karatsuba’s algorithm for polynomial multiplication and Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication, where we obtain O(n) bound such that r is not an integer and close to the best-known bounds for the respective algorithms.	best, worst and average case;farkas' lemma;linear programming;matrix multiplication algorithm;merge sort;polynomial ring;recursion (computer science);recursive language;strassen algorithm;termination analysis	Krishnendu Chatterjee;Hongfei Fu;Amir Kafshdar Goharshady	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_3	algorithm;strassen algorithm;logarithm;binary logarithm;karatsuba algorithm;recursion;computer science;exponentiation;linear programming;polynomial	Logic	8.84095816871521	17.92595899748702	132700

We study these nets at specific instants in the steady state that occur directly after the firing of a transition. We focus our attention on the instant after tokens are removed from the places specified by a transition's input bag and just before tokens are entered into the places specified by the same transition's output bag. We show that the stationary probabilities at “arrival instants” are related to corresponding stationary probabilities at arbitrary instants in net(s) with lower load. We then show how one of the “arrival” theorems can be applied to the derivation of a formula for the mean sojourn time of a token in a place at steady state. This is the basis for the development of a Mean Value Analysis algorithm for the computation of performance indices for Product-Form Stochastic Petri Nets.	algorithm;computation;ergodic theory;stationary process;steady state;stochastic petri net	Gianfranco Balbo;Steven C.

One such change is the incorporation of Demand Response (DR), the process by which consumers can adjust their demand in a flexible manner. This paper presents a survey of various aspects of DR including the different types of participants, as well as the underlying challenges and the overall potential of DR when it comes to large-scale implementations. Benefits of DR as reported in the literature for performance metrics such as frequency control and price control, as well as methods for ensuring privacy are discussed. A quantitative taxonomy of DR recently proposed in the literature based on the inherent magnitude, run-time, and integral constraints is discussed and its integration with economic dispatch is explored.	dynamic dispatch;taxonomy (general)	Jacob Hansen;Jesper Knudsen;Anuradha M.

Furthermore these learners are always incremental, maximally consistent, and locally conservative. They are also efficient provided the function itself is efficient. These learners are called string extension learners because components of the grammar are read directly from strings in the language via the defining function. A number of classes of languages in the literature can be described this way including varieties of k-Locally Testable languages (McNaughton and Papert 1971) and k-Piecewise Testable languages (Simon 1975), as well as some classes not discussed in the literature, such as the k-Piecewise Testable languages in the Strict Sense. Potential applications of string extension learning exist for models of natural languages, particularly phonotactics, aspects of cognition and natural language processing.	algorithm;categorial grammar;cognition;crystal structure;data point;formal language;language identification in the limit;natural language processing;pattern language;programming paradigm;regular language;sl (complexity);scripting language;theory;timo sirainen	Mitsuo Wakatsuki;Etsuji Tomita;Go Yamada	2006		10.1007/11872436_14	time complexity;system identification;string;computer science;calculus;mathematics;linguistics;programming language;algorithm	PL	3.12747107011293	17.56469256952146	133794

This paper reviews and compares CHCP system based on solar energy with respect to traditional CHCP ones. A further comparison is made among the possible technologies for solar CHCP to assess the technical solutions more suited to residential applications. Beyond photovoltaic based systems, two other solutions are proposed: a concentrated sunlight all-thermoacoustic system and an hybrid thermo-photovoltaic system. In a grid-connected energy market, the adoption of CHCP plants may become profitable with respect to traditional systems, where the single energies are produced or purchased separately. Specifically, the onset of solar trigeneration can lead to a substantial improvement, overcoming many of the traditional drawback associated with micro-cogeneration and trigeneration. The result is a trigeneration system based totally on renewable energy. This is especially attractive for the residential demand, provided that a cost-effective technical solution is available.	block cipher mode of operation;computer cooling;curve fitting;fossil;onset (audio);point of view (computer hardware company);requirement	Fabio Immovilli;Alberto Bellini;Claudio Bianchini;Giovanni Franceschini	2008	2008 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/08IAS.2008.142	renewable energy;environmental engineering;engineering;operations management;photovoltaic system;photovoltaics;waste management	Embedded	3.3590736726879675	6.903716362759492	133797

In the industry, such system is commonly operated via two strategies; Following Electrical Load (FEL) or Following Thermal Load (FTL). However, these operating strategies may lead to huge amount of energy that is wasted. In this respect, several works have proposed a switching strategy, whereby tri-generation systems would interchange between FEL and FTL modes depending on energy demand. Unfortunately, the design of tri-generation based on this strategy has received limited attention. Besides, tri-generation operations often face challenges in equipment reliability. As tri-generation systems contain a network of interconnected equipment, equipment failures would disrupt the overall performance of a tri-generation system. As such, this work proposes a novel systematic optimisation approach to design alm-based biomass a robust tri-generation system which can operate optimally in its operating strategies. In addition, the proposed approach can simultaneously determine type, size and required equipment redundancy (e.g. operating and standby units) of technologies while considering operating strategies in a tri-generation system. A palm biomass-based tri-generation system (BTS) case study is solved to illustrate the proposed approach. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

At each station specialized robots automatically load and unload items on and off the conveyor. We examine here a single station in such a system. A new kind of queueing problem arises, with input-output dependencies that result because the same conveyor transports items both to and from the station. The paper analyzes two models of a station. Model 1 has one robot that cannot return a processed item to the conveyor while unloading a new item for processing. Model 2 has two robots to allow simultaneous loading and unloading of the conveyor. A principal goal of the analysis is the proper choice of the distance separating the two points at which items leave and rejoin the conveyor.	flexible-fuel vehicle;jsp model 2 architecture;robot	Edward G.

We show that k+1 set quantifier alternations allow to define a picture language that cannot be defined using k set quantifier alternations preceded by arbitrarily many first-order quantifier alternations. The approach uses, for a given picture language L and an integer m ≥ 1, the height-m fragment of L, which is defined as the word language obtained by considering each picture p of height m in L as a word, where the letters of that word are the columns of p. A key idea is to measure the complexity of a regular word language by the group complexity of its syntactic monoid. Given a picture language L, such a word language measure may be applied to each of its height fragments, so that the complexity of the picture language is a function that maps each m to the complexity of the height-m fragment of L. The asymptotic growth rate of that function may be bounded based on the structure of a monadic second-order formula that defines L. The core argument for that lower bound proof is based on Straubing’s algebraic characterization of the effect of first-order quantifiers on the syntactic monoid of word languages by means of Rhodes’ and Tilson’s block product.	column (database);first-order predicate;linear algebra;monadic predicate calculus;picture language;quantifier (logic);syntactic monoid	Oliver Matz	2012	CoRR		arithmetic;discrete mathematics;syntactic monoid;mathematics;algorithm	Logic	-2.279529906403725	18.024399169961562	134783

In this paper, we highlight that some non-ideal effects, especially the so-called """"charge recovery,"""" can have a dramatic impact on the operation policy of autonomous devices. To do so, we construct a Markov model, where we introduce a bidimensional battery value, including the apparent energy level, which is what available at the electrodes to power the device, and the actual energy level stored in the battery. When power is not drained by the device, these levels tend to equalize due to charge recovery, but, in the case of intense battery usage, they can be significantly different. We show that this non- ideality leads to considerably different estimates of undesirable events such as battery outages, and may cause a general underutilization of the devices if not properly accounted for."""	autonomous robot;depth of discharge;discharger;downtime;energy level;markov chain;markov model;mobile device;regular language description for xml;spectral leakage;time complexity	Leonardo Badia;Elisa Feltre;Elvina Gindullina	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2017.7919072	simulation	Mobile	1.9747149401923032	10.742961376973188	134973

In this paper, a priority M/D/k queue with finite buffers is analyzed and an approximate closed-form expression for the average waiting time of customers belonging to different priority classes is obtained. The key assumption is the presence of heavy traffic in the network leading to loss of customers from the service stations. Several interesting numerical results are reported that show the interplay between arrival and service rate of customers, capacity of the buffer, proportion of traffic belonging to each class and probability of loss as experienced by incoming customers.#R##N#Scope and purpose#R##N#Priority queues with finite buffers are used to model various types of telecommunications and manufacturing situations. These queues are specially useful for modeling high-speed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks that are subject to loss due to overfilling of the buffers. In general, it is difficult to obtain closed-form solutions of the various performance measures for these queues. Analysis of such queues with the deterministic service discipline can help provide useful guidelines for designers and developers of telecommunication and manufacturing networks.

Specifically, an arriving message is processed by the lowest-numbered idle link, if such a link exists. When all links are busy, a single queue is formed and messages enter for service on a first-come first-served basis. We assume that messages arrive in a Poisson manner with rate ~, that message lengths are exponentially distributed with mean l / p , and that C~_ 1 >/C,, where C, is the capacity of link i, i = 2 . . . . . n. We want to compute the utilization factor of each link and the expected message delay."""" The authors assert that an exact analysis requires the solution of 2 n linear equations, which is impractical except when n is small. Therefore, they propose an approximation, which they compare with the exact results for n = 2 and n = 3, and with simulation results for n = 4, 5, and 10. The purpose of this short note is to point out that the model of Ibe and Maruyama is a special case of the one considered by the present author [1], who gives an exact and easily computable solution for the case of arbitrary n, and which remains valid under less restrictive assumptions about the arrival process and the queue discipline. More specifically, Cooper's model and its solution [1, pp. 72-73] are stated as follows."""	approximation;computable function;linear equation;queueing theory;simulation	Robert B. Cooper	1987	Perform.

Our focus is on the logarithmic estimates of the tail of sojourn-time distribution, under the assumption that the jobsize distribution has a light tail. Whereas upper bounds on the decay rate can be derived under fairly general conditions, the establishment of the corresponding lower bounds requires that the service process satisfies a samplepath large-deviation principle. We show that the class of allowed service processes includes the case where the service rate is modulated by a Markov process. Finally, we extend our results to a similar system operation under the Discriminatory Processor Sharing (DPS) discipline. Our analysis relies predominantly on large-deviations techniques. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 60K25, Secondary 68M20, 90B22	ergodic theory;mathematics subject classification;modulation;pictbridge	Regina Egorova;Michel Mandjes;Bert Zwart	2007	Queueing Syst.	10.1007/s11134-007-9026-9	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;statistics	Metrics	9.712112422115412	12.733071467127905	135690
4ada222d13147c625c3a6a702a1750544618c84c	cloud computing cost and energy optimization through federated cloud sos		The two most significant differentiators among contemporary cloud computing service providers have increased green energy use and data center resource utilization. This paper addresses these two issues from a system's architectural optimization viewpoint. The proposed approach herein allows multiple cloud providers to utilize their individual computing resources in three ways by: 1 cutting the number of datacenters needed, 2 scheduling available datacenter grid energy via aggregators to reduce costs and power outages, and lastly by 3 utilizing, where appropriate, more renewable, and carbon-free energy sources. Altogether our proposed approach creates an alternative paradigm for a federated cloud system-of-systems SoS approach. The proposed paradigm employs a novel control methodology that is tuned to obtain both financial and environmental advantages. It also supports dynamic expansion and contraction of computing capabilities for handling sudden variations in service demand as well as for maximizing usage of time-varying green energy supplies. Herein we analyze the core SoS requirements, concept synthesis, and functional architecture with an eye on avoiding inadvertent cascading conditions. We suggest a physical architecture that diminishes unwanted outcomes while encouraging desirable results. Finally, in our approach, the constituent cloud services retain their independent ownership, objectives, funding, and sustainability means.	cloud computing	Yahav Biran;George Collins;Joel Dubow	2017	Systems Engineering	10.1002/sys.21393	service provider;system integration;grid;finance;cloud computing;architecture;scheduling (computing);data center;systems engineering;sustainability;distributed computing;engineering	DB	2.204655553234342	5.955480321993306	135746

The BEMS of our interest includes a Fuel Cell (FC) hydrogen coproduction unit, a FC Vehicle (FCV), a photo-voltaic generation unit, and a battery unit as distributed energy sources, and handles different energy carriers which are a key enabler to realizing reliable supply of power inside the building. The design involves a mechanism to react to a dynamic uncertain environment by time-varying operations of the energy sources and FCV. In this sense, the so-called reactive design of BEMS becomes promising that is a system used in embedded softwares to maintain an ongoing interaction with its environment. For this design, we use the methodology for synthesis of reactive control systems from specifications described by linear temporal logic, which was recently reported in literature.	cell (microprocessor);control system;embedded system;experiment;formal methods;hydrogen;linear temporal logic;management system;power supply	Shoko Kimura;Yoshihiko Susuki;Atsushi Ishigame	2017	2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229290	battery (electricity);linear temporal logic;coproduction;control engineering;distributed generation;energy carrier;hydrogen;control system;building management system;computer science	EDA	-0.025598262948119687	9.197809628934184	136239

A slip family is a family containing only slip languages. The purpose of this paper is to study slip AFL. A sufficiency condition is given on a slip family which ensures that the family generates a slip AFL. Using this condition, it is proved that (i) there exists a largest slip AFL and (ii) if @? is a slip family, then the smallest AFL containing the commutative closure of @? is a slip AFL. A new operation called ''homomorphic replication'' is then introduced. It is shown that the smallest AFL containing a homomorphic replication of a slip AFL is also a slip AFL. Furthermore, the resulting AFL is principal if the original AFL is principal. It is then proved that the smallest AFL containing all homomorphic replications of the regular sets is not principal. Finally, abstract families of acceptors are presented which, respectively, define the smallest AFL containing a particular homomorphic replication of the regular sets and all homomorphic replications of the regular sets.	semilinear response;american fuzzy lop	Seymour Ginsburg;Edwin H.

However, identifying key intersections that will soon become congested is a difficult task, performed by tedious, thorough simulations; even more difficult is to adapt the road network so as to increase its efficiency and avoid congestion. We argue upon the social component of road traffic and propose an alternative way to detect hotspots leading to congestion by using techniques borrowed from complex network analysis. We will use the betweenness centrality and argue upon its power-law distribution, which we set out to redistribute and equalize. The paper introduces a genetic algorithm that redistributes the betweenness values at a community level in a city by changing street directions and number of available lanes in order to reduce (and possibly even eliminate) congestion hotspots. Experimental results in terms of reducing traffic loads from hotspots and transferring to neighboring streets yield an improvement with a factor of up to 90% times without adding significant costs or modifying the existing infrastructure.	betweenness centrality;complex network;genetic algorithm;hotspot (wi-fi);network congestion;simulation;social network	Cristian Cosariu;Alexandru Iovanovici;Lucian Prodan;Mihai Udrescu;Mircea Vladutiu	2015	2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2015.7256877	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;network traffic control;simulation;floating car data;computer science;traffic congestion reconstruction with kerner's three-phase theory;traffic flow;computer security;slow-start;complex network;algorithm	Mobile	-2.7245387397107748	4.778321725033971	137178

The incorporation of material handling and transportation networks in finite buffer closed queueing networks is studied. A novel queue decomposition approach using state dependent queues to capture the buffer of finite M/M/1/K queues is shown to be a viable approach for modelling these systems. Each M=M=1=K queue is replaced with a coupled state dependent queue plus an M/M/1 queue. An extended mean value analysis (MVA) algorithm is employed to demonstrate the integration of the state dependent queues for the buffers in the approach. Under certain restrictions concerning the network population, finite queueing networks with the state dependent queues acting as buffers should have a product form distribution. This paper focuses on M/M/1/K queues and their transformation while future papers will treat the multi-server case.

Hence smart grid leads to optimization of energy consumption and reduce high cost in today extensive demand of energy. In this research work we are reducing electricity consumption cost and load consumption using scheduling the appliances. The twenty appliances are used to schedule their energy consumption and load using heuristics techniques i.e. binary particle optimization, genetic algorithm and wind driven optimization, using the same data set for each technique and their results are compared with each other in order to find which technique do better optimization. Simulations are performed in matlab to show the cost and load reduction by the above three techniques and validate the experiment. The simulation results show that binary particle swarm optimization perform better than the other two techniques and wind driven optimization is better than genetic algorithm but not able to perform as binary particle swarm optimization, similarly genetic algorithm is least efficient as compared to both methods.

We use a linear approximation to the network flow equations and apply linear programming techniques that optimize the dispatching of generators and loads in order to eliminate the network overloads associated with a damaged system. We also provide a simple model for the operator's response to various contingency events that is not always optimal due to either failure of the state estimation system or due to the incorrect subjective assessment of the severity associated with these events. This further allows us to use a game theoretic framework for casting the optimization of the operator's response into the choice of the optimal strategy which minimizes the operating cost. We use a simple strategy space which is the degree of tolerance to line overloads and which is an automatic control (optimization) parameter that can be adjusted to trade off automatic load shed without propagating cascades versus reduced load shed and an increased risk of propagating cascades. The tolerance parameter is chosen to describes a smooth transition from a risk averse to a risk taken strategy.

An incentivized DRM approach is studied to reduce the system cost and maintain the system stability. EVs are motivated with dynamic pricing determined by the group-selling-based auction. In the proposed approach, a number of aggregators sit on the first-level auction responsible to communicate with a group of EVs. EVs as bidders consider quality of energy (QoE) requirements, and report interests and decisions on the bidding process coordinated by the associated aggregator. Auction winners are determined based on the bidding prices and the amount of electricity sold by the EV bidders. We investigate the impact of the proposed mechanism on the system performance with maximum feedback power constraints of aggregators. The designed mechanism is proven to have essential economic properties. Simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism can reduce the system cost and offer EVs significant incentives to participate in the V2G DRM operation.	algorithmic trading;always-on drm;extended validation certificate;requirement;simulation	Ming Zeng;Supeng Leng;Sabita Maharjan;Stein Gjessing;Jianhua He	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2015.2482948	games;computer science;resource management;smart grid;informatics	Embedded	2.360412131744301	4.345456578934618	137951

We model the server interruptions by a correlated Markovian on/off process with geometrically distributed on and off periods. We first derive an expression for the functional equation describing the transient evolution of this queuing system. This functional equation is then manipulated and transformed into a mathematical tractable form. This allows us to derive the probability generating function (pgf) of the system occupancy. From this pgf, closed-form expressions for various performance measures, such as mean and variance of system contents and customer delay can be derived. Finally, we illustrate our solution technique with some numerical examples, whereby we demonstrate the negative effect of correlation in the interruption process on the performance of the system. The paper presents new insights into the performance analysis of queuing systems with correlated arrivals and service interruption and it also covers some previously published results as a special case.	interrupt;network packet;performance evaluation;server (computing)	Faouzi Kamoun	2009	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-009-9160-2	functional equation;real-time computing;simulation;computer science	OS	7.657028696978705	10.97761370540603	138064

Denmark has a particularly aggressive strategy for renewable energy generation. By 2020 50% of electricity production is to be wind based and by 2050 the goal is to have an energy production based entirely on renewable energy. Renewable energy such as solar and wind is subject to variations due to changing weather conditions. This requires additional balancing capacity and ancillary services in order to balance the grid for transmission system operators and distribution system operators and balance errors in forecasts made by balance responsible parties. By enabling the demand-side to adapt consumption to match power generation, we can address this in a cost-effective and environmental sound way. In this context, data centers are of special interest as they account for 500 GWh of consumption in Denmark or nearly 2% of the total electricity consumption. This paper performs an analysis on load management capabilities of data centers in Denmark based on the experiences in the U.S. We characterize the load management capabilities of the data centers based on their types, technology, and their application as grid management resources. Further, we identify demand-side entry barriers towards market participation. Our findings suggest that groups of data centers can offer dynamic load flexibility as virtual power plants, and thereby support the evolution of the Danish energy systems towards its 2020 and 2050 goals.	data center;fossil;load management;sysop	Anders Clausen;Girish Ghatikar;Bo Nørregaard Jørgensen	2014	International Green Computing Conference	10.1109/IGCC.2014.7039161	wind power;renewable energy credit;economics;electricity market;load balancing;operations management;grid parity;electricity retailing;stand-alone power system;smart grid;economy;distributed generation;pumped-storage hydroelectricity;intermittent energy source;energy development;feed-in tariff;commerce;energy management	HPC	2.5559123098150236	6.469252436434201	138186

We introduce a theoretical formulation of the coordination problem and an Integer Linear Programming model for its resolution. Our formalization is complemented by an analysis of the properties and limits of the model. We also define a practical smart-building setting in which our formalization holds. Finally, we conduct several experiments with realistic data and we make a scalability and sensitivity analysis. The experimental results correspond to emulation on an industrial infrastructure for smart-buildings, the one of Qarnot computing. They are obtained in using the API of the company. They show that we can quickly solve the problem for small and medium-sized buildings and for realistic settings. They also open interesting questions regarding the optimal model of control in future intelligent buildings.

Suppose that the system receives a fixed reward for each accepted customer and pays a holding cost per customer per unit time in the system. The objective is to dynamically determine the optimal admission policies based on the state of the system so as to maximize the average profit (reward minus cost) over an infinite horizon. This model finds applications in flow control in communication systems, industrial job shops, and traffic-flow systems. In this paper, a novel approach is presented using fuzzy control. This approach explicitly finds the optimal policy, which up until now has defied analytical solutions.	fuzzy control system;tandem computers	Runtong Zhang;Yannis A. Phillis	1999	IEEE Trans.

These pressures include environmental concerns that severely limit the installation of new power plants or transmission lines, the growing obsolescence of some equipment, the proliferation of small, independent power producers, growing government deregulation, and the development of fast electronic power-flow-control devices. The sharp drop in experienced power engineers because of retirements, low hiring levels, and a decreasing number of university graduates in power engineering exerts an additional pressure. This decline in human expertise is especially alarming, because much design work in electric power systems is highly knowledge-intensive. Design work relies on numerous areas of expertise, a wide body of disciplines, simulations, data, actual examples, and heuristic rules, and particularly on how all of this is integrated. This kind of knowledge is not found in any single document or well-recognized collection of sources, but is widely dispersed. Much of it resides only in the minds of human experts. Seven years ago, McGill University’s Power Engineering Group embarked on an ambitious program to develop a knowledgebased approach 1–5 that would help meet the challenge of knowledge erosion by emulating the various activities associated with the planning of electric power systems. 6This program aims to identify and gather a wide body of power-system planning and design knowldge, and to structure it into one easily accesible source for preservation, consolidation, and training. The main planning activities include the design of a complete power system or of specific subsystems or components such as generation, interconnections, transmission (AC or DC) or distribution networks, towers, and substations. These activities also consider performance requirements such as power flow and stability, insulation coordination, control, protection and grounding, reliability, and especially cost. Through this program, we’ve developed an integrated knowledge-based model of the power-system planning process and a generic approach for power-system design. We plan to use this model and approach to develop a system that can solve the most common planning and design problems in power systems. Although this tool will not replace experienced human experts, it has the potential to generate automatically a wide set of design alternatives for a given power-system problem, while justifying its reasoning process.	artificial consciousness;emulator;erosion (morphology);http 404;heuristic;high-level programming language;ibm power systems;requirement;semiconductor consolidation;simulation;systems design;transmission line	Djordje Atanackovic;Donald T.

Among four types of commissioning, ongoing commissioning is a commissioning process conducted continually for the purpose of maintaining, improving and optimizing the performance of building systems initial or re/retro commissioning. Ongoing commissioning maintains the optimal status of a building and gives financial, comfort and performance benefits to the building's owner, staff and future occupants. We need to develop an ICT-based building ongoing commissioning system. In this paper, we show our developed ICT-based building ongoing commissioning system for the first time in Korea.

Its tractable fragments can be identified by generalizing the results obtained for crisp Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) to fuzzy CSPs (FCSPs); to do this, we apply a general methodology based on the notion of  ̨-cut. In particular, the results concerning the tractability of Qualitative Algebra QA, obtained in a recent study by different authors, can be extended to identify the tractable algebras of the fuzzy Qualitative Algebra QA in such a way that the obtained set is maximal, namely any maximal tractable fuzzy algebra belongs to this set.	algorithm;allen's interval algebra;cobham's thesis;computational complexity theory;constraint satisfaction;local consistency;maximal set;question answering;region connection calculus;software propagation;software quality assurance;vagueness	Silvana Badaloni;Marco Falda;Massimiliano Giacomin	2008	Spatial Cognition & Computation	10.1080/13875860801944812	possibility theory;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics	AI	-1.6789831411466365	13.11186451259371	138929

An authoritative entity can apply sanctions to non-compliant agents in order to ensure society functions in some desirable way, which requires the detection of norm violations with some monitoring mechanism. The majority of existing approaches to norm enforcement assumes that the system is fully observable; this is often not possible in realistic environments. Our main contribution to address this issue is the formalization of the problem of monitor placement within a normative multi-agent system under budgetary constraints. More specifically we consider a system containing (1) a set of possible monitors able to determine the state of portions of the domain; (2) costs for deploying the monitors; and (3) a set of norms which, if violated, result in a sanction. We seek to identify which combination of monitors maximizes the system’s utility, evaluating approximate solutions using several heuristics, empirically demonstrating their efficiency.	approximation algorithm;brute-force search;computation;heuristic (computer science);multi-agent system;run time (program lifecycle phase);time complexity	Guilherme Krzisch;Nir Oren;Felipe Meneguzzi	2017			normative;computer science;heuristics;enforcement;sanctions;operations research;bounded function;observable;norm (social);budget constraint	AI	-1.5186298228266053	4.70951905172654	139380
9f2e589b84daf84ab107329180305bc1952587b9	a comprehensive evaluation of software rejuvenation policies for transaction systems with markovian arrivals		Software rejuvenation is one of the proactive fault management techniques to prevent system performance degradation, which may lead to the system failure caused by software aging. In the design of software rejuvenation, it is important to determine the optimal timing of triggering the rejuvenation in terms of the system overhead. In this paper, we consider six software rejuvenation policies, which are categorized into time-based and workload-based policies, under the environment where the arrival stream of system follows a Markovian arrival process (MAP). After building the stochastic models with respective rejuvenation policies, we formulate the loss probability of transaction and the upper bound of mean response time as the system performance indices. In the numerical illustrations, we exhibit a comprehensive study to compare six software rejuvenation policies numerically and show that the proposed rejuvenation policies called wait-time policies are superior to the others under the MAP arrival stream.	categorization;elegant degradation;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);response time (technology);software aging;software rejuvenation;stochastic process	Junjun Zheng;Hiroyuki Okamura;Lin Li;Tadashi Dohi	2017	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2017.2741526	markovian arrival process;reliability engineering;software bug;stochastic modelling;software rejuvenation;mathematics;fault management;software;real-time computing;database transaction;software aging	Metrics	5.837751261141243	11.057602517563621	139758
f8d9625b85896e9cc886b6a9cdf9d763e9012379	equivalent and efficient optimization models for an industrial discrete event system with alternative structural configurations		Discrete event systems in applications, such as industry and supply chain, may show a very complex behavior. For this reason, their design and operation may be carried out by the application of optimization techniques for decision making in order to obtain their highest performance. In a general approach, it is possible to implement these optimization techniques by means of the simulation of a Petri net model, which may require an intensive use of computational resources. One key factor in the computational cost of simulation-based optimization is the size of the model of the system; hence, it may be useful to apply techniques to reduce it. This paper analyzes the relationship between two Petri net formalisms, currently used in the design of discrete event systems, where it is usual to count on a set of alternative structural configurations. These formalisms are a particular type of parametric Petri nets, called compound Petri nets, and a set of alternative Petri nets. The development of equivalent models under these formalisms and the formal proof of this equivalence are the main topics of the paper. The basis for this formal approach is the graph of reachable markings, a powerful tool able to represent the behavior of a discrete event system and, hence, to show the equivalence between two different Petri net models. One immediate application of this equivalence is the substitution of a large model of a system by a more compact one, whose simulation may be less demanding in the use of computational resources.

97d23720f86aa445092c59d0c1984544269cce7c	a balking queue approach for modeling human-multi-robot interaction for water monitoring		We consider multi-robot scenarios where robots ask for operator interventions when facing difficulties. As the number of robots increases, the operator quickly becomes a bottleneck for the system. Queue theory can be effectively used to optimize the scheduling of the robots’ requests. Here we focus on a specific queuing model in which the robots decide whether to join the queue or balk based on a threshold value. Those thresholds are a trade-off between the reward earned by joining the queue and cost of waiting in the queue. Though such queuing models reduce the system’s waiting time, the cost of balking usually is not considered. Our aim is thus to find appropriate balking strategies for a robotic application to reduce the waiting time considering the expected balking costs. We propose using a Q-learning approach to compute balking thresholds and experimentally demonstrate the improvement of team performance compared to previous queuing models.	robot	Masoume M.

Both techniques are readily available, inexpensive but inherently wasteful to use. Dynamic numerical simulations were conducted to determine the primary energy efficiency and the level of protection afforded by these techniques in active residential grid-connected solar domestic hot water systems. Also evaluated was the use of occupancy rate information, possible via so-called “smart systems”, to complement the techniques. The results revealed better performances for systems using stagnation control schemes relative to those not using them. Also, night cooling was shown to be unable to prevent overheating reliably while tank fluid purging proved to be more apt but resulted in substantial waste of water annually, which was slightly reduced by combining it with night cooling, which in turn proved to be the most energy efficient solution.	computer cooling	Pedro M.

e4a3f6f36c968a50639c5fd87ade0bec6acd5ee7	design and analysis of battery-aware automotive climate control for electric vehicles		Electric Vehicles (EV) as a zero-emission means of transportation encounter challenges in battery design that cause a range anxieties for the drivers. Besides the electric motor, the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system is another major contributor to the power consumption that may influence the EV battery lifetime and driving range. In the state-of-the-art methodologies for battery management systems, the battery performance is monitored and improved. While in the automotive climate control, the passenger’s thermal comfort is the main objective. Hence, the influence of the HVAC power on the battery behavior for the purpose of jointly optimized battery management and climate control has not been considered. In this article, we propose an automotive climate control methodology that is aware of the battery behavior and performance, while maintaining the passenger’s thermal comfort. In our methodology, battery parameters and cabin temperature are modeled and estimated, and the HVAC utilization is optimized and adjusted with respect to the electric motor and HVAC power requests. Therefore, the battery stress reduces, while the cabin temperature is maintained by predicting and optimizing the system states in the near-future. We have implemented our methodology and compared its performance to the state-of-the-art in terms of battery lifetime improvement and energy consumption reduction. We have also conducted experiments and analyses to explore multiple control window sizes, drive profiles, ambient temperatures, and modeling error rates in the methodology. It is shown that our battery-aware climate control can extend the battery lifetime by up to 13.2% and reduce the energy consumption by up to 14.4%.	elegant degradation;experiment;extended validation certificate;scalability	Korosh Vatanparvar;Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque	2018	ACM Trans.

One of the reasons for choosing a DG is its ability to support voltage in a distribution system. Selection of effective DG characteristics and DG parameters is a significant concern of distribution system planners to obtain maximum potential benefits from the DG unit. This paper addresses the issue of improving the network voltage profile in distribution systems by installing a DG of the most suitable size, at a suitable location. An analytical approach is developed based on algebraic equations for uniformly distributed loads to determine the optimal operation, size and location of the DG in order to achieve required levels of network voltage. The developed method is simple to use for conceptual design and analysis of distribution system expansion with a DG and suitable for a quick estimation of DG parameters (such as optimal operating angle, size and location of a DG system) in a radial network. A practical network is used to verify the proposed technique and test results are presented.	algebraic equation;discontinuous galerkin method;radial (radio)	Kashem M. Muttaqi;An D. T.

c87f0a89ffe46b859d3182bd1f13ccd9f154d455	renewables firming using grid scale battery storage in a real-time pricing market		Battery storage has many benefits, such as providing instantaneous response to changes in demand, clean electricity to customers, and integration of intermittent power sources. However, at the present time battery storage has proven to be too costly for widespread implementation. While there has been research to examine the cost at which battery storage will become cost effective for particular applications, little work has been done to determine the most effective placement of battery storage for the greatest impact on the system as a whole. This research examines battery storage in a real-time pricing energy market, and compares the cost effectiveness of three different cases: (1) Battery storage owned and operated by an intermittent renewable energy generation facility, (2) Battery storage connected to the grid providing energy services, (3) Battery storage owned and operated by a manufacturing plant. Realtime pricing data from ISO New England was analyzed to determine the monetary benefits of each case on a per mega-amp-hour basis. By looking at the issue holistically, instead of analyzing specific scenarios as previous researchers have done, the benefits of each placement can be isolated from the overall benefits of connecting storage to the grid. Once the true value of each scenario can be accurately identified, the integration of utility scale battery storage is optimized for the maximum benefits to all.	holism;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;variable pricing	Charles Quann;Thomas H.

4a664007ac4f95f495a9ef89eaaed28b38fa19ec	modeling the operation mechanism of combined p2g and gas-fired plant with co2 recycling		The rapid development of power-to-gas (P2G) technology is promoting the integration of renewables and the interaction between multiple energy systems. In this paper, the concept of combined P2G and gas-fired power plant (GFPP) system is proposed as a potential solution for the globally recognized imperatives to reduce CO2 emission and utilize renewable energy. The proposed system is featured by the on-site conversion of CO2 back to the fuels of GFPP and thus recycles CO2 without long-distance transport. This paper further establishes the mathematical model of the proposed system. Detailed gas, electricity and heat flow inside the system are explained and the input/output relationship is derived as well. This paper also studies the operational range and optimal scheduling method of the proposed system to quantify its ability on the reduction of CO2 emission and utilization of renewables. According to the estimation, the GFPP-P2G system is able to utilize approximately 30% of the surplus renewables for electricity generation and 20% for heat generation. The combined GFPP-P2G system is also compared with the standalone GFPP through several cases. The numerical study shows great effect of the proposed system on the utilization of renewables and reduction of CO2 emission.

In the large means, that we define categories of graph grammars, graph transition systems, and graph derivation systems which embody the notion """"grammar"""", """"direct derivation"""", and """"derivation"""", respectively, as they are defined in the classical algebraic theory.

A typed graph grammar is a grammar for typed graphs which is a slight generalization of the standard case. The main result shows that the three categories are related by left-adjoint functors. We discuss the relationship of our results to similar results obtained in the Petri-net field, and applications to entity/relationship models. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n As shown in [CELMR 94b], algebraic graph grammars of the double-pushout type [Ehr 87] are a proper generalization of Petri-nets [Rei 85]. By contrast to Petri-nets, they allow to specify structured states, i.e. graphs instead of place vectors, and context dependent transitions, where part of the precondition is read but not consumed. However, by contrast to other formalisms for the specification of concurrent and distributed systems (like Petri-nets, Event Structures, Asynchronous Transition Systems and others [NPW 81, Bed 88, MM 90, SNW 93] graph grammars lack a formal categorical treatment in the large. This is mainly due to the absence of a natural notion of graph grammar morphism, which allows to compare and translate different grammars, their induced direct derivations and derivation sequences.

The goal of the proposed method is to optimally charge the PEVs in order to maximize the PEV owners' satisfaction and to minimize system operating costs without violating power system constraints. Unlike the solutions reported in the literature, the proposed charging architecture guarantees the feasibility of the charging decisions by means of a novel prediction unit that can forecast future PEVs power demand and through an innovative two-stage optimization unit that ensures effective charging coordination. Coordinated PEV discharging also enables improved utilization of power system resources.

In existing studies [4, 5, 3] a hypothesis is a conjunction of attribute-value pairs, which is shown to have limited expressive power [6].In this paper we investigate version space in a more expressive hypothesis space, where a hypothesis is a hyperrelation, which is in effect a disjunction of conjunctions of disjunctions of attribute-value pairs. We propose to use an inductive bias, E-set, which turns our attention to equilabelled, supported, and maximal hypertuples. We characterise version space in such a hypothesis space under this bias and show the relationship between the specific boundary and general boundary with respect to unequivocal data, a special subset of the data space.

Energy accounts for 50% or more of operating profit and 60%of energy in enterprise is under utilized. Plug loads typically consume up to 50% of the overall electrical energy usage in an enterprise. Even though multiple solutions exist such as Building Management System (BMS) to monitor and control electrical energy at main level such as HVAC but there are no solutions that can detect, analyze and trigger automatic actions in real time at plug load points. The proposed solution for managing plug loads is called PLEMS which allows to monitor and control appliances connected to smart plugs in a policy adaptable way and extend the coverage of existing BMS to plug loads. PLEMS helps to identify the consumption pattern of any appliance using a weighted moving average model. New policies are proposed based on usage/budget along with time based policies to trigger actions that mitigate or minimize energy wastage. The solution allows unified monitoring across enterprise with energy integration dashboard. Two case studies which were carried out in our enterprise (on office appliances) proved that we can potentially save energy by up to 60% eventually leading to a reduction in carbon footprint. We showcased another case study to highlight the actual savings achieved from the same appliances by using adaptable policies.	battery management system;floor and ceiling functions;lateral thinking;moving-average model;paperless office;plug-in (computing);smart meter	Animikh Ghosh;Ketan A.

Utilizing the ESS, generation shortage due to outage of conventional units and intermittency of renewable units is handled; hence microgrid reliability criterion is satisfied.

A neural network based self-learning prediction algorithm is used to forecast the power production of the PV plant and the household consumptions over a determined time horizon.

The use of an alphabetical subsumption relation (subsumption) implies that the least generalization of clauses (generalization) has diierent properties than Plotkin's least generalization (lgg). We present a method for constructing optimal-generalizations from Plotkin's least generalization. The developed framework is used in the relational decision tree algorithm TRITOP.	algorithm;decision tree learning;graph theory;is-a;list of algorithms;logical framework;plotkin bound;subsumption architecture	Peter Geibel;Fritz Wysotzki	1997		10.1007/3540635149_46	discrete mathematics;logical framework;decision tree learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;graph theory;machine learning;decision tree;mathematics;id3 algorithm;algorithm;tree decomposition	AI	2.2842850899808984	16.474221647308998	143963
1642197df2372a962b8670bfa11d4e8ea271dfe8	multi-objective optimization of energy storage and wind dgs for self-adequacy of microgrid equipped with fast dc charging station		This paper presents a framework to determine the optimal siting and sizing of Wind-based distributed generators (WDGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) in a micro-grid (MG), considering the total active power losses in the system, the self-adequacy index (SAI), and the total annual cost (TAC) of the WDGs and the ESSs. The work in this paper employs multi-objective optimization (MOO) based on archived multi-objective simulated annealing in order to obtain a diverse set of Pareto optimal solutions. The analysis formulates the siting and sizing optimization problem considering a MG with a Fast Direct Current Charging Station (FDCCS). The results of the simulation have revealed that the optimal solution results in a trade-off between increasing SAI and increased TAC. Finally, it was seen that the optimal siting and sizing of the WDGs are highly affected by the location of the FDCCS.	archive;mathematical optimization;mg (editor);microgrid;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;simulated annealing;simulation;transcranial direct-current stimulation	Shady A.

In this paper, we present a decentralized self-organized mechanism that draws on the methodology of autonomy-oriented computing (AOC) to study the formation of an energy distribution network from a bottom-up viewpoint. We utilize ideas from the animals' foraging behaviors (i.e., the Levy flight) for energy consumers to search for energy suppliers. Simulation-based experimental results based on the real-world data of crude oil production and consumption in U.S. and Canada show that distribution hubs, which are essential to enhance supply opportunities and flexibilities in the real world, can also be observed from the AOC-based mechanism. This work provides a possible way for understanding the fundamental principles behind the formation of an efficient and reliable distribution system.	autonomy	Benyun Shi;Jiming Liu	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15597-0_45	foraging;self-organization;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;top-down and bottom-up design	ECom	0.9013612497887947	5.771645591476031	144368

Wind energy provides many benefits such as a low energy costs and near zero carbon footprint, but it also brings new challenges, a consequence of wind's intermittent nature. These challenges must be overcome by ISO/RTOs and other entities responsible for the reliable and efficient operation of the power grid. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) has taken a number of steps to facilitate the integration of up to 8000 MW of wind resources into a 34,000 MW peak load system. These include a centralized wind forecasting system, putting wind plants on dispatch, creating a market for limited energy storage resources as well as creating a market mechanism to utilize the hydro resources of Hydro Quebec to balance the intermittency of wind.	centralized computing;dynamic dispatch;entity;load profile;microwave;sysop;the new york times	Rana Mukerji	2012	2012 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2012.6175671	simulation;engineering;electrical engineering;operations management	AI	2.3159734729143517	6.74884892956244	144542

7fc3dce511ba262264ccc527800222adccdbb746	bounds for markovian queues with possible catastrophes		We consider a general Markovian queueing model with possible catastrophes and obtain new and sharp bounds on the rate of convergence. Some special classes of such models are studied in details, namely, (a) the queueing system with S servers, batch arrivals and possible catastrophes and (b) the queueing model with “attracted” customers and possible catastrophes. A numerical example illustrates the calculations. Our approach can be used in modeling information flows related to high-performance computing. INTRODUCTION There is a large number of papers devoted to the research of Markovian queueing models with possible catastrophes, see for instance, [1], [3], [2], [10], [11], [17], [18], [19], [21], [24], [25] and the references therein. Such models are widely used in simulations for hight-performance computing. In particular, in some recent papers the authors deal with more or less special birth-death processes with additional transitions from and to origin [1], [2], [3], [10], [11], [21], [24], [25]. In the present paper we consider a more general class of Markovian queueing models with possible catastrophes and obtain key bounds on the rate of convergence, which allow us to compute the limiting characteristics of the corresponding processes. Namely, we suppose that the queue-length process is an inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chain {X(t), t ≥ 0} on the state space E = {0, 1, 2 . . . }. All possible transition intensities are assumed to be non-random functions of time and may depend on the state of the process. From any state i the chain can jump to any another state j > 0 with transition intensity qij(t). Moreover, the transition functions from state i > 0 to state 0 (catastrophe intensities) are βi(t). Denote by pij (s, t) = P {X (t) = j |X (s) = i}, i, j ≥ 0, 0 ≤ s ≤ t the probability of transition X (t), and by pi (t) = P {X (t) = i} the corresponding state probability that X (t) is in state i at the moment t. Let p (t) = (p0 (t) , p1 (t) , . . . ) T be the vector of state probabilities at the moment t. Throughout the paper we suppose that for any i, j P (X (t+ h) = j|X (t) = i) = =  qij (t)h+ αij (t, h) , if j 6= i, βi (t)h+ αi0 (t, h) = qi0(t) + αi0(t, h), if j = 0, i > 1, 1− ∑ j 6=i qij(t)h+ αi (t, h) , if j = i, (1) where sup i |αi(t, h)| = o(h). (2) Let Q(t) be the corresponding intensity matrix. We suppose that all intensity functions are non-negative and locally integrable on [0,∞). Put aij (t) = qji (t) for j 6= i and aii (t) = − ∑	catastrophe theory;emoticon;goto;markov chain;numerical analysis;queueing theory;randomness;rate of convergence;simulation;state space;supercomputer	Alexander I.

As soon as the system size is greater than N, turn the server on with probability p and leave the server off with probability (1-p). All arriving customers demand the first essential service, where only some of them demand the second optional service. He needs a startup time before providing first essential service until there are no customers in the system. The server is subject to break down according to a Poisson process and his repair time obeys a general distribution. In this queueing system, the steady-state probabilities cannot be derived explicitly. Thus, we employ an improved maximum entropy method with several well-known constraints to estimate the probability distributions of system size and the expected waiting time in the system. By a comparative analysis between the exact and approximate results, we may demonstrate that the improved maximum entropy method is accurate enough for practical purpose, and it is a useful method for solving complex queueing systems.

The objectives of this optimization model are to maximize utilization of wind power and minimize cost of energy storage infrastructure. Due to antagonistic relations between goals, compromised processing method is used to realize the overall benefit of wind farm. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve the model rapidly and accurately. The storage capacity optimization of case system indicates that the model could smooth wind power by smaller cost and larger utilization of wind power.	algorithm;capacity optimization;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;quantum fluctuation;smoothing	Zhe Jiang;Jiangxia Feng;Yandong Sun;Bohao Sun;Naihu Wu	2013	2013 Ninth International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)	10.1109/ICNC.2013.6818045	mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering;operations management;power optimizer	EDA	4.498920724951415	5.389860572763111	145027

We consider the problem of satisfiability of membership constraints, i.e., to determine if a formal concept exists whose object and attribute set include certain elements and exclude others. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem in general and for restricted forms of membership constraints. We perform the same analysis for generalizations of FCA to incidence structures of arity three (objects, attributes and conditions) and higher. We present a generic answer set programming (ASP) encoding of the membership constraint satisfaction problem, which allows for deploying available highly optimized ASP tools for its solution. Finally, we discuss the importance of membership constraints in the context of navigational approaches to data analysis.	ac0;answer set programming;boolean satisfiability problem;cobham's thesis;computational complexity theory;constraint satisfaction problem;formal concept analysis;incidence matrix;np-completeness;norm (social);programming paradigm;requirement;stable model semantics	Sebastian Rudolph;Christian Sacarea;Diana Troanca	2015			discrete mathematics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm	AI	-3.760414250551347	10.641966443304877	145041

To define an optimization problem, including the effects of multiple operating points, both sensitivity analysis and conflict analysis of the design objectives were incorporated into the proposed strategy. An objective-reduction algorithm was applied in order to make the optimization process affordable under a limited computational budget. The effects of incorporating multiple operating points on the optimization of 10-pole 12-slot FSCWs are presented. The proposed methodology can be applied to solve motor optimization problems with a high number of objectives, in general.	algorithm;computation;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem	Rodrigo C&#x00E9;sar Pedrosa Silva;Tanvir Rahman;Mohammad Hossain Mohammadi;David Alister Lowther	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2756586	engineering;control theory;traction motor;design objective;ac motor;control engineering;algorithm design;energy management;electric motor;multi-objective optimization;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	EDA	5.111186028505587	5.533168224691779	145160

We then analyze two algorithms that have been previously used in data mining, proving upper bounds on their complexity. The first algorithm is useful when the maximally specific interesting sentences are “small”. We show that this algorithm can also be used to efficiently solve a special case of the hypergraph transversal problem, improving on previous results. The second algorithm utilizes a subroutine for hypergraph transversals, and is applicable in more general situations, with complexity close to a lower bound for the problem. We also relate these problems to the model of exact learning in computational learning theory, and use the correspondence to derive some corollaries.	algorithm;computational learning theory;data mining;machine learning;subroutine;sentence	Dimitrios Gunopulos;Roni Khardon;Heikki Mannila;Hannu Toivonen	1997		10.1145/263661.263684	computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;computational learning theory	ML	8.72621485959573	17.29480395246208	145244

At each service completion epoch, a reward is received and the serviced customer changes nodes or leaves the system according to specified probabilities. In addition, linear holding costs are incurred. The problem is to schedule the server so as to maximize the expected discounted reward over an infinite planning horizon. This model is equivalent to a single-server, multi-class queuing system with feedback of the customers. We study two cases: general service times with a non-preemptive service discipline and exponential service times with a preemptive service discipline. For each case we show that a modified static policy of priority form is optimal and we provide an algorithm for computing an optimal policy.	optimal control	Dong-Wan Tcha;Stanley R.

Smart grid management requires the control of non-renewable energy production and the integration of renewable energies which might be highly unpredictable. Indeed, their production levels rely on uncontrolable factors such as sunshine, wind strength, etc. First, we derive optimal control strategies on the non-renewable energy productions and compare competitive learning algorithms to forecast the energy needs of the end users. Second, we introduce an online learning algorithm based on regret minimization enabling the agents to forecast the production of renewable energies. Additionally, we define organizations of the market promoting collaborative learning which generate higher performance for the whole smart grid than full competition.	algorithm;competitive learning;machine learning;optimal control;regret (decision theory);tree network	Hélène Le Cadre;Jean-Sébastien Bedo	2012	6th International ICST Conference on Performance Evaluation Methodologies and Tools		simulation;engineering;machine learning;management science	ML	0.9436090269055427	5.155501018563836	145944

e5aa697720a73f264fef6e2ca2232b209006b578	perturbation analysis: a framework for data-driven control and optimization of discrete event and hybrid systems		The history of Perturbation Analysis (PA) is intimately related to that of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS), starting with a solution of a long-standing problem in the late 1970s and continuing today with the control and optimization of Hybrid Systems and the emergence of event-driven control methods. We review the origins of the PA theory and how it became part of a broader framework for models, control and optimization of DEDS. We then discuss the theoretical underpinnings of Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) as a data-driven stochastic gradient estimation method and how it has been applied over the past few decades. We explain how IPA offers a basis for general-purpose stochastic optimization of Markov systems through the notion of the performance potential and how it has evolved beyond DEDS and now provides a framework for control and optimization of Hybrid Systems and, more generally, event-driven methodologies. 1. THE ORIGIN OF PERTURBATION ANALYSIS In pioneering the field of Discrete Event Systems (DES) in the early 1980s, Y.C. Ho and his research group at Harvard University discovered that event-driven dynamics give rise to state trajectories (sample paths) from which one can very efficiently and nonintrusively extract sensitivities of state variables (therefore, various performance metrics as well) with respect to at least certain types of design or control parameters. This eventually led to the development of a theory for Perturbation Analysis (PA) in DES (Cassandras and Lafortune (2008), Ho and Cao (1991), Glasserman (1991)), the most successful branch of which is Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. In fact, by the early 2000s, IPA was shown to apply to all virtually arbitrary Hybrid Systems (HS) and continues to be today one of the most attractive tools for data-driven control and optimization, especially in stochastic environments where modeling random aspects of a process is prohibitively hard. ? Wardi’s work is supported in part by NSF under Grant Number CNS-1239225.

The origin of the key concepts that form the cornerstones of the PA theory are found in a long-standing problem in operations research and industrial engineering known as the buffer allocation problem. In its industrial engineering version, it was presented to Ho’s research group by the FIAT automobile company in the late 1970s as follows. A typical serial tranfer line consists of N workstations in tandem, each with different characteristics in terms of its production rate, failure rate and repair time when failing. In order to accommodate this inhomogeneous behavior, a buffer is placed before the ith workstation, i = 1, . . . , N , with Bi discrete slots where production parts can be queued. Since the space within which this transfer line operates is limited, there is an upper bound B to the total number of buffer slots that can be allocated over the N workstations so that ∑N i=1Bi = B. The problem is to allocate these B buffer slots, i.e., determine a vector [B1 . . . BN ], so as to maximize the throughput of the transfer line while also maintaining a low overall average delay of the parts moving from an entry point before the first workstation to an exit point following the Nth workstation. Tackling this problem in a “brute force” manner requires considering all possible buffer allocations, a number given by ( B +N − 1 B ) . For a reasonably small Preprints of the 20th World Congress The International Federation of Automatic Control Toulouse, France, July 9-14, 2017 Copyright by the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) 3083 problem such as B = 24 and N = 6, this gives 118,755 possible solutions. A direct trial-and-error approach where one is allowed to test each allocation for about a week would require about 2300 years. If one were to reduce the initial solution space to only 1000 “good guesses” and use early 1980s simulation technology requiring about 3 min per trial to estimate the resulting performance, the overall task would take about 250 days of CPU time. The approach taken by Ho’s group and first reported in Ho et al. (1979) was to study the serial transfer line as a dynamic system whose state includes the integervalued buffer contents along with real-valued “clocks” associated with each workstation as it processes a part. The question then posed was: “what would happen if in a given allocation a specific value Bi were changed to Bi+1?” The “brute force” way to answer this question is to first simulate the system under the nominal allocation with the value Bi and estimate the system’s performance over a (sufficiently long) time period T which may be denoted by LT (Bi). Then, repeat the simulation under Bi + 1 to obtain LT (Bi+1). The difference ∆LT (Bi) = LT (Bi+1)− LT (Bi) provides an estimate of the system’s performance sensitivity with respect to Bi. What the research team realized, however, is that this is unnecessary: indeed, the initial simulation alone yielding LT (Bi) and a simple thought experiment can deliver the value of ∆LT (Bi). Moreover, the same thought experiment can deliver the enire vector [∆LT (B1), . . . ,∆LT (BN )] with minimal extra effort. The key observation that led to a formal procedure describing this thought experiment is the following. When Bi is replaced by Bi + 1, no change in the state of the system can take place unless one of two “events” is observed at time t: (i) The ith buffer content, say xi(t), reaches its upper limit, i.e., xi(t) = Bi and a part is ready to leave the (i−1)th workstation. In this case, this upstream workstation is “blocked” since there is no place for the departing part to go. However, in a perturbed system with Bi replaced by Bi + 1 that would not happen and one can simply predict a buffer content perturbation ∆xi(t) = 1. Moreover, one can record when this blocking occurs at time t ≡ ti,B and the next time that a part departs from the ith workstation, ti,D. Then, ti,D − ti,B is the amount of time that would be gained (i.e., no blocking would have occurred) in a perturbed system realization. The important observation here is that ti,D, ti,B are directly observed along the nominal system realization. (ii) The (i + 1)th buffer content reaches its lower limit, i.e., xi+1(t) = 0 and a part is ready to leave the ith workstation. In this case, if ∆xi(t) = 1, i.e., the ith workstation has already gained a part from an earlier blocking event, then this gain can now propagate downstream and we can set ∆xi+1(t) = ∆xi(t) = 1. This simple observation leads to the conclusion that estimating the effect of replacing Bi by Bi + 1 boils down to observing just a few events along the nominal system realization: blocking events (when xi(t) = Bi and a part departure from i− 1 takes place) and idling events (when xi(t) = 0 at any i = 1, . . . , N). This can be formalized into an “estimator” for buffer perturbations ∆xi(t) and event timing perturbations for all part departures at workstations. More generally, this estimator transforms a given hypothetical perturbation ∆Bi(t) = 1 (or −1) into state perturbations, which can ultimately be used to estimate a performance perturbation ∆LT (Bi). Most importantly, this is accomplished without ever having to implement the perturbation ∆Bi(t), since the estimator depends only on directly observable data from the nominal system realization; in particular, it suffices to observe selected events and associated event times and to perform extremely simple calculations. This initial procedure pertaining to a very specific type of dynamic system and problem was given the name Perturbation Analysis (PA). It soon became clear that it could be extended to any system with a structure similar to that of the serial transfer line and to a perturbation in any system parameter. Thus, one could consider, for instance, speeding up the operation of a workstation and studying the effect of a perturbation ∆ri in the operation rate ri of the ith workstation. The general procedure is one where some parameter perturbation ∆θ generates a state perturbation ∆xi(t) when a specific event occurs at time t. Subsequently, the system dynamics dictate how ∆xi(t) propagates through the system by affecting ∆xi(t) or ∆xj(t) for j 6= i. Depending on a performance metric of interest, this ultimately yields ∆LT (∆θ), the change in performance due to ∆θ. As for the system structure amenable to this kind of efficient PA, it became obvious that it fits the general class of queueing networks. An obvious next question was: “Does PA hold for any value of ∆θ or do we have to restrict it to “small” ∆θ when θ is real-valued?” There was ample empirical evidence collected over the early 1980s that ∆θ had to be small but not necessarily “very small”. In other words, the values of ∆L T (∆θ) obtained through PA were identical to those obtained through the “brute force” finite difference LT (θ + ∆θ) − LT (θ) for “sufficiently small” ∆θ. This led to the term Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) to capture the fact that the methodology was applicable to perturbations which were “infinitesimally” small, although a formal quantification characterizing limits for ∆θ was lacking. Moreover, when ∆θ became larger, it was still possible to satisfy ∆L T (∆θ) = LT (θ + ∆θ) − LT (θ) at the expense of observing more “interesting events” and performing a few more calculations. For instance, in the case of the integer-valued buffer size parameter Bi, the minimal feasible perturbation is obviously either +1 or −1. To differentiate these cases, the term Finite Perturbation Analysis (FPA) was introduced. FPA reverts to IPA when parameters are real-valued and may be allowed to take “sufficiently small” values ∆θ. To illustrate the distinction between IPA and	automatic control;blocking (computing);brute-force search;c date and time functions;central processing unit;downstream (software development);dynamical system;emergence;entry point;event-driven architecture;event-driven programming;fits;failure rate;feasible region;finite difference;general-purpose modeling;gradient;hybrid system;ibm notes;industrial engineering;like button;markov chain;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;observable;operations research;realization (systems);sql;simulation;stochastic optimization;system dynamics;throughput;translation lookaside buffer;workstation	Yorai Wardi;Christos G.

The main idea is to tackle a hard problem by first seeking an insightful simplification. For capacity planning to meet uncertain exogenous demand, offered load analysis looks at the amount of capacity that would be used if there were no constraints on its availability. This simplification is helpful because the stochastic model becomes much more tractable. Offered load analysis can be especially helpful when the demand is not only uncertain but also time varying, as in many service systems. Given the distribution of the stochastic offered load, we often can set staffing levels to stabilize performance at target levels, even in face of a strongly time-varying arrival rate, long service times, and network structure.	cobham's thesis;level of detail;queueing theory;text simplification	Ward Whitt	2013	Manufacturing & Service Operations Management	10.1287/msom.1120.0428	simulation;computer science;operations management;operations research	Metrics	7.995781605824869	8.135507745482712	146436

To realize such a smart grid, large scale pilot projects are currently implemented and evaluated. Such pilot projects generate an excessive amount of data that needs to be processed: energy measurements, information on available flexibility from smart devices that can be shifted in time, control signals, dynamic prices, environmental data, etc. To validate and analyze the gathered data and adjust the running experiments in real-time, an optimized data management infrastructure is needed as well as comprehensive visualization tools. In this paper we present a data management infrastructure optimized for the follow up of the large scale smart grid project called Linear. In this project a pilot in over 200 households is implemented to evaluate several business cases including the balancing of renewable energy supply and the mitigation of voltage and power issues in distribution grids. By decoupling the gathering of the incoming data, the processing and storage of the data, and the data visualization and analysis on different servers, each with their own, optimized database, we obtain an efficient system for validation of the generated data in the pilot, management of the deployed set-ups and follow-up of the ongoing experiments in real-time.	coupling (computer programming);data visualization;experiment;real-time clock;real-time computing;smart device;smart meter;transformer	Matthias Strobbe;Tom Verschueren;Stijn Melis;Dieter Verslype;Kevin Mets;Filip De Turck;Chris Develder	2013	2013 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2013)		renewable energy;simulation;computer science;smart grid;data analysis;internet of things;sustainable development;data visualization;statistics	HPC	1.50778441601357	8.430849649867978	146560

The rates at which the !uid enters and leaves the bu2er depend on a random environment process. The external governing process is an irreducible CTMC and the !uid from the bu2er is emptied at a constant rate . Let X (t) denote the bu2er content at time t and I(t) denote the state of the random environment at time t. In this paper we present a method for computing the mean rst passage times in the {X (t); t¿ 0} process, as well as in the bivariate {(X (t); I(t)); t¿ 0} process. We derive a system of rst-order non-homogeneous linear di2erential equations for the mean rst passage times which can easily be solved using well-known techniques. The method developed here can be readily implemented for computational purposes. We present two examples illustrating how to nd explicitly the analytical solution to a small two-state problem and how to obtain numerical solutions to a multistate problem. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The system involves the developed smart power charging controller, a 75kW photovoltaic (PV) panel, a DC distribution bus and the AC utility grid. Stochastic models of the power demanded by PHEVs in the parking garage and output power of PV are presented. In order to limit the impact of PHEVs' charging on the utility AC grid, a fuzzy logic power flow controller is designed. Based on their power requirements, PHEVs were classified into five charging priorities with different rates according to the developed controller. The charging rates depend on the predicted PV output power, the power demand by the PHEVs and the price of energy from the utility grid. The developed system can dramatically limit the impacts of PHEVs on the utility grid and reduce the charging cost. The system structure and the developed PHEVs smart charging algorithm are described. Moreover, a comparison between the impacts of the charging process of the PHEVs on the grid with/without the developed smart charging technique is presented and analyzed.	algorithm;fuzzy logic;hybrid kernel;multi-storey car park;plug-in (computing);requirement	Tan Ma;Ahmed Mohamed;Osama A.

As transient delay is an ambiguous concept, we first discuss different possible definitions of the term (delay of the kth customer, delay of a customer arriving at time t, etc.). In this paper, we focus on the analysis of the delay of a customer arriving in slot t, also sometimes called virtual delay in single-arrival systems. It turns out that the modeling in batch-arrival systems is more intricate. In analysis, we relate transient delay to transient unfinished work and characterize the latter. Some time-dependent as well as limiting steady-state delay measures are calculated. We also study a variation that is related to active probing measurements. A substantial part of the article finally focuses on some fundamental differences between alternative definitions of transient delay. 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this report, we study the complexity of sampling Markov sequences under two classes of constraints: Binary Equalities and Grammar Membership Constraints. First, we give a sketch of proof of #P-completeness for binary equalities and identify three sub-cases where sampling is polynomial. We then give a proof of #P-completeness for grammar membership, and identify two cases where sampling is tractable. The first polynomial sub-case where sampling is tractable is when the grammar is proven to be unambiguous. Our main contribution is to identify a new, broader class of grammars for which sampling is tractable. We provide algorithm along with time and space complexity for all the polynomial cases we have identified.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;dspace;gibbs sampling;markov chain;markov model;polynomial;sampling (signal processing);strong np-completeness	Stephane Rivaud;François Pachet	2017	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;sampling (statistics);mathematics;sketch;binary number;polynomial;markov model;markov chain;rule-based machine translation;grammar	Theory	-1.570349911642579	15.22082504153173	147696

Accurate modelling and visualisation of both tidal resource and array layout enhances understanding of in-stream tidal behav‐ iour leading to improvements in site identification and optimal positioning of individual turbines. A realistic representation of blade loading conditions will aid designers and manufacturers in creating more robust devices and improve surviv‐ ability. The main barriers to large scale deployments of tidal arrays are the costs associated with manufacturing, installation and maintenance. Therefore, pres‐ ently tidal energy is not competitive on cost with more established renewable technologies. The current position paper investigates and reports on resource modelling, site selection, selecting optimal array configurations and the design and manufacture of devices for tidal stream renewable energy generation. This is aimed at developing models to reliably simulate real conditions, enhance under‐ standing of tidal processes, flow regimes and device survivability issues.	3d modeling;interaction;operating environment;pitch (music);r.o.t.o.r.;simulation	John Harrison;James Uhomoibhi	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-50070-6_2	simulation	HCI	7.009647440880083	5.306954365756504	148120

It is performed on a graphics processing unit (GPU) by combining the optimization procedure with the load flow method. In the case study, performed for the test LVDN with distributed generators (DGs) and controllable loads, differential evolution optimization based on a backward–forward sweep load flow method was parallelized on GPU. The goal of online optimization is to keep the LVDN voltage profile within the prescribed limits, to minimize LVDN losses, and to enable demand response functionality. This is achieved by the optimization determined reference values for the controllable load’s operation, and the reactive power generation, and active power curtailment of DGs. The results show that the parallelized GPU implemented optimization can be significantly faster than similar implementation on a central processing unit, and is, therefore, suitable for the online optimization of the presented LVDN.	graphics processing unit;online optimization	Ernest Belic;Niko Lukac;Klemen Dezelak;Borut Zalik;Gorazd Stumberger	2017	IEEE Trans.

Such a model has potential application to automated manufacturing systems or packet-switched communication networks, where a message is divided into packets (or cells) of fixed lengths. The network is a series-type assembly or transfer line, with the exception that there is an additional class of jobs that requires processing only at the first node (class 0). There is a holding cost per unit time that is proportional to the total number of customers in the system. The objective is to minimize the (expected) total discounted holding cost over a finite or an infinite horizon. We show that an optimal policy gives priority to class-0 jobs at node 1 when at least one of a set ofm−1 inequalities on partial sums of the components of the state vector is satisfied. We solve the problem by two methods. The first involves formulating the problem as a (discrete-time) Markov decision process and using induction on the horizon length. The second is a sample-path approach using an interchange argument to establish optimality.		R. Hariharan;M. S.

This facility becomes impossible to run due to the inability of the public utility to provide steady, reliable and efficient power. A 250KVA generating set was denoted by the school Administration and latter installed for this facility. After the installation, the facility cut off from public utility and depends wholly on Diesel generator. From experience with the performance of the existing generating sets as regards emissions and operating costs due to high cost of maintenance and diesel, a hybrid system (Diesel-Solar PV) was proposed. This paper investigates and analyzes the economic and environmental benefits of the proposed project to existing diesel generator. From the analyses, the proposed system (solar PV-diesel) has less total net present cost and less emission as a result of less fuel consumption and higher efficiency operation of the diesel genset when compared to the existing system (diesel only).	computer;diesel;hybrid system;renaissance	Vincent Anayochukwu Ani	2013	IJEOE	10.4018/ijeoe.2013040102	simulation;engineering;operations management	AI	3.0686236917627188	7.516430105773301	148981

In this paper, an iterative mixed integer quadratic constrained quadratic programming model to optimize the operation of a three phase unbalanced distribution system with high penetration of Photovoltaic (PV) panels, DG and energy storage (ES) is developed. The proposed model minimizes not only the operating cost, including fuel cost and purchasing cost, but also voltage deviations and power loss. The optimization model is based on the linearized sensitivity coefficients between state variables (e.g., node voltages) and control variables (e.g., real and reactive power injections of DG and ES). To avoid slow convergence when close to the optimum, a golden search method is introduced to control the step size and accelerate the convergence. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on modified IEEE 13 nodes test feeders with multiple PV panels, DG and ES. Numerical simulation results validate the proposed algorithm. Various scenarios of system configuration are studied and some critical findings are concluded.	algorithm;coefficient;discontinuous galerkin method;iterative method;mathematical optimization;programming model;purchasing;quadratic programming;simulation;system configuration;unbalanced circuit	Guodong Liu;Oguzhan Ceylan;Bailu Xiao;Michael Starke;Ben Ollis;Daniel King;Philip Irminger;Kevin Tomsovic	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.298	nickel;programming;mathematical optimization;sensitivity;multi-objective optimization;ac power;management;linearization;voltage regulation	HPC	5.220084897286147	4.285455787540824	149257
306939d3db8643e35944016b1f45781da69a750e	distributed energy management of p2p energy sharing in energy internet based on cloud energy storage		Cloud energy storage (CES) has recently been proposed as one of the most economic saving techniques for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing and coordination in energy internet. By transforming traditional consumers into self-sufficient customers and utility customers, CES enables transactions between customers and utility company, as well as among customers. In this paper, an architecture and operational technology which support P2P energy transactions are suggested based on the case of CES. With the aim of shared and virtually integrated CES among individual customers, a distributed algorithm is proposed to achieve higher renewable energy penetration and economic saving, in combination with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). On the basis of a real-world dataset of renewable energy and real-time electricity price, numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of economic saving for a long time application.	augmented lagrangian method;cloud computing;distributed algorithm;internet;loss function;numerical analysis;optimization problem;peer-to-peer;real-time clock;simulation	Yanglin Zhou;Song Ci;Ni Lin;Hongjia Li;Yang Yang	2018		10.1145/3208903.3208906	renewable energy;distributed algorithm;computer network;architecture;business;distributed generation;the internet;cloud computing;energy storage	Metrics	1.9133547629124474	4.7911092804798985	149318

It is shown that swapping is efficient in operating a dual-arm cluster tool. For dual-arm cluster tools with wafer revisiting, if a swap strategy is applied, it forms a three wafer periodical process with three wafers completed in each period. Such a period contains three cycles in a revisiting process and another three cycles in non-revisiting process. Hence, analysis and scheduling of dual-arm cluster tools with wafer revisiting become very complicated. In this work, a Petri net model is developed to describe the operations of such tools. Based on it, it is found that if a swap strategy is applied to a dual-arm cluster tool with wafer revisiting, it is always in a transient state. A systematic method is presented to analyze its performance.	computer performance;paging;petri net;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);transient state;wafer (electronics);wafer fabrication	Naiqi Wu;Feng Chu;Chengbin Chu;Mengchu Zhou	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980119	electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;petri net	Robotics	9.862942666632424	5.682538469911729	149474

However, this requires truly flexible CIT approaches. To this end, we introduce Unified Combinatorial Interaction Testing(U-CIT), which enables practitioners to define their own combinatori al spaces and coverage criteria for testing, and present a unifi ed construction approach to compute specific instances of U-CI T objects. We, furthermore, argue that most (if not all) existing CIT objects are a special case of U-CIT and demonstrate the flexibility of U-CIT on a simple, yet realistic scenario.

The flakes aren't distributed uniformly at random throughout the paint binder but form clusters around center points. The number of flakes around a center is distributed like the Poisson distribution. The article presents three ways to sample from the Poisson distribution. We describe the usual method, a faster method that uses some preprocessing, and an even faster method with more preprocessing. The last two methods work with any discrete probability distribution. Depending on how often we need to generate samples, paying extra for a deluxe model of sample generation might be worth it.	computer programming	Isabel Beichl;Francis Sullivan	1999	Computing in Science and Engineering	10.1109/5992.774841	probability distribution;sampling;programming;mathematical optimization;simulation;random number generation;computer science;theoretical computer science;poisson distribution;pseudo-random number sampling;computer graphics;algorithm;statistics	DB	3.12113870021438	13.850537016440763	150008

In this context, microgrids (MGs) are power networks which, among other properties, allow more flexible demand consumption, and also help with, the efficient integration of renewable resources and electric vehicles (EVs). However, the effect of the incorporation of EVs has to be taken into consideration with care, since that situation may drive to unfeasible operations in grids which have not been designed to support these particular elements. In this paper, a system composed of different agents is used to develop a market-oriented operation in a MG with several EV charge stations. It is expected that the system takes to an optimal management allowing a technically feasible operation considering the behaviour of every agent involved. The demand shifting and the flexible operation of EVs, spatial and temporal, are features that reduce costs and thus improve the benefit of the participants.	depletion region;extended validation certificate;fossil;mg (editor);microgrid	Miguel A.

The existing electric energy monthly trade schedules study only on one single conventional energy resource and cannot solve the electric energy monthly trade schedule incorporating multiple energy sources effectively. Based on this, the time sequential simulation method is proposed in this paper. The method has considered the output characteristics of wind power and conventional units, load characteristics, unit peaking characteristics and start-up mode. The power balance of the power grid with new energy is optimized hour by hour and the model of electric energy monthly trade schedule that meets the energy-saving generation dispatching is established. The result of the computing example verifies the rationality of the time sequential simulation model and the correctness of the theoretical analysis and achieves the target of the lowest integrative cost of monthly power generation. The model has strong social benefits and can provide a reference for making monthly trade schedule.	cplex;computer hardware;correctness (computer science);power supply;rationality;requirement;schedule (computer science);simulation;solver	Yi Wang;Jiakai Shen;Dalong Hu;Ye Han;Weidong Li;Jiye Yang	2016	2016 3rd International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI)	10.1109/ICSAI.2016.7810961	real-time computing;simulation	EDA	4.848993352588486	4.308419070880388	150324

Their main purpose is to provide energy to rural communities, which are not profitable business for utilities due to their socioeconomic characteristics and the high cost of extension of the national grid. This paper provides an analysis of the Nicaraguan legal framework related to DG connected to the electrical grid. The point of view of the electrical market agents is included. Laws are analyzed based on how they were designed to support the particular use of rural electrification by incorporating renewable energies. Findings reveal that while DG is considered in different laws, aspects such as tax exemptions and financial incentives are not properly addressed. Furthermore, grid interconnection standards and commercial regulation are not included at all. These facts represent a real threat to the sustainability model of small energy producers. Additionally, a comparative analysis of the Nicaraguan DG regulatory framework with that of Costa Rica is carried out in order to identify lessons learned as well as failure and success factors. Finally, we provide recommendations for improving Nicaraguan regulation, to support small producers of energy, serving rural communities.	discontinuous galerkin method;interconnection;microwave;point of view (computer hardware company);qualitative comparative analysis	Maria Virginia Moncada;Wadaed Uturbey	2016	2016 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC)	10.1109/GHTC.2016.7857331	engineering;operations management;economy;economic growth	HPC	2.0719299958048074	7.932291541919391	150367

The lower layer is a real-time model predictive control (MPC) executed at 10 s resolution to achieve fine tuning of a given energy setpoint. The upper layer is a slower MPC coordination mechanism based on distributed optimization, and solved with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) at 5 minutes resolution. It is needed to coordinate the power flow among the controllable resources such that enough power is available in real-time to achieve a pre-established energy trajectory in the long term. Although the formulation is generic, it is developed for the case of a battery system and a curtailable PV facility to dispatch stochastic prosumption according to a trajectory at 5 minutes resolution established the day before the operation. The proposed method is experimentally validated in a real-life setup to dispatch the operation of a building with rooftop PV generation (i.e., 101 kW average load, 350 kW peak demand, 82 kW peak PV generation) by controlling a 560 kWh/720 kVA battery and a 13 k W peak curtailable PV facility.

f55568177912d5c05c34298ea29740875630fc47	coordinated primary control reserve by flexible demand and wind power generation		With the steady increase of intermittent renewable energy penetration and reduced access to controllable thermal power plants, the importance of enabling participation of flexible loads in control reserve rises. In this paper, a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) as an aggregator of resources of Demand Response (DR) and wind farms is introduced. It can perform an important role in allocation of the primary frequency control by aggregation of resources of DR and coordination of the primary reserve between those aggregated DR and wind farms. As a result, wind farms can be operated with less available capacity allocated for primary control reserve. This approach contributes to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in a power system with an important share of wind-thermal units in the generation portfolio. Decentralized activation of DR for primary control reserve is proposed. An intraday and a close to real-time scheduling algorithm in compliance with the German electricity market rules for the VPP is devised. The performance of the introduced method is demonstrated by simulation in a representative high voltage transmission network model.	algorithm;network model;power supply;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);secure multi-party computation;simulation	Ehsan Abbasi	2017	2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2017.8086071	renewable energy;electric power system;wind power;electricity market;operations management;scheduling (computing);demand response;virtual power plant;engineering;transmission (mechanics)	HPC	2.7153004462895796	5.089144188439285	151014

63d7a1a6d7842a0806970ace78fe485731725633	a characterization of np within interval-valued computing		In [CiE2005], B. Nagy introduced a new computing paradigm, namely, interval-valued computing. It uses finite unions of subintervals of [0,1) as basic data processing unit (known as generalized intervals). While Turing machines are abstractions where the memory size can be arbitrarily extended in its length, this system assumes the unlimited density of data units. In [TCS2008], the notion of interval-valued computations was formalized. A computation is a sequence of operator applications on generalized intervals (interval-values). Operators are the usual Boolean ones, two shifts (left and right) and a so-called product which works as zooming. A discrete language L is decidable by (linear, polynomial, etc.) interval-valued computation if and only if there is a classical logspace algorithm that for any input word w constructs an interval-valued computation (of a size that linearly, polynomially depends on the length of w) that ends with a nonempty interval-value if and only if w is in L. This tastes like Boolean network computing style but not on discrete bit sequences but on full interval-values. In the same paper we showed that QSAT (the language of true quantified Boolean formulae) can be decided by a linear interval-valued computation and that PSPACE coincides with tha languages decidable by a polynomial size restricted interval-valued computations where restricted means that product operator may occur only as product by [0,1/2). In [VLL2007] we demonstrated the connections of this system to visual computing. In [PMD2011] and in an other paper (accepted for publication, presented on [DCM2012]), we defined the notion of computable function by interval-valued computing and showed two functions to be com-	algorithm;boolean network;computable function;computation;interval arithmetic;l (complexity);pspace;polynomial;programming paradigm;true quantified boolean formula;turing machine;visual computing	Benedek Nagy;Sándor Vályi	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-23111-2_11	combinatorics;time complexity;discrete mathematics;subclass;computer science;operator (computer programming);unconventional computing;computation;syntax;polynomial;aside	Theory	-0.92346282675065	15.899626836089409	151455

We consider refutable/inductive language learning from positive examples, some of which may be incorrect. The error or incorrectness we consider is the one described uniformly in terms of a distance over strings. We define a k-neighbor closure of a language L as the collection of strings each of which is at most k distant from some string in L. In ordinary learning paradigm, a target language is assumed to belong to a hypothesis space without any guarantee. In this paper, we allow an inference machine to infer a neighbor closure instead of the original language as an admissible approximation. We formalize such kind of learning, and give some sufficient conditions for a hypothesis space.As its application to concrete problems, we deal with languages defined by decision trees over patterns. The problem of learning decision trees over patterns has been studied from a viewpoint of knowledge discovery for Genome information processing in the framework of PAC learning from both positive and negative examples. We investigate their learnability in the limit from neighbor examples as well as refutable learnability from complete examples, i.e., from both positive and negative examples. Furthermore, we present some procedures which plays an important role for designing efficient learning algorithms for decision trees over regular patterns.	decision tree learning;inductive reasoning	Masako Sato;Yasuhito Mukouchi;Mikiharu Terada	2002		10.1007/3-540-45884-0_12	information processing;completeness;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;decision tree;mathematics;knowledge extraction;probably approximately correct learning;algorithm	ML	3.6667483914750254	17.684865166048926	152134

Their motivation was to more economically and conveniently monitor the energy flows on a university campus that currently uses over $7 million of electricity and gas annually. These students continued the development of their initial design prototyped for the above course by redesigning, constructing, and testing a more easily manufacturable instrument in their Senior Engineering Clinic class. The engineering clinic sequence at Rowan University represents an ideal mechanism for the inclusion of key instrumentation and measurement (I&M) concepts and principles into an engineer's education. While the core ECE curriculum does not teach I&M technology (I&MT) as a distinct subject area, the students engage in a hands-on and minds-on learning environment in this clinic, which proves ideal for I&MT applications and education. Their challenge was to create an inexpensive I&MT that could provide the means by which Rowan University could affordably monitor its electrical energy use in many of its unmetered buildings. With these data, the university could then find out exactly why it leads a group of 20 peer universities and colleges in energy consumenergy consumption ption per square foot and to assist the university in meeting its sustainability commitment to the Governor's Office and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. With the assistance of their professor and the use of their electrical engineering training, the team undertook to develop an energy auditor's dream machine, i.e., a cheap, portable, and easily installed energy measurement instrument that produces reliable data and can be used to safely instrument each key building without requiring the aid of a professional electrician. This paper details the background of their challenge, the approaches they considered, the benefits of this project-based learning clinic on I&M education and, quite importantly, the innovation they have created, i.e., a single-phase power sensing, measuring, and monitoring instrument for a total cost of less than $100 (their design can be easily expanded to three phase for a nominal increase in sensor cost).	campus party;computer engineering;electrical engineering;hands-on computing;prototype;sony dream machine	Peter Mark Jansson;Jeffrey Tisa;William Kim	2007	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2007.903582	greenhouse gas;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;student engagement;cutoff frequency;system of measurement;energy flow;technology education;sustainable design;mechanical engineering	Mobile	1.7799239154236002	10.433669448669093	152746
f3f18e262bf359eeb58b1225c52d7dbbd4f68e20	quantifying the resilience of community structures in networks		Many networks contain community structures, or collections of densely connected nodes with sparse connections to other dense groups in the network. Communities may coalesce for a number of reasons, including friendships in a social network, physical connections in an infrastructure network, or spatial distribution in a neighborhood. Several approaches have been proposed to identify communities and compare the partition of networks into communities. This work explores community structures from the perspective of their resilience, or their ability to withstand degradation in network performance and recover to a desired level of network performance. In this context, network performance is defined as the similarity of a network partition (or the characterization of the network into community structures) formed after the disconnection of one or more links to the initial partition. This work provides an approach to measure how the initial set of community structures survive after a disruption and how these structures return after restoration commences. The approach is illustrated with an electric power network case study.		Jose Emmanuel Ramirez-Marquez;Claudio M. Rocco;Kash Barker;José Moronta	2018	Rel. Eng. & Sys.

A static planning model is considered which provides a quick solution and viable insight on the microgrid planning decisions.

However, for a subclass that still is of practical interest, a linear satisfiability algorithm and related characterization of unsatisfiability can be established.

This is in the same spirit as the (non-generalized) solutions of Mazoyer except that we do not use signal speeds but the concept of fields to achieve this goal. Signals and speeds do appear visually as an effect of the spatio-temporal structure of the cellular automaton. However, not being setup by design allows the solution to automatically extends to more generalized settings. Moreover, the conceptual design of the solution is separated from the state space optimization that is only handle afterward. The finiteness of state space is also sketched.	cellular automaton;firing squad synchronization problem;mathematical optimization;state space	Luidnel Maignan;Jean-Baptiste Yunès	2016	2016 Fourth International Symposium on Computing and Networking (CANDAR)	10.1109/CANDAR.2016.0048	simulation;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm	EDA	5.553093092422132	15.428781164658375	153112

Items arrive one by one in a buffer and depart from it as soon as possible but by pairs. The items of a departing pair are said to be {\em matched}. There is a finite set of classes $\maV$ for the items, and the allowed matchings depend on the classes, according to a {\em matching graph} on $\maV$. Upon arrival, an item may find several possible matches in the buffer. This indeterminacy is resolved by a {\em matching policy}. When the sequence of classes of the arriving items is i.i.d., the sequence of buffer-contents is a Markov chain, whose stability is investigated. In particular, we prove that the model may be stable if and only if the matching graph is non-bipartite.		Jean Mairesse;Pascal Moyal	2016	J.

With the development of smart grid, real-time pricing (RTP) is being implemented. The charging of PHEVs can be scheduled adaptively to RTP so that the power consumption cost can be minimized. In this paper, a battery replacement strategy is adopted for a charging process in a charging station. We develop the scheduling scheme for PHEV charging. An optimization problem is formulated and solved for an optimal charging policy that minimizes the cost due to power consumption and performance degradation. In addition, the impact of incomplete power price information (e.g., due to unavailability of data communication channel) is analyzed. The numerical results show that if multiple data communication channels are available for transferring the power price information, the scheduling performance can be improved significantly.	channel (communications);charging argument;crew scheduling;elegant degradation;fossil;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;plug-in (computing);real-time clock;requirement;scheduling (computing);unavailability;variable pricing	Qiumin Dong;Dusit Niyato;Ping Wang;Zhu Han	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6687958	embedded system;simulation;engineering;operations management	EDA	3.8607046481333955	4.628832252672007	153603

DQNs emerge from a synthesis of the well-known separable queueing networks (BCMP networks) and the classical machine-repair-man model. Under the assumption that failure and repair events which change the level of performance are much less frequent compared with the service completions of tasks moving through the network, the presented product from approximates the exact probability distribution very closely. Because DQNs are nearcompletely decomposable, the error of approximation depends on the degree of coupling between the different modes of degraded performance. In accordance with the theory of nearcomplete decomposability, a numerical example shows that the approximation error is proportional to the degree of coupling.

For the rational decision, the power operation plan of the prosumers in the region is determined by considering the fixed electricity charge through the system operator. To consider that whole of predicted data is uncertain comparing with the practical data, we set a practical operating mechanism which depends on 2 stage central operation algorithm.

c39213571d5e2afffe43110ea861443cb09bb3f5	generic demand model considering the impact of prosumers for future grid scenario analysis		The increasing uptake of residential PV-battery systems is bound to significantly change demand patterns of future power systems and, consequently, their dynamic performance. In this paper, we propose a generic demand model that captures the aggregated effect of a large population of price-responsive users equipped with small-scale PV-battery systems, called prosumers, for market simulation in future grid scenario analysis. The model is formulated as a bi-level program in which the upper-level unit commitment problem minimizes the total generation cost, and the lower-level problem maximizes prosumers’ aggregate self-consumption. Unlike in the existing bi-level optimization frameworks that focus on the interaction between the wholesale market and an aggregator, the coupling is through the prosumers’ demand, not through the electricity price. That renders the proposed model market structure agnostic, making it suitable for future grid studies where the market structure is potentially unknown. As a case study, we perform steady-state voltage stability analysis of a simplified model of the Australian National Electricity Market with a significant penetration of renewable generation. The simulation results show that a high prosumer penetration changes the demand profile in ways that significantly improve the system loadability, which confirms the suitability of the proposed model for future grid studies.

abe7afd3c89835a6dfe0fa4afe8800ed82c11098	context-free languages and rudimentary attributes	context free language	Formal languages have been defined and classified in several ways. Three of the methods are the hierarchy of grammar types of Chomsky [2], various types of mathematical automata ([10], [3], [9]), and the rudimentary predicates (or attributes) of Smullyan [11]. (We use the term predicate because it is closer to a mathematical convention than Smullyan's term attribute.) These might be described as definition by generation, recognition and construction respectively. The rudimentary attributes seem to be the most manageable of the three, in the sense that translation between intuitive and formal definitions is natural, and it is easier to construct languages from other languages in terms of their rudimentary definitions than in terms of grammars or automata. Myhill showed in [9] that every rudimentary predicate is acceptable by a deterministic linear-bounded automaton, and from the result of Landweber [8] it follows that every rudimentary language is context-sensitive. In this paper we shall show that the rudimentary languages properly include the context-free languages, thus establishing the place of the class of rudimentary languages within Chomsky's hierarchy as being between context-free and contextsensitive. This is done in four steps, by showing successively that each of the following is rudimentary: every regular language (Lemma 8), the relation h ( x ) = y for any simple homomorphism h (Lemma 9), every Dyck language (Lemma 10), and then every context-free language (Theorem 11). Theorem 11 is used in Corollary 12 to show very simply that h ( x ) = y is rudimentary for any homomorphism h. An open question: Are there any languages which are context-sensitive but not rudimentary ? This could be answered affirmatively either by constructing a context-sensitive language which is not accepted by any deterministic linearbounded automaton, or by constructing a language which is accepted by the latter device and is not rudimentary. Both approaches seem difficult. A closely related problem: Are there any 0-1 valued functions in Grzegorczyk's class E 2 which are not in the class E ° ([5])?	context-free grammar;context-free language;context-sensitive grammar;context-sensitive language;dyck language;emoticon;linear bounded automaton;regular language	Neil D.

e6ad686eff9a6a883cb7f1e1d983bc96a411dafe	health-management driven control reconfiguration approach for flight vehicles.		A prognostic system makes it possible to anticipate loss of functionality before it occurs with sufficient lead time to take actions that mitigate the impact of this loss. We focus on the forms of mitigation within the flight vehicle that influence the operational dynamics but do not directly amend the mission plan. Thus, we focus upon the reconfiguration of the feedback control strategy for the flight system. The high degree of complexity in the design and dynamics of modern aircraft is typically handled using a hierarchical control scheme in which there are several levels of control at increasing levels of responsibility: the component level, the subsystem level, and the system level. Our reconfiguration strategy involves mitigating problems that are detected at the component level at both the level in which the fault is detected and higher levels as well. There are, thus, two subproblems to the reconfiguration: (a) an adaptive control problem at the lower level to extend component life and derive new component performance limits, and (b) a supervisory control problem at the higher level to adapt the system controller to maximize system capability while respecting the performance limitations. Since our reconfiguration occurs in the context of a dynamic system, we need to respect the stability implications of the reconfiguration. To address this, we apply bandwidth analyses at the component level and the systems level in a robust performance context. A conservative criterion for stability is to impose rate limits for reconfiguration that insure that undesired, and possibly unmodeled, modes of behavior are not driven by reconfiguration activities. For specific hardware, extensions beyond this conservative approach may be warranted (e.g. to catch faulty behavior) and validated on a case-by-case basis, essentially by extending the component modeling to include a model of behavior under certain types of reconfiguration.	control reconfiguration;control theory;dynamical system;emoticon;feedback;java-gnome	Asif Khalak;K.

3a5191b89055c602aaaa14473db852713926fa36	multi-state throughput analysis of a two-stage manufacturing system with parallel unreliable machines and a finite buffer	markovian analysis;matrix analytic method;manufacturing;parallel machines;manufacturing system;parallel machine	This paper models and analyzes the throughput of a two-stage manufacturing system with multiple independent unreliable machines at each stage and one finite-sized buffer between the stages. The machines follow exponential operation, failure, and repair processes. Most of the literature uses binary random variables to model unreliable machines in transfer lines and other production lines. This paper first illustrates the importance of using more than two states to model parallel unreliable machines because of their independent and asynchronous operations in the parallel system. The system balance equations are then formulated based on a set of new notations of vector manipulations, and are transformed into a matrix form fitting the properties of the Quasi-Birth–Death (QBD) process. The Matrix-Analytic (MA) method for solving the generic QBD processes is used to calculate the system state probability and throughput. Numerical cases demonstrate that solution method is fast and accurate in analyzing parallel manufacturing systems, and thus prove the applicability of the new model and the effectiveness of the MA-based method. Such multi-state models and their solution techniques can be used as a building block for analyzing larger, more complex manufacturing systems.		Jialu Liu;Sheng Yang;Aiguo Wu;S.

Concurrently, offsetting renewable power plants are also being built to mitigate the environmental impact of the new data-centers' massive energy consumption. Research efforts that have studied how to best place new datacenters and renewable power plants have mostly neglected the impact on the electricity transmission grid. In this paper, we show that accounting for the impact on the transmission grid can be mutually beneficial to both datacenter owners and grid operators. Specifically, locating datacenters and renewable power plants at strategic places in the grid could help to minimize (i) overloading of transmission lines, (ii) grid voltage variations outside the acceptable range, and (iii) transmission system losses. We develop an optimization framework for placing a new datacenter and offsetting wind farm, and use it in a case study to show that considering transmission losses along with datacenter costs can lead to different placements and lower overall cost. Interestingly, co-locating the datacenter and wind farm does not always lead to lowest impact on the transmission grid and lowest overall cost. Thus, we conclude that the impact of location on the costs of both the datacenter owners and grid operators should be considered when placing new datacenters and offsetting renewable power plants.	artificial intelligence;data center;function overloading;mathematical optimization;operator overloading;simulation;transmission line	Xiaoying Wang;Divya Kurthakoti Chandrashekhara;Md Haquez;Iñigo Goiri;Ricardo Bianchini;Thu D.

Our goal is to quantify the benefits of optimal energy storage to solar customers whose electricity bills consist of both Time of Use charges ($/kWh, with different rates for on-peak and off-peak hours) and demand charges ($/kW, proportional to the peak rate of consumption in a month). We first define our energy storage optimization problem as minimization of the monthly electricity bill subject to certain constraints on the energy level and the charging/discharging rate of the battery, while accounting for battery's degradation due to cycling and depth of discharge. We solve this problem by constructing a sequence of parameterized multi-objective dynamic programs whose sets of non-dominated solutions are guaranteed to contain an optimal solution to our energy storage problem. Unlike the standard formulation of our energy storage problem, each of the parameterized optimization problems satisfy the principle of optimality - hence can be solved using standard dynamic programming algorithms. Our numerical case studies on a wide range of load profiles and various pricing plans show that optimal energy storage using Tesla's Powerwall battery can reduce the monthly electricity bill by up to 52% relative to the case where no energy storage is used.	algorithm;bellman equation;constrained optimization;converge;depth of discharge;discharger;dynamic programming;elegant degradation;energy level;iteration;load profile;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;powerwall	Reza Kamyar;Matthew M.

The development of the FSM approach involves the modelling of all systems (nodes) of the autonomous network and the identification of the needs and the requirements for energy management in a dynamic and distributed environment where Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are used as the main source of power to the grid. Furthermore, applicability of FSM approach is a main issue, since the final objective is its online implementation to the supervisory control system that derives and supplies the operations-related actions to the involved nodes of the network relying on industrial-grade software. Some indicative results are presented that demonstrate the response of the proposed method to a smart grid network with RES and hydrogen production, usage and storage.	autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);control system;data acquisition;earliest deadline first scheduling;finite-state machine;grid network;hydrogen;mathematical optimization;requirement;scalability;state machine replication	Dimitris Trigkas;Chrysovalantou Ziogou;Spyros Voutetakis;Simira Papadopoulou	2018	2018 5th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)	10.1109/CoDIT.2018.8394845	renewable energy;grid;finite-state machine;smart grid;state of charge;energy management;distributed computing environment;supervisory control;computer science;distributed computing	Robotics	0.6997946929221429	6.829953712899274	156150

It is shown that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the class of concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes are analyzed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for feasible learnability.	alexey chervonenkis;algorithm;concept class;learnability;pattern recognition;vc dimension	Anselm Blumer;Andrzej Ehrenfeucht;David Haussler;Manfred K.

Understanding this risk and its relation to the system state as it evolves, could allow for a more realistic risk assessment over time and even for mitigation or at least preparation if in a high risk state. In order to facilitate this type of analysis in the context of the power grid as a complex system, we develop a new measure of the complex system state, the generalized autonomous generational average Lambda-gaga, which correlates with the risk. The Lambda-gaga measure is an extension of the standard cascading propagation measure lambda but avoids the contamination of that measure by small events.	autonomous robot;complex system;lambda calculus;risk assessment;software propagation	Benjamin A.

02ed554e158d6ac28255ae2cd4361a6ed1cf8b17	spatio-temporal modeling of roof-top photovoltaic panels for improved technical potential assessment and electricity peak load offsetting at the municipal scale	roof top photovoltaic;open source gis;solar cadastre;integrated spatial and energy planning;energy balance time series	Integrated spatial and energy planning has become a major field of interest to meet the current renewable energy share expansion and CO2 emissions reduction targets. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) play a considerable role in supporting decision making in this field. Solar potential maps are a popular strategy to promote renewable energy generation through photovoltaic (PV) panel installations at city and municipal scales. They indicate the areas of roofs that would provide the maximum amount of energy in kW h per year. These are often used to suggest “optimal locations” for PV-panels and/or recommend system sizes to achieve a certain level of yearly autarchy. This approach is acceptable if PVs have only a minor share in the local energy supply system. However, increased PV-penetration can lead to instability of the local grid, create hazards for the security of the supply, and considerably escalate the storage and system back-up requirements. To obtain a proper understanding of the consequences for the local energy balance when selecting or rejecting a certain installation, examining the hourly and intra-hourly time series of the potential energy generation from PVs is necessary. This paper introduces a GIS-based procedure to estimate the potential PV-electricity generation time series for every roof-top section within a study area using open source software. This procedure is complemented by a series of strategies to select suitable PV-installations considering the time series analysis of supply and demand. Furthermore, thirteen technical indicators are considered to evaluate the PV-installation sets selected with every strategy. The capabilities of the procedure are tested using data from a German rural municipality. The proposed procedure constitutes an efficient and accessible way to assess solar potentials at the municipal scale and to design roof-top PV exploitation plans, which are more appropriate to fulfill the local energy requirements.	load profile	Luis Ramirez Camargo;Roland Zink;Wolfgang Dorner;Gernot Stoeglehner	2015	Computers, Environment and Urban Systems	10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2015.03.002	environmental engineering;engineering;civil engineering;operations management	NLP	2.5296283827153943	8.016019798410621	156506

Stationary photovoltaic (PV) collector arrays produce clean and sustainable energy especially during peak hours which are generally day time. In addition, PVs do not emit any waste or emissions, and are silent in operation. The incident energy collected by PVs is mainly dependent on the number of collector rows, distance between collector rows, dimension of collectors, collectors inclination angle and collectors azimuth, which all are involved in the proposed modeling in this article. The objective is to achieve optimal design of a PV farm yielding two conflicting objectives namely maximum field incident energy and minimum of the deployment cost. Two state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) called Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and Generalized Differential Evolution Generation 3 (GDE3) are compared to design PV farms in Toronto, Canada area. The results are presented and discussed to illustrate the advantage of utilizing MOEA in PV farms design and other energy related real-world problems.

The queue is stable as long as the Poisson arrival rate does not exceed a critical value, which depends in a complicated manner on the service rates, the numbers of servers in each group, the size of the intermediate buffer and the unblocking rule followed when system becomes blocked. The critical input rate is determined in a unified manner.For stable queues, it is shown how the stationary probability vector and other important features of the queue may be computed. The essential step in the algorithm is the evaluation of the unique positive solution of a quadratic matrix equation.		Guy Latouche;Marcel F. Neuts	1980	SIAM J.

This and the increase in the use of renewable energy sources will have an important positive impact on our ecosystem. At the same time it will require a serious reanalysis and possibly redesign of the structure of our distribution network. In this paper we propose a model that, at a relatively fine level, describes the behavior of communities in terms of transport requirements, derives statistic driving behavior patterns and determines the corresponding induced Electric Vehicle Charging habits. The energy consumption of every simulated EV is computed taking into account the features of the trip and the vehicle itself. The model has been tailored to data extracted from a portion of the Milan (Italy) metropolitan area, but is trivially adaptable to any area for which a similar set of data is available. The obtained results are compared to data from similar works, showing good agreement. The outputs of the model, i.e. the energy consumption of the vehicles and their time-spatial distribution within a specific area (and consequently the loads on the distribution network nodes due to charging operations), have been (and will be) used to perform impact analyses on network performances and on personal mobility.	ecosystem;extended validation certificate;image resolution;meteorological reanalysis;performance;requirement;state of charge	Federico Bizzarri;F.

f3070f4ea507e36dcac00aacea35b767a8cd8a0d	design and management of flexible on-shore lng production engineering systems		This paper presents a flexibility analysis as a practical procedure to evaluate large-scale capital-intensive projects considering market uncertainty. It considers the combined effects of the time value of money, economies of scale, and learning, and demonstrates the additional benefits stemming from considerations of uncertainty and flexibility in the early stages of design and project evaluation. This study focuses on the long-term deployment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) technology in a target market to supply the transportation sectors. Two design alternatives are considered: 1) fixed design, a big centralized production facility; 2) flexible modular designs, either using phasing approach at the big plant site or the same flexible approach with an option to move modular plants at distance. To compare the design alternatives, a structured flexibility methodology is applied based on several economic lifecycle performance indicators (e.g. Net Present Value, Initial CAPEX, etc.). Results indicate that a flexible modular deployment strategy improves the economic performance as compared to optimum fixed designs. They also indicate that factoring flexibility to locate modules at a distance further improves system performance. Such improvement enhances as learning rate increases. Overall, the study shows that flexibility in engineering design has multiple, supporting advantages due to uncertainty, location and learning.	centralized computing;engineering design process;industrial engineering;integer factorization;mit engineering systems division;software deployment;stemming;time value of money	Michel-Alexandre Cardin;Mehdi Ranjbar-Bourani;Richard de Neufville	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-12544-2_6	automotive engineering;marine engineering;manufacturing engineering	HCI	3.9687251230806644	7.519169337840963	158701

The study of the density of regular and context-free languages has attracted some attention culminating in the fact that such languages are either sparse, when the density can be bounded by a polynomial, or dense otherwise. We show that for all nonambiguous context-free languages the number of accepted words of a given length n can also be computed recursively using a finite combination of the number of accepted words smaller than n, or . This extends an old result by Chomsky and provides us with a more expressive description and new insights into possible applications of the density function for such languages as well as possible characterizations of the density of higher languages.

System effectiveness is defined as the combined measure of availability and reliability at each task-arrival time, when transient human operator behavior was considered in conjunction with the machine state. Because factors such as fatigue, stress, and learning affect the human operator over time, all probability measures for successful human performance are considered to be time-dependent. Performance evaluation models for a generic military system are developed. The modeling techniques can also be used for large-scale, man-machine systems that consist of modern computers and processors.	central processing unit;computer;human reliability;human–machine system;performance evaluation;stochastic process;time of arrival	B.

The main goal of the control strategy is to reduce the operation costs of the power plant, by scheduling the boilers, the operation of the thermal energy storage and the curtailment on the loads. The problem is stated as a constrained optimization in the form of a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), embedded on an Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. Particular attention is paid to modeling of boilers operating constraints, including the outlet water flow temperature, to the energy exchanged with the thermal energy storage and to the operating modes of the power plant layout, including the constraints related to the supply water temperature needed from the network. The results are performed using the data and the layout of the power plant located in the city of Ylivieska, in Finland. The cost analysis performed shows the advantages of using the predictive control strategy.	constrained optimization;control theory;embedded system;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;optimal control;programming model;reduced cost;scheduling (computing)	Giovanni Gambino;Francesca Verrilli;Michele Canelli;Andrea Russo;Mikko Himanka;Maurizio Sasso;Seshadhri Srinivasan;Carmen Del Vecchio;Luigi Glielmo	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525266	control engineering;energy recovery;electricity generation;engineering;thermal energy;waste management;energy storage;grid energy storage	EDA	4.295926618657782	5.233938762425546	159198

This theory is concerned with the quantitative aspects of computations and its central theme is the measuring of the difficulty of computing functions. The paper concentrates on the study of computational complexity measures defined for all computable functions and makes no attempt to survey the whole field exhaustively nor to present the material in historical order. Rather it presents the basic concepts, results, and techniques of computational complexity from a new point of view from which the ideas are more easily understood and fit together as a coherent whole.

The author then highlighted a seeming disparity between a number of different research groups 1) Fthenakis group at Brookhaven, 2) Prieto group in Madrid, 3) Weißbach group in Berlin, and 4) Brandt group at Stanford all of whom have recently published values for the EROI (or similar metric) for solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Unfortunately, in so doing, the author directly compares results calculated using different system boundaries, methodologies, and assumptions. It is the purpose of this response to (1) adjust the results for the four groups to better compare like systems and (2) outline details of two methodological issues common in the EROI literature. The objective of these two activities is to explain much of the apparent disparity between the different EROI values produced by the different research groups.	binocular disparity;page view;point of view (computer hardware company)	Michael Carbajales-Dale;Marco Raugei;Vasilis Fthenakis;Charles Barnhart	2015	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2015.2438471	market research;electricity generation;electrical engineering	ML	2.292958424478968	8.31522016972358	159412

Jobs are assumed to arrive according to a general input process, and each job is assigned randomly to an available processor. A finite capacity input buffer is used if no processor is available. The mathematical model is based on the busy period analysis, and two utilization measures are derived: processor utilization the fraction of processor occupation time during a busy cycle and system utilization the fraction of actual utilization time for all processors. A computational model for these utilization measures is developed through an imbedded Markov chain approach. Experimentation with the computational model reveals the sensitivity of the model to variability in the arrival process. Comparison of 2-processor and 4-processor systems from the operator perspective indicates a qualified preference for the behavior of the 2-processor system. This preference must be carefully interpreted since processor costs, the increase in overhead with an increase in processors, and behavioral variables reflecting the user perspective are excluded.	linc;multiprocessing	Richard E.

42733bae7936f94dc386a015f697e65a4ffa7b7d	intentional controlled islanding and risk assessment: a unified framework		Power systems are prone to cascading outages leading to large-area blackouts, and intentional controlled islanding (ICI) can mitigate these catastrophic events by splitting the system into sustainable islands. ICI schemes are used as the last resort to prevent cascading events; thus, it is critical to evaluate the corresponding system risks to ensure their correct operation. This paper proposes a unified framework to assess the risk of ICI schemes. First, a novel ICI method to create islands with minimum power imbalance is presented. Further, a risk assessment methodology is used to assess the probability and impact of the main operational modes of the ICI scheme. The unified framework provides insights on the benefits of implementing ICI, considering the uncertainties related to its reliability. The ICI scheme is demonstrated using the IEEE 9-bus system. The proposed unified framework is then fully deployed on the actual power system of Cyprus. Multiple case studies on the real network are created to demonstrate the adaptability and robustness of the proposed scheme to different system conditions. The adoption of the unified framework highlights that the system risk significantly reduces with the ICI in service, even when the reliability uncertainties associated with the scheme are considered.	blackout - symptom;ibm power systems;ici (programming language);risk assessment;unified framework;benefit	Jairo Quir&#x00F3;s-Tort&#x00F3;s;Panayiotis Demetriou;Mathaios Panteli;Elias Kyriakides;Vladimir V.

In order to improve the performance of LED-Lighting control systems, we propose a linear model that considers the luminaire's influence on its neighborhood and takes into account visual comfort and energy consumption. The proposed linear model was contrasted against two Neural Network configurations that were trained to find the best dimming levels. Our experiments demonstrate that a linear optimizer applied to our proposed linear model have a better performance than any of the two tested neural networks.	artificial neural network;experiment;lighting control system;linear model;mathematical optimization;maximum power transfer theorem	Victor Lobato-Rios;Viviana del Rocio Hernandez-Castanon;Jesús Ariel Carrasco-Ochoa;José Francisco Martínez Trinidad	2016	2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)	10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900037	simulation;visualization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;lighting;artificial neural network	Robotics	5.653357764390793	6.22369970336441	159829

A doi:10.1016/j.cie.2011.03.003 q This manuscript was handled by area editor Jame ⇑ Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: dowoo@sangji.ac.kr (C. Kim), du A two-stage multi-server tandem queue with two types of processed customers is analyzed. The input is described by the Marked Markovian Arrival Process (MMAP). The first stage has an infinite number of servers while the second stage has a finite number of servers. The service time at the both stages has an exponential distribution. Priority customers are always admitted to the system. Non-priority customers are admitted to the system only if the number of busy servers at the second stage does not exceed some pre-assigned threshold. Queueing system’s behavior is described in terms of the multi-dimensional asymptotically quasi-Toeplitz continuous time Markov chain. It allows to exploit a numerically stable algorithm for calculation of the stationary distribution of the queueing system. The loss probability at the both stages of the tandem is computed. An economic criterion of the system operation is optimized with respect to the threshold. The effect of control on the main performance measures of the system is numerically demonstrated. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Different types of control strategies are being developed to tackle the challenges with direct switching actions such as load shedding or power curtailment. Alternatively, demand flexibility from the large number of DERs is being considered as a potential approach by influencing the individual end-users with various demand response (DR) programs. However, most of the DR-based solutions focus on scheduling phase, thus having a limitation to handle network issues in real-time grid operation. In order to improve DR's capability, besides a proper incentive scheme for involved actors, the DR-based approach needs to integrate network constraints and quantify this real-time information in its control process. In this paper, a novel method for real-time congestion management is proposed, which focuses on resolving the congestion problem at the MV/LV transformer. Detail models for different loads and thermal overloading of the MV/LV transformer are developed to realize the benefits of the demand flexibility. The overall performance of the integrated approach for the congestion management has been verified by a simulation with a typical LV network of the Netherlands.	load shedding;logical volume management;mv-algebra;network congestion;operator overloading;real-time clock;real-time data;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);simulation;thermal grease;transformer	A.

A holistic scheduling problem is, therefore, required to consider the impact of the charging power and that of the switching between vehicle-to-grid and grid-to-vehicle modes to account for battery health. In this paper, we propose a mixed-objective approach toward vehicle-to-grid interactions of a residential parking lot complex. The solution makes accommodation for battery health while considering the cost/profit model for the electric vehicles. We discuss the importance of system constraints in achieving both, valley filling and peak shaving. A moving horizon model is used to determine real-time schedules for the vehicles.

A significant number of studies have focused on the self-organised behaviour of ants in the natural environment to develop effective systems for dynamic problems. Ant-based systems have special properties such as scalability, adaptability, and dynamicity, which are the main requirements for solving vehicle traffic congestion problem. Thus, ant-based algorithms are now being adopted by vehicle traffic systems (VTSs) to guide vehicles to less congested paths. However, literature shows that comprehensive reviews are lacking in this field. The main contribution of this paper is the review and classification of the most relevant systems based on novel taxonomy. A survey that includes statistical analyses on ant-based VTS was conducted to identify the limitations and evaluation process of VTS. This paper concludes by proposing a general framework in applying ant colony optimisation to VTS.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;apache ant (another neat tool);mathematical optimization;network congestion;requirement;scalability;self-organization;simulation;vehicle tracking system	Mohammad Reza Jabbarpour Sattari;Hossein Malakooti;Rafidah Md Noor;Nor Badrul Anuar;Norazlina Khamis	2014	IJBIC	10.1504/IJBIC.2014.059970	ant colony optimization algorithms;simulation;ant robotics;swarm intelligence;computer science;artificial intelligence;operations research	DB	-2.8950704077518283	4.828944488255364	160079

In earlier work we had exhibited a threshold phenomenon in the transient behaviour of a closed network of . / M / 1 nodes: When there are N customers circulating, and the initial state is x, let d~(t ) denote the total variation distance between the distribution at time t and the stationary distribution. Let dU(t )= maxxdff(t). We explicitly found a N proportional to N such that dU(taN) ---~1 for every t <1, and dr( taN) --~ 0 for every t >1. Thus it appears that the network has not yet converged to stationarity upto aN, but has converged to stationarity after aN, SO a N can be naturally interpreted as the settling time of the network. Here we briefly deal with some other similar models closed networks of . / M / m nodes, a well studied model for circuit switched networks, and a model of Mitra for studying concurrency control in databases. Similar threshold phenomena are established in the transient behaviour of these models.	c date and time functions;circuit switching;concurrency (computer science);concurrency control;database;settling time;stationary process	Venkat Anantharam	1989	Queueing Syst.	10.1007/BF01149187	jackson network;markov chain;stationary distribution;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;concurrency control;mathematics;total variation;circuit switching;statistics	ML	8.60103948215225	13.75056455980381	160198

These PV storage systems provide the opportunity to increase the local consumption of locally generated PV energy. The so called self-consumption does not imply an explicit benefit for highly PV penetrated distribution grids suffering PV related voltage rises. Hence, this paper introduces several local voltage control strategies using PV storage systems. These strategies focus on adding a voltage control capability to self-consumption strategies through a combination of voltage dependent battery charging, automatic reactive power provision as well as PV power curtailment. Their potential to smooth the grid integration of PV while increasing self-consumption is assessed through grid simulations and an economic evaluation. In conclusion, PV storage systems which are capable of voltage control can improve PV grid integration and provide a benefit to storage system owners.	battery charger;computer data storage;logical volume management;page view;point of view (computer hardware company);simulation	Jan von Appen;Thomas Stetz;Martin Braun;Armin Schmiegel	2014	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2013.2291116	control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;engineering;electrical engineering;stand-alone power system;grid-connected photovoltaic power system	HPC	2.6176800540273737	6.32091668065962	160780

We study a tandem queueing system consisting of two multi-server stations and finite intermediate buffer. Customers arrive at the first station of the tandem according to a Markovian Arrival Process. The first station does not have a buffer. Customers, who do not succeed to enter the service immediately upon arrival, retry for the service after a random amount of time. After service completion at the first station, a customer leaves the system permanently or moves for the service at the second station. A part of customers entering the second station have a priority over other customers. The priority is provided by means of reservation of a part of servers for the service of priority customers only. Usually, non-priority customers are not allowed to occupy the reserved servers. However, if the queue of non-priority customers in the intermediate buffer becomes larger than some preassigned threshold while there are free servers, a non-priority customer is picked-up for the service. Customers staying in the buffer are impatient. Priority and non-priority customers have different patience time and may leave the system or return to the first station if the patience time expires. The system is analyzed in steady state. A condition for existence of the stationary regime in the system is derived, the steady state distribution and various performance measures of the system are calculated, some illustrative numerical examples are discussed. A tandem queue under consideration is suitable, e.g., for modeling call centers with Interactive Voice Response Machines. Analysis presented in this paper was implemented in borders of the applied project funded by one of the banks.	queueing theory;tandem computers	Che Soong Kim;Valentina I. Klimenok;Alexander N.

One of the approaches towards a more balanced grid is, e.g., taken by the German government by subsidizing local storage for solar power. While the main interest of the energy operator and the government is to balance the grid, thereby ensuring its stability, the main interest of the client is twofold: the total cost for electricity should be as low as possible and the house should be as resilient as possible in the presence of power outages. Using local battery storage can help to overcome the effects of power outages. However, the resulting resilience highly depends on the battery usage strategy employed by the controller, taking into account the state of charge of the battery. We present a Hybrid Petri net model of a house (that is mainly powered by solar energy) with a local storage unit, and analyse the impact of different battery usage strategies on its resilience for different production and consumption patterns. Our analysis shows that there is a direct relationship between resilience and flexibility, since increased resilience, i.e., reserving battery capacity for backup, decreases the flexibility of the storage unit.	backup;cloud storage;controller (computing);energy operator;petri net;state of charge;thread-local storage	Hamed Ghasemieh;Boudewijn R.

23c8a892ca3f09ed6197a9aa8aadf45c6e6c3495	multipass precedence analysis	context free	This paper defines a hierarchy of languages which is properly contained in the context sensitive languages and which starts with the context free family. The hierarchy is defined inductively by controlling labeled linear grammars with languages in one family to yield languages in the next larger family. The families of the hierarchy have properties analogous to those of the context free family, in particular, the new mechanism introduced is very suitable for parsing. A language in the n-th family is specified by a sequence of n — 1 labeled linear grammars and a context free grammar. By assuming that the reversals of the first n — 1 grammars and the last labeled linear grammar are precedence grammars, the concepts and parsing algorithm of Wirth and Weber extend to yield a parsing algorithm within the hierarchy. This considerably enhances the usefulness of the construction and allows much of the power of the context sensitive languages to become accessible in measured amounts for potential programming applications.	algorithm;context-free grammar;context-sensitive language;linear grammar;parsing	Nabil A.

The literature introduces the concept of Smart Grid, a system which takes into account the behaviour and the action of its agents. Studying the smart grid through modelling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in the real world due to time and cost related constraints. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system approach to the smart grid modelling, accentuating on the representation of the structure. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved on a dynamic graph taking into account changes and network errors over time, with the ability to detect them.	agent-based model;algorithm;complex system;complex systems;computational complexity theory;context-free language;global optimization;grid computing;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;object composition;optimization problem;simulation	Guillaume Guérard;Soufian Ben Amor;Alain Bui	2015	2015 International Conference on Smart Cities and Green ICT Systems (SMARTGREENS)	10.5220/0005409203350341	control engineering;simulation;engineering;distributed computing	Robotics	6.461422433576832	4.284189099336606	162719

The metallization is a plating process that deposits electroless nickel and electroless gold on conductive molybdenum features.  The plating operation involves the processing of up to 72 multilayer ceramic substrates in one group. Each product group automatically moves through 35 sequential chemical operations to complete the process.  As a product is completed, the process parameters are monitored and stored by computers (IBM Series 1). In addition, the product transporters are controlled and monitored by computers.

The system considered in this study consists of the large-scale AS/RS with stacker cranes, the looped track AGV system, aisle conveyors connecting these two systems, and incoming and outgoing conveyors. There are two major stages to model large-scale AS/RS-AGV systems efficiently and to execute simulation experiments. The first stage is to generate a simulation program by placing appropriate modules and inputting the selected parameters such as the number of banks, the number of bays, the number of levels of AS/RS, and the number of AGVs. The second stage is to perform simulation experiments. In the proposed model, every item number puts on each rack, the corresponding number of cases for each item, the time of arriving in the warehouse, and the time of departing from the system are stored and recorded. Generally, it takes a lot of time to build a complex program for a particular type of large-scale AS/RS-AGV system. It is found that simulation/ animation models can be made quickly, by using a module-based modeling method developed in this study.	experiment;lempel–ziv–stac;reed–solomon error correction;simulation	Soemon Takakuwa	1996		10.1145/256562.256924	anime;simulation;computer science;engineering;technical report;time of arrival;world wide web;engineering drawing	AI	9.006789949366937	4.477918080913477	163255

A novel method of converting time-integrated interdependent logic conditions, which are for constraining the lockout effect, into inequalities is proposed in this paper. A case study is conducted with realistic data to validate the feasibility of the modeling and control approaches. Parametric studies in terms of temperature deadband width, ambient temperature, and lockout time are conducted to investigate the service quality in different circumstances. The test results reveal that a population of diversified TCAs can become a major source of providing ancillary service. The proposed approach can be specialized to deal with the pure ON/OFF control.	advanced telecommunications computing architecture;advanced process control;aggregate data;interdependence;lockout chip;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;quality of service;semiconductor industry;simulation;vacuum fluorescent display	Mingxi Liu;Yang Shi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2016.2535400	control engineering;real-time computing;engineering;control theory;smart grid	SE	3.8625069071931457	4.820957447905889	163648

A mismatch between the forecasted and the actual load in smart electricity grids can arise due to the intermittent nature of the renewable energy sources. To minimize this deviation, we propose a distributed model predictive controller, in which prosumers equipped with flexible appliances make control decisions based only on local information, also taking the distribution network capacity limitations into account.

Sequential reductions traverse the black points of a picture, and focus on the actually visited point for possible deletion, while parallel reductions delete all ‘deletable’ black points simultaneously. Two reductions are called equivalent if they produce the same result for each input picture. A deletion rule is said to be equivalent if it provides a pair of equivalent sequential and parallel reductions. Thinning and shrinking algorithms iterate reductions until no points are deleted. If a black point is not deleted in an iteration step, it is taken into consideration again in the next step. This work examine fixpoints of iterated reductions with equivalent deletion rules, i.e., ‘survival’ points whose rechecking is not needed in the remaining iterations.	iterated function	Kálmán Palágyi;Gabor Nemeth	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-05288-1_2	mathematical optimization;traverse;computer science;iterated function;binary number	Logic	-0.35964478635219455	15.134599955819743	164057

Onshore wind farms have been built in many countries, such as Denmark, Norway, UK, Italy, Brazil and the US. To utilize the more stable wind resources, wind farms have moved off the shore, first to shallow waters near shore and now extending to deeper waters and far off the shore. Deep-water offshore solutions will give access to large areas with high wind, and less sensitivity to noise, visual impacts and size. However, the cost of developing and operating an offshore wind farm is many times larger than onshore due to large water depths and harsh offshore environments. Hence, the needs for fast and automatic data exchange in offshore wind industry are required more than ever. A smart grid is one of the technologies which will help the wind industry to effectively use wind power plants and reduce cost of operation and maintenance. The aim of this work is to develop a flexible information model for offshore smart grids, which can keep pace with the current rapid development of wind turbine technology. In this work, we choose the existing IEC 61400-25 standard as a starting point for developing an information model for offshore wind smart grid communication.	information model	Trinh Hoang Nguyen;Andreas Prinz;Trond Friisø;Rolf Nossum	2012	2012 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2012.6175686	wind power;offshore wind power;engineering;civil engineering;operations management;marine engineering	HPC	3.3208146156568787	9.181398955062969	164085

Nonetheless, aerial high voltage power lines are still supported by old transmission towers which involve some serious risks. Those risks may be avoided with periodic and expensive reviews. The main objective of this work is to reduce the number of these periodic reviews so that the maintenance cost of power lines is also reduced. More specifically, the work is focused on reducing the number of periodic reviews of transmission towers to avoid step and touch potentials, which are very dangerous for humans. A virtual organization-based multi-agent system is proposed in conjunction with different artificial intelligence methods and algorithms. The developed system is able to propose a sample of transmission towers from a selected set to be reviewed. The system ensures that the whole set will have similar values without needing to review all the transmission towers. As a result of this work, a website application is provided to manage all the review processes and all the transmission towers of Spain. It allows the companies that review the transmission towers to initiate a new review process for a whole line or area, while the system indicates the transmission towers to review. The system is also able to recommend the best place to locate a new transmission tower or the best type of structure to use when a new transmission tower must be used.	aerial photography;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;case-based reasoning;database;multi-agent system;project dream;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sampling (signal processing);simulation;virtual organization (grid computing)	Pablo Chamoso;Juan F.

The system includes flexible machines, fixed storage areas, a fixed number of pallets and an automated material handling device. A procedure is developed to aggregate part-type dependent data so that a single class of parts is obtained and the number of states of the underlying Markov chain is significantly reduced. Problems encountered when implementing Markovian approaches are dealt with by using the QNAP2 software package. Results based on a real workload are given for several transport durations and are very satisfactory when compared with those of simulation experiments. The overall approach exhibits a great flexibility, which is highly desirable for the systems studied.	blocking (computing);network model;performance evaluation	D.

Exponentially distributed jobs arrive to a dispatcher, which assigns each task to one of the servers. In the so-called size-aware system, the dispatcher is assumed to know the remaining service requirements of some or all of the existing jobs in each server. The aim is to minimize the mean sojourn time, i.e., the mean response time. To this end,we first analyze anM/M/1-PS queue in the framework ofMarkov decision processes, and derive the so-called size-aware relative value of state, which sums up the deviation from the average rate at which sojourn times are accumulated in the infinite time horizon. This task turns out to be non-trivial. The exact analysis yields an infinite system of first order differential equations, for which an explicit solution is derived. The relative values are then utilized to develop efficient dispatching policies by means of the first policy iteration (FPI). Numerically, we show that for the exponentially distributed job sizes the myopic approach, ignoring the future arrivals, yields an efficient and robust policy when compared to other heuristics. However, in the case of highly asymmetric service rates, an FPI based policy outperforms it. Additionally, the size-aware relative value of an M/G/1-PS queue is shown to be sensitive with respect to the form of job size distribution, and indeed, the numerical experiments with constant job sizes confirm that the optimal decision depends on the job size distribution. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

5a2cf43289c40d2928c6a42653001e0272abbae3	robust energy hub management using information gap decision theory		This paper proposes a robust optimization framework for energy hub management. It is well known that the operation of energy systems can be negatively affected by uncertain parameters, such as stochastic load demand or generation. In this regard, it is of high significance to propose efficient tools in order to deal with uncertainties and to provide reliable operating conditions. On a broader scale, an energy hub includes diverse energy sources for supplying both electrical load and heating/cooling demands with stochastic behaviors. Therefore, this paper utilizes the Information Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) to tackle this uncertainty as an efficient robust optimization tool with low complexity to ensure the optimal operation of the system according to the priorities of the decision maker entity. The proposed optimization framework is also implemented on a benchmark energy hub which includes different energy sources and evaluated under different working conditions.	behavior;benchmark (computing);computer cooling;computer data storage;cool - action;decision theory;electrical load;electricity;health information exchange;heating;mathematical optimization;providing (action);radiology information systems;real-time clock;robust optimization;simulation;small;usb hub	Mohammad Sadegh Javadi;Amjad Anvari-Moghaddam;Josep M.

As customary, erroneous data records are detected by formulating a set of rules. Such rules are here encoded into linear inequalities. This allows to check the set of rules for inconsistencies and redundancies by using a polyhedral mathematics approach. Moreover, it allows to correct erroneous data records by introducing the minimum changes through an integer linear programming approach.

We consider traffic streams or “classes” that have a cost function representation related to cell loss. These traffic classes share a common finite capacity buffer. Using this model we characterize optimal scheduling and rejection rules for minimizing the cost of lost cells, both over the finite and infinite time horizon. Optimization is considered both at the single switch level and for a sequence of switches with cross traffic. For the single node case we describe optimal policies for cell scheduling and rejection when loss related cost functions are used. These cost functions can either be linear or convex. In the case of a two-node system, we describe numerical experiments using a dynamic programming formulation. Although this leads to large computational cost, it does provide insight into simple rules which could be used to approximate optimal policies.	control flow;end-to-end principle	Erol Gelenbe;Sridhar Seshadri;Vijay Srinivasan	1994			real-time computing;computer science;operations management;distributed computing	Embedded	8.809732414720497	9.26137849043248	167678

The key technology that achieves this manufacture mode is to aggregate all kinds of potential CMfg services to create value-added composite CMfg services, so as to satisfy various manufacturing requirements. As massive CMfg services with the same manufacturing functionalities and different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the Internet, CMfg services dynamic composition becomes more and more complex. One challenge of this technology is how to efficiently solve the problem of multipath CMfg services dynamic composition. Another challenge is how to conquer the overconstrained problem occurred in the process of CMfg services dynamic composition. To tackle these two issues, this paper proposes an approach for multipath CMfg services dynamic composition based on improved QoS constraint hierarchies (CHs) model. First, a QoS constraints description model with new evaluation function is propounded based on the CHs theory to conquer the overconstrained problem; second, improved max–min ant system (MMAS) is put forward by introducing improved transfer rule, new global pheromone updating rule and mutation mechanism into MMAS, and then an optimization algorithm named culture genetic MMAS is constructed for multipath CMfg services dynamic composition. Finally, experimental results and performance comparison prove that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.	cloud manufacturing;multipath propagation	Zhi-Zhong Liu;Cheng Song;Dian-Hui Chu;Zhanwei Hou;Wei-Ping Peng	2017	Int.

In particular, the net load ramping, created as a result of simultaneous solar generation drop and load increase at early evening hours, is one of the major operational issues that needs to be carefully addressed. In this paper, microgrids are utilized to offer a viable and localized solution to this challenge while removing the need for costly investments by the electric utility. In this regard, first the microgrid ramping capability is determined via a min-max optimization, and second, the microgrid optimal scheduling model is developed to coordinate the microgrid net load with the distribution grid net load for addressing the ramping issue. Numerical simulations on a test distribution feeder with one microgrid exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model.	electrical load;load profile;mathematical optimization;microgrid;multistage interconnection networks;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment	Alireza Majzoobi;Amin Khodaei	2016	2016 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2016.7781276	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;solar energy	HPC	3.5958093070608723	6.456305025012123	167891

f373d52183d3c13a31a43654bc78e6d3e64700f7	an innovative hybrid wind-solar and battery-supercapacitor microgrid system—development and optimization		This paper presents a methodology for the joint capacity optimization of renewable energy (RE) sources, i.e., wind and solar, and the state-of-the-art hybrid energy storage system (HESS) comprised of battery energy storage (BES) and supercapacitor (SC) storage technology, employed in a grid-connected microgrid (MG). The problem involves multiple fields, i.e., RE, battery technology, SC technology, and control theory, and requires an efficient and precise co-ordination between sub-fields to harness the full benefits, making the problem labyrinthine. The optimization problem is formulated, and it involves a variety of realistic constraints from both hybrid generation and storage, and an objective function is proposed to: 1) minimize the cost; 2) improve the reliability; and 3) curtail greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The complex optimization problem is solved innovatively in piecewise fashion to decrease the complexity and computational time. First, sizes of solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) are determined using an innovative search algorithm, and in the second step, the size of HESS is calculated, finally the optimal solution is determined. A comparison based upon cost, reliability, and GHG emissions is presented which plainly shows the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The technique is also applied to determine the size of an MG employing PV, WT, and BES operating in grid-connected mode. And a brief cost analysis, reliability assessment, and emission reduction are given for three scenarios: 1) MG with HESS; 2) MG with BES; and 3) MG with conventional generation. It is shown that an MG with HESS is not only economical but also more reliable and has lower GHG emissions.	capacity optimization;collegehumor;computer data storage;control theory;mathematical optimization;mg (editor);microgrid;optimization problem;search algorithm;time complexity	Umer Akram;M.

Pairing means that departures from the bu ers are synchronised and that service is interrupted if anyof the bu ers is empty. To cope with the inherent state-space explosion problem, we propose an approximate numericalalgorithm which calculates the rst Lcoecients of the Maclaurin series expansion of the steady-state probability vectorin O(KLM) operations, Mbeing the size of the state space.1. IntroductionWe consider a system of Kqueues, each queue having nite capacity. Let C i denote the capacity of the ith queue.Moreover, for each of the queues, customers arrive in ac-cordance with an independent Poisson process, let  i >0denote the arrival rate in queue i. Departures from thedi erent queues are paired which means that there are si-multaneous departures from all queues with rate as longas all queues are non-empty. If one of the queues is empty,there are no departures.The queueing system at hand is motivated by kittingprocesses in assembly systems. A kitting process collectsthe necessary parts for a given end product in a con-tainer prior to assembly. While conceptually simple, kit-ting comes with many advantages. Kitting clearly miti-gates storage space requirements at the assembly stationsince no part inventories need to be kept there. Moreover,parts are placed in proper positions in the container suchthat assembly time reductions can be realised [3, 9]. Akitting process is obviously related to a paired queueingsystem: the inventories of the di erent parts that go intothe kit correspond to the di erent bu ers, the kitting timecorresponds to the service time and kitting is blocked ifone or more parts are missing.Paired queueing systems have been studied by variousauthors. Harrison [4] studies stability of paired queueingunder very general assumptions: K2 in nite-capacitybu ers, generally distributed interarrival times at the dif-ferent bu ers and generally distributed service times. Heshows that it is necessary to impose a restriction on thesize of the bu er to ensure stability of the queueing sys-tem. In particular, the distribution of the vector of wait-ing times (in the di erent queues) of the components of a	series expansion	Eline De Cuypere;Koen De Turck;Dieter Fiems	2014	Oper. Res.

In the case of large consumers, this can lead to an overload of the electro-energetic system. In order to avoid such scenarios, the consumers have to pay peak load additionally. The share of this cost in overall costs for electricity can be significant, up to 50% for smaller production plants with discontinuous production. For large consumers, peak load costs usually do not exceed 30% of total costs for electricity. In order to reduce the peak load, it is necessary to provide consistent power consumption that is without major short-term peaks. The paper presents several examples of microcontroller based systems for peak load reduction.	load profile;microcontroller	Visa Tasic;Dragan R.

This became possible due to the recent recompression technique.#R##N##R##N#While this technique was successfully applied for pure word equations without involution or rational constraints it could not be used as a black box for free groups. Actually, the presence of an involution and rational constraints complicates the situation and some additional analysis is necessary. Still, the technique is general enough to accommodate both extensions. In the end, it simplifies proofs that satisfiability of word equations is in PSPACEPSPACE and the corresponding result for equations in free groups with rational constraints. As a byproduct we can decide in PSPACEPSPACE whether the solution set is finite.		Volker Diekert;Artur Jez;Wojciech Plandowski	2016	Inf.

Along with a review of drivers and recent developments towards distributed energy resources, this brief presents research challenges of integrating millions of distributed energy resources into the grid. The brief then proposes a novel three-level hierarchical architecture for effectively integrating distributed energy resources into smart grids. Under the proposed hierarchical architecture, distributed energy resource management algorithms at the three levels (i.e., smart home, smart neighborhood, and smart microgrid) are developed in this brief based on stochastic optimization that can handle the involved uncertainties in the system.	stochastic optimization	Yuanxiong Guo;Yuguang Fang;Pramod P.

We propose Delayed Workload Shifting (DWS) which has two defining features: when there are n users in the system, newly arriving users are no longer admitted directly. Instead, these users will reattempt getting access after a stochastic delay until they are successful. The goal of DWS is to release pressure from the system during overloaded periods, and indeed we show that the performance gain can be substantial. We derive nontrivial corrections to classical QED approximations to account for DWS, and leverage these to control stationary and time-varying system behavior.	approximation;dictionary writing system;server (computing);stationary process	Johan van Leeuwaarden;Britt W.

This abstraction is then taken further into a real-time scenario where automated home energy managing devices attempt to maintain Nash equilibrium under persistent varying unplanned electricity consumption.	algorithm;game theory;nash equilibrium;real-time clock;requirement	Saraansh Dave;Mahesh Sooriyabandara;Luyang Zhang	2011	2011 2nd IEEE PES International Conference and Exhibition on Innovative Smart Grid Technologies	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2011.6162735	economics;operations management;microeconomics;commerce	Robotics	2.936933914369227	4.4768701343539	170063

In this paper, an efficient price profile under the Real-Time Pricing (RTP) option is found out to optimize the regional domestic daily electric load curve. The domestic electric appliances are divided into eight categories, with respect to the difference of their self-price elasticity and cross-price elasticity. In order to set up a reasonable pricing strategy model, both the users' satisfaction and the price are taken into account. The program of RTP is taken and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the electricity price profile. Under the optimized price profile, the load curve tends to be more flat and the average price for the customer is lower than before, after the variation and shift of the electric power demand.	aggregate data;aggregate function;algorithm;elasticity (cloud computing);elasticity (data store);electrical load;load profile;particle swarm optimization;real-time transcription;variable pricing	Zhongwen Li;Haixin Huang;Chuanzhi Zang;Haibin Yu	2013	2013 15th IEEE International Conference on Communication Technology	10.1109/ICCT.2013.6820418	financial economics;price elasticity of demand;price elasticity of supply;economics;limit price;operations management;cross elasticity of demand;microeconomics;elasticity;complementary good;demand curve	Robotics	3.2759216859548683	4.844047690768473	170479

Regular customers arrive according to a Markovian arrival process and special customers arrive according to a phase type renewal process. The service times are exponentially distributed with parameter depending on the type served. While a regular customer requires the attention of only one server, a special customer needs the attention of all servers. An arriving special customer finding the servers busy with a special customer is lost; otherwise, the special customer will enter into service immediately by possibly pre-empting existing services of regular customers. The displaced customers will enter into service once the special customer leaves. The model is analyzed in steady state and some illustrative numerical examples are discussed to bring out the key effect of the special customers on selected system performance measures. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This lane selection decision is often based on intelligent on-the-spot analysis of the physical length and the number of vehicles in each counter. Capturing such a lane selection behavior is important while designing a toll plaza as conventional queue selection rules do not mimic the reality. A simulation model of a toll plaza with identical counters is developed and various lane selection rules are analyzed. The goal is to identify a rule that minimizes the waiting time of arriving vehicles. The insights gained from the study could be used for regulating the incoming vehicles to the correct lane as well as for designing a toll plaza to provide a required level of service.	selection rule;simulation	T.

The proposed control strategy considers grid interconnections for additional power exchanges. This paper is based on an original Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem definition for the optimal control of power flows in a SNMs. The control strategy incorporates storage devices, various distributed energy resources, and loads. The objective function aims to minimize the power exchanges among microgrids (MGs), and to make each local energy storage system in a MG works around a proper optimal value. The proposed model is evaluated through a case study in the Savona district, Italy, consisting of four MGs that cooperate together under an SNMs connected to a main grid. The case study shows that the proposed approach can effectively cope with the aim to decrease the intermittencies effects of renewable energy sources, and to manage real-time burst in the residential local demands.	centralized computing;computer data storage;control theory;loss function;mg (editor);microgrid;optimal control;optimization problem;quadratic programming;real-time clock;system of systems	Ahmed Ouammi;Hanane Dagdougui;Roberto Sacile	2015	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2014.2314474	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory	Embedded	3.92418097168286	4.976492664376029	170794

The adiabatic framework provides analytical tools for stability analysis of slowly changing systems that can be modeled as time inhomogeneous reversible Markov chains. In particular, we consider queueing policies whose service rate is adaptively changed based on the estimated arrival rates that tend to vary with time. As a result, the packet distribution in the queue over time behaves like a time inhomogeneous reversible Markov chain. Our results provide an upper bound on the time for an initial distribution of packets in the queue to converge to a stationary distribution corresponding to some pre-specified queueing policy. These results are useful for designing adaptive queueing policies when arrival rates are unknown, and may or may not change with time. Furthermore, our analysis is readily extended for any system that can be modeled as a time inhomogeneous reversible Markov chain. We provide simulations that confirm our theoretical results.	converge;detailed balance;markov chain;network packet;simulation;stationary process	Leena Zacharias;Thinh P.

Evaluations of the EMS in a realistic scenario, which consists of a building with adsorp- tion chiller, hot and cold water storage tanks as well as combined heat and power plant, show the ability to reduce energy consumption and costs by an improved scheduling of the generation of hot and chilled water for cooling purposes.	evolutionary algorithm;interdependence	Ingo Mauser;Julian Feder;Jan Müller;Hartmut Schmeck	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-16549-3_20	structural engineering;architectural engineering;engineering;operations management	HCI	4.636838465029415	5.976446565748383	170826

63a3371702b5333aa4a7bd398baf83db4acf330d	a simulation analysis of the impact of finite buffer storage on manufacturing system reliability		This paper develops a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) approach to estimate the system reliability for a multistate manufacturing network with parallel production lines (MMN-PPL) considering finite buffer storage. System reliability indicates the probability that all workstations provide sufficient capacity to satisfy a specified demand and buffers possess adequate storage. The buffers are modeled as a network-structured MMN-PPL. Storage usage of buffers is analyzed based on the MMN-PPL. MCS algorithms are developed to generate the capacity state and to check the storage usage of buffers to determine whether the demand can be satisfied or not. System reliability of the MMN-PPL is estimated through simulation. The MCS approach is an efficient method to estimate system reliability for an MMN-PPL with a reasonable accuracy and time. A pair of practical examples including a tile and a touch panel manufacturing systems shows that system reliability is overestimated when buffer storage is assumed to be infinite. Demand satisfaction probability is further addressed to provide guidance for a proper production policy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

af5adbec92d943c3ca5fe6b15128d75144d7cbde	inductive inference of context-free languages - context-free expression method		An inductive inference problem of context-free languages is investigated. There have been many attempts to this problem, and most of them are based on a problem setting in which a representation space for hypotheses is a class of context-free grammars. An inference algorithm given in this paper , on the contrary, employs a kind of extensions of regular expressions called context-free expressions as a representation space for context-free languages. The algorithm, based on the notion of an identification in the l imit, is significantly concise when compared with existing algorithms. 1. I n t r o d u c t i o n We consider the following model of inductive inference problem: Given an object L of inference, an inductive inference device (IID) tries to infer a representation H for the object from examples. It is assumed that IID has an enumeration mechanism by which any possible hypothesis from the representation space can be eventually enumerated at least once. It is also assumed that we can utilize an oracle for presenting examples concerning the object. IID asks the oracle for an example, and computes hypothesis and outputs i t , and again asks another example for the next step, and this process is cycled. In a sequence of hypotheses H1, H2 , . . . I ID is said to identify L in the l imit if there exists a positive integer n such that Hn represents L and Hn + i equals to Hn for all i >0. A simple algorithm for identification in the l imit is the one based on the notion of identification by enumeration. Let H1, H2,... be an effective enumeration of the possible hypotheses, and suppose a set of examples e1,e2,...,ek are presented. Then, ED provides as its next output the first hypothesis which is compatible with all these examples. Under the assumption of a perfect oracle, the sequence of hypotheses converges in the limit.([Gold 1967]) In this paper, we deal with the inductive inference problem for context-free languages, and employ a representation space for hypotheses different from the ones in the existing methods. This enables us to make an elegant discussion on the problem and to obtain a simple algorithm for solving the problem.	algorithm;context-free language;id-wsf;inductive reasoning;oracle database;recursively enumerable set;regular expression	Takashi Yokomori	1987				AI	-3.947891301343304	15.283211205731952	171767

Conventional PHEV power management systems work in either an online or offline mode. Most online systems are based on some pre-set power balancing strategies without utilizing the driving cycle or route information. Offline management strategies solved from historical driving cycles are not optimal for real specific driving routes. With the rapid development of vehicular networks and proliferation of smartphones, real-time traffic information can be collected by smartphones from a vehicular network so as to facilitate online PHEV power management. This paper proposes an on-road PHEV power management cyber-physical system (CPS) with 2-level hierarchical optimizations to minimize the fuel consumption of a trip. The high-level online stochastic optimization generates a battery energy budget for each road at runtime according to the traffic prediction and trip information. The low-level powertrain policies are solved offline from historical driving cycles. During driving, the high-level battery energy budgets and low-level policies are combined to get the optimal power decisions according to current driving states. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other three methods in fuel savings.	airplane mode;algorithm;backward induction;cyber-physical system;high- and low-level;mathematical optimization;online and offline;plug-in (computing);power management system;real-time clock;real-time computing;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;smartphone;stochastic optimization;table (database)	Bingnan Jiang;Yunsi Fei	2014	2014 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium Proceedings	10.1109/IVS.2014.6856597	control engineering;engineering;automotive engineering;transport engineering	EDA	4.919072935023363	5.337875365174885	172379

This is on one hand due to the ever increasing demand in energy consumption (e.g. electric vehicles) and secondly due to the proliferation of distributed generators (e.g. renewable energy) to be connected to the grid. Current power networks will no longer be able to provide the required level of system reliability and robustness and thus there is a need for a more flexible connection and management.

Changing the traditional structure of power systems and integrating communication devices are beneficial for better monitoring and decisionmaking by System Operators but increases the chance of being maliciously attacked. The communication links can be hacked so that the attacker can alter the power flow and power injection measurements, which are used to estimate the states of power system. In this paper, we formulate an attack strategy that can change the congestion of transmission lines without being detectable. Moreover, the financial benefit in an Ex-Post market is also investigated. Simulation results on an IEEE 30-Bus test system shows both the changes of congestion and the potential financial benefit gained by an attacker.	computer science;function overloading;ibm notes;ibm power systems;network congestion;simulation;sysop;transmission line	Mohammad Esmalifalak;Zhu Han;Lingyang Song	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214211	embedded system;power-flow study;electricity market;telecommunications;computer science;transmission line;electric power system;electric power transmission;network congestion;computer security;computer network	EDA	-1.313713206864565	6.364445056655229	172681

This works uses the formulation of Energy Hub previously presented in the literature, as an interface among energy producers, consumers and the transportation infrastructure. Risk factors such as demands, operating and maintenance cost or power cost are considered in the optimization of the system. Mitigation actions reduce the risk impacts that may affect the system. A model predictive control approach is used to optimize the demand satisfaction and to determine the set of mitigation actions to be executed. An example of a hybrid storage system is considered. In particular, the architecture incorporates a wind generator, a Combined Heat and Power Plant (CHPP) and an intermediate hydrogen storage. A set of possible risks has been identified in the system in order to select the mitigation actions that reduce the impacts of these risks.

MGs bring unprecedented modularity, efficiency, sustainability, and resilience to the power grid as a whole. Due to a high share of renewable generation, MGs require innovative concepts for control and optimization, giving rise to a novel class of smart energy applications, in which communications represent an integral part. In this article, we review power talk, a communication technique specifically developed for direct current MGs, which exploits the communication potential residing within the MG power equipment. Depending on the smart energy application, power talk can be used as either a primary communication enabler or an auxiliary communication system that provides resilient and secure operation. The key advantage of power talk is that it derives its availability, reliability, and security from the very MG elements, outmatching standard off-the shelf communication solutions.	floor and ceiling functions;mathematical optimization;mg (editor);microgrid	Cedomir Stefanovic;Marko Angjelichinoski;Pietro Danzi;Petar Popovski	2017	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700178	grid;communications system;computer network;renewable energy;synchronization;computer science;smart grid;direct current;distributed computing;sustainability;exploit	Arch	0.3257590437774521	7.738003733880783	173158

Renewable energy sources (RESs), mainly wind and solar, can reduce emissions from the electric energy sector; however, they are very intermittent. Likewise, next generation plug-in vehicles, which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, referred to as gridable vehicles (GVs) by the authors, can reduce emissions from the transportation sector. GVs can be used as loads, energy sources (small portable power plants) and energy storage units in a smart grid integrated with renewable energy sources. However, uncertainty surrounds the controllability of GVs. Forecasted load is used in unit commitment (UC); however, the actual load usually differs from the forecasted one. Thus, UC with plug-in vehicles under uncertainty in a smart grid is very complex considering smart charging and discharging to and from various energy sources and loads to reduce both cost and emissions. A set of valid scenarios is considered for the uncertainties of wind and solar energy sources, load and GVs. In this paper, an optimization algorithm is used to minimize the expected cost and emissions of the UC schedule for the set of scenarios. Results are presented indicating that the smart grid has the potential to maximally utilize RESs and GVs to reduce cost and emissions from the power system and transportation sector.	algorithm;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;next-generation network;particle swarm optimization;plug-in (computing);real-time clock;run time (program lifecycle phase);schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);uc browser;unmanned aerial vehicle	Ahmed Yousuf Saber;Ganesh K.

However, regenerations in such networks are difficult to identify when the interarrival times are generally distributed. We assume that the interarrival times have exponential or heavier tails and show that such distributions can be decomposed into mixture of sums of independent random variables such that at least one of the components is exponentially distributed. This allows an implementable regenerative simulation for these networks. We show that the regenerative mean and standard deviation estimators are consistent and satisfy a joint central limit theorem. We also show that amongst all such interarrival decompositions, the one with largest mean exponential component minimizes the asymptotic variance of the standard deviation estimator. We also propose a regenerative simulation method that is applicable even when the interarrival times have superexponential tails.	automated theorem proving;harris affine region detector;simulation;singular value decomposition;steady state;tails;time complexity	Sarat Babu Moka;Sandeep Juneja	2013	2013 Winter Simulations Conference (WSC)		minimisation;econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;markov process;estimation theory;queueing theory;statistics	Metrics	9.309044153717453	12.964841375209307	173268

In this paper we focus on a residential microgrid, which consists of a grid-tied PV system and a battery, and propose a new low-complexity closed-loop EMS based on a nonlinear and time-variant feedback. The main characteristic of the proposed EMS is that instead of directly optimizing the energy flows, it optimizes the parameters of a two-layer controller. This EMS is tested using real irradiance and electrical consumption measurements. Results show a satisfactory performance of the proposed EMS.

The situation arises in connection with maritime container terminals. The steady state solution to the problem follows an integral equation that may be solved numerically. When congestion is light (as is usual in well managed ports) approximate analytic solutions to the integral equation can be found. As an illustration, formulas are given that apply if the deviations from the schedule and the service times have some specific distributions. These expressions accurately predict the expected delay for systems with fairly unpunctual arrivals and occasional congestion. The paper also contains an exact analytical solution for the special case in which service times are constant and the deviations from the arrival schedule are independent Gumbel variables.

In this Genetic Algorithm, a population diversity measurement and an adaptive crossover strategy are proposed to further improve the efficiency and convergence of Genetic Algorithm. The probability value of the crossover operation can be set according to the combination of population diversity and individual fitness. The algorithm can get more excellent composite service plan because it accords with the characteristic of web service selection very well. Some simulation results on web service selection with global QoS constraints have shown that the adaptive Genetic Algorithm can gain quickly better composition service plan that satisfies the global QoS requirements.	genetic algorithm;quality of service;requirement;service-oriented modeling;simulation;web service	Chengwen Zhang	2011	2011 IEEE Workshops of International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/WAINA.2011.43	web service;algorithm design;genetic algorithm;computer science;data mining;database;law;world wide web;computer network;population-based incremental learning	HPC	4.364163632526731	13.744873500990117	173962

Many attempts have been made to de ne interesting classes that are learnable in this model, preferably with the associated learner having certain advantageous properties. Heinz '09 presents a set of language classes called String Extension (Learning) Classes, and shows it to have several desirable properties. In the present paper, we extend the notion of String Extension Classes by basing it on lattices and formally establish further useful properties resulting from this extension. Using lattices enables us to cover a larger range of language classes including the pattern languages, as well as to give various ways of characterizing String Extension Classes and its learners. We believe this paper to show that String Extension Classes are learnable in a very natural way , and thus worthy of further study.	algorithm;crystal structure;empty string;learnability;machine learning;microsoft outlook for mac;natural language;pattern language;regular language;theory	Anna Kasprzik;Timo Kötzing	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13089-2_32	natural language processing;string operations;regular language;computer science;artificial intelligence;pattern language;mathematics;programming language;algorithm	ML	-3.0332238415618633	16.56761107429066	174043

Numerical, categorical and functional data can be handled in a uniform manner in this setting. We demonstrate how mechanisms based on data sanitisation and those that rely on adding noise to query responses fit within this framework. We prove that once the sanitisation is differentially private, then so is the query response for any query. We show how to construct sanitisations for high-dimensional databases using simple 1-dimensional mechanisms. We also provide lower bounds on the expected error for differentially private sanitisations in the general metric space setting. Finally, we consider the question of sufficient sets for differential privacy and show that for relaxed differential privacy, any algebra generating the Borel σ-algebra is a sufficient set for relaxed differential privacy.	database;differential privacy;numerical linear algebra;sanitization (classified information);spaces	Naoise Holohan;Douglas J.

Hierarchical and iterative models of systems have been used extensively to solve this problem. A problem with models which use fixed-point iteration is the theoretical proof of existence, uniqueness, and convergence of the fixed-point equations, which still remains an “art.” In this paper, we establish conditions, in terms of the net structure and the characteristics of the iterated variables, under which existence of a solution is guaranteed when fixed-point iteration is used in stochastic Petri nets. We use these conditions to establish the existence of a fixed point for a model of a priority scheduling system, at which tasks may arrive according to a Poisson process or due to spawning or conditional branching of other tasks in the system.	branch (computer science);fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point iteration;markov chain;proof of existence;scheduling (computing);state space;stochastic petri net	Varsha Mainkar;Kishor S.

The derived estimates can be used for performance evaluation and capacity planning in cases where the arrival process is not observable directly. Instead, only the departure process modified at the (last) server needs to be observed. Concerning the arrival process we begin by focusing on the normally distributed number of arrivals per interval and on autoregressive processes. Both classes can be used to model traffic in communication networks on links with a high degree of aggregation. In the case of autoregressive processes we apply the Tobit regression model in order to derive accurate estimates of all parameters of the arrival process. We then continue by generalizing the estimation procedures to correlated arrival processes by using the Buckley-James Estimator. The results are presented for the single G/D/1 queue but are then generalized to the more realistic scenario of sequences of queues with possibly varying bottleneck capacity. The latter especially permits the modeling of effects due to interfering cross traffic. We show how the derived estimates can be used for performance evaluation or capacity planning based on effective bandwidth theory. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimation procedures can be utilized within wireless networks by means of a detailed simulation model.		Stephan Heckmüller;Bernd E.

This paper is motivated by the requirement that the feedback analysis service of e-learning system needs to distribute the computing jobs for balancing the workload and getting the fast response. We propose an efficient local search method embed into the differential evolution algorithm (DE) to find a feasible solution. DE is efficiently in the computing time and the proposed local search method tries to enhance the result of DE for minimizing the makespan. Comparing with DE, our proposed algorithm reduces the makespan with the ratio 64% in the best case.

First, an averaging principle for two-component Markov process (x n (t),ζ n (t)) is proved in the following form: if a component x n (⋅) has fast switches, then under some asymptotic mixing conditions the component ζ n (⋅) weakly converges in Skorokhod space to a Markov process with transition rates averaged by some stationary measures constructed by x n (⋅). The convergence of a stationary distribution of (x n (⋅),ζ n (⋅)) is studied as well. The approximation of state-dependent queueing systems of the type M M,Q /M M,Q /m/N with fast Markov switches is considered.

5195811233748e1b92fb68a2bea2c09ab966c245	towards a 3d spatial urban energy modelling approach	urban planning;heat energy demand;energy systems;agent based modelling;keywords 3d city model	Today’s needs to reduce the environmental impact of energy use impose dramatic changes for energy infrastructure and existing demand patterns (e.g. buildings) corresponding to their specific context. In addition, future energy systems are expected to integrate a considerable share of fluctuating power sources and equally a high share of distributed generation of electricity. Energy system models capable of describing such future systems and allowing the simulation of the impact of these developments thus require a spatial representation in order to reflect the local context and the boundary conditions. This paper describes two recent research approaches developed at EIFER in the fields of (a) geo-localised simulation of heat energy demand in cities based on 3D morphological data and (b) spatially explicit Agent-Based Models (ABM) for the simulation of smart grids. 3D city models were used to assess solar potential and heat energy demand of residential buildings which enable cities to target the building refurbishment potentials. Distributed energy systems require innovative modelling techniques where individual components are represented and can interact. With this approach, several smart grid demonstrators were simulated, where heterogeneous models are spatially represented. Coupling 3D geodata with energy system ABMs holds different advantages for both approaches. On one hand, energy system models can be enhanced with high resolution data from 3D city models and their semantic relations. Furthermore, they allow for spatial analysis and visualisation of the results, with emphasis on spatially and structurally correlations among the different layers (e.g. infrastructure, buildings, administrative zones) to provide an integrated approach. On the other hand, 3D models can benefit from more detailed system description of energy infrastructure, representing dynamic phenomena and high resolution models for energy use at component level. The proposed modelling strategies conceptually and practically integrate urban spatial and energy planning approaches. The combined modelling approach that will be developed based on the described sectorial models holds the potential to represent hybrid energy systems coupling distributed generation of electricity with thermal conversion systems.	3d city models;3d modeling;agent-based model;emoticon;energy systems language;energy modeling;image resolution;information visualization;refurbishment (electronics);simulation;spatial analysis	Jean-Marie Bahu;Andreas Koch;Enrique Kremers;Syed Monjur Murshed	2014	IJ3DIM	10.4018/ij3dim.2014070101	simulation;engineering;operations management;transport engineering	AI	2.137206113585884	7.785234077695164	175755

The construction of these models is formalised within the algebra underlying weighted finite automata and expressed in terms of weighted rational languages and transductions. Besides the algebra we make use of five special constant weighted transductions which rely only on the alphabet and the model parameter N. In addition, we discuss efficient implementations of these transductions in terms of virtual constructions.	automata theory;finite-state machine;language model;natural language processing;text corpus	Thomas Hanneforth;Kay-Michael Würzner	2009	Acta Cybern.		natural language processing;discrete mathematics;regular language;computer science;computational linguistics;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm	NLP	-1.224791049190748	17.43340065099906	175969

Equalizing the power consumption in industry may lead to the utilization of power in other service areas in an efficient way. Although industries have comparably lesser number of power consuming device types than other service areas the power consumption is quite high. To meet the demands rising in the industry, shiftable loads (devices) can be redistributed equally to all the working time slots based on the average power utilization. It can be done in a flexible manner by shaping the loads using Demand Side Management (DSM) technique in Smart Grid. The main objective is to minimize the power utilization during the electricity rush hour by effectively distributing the power available during off-peak hour. Evolutionary algorithm can be well adapted to problems where optimization is the core criteria. Any maximization or minimization problem can be solved efficiently using evolutionary algorithm. Hence, to obtain the optimized fitness function of load redistribution in industry Genetic Algorithm in Demand Side Management (GA-DSM) is chosen and it has benefited with an overall reduction of 21.91% which is very remarkable. In addition to this the evaluation of the fitness function using GA-DSM is carried out in other two industrial dataset models (steel plant and wind power plant) which is unavailable so far in the literature.	genetic algorithm	C.

In this paper, we leverage data center workload scheduling for the coordination between data centers and the smart grid, aiming to reduce the electricity cost of data centers and smooth the load variation of the smart grid simultaneously. We first build cost models of workload scheduling at data centers and the power generation and variation at the smart grid. We formulate the objective function as a weighted sum of the cost of the smart grid and the penalty caused by workload scheduling. Using the dual decomposition method, we then derive the optimal offline solution. To facilitate online implementation, we finally propose a Receding Horizon Control (RHC) based algorithm to obtain the suboptimal solution using limited predicted information. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly reduce the cost of the smart grid, by up to 20%, while smoothing the load variation simultaneously.	algorithm;cost efficiency;data center;lagrangian relaxation;loss function;marginal model;online algorithm;online and offline;optimization problem;power supply;recueil des historiens des croisades;scheduling (computing);simulation;smoothing;tango;weight function	Han Hu;Yonggang Wen;Lei Yin	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7511442	embedded system;data modeling;real-time computing;simulation;load balancing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;smart grid	HPC	3.730733779934768	4.557672568307839	176219

We assume that arriving tasks for the workforce are homogeneous, and that each is characterized by an unknown and onedimensional difficulty value x ∈ [0, 1]. Each worker i is characterized by their ability wi ∈ [0, 1], and can solve the task if and only if x ≤ wi. If a worker is unable to solve a given task it must be forwarded to a worker of greater ability. For a given set of worker abilitiesW and a distribution P over task difficulty, we are interested in the problem of designing efficient forwarding structures forW and P . We give efficient algorithms and structures that simultaneously (approximately) minimize both the maximum workload of any worker, and the number of workers that need to attempt a task. We identify broad conditions under which workloads diminish rapidly with the workforce size, yet only a constant number of workers attempt each task.	algorithm;organizing (structure);p (complexity);population	Hoda Heidari;Michael Kearns	2013			real-time computing;simulation	ML	3.9196585214731994	12.311030080400778	176279

The aims of the paper are two-fold. The first, is to bring this technique, which is still relatively new, to the attention of a wider audience, since the method is particularly relevant to practical systems optimization. The second, is to develop two new methods, the phantom customer method and the marked customer method, as extensions of the perturbation analysis approach. These methods enable efficient and accurate optimization of closed queueing networks with blocking and general service-time distributions. Useful practical applications of these methods would be for optimization of performance of computer systems, communication networks, and automated manufacturing complexes.

Consumers send the power requests online over-list. The request is released with a limited set of timeslots. Only one of the timeslots in the set can this request be served by the operator. In a timeslot, the electricity cost consumed to serve the requests is a quadratic function of the load in it. Our aim is to find a best possible online schedule which generates the minimal total electricity cost. In this paper, we propose a greedy algorithm of this problem which is 2-competitive. Besides, we prove our algorithm is optimal.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of a comfort indicator, present an advanced reward system, and finally propose a framework for aggregating residential demands enrolled in incentive-based demand response (DR) programs. The proposed framework not only allocates load serving entities’ demand reduction requests among residential appliances quickly and efficiently without affecting residents’ comfort levels but also rewards residential consumers based on their actual participation. Also, since the framework is designed with the practical considerations of simplicity and efficiency, it can be utilized as a quick implementation for existing pilot development works. The effectiveness and merit of this framework are demonstrated and discussed in the comparison studies with conventional incentive-based DR.	algorithm;automatic control;cost efficiency;deficit round robin;entity;mathematical optimization;virtual appliance	Qinran Hu;Fangxing Li;Xin Fang;Linquan Bai	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2631083	load balancing;computer science;demand load;peak demand;demand management;microeconomics;smart grid;commerce	Visualization	2.971463646232962	4.878834185074832	177305

A method of reduction is suggested that reduces the number of roots in separate equations, which in its turn saves time spent for finding roots of the whole system. Three mechanisms of reduction are proposed, each looking for some prohibited combinations of variables in separate equations (combinations that do not satisfy the equations). The first procedure looks for constants (prohibited values of some variables, or 1-bans). The second one looks in a similar way for prohibited combinations of values on pairs of variables (2-bans) and finds all their logical consequences closing the set of discovered 2-bans. The third analyses the equations by pairs, finds r common variables for them, and checks one by one all different combinations of their values looking for prohibited ones (r-bans). The found bans are used for deleting some roots in other equations. After this new bans could be found, so the procedure of reduction has the chain nature. It greatly facilitates solving large systems of logical equations. Sometimes it is enough to find the only root of a system or prove its inconsistency.	algorithm;closing (morphology);experiment;logical connective	Arkadij Zakrevskij	2000	The Computer Science Journal of Moldova		discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	AI	-4.344651759435558	13.253179703957347	177653

While most existing Demand Response (DR) programs only use pricing signals to encourage consumers to alter their power consumption patterns, the impacts on consumers have been overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel demand management scheme that takes into account of the consumer comfort level. We define the concept of Operational Comfort Level (OCL), and construct the OCL models for a range of smart appliances. These OCL models are integrated into our load management scheme. We develop a Min-Max Load Scheduling (MMLS) algorithm to minimize the peak-to-average ratio (PAR), while maximize the OCL of consumers. Simulation results confirm that our proposed MMLS algorithm is able to achieve both peak-load shifting and energy cost saving with minimal impact on consumers' comfort levels.	algorithm;load management;simulation	Ren Ping Liu;Chen Wang;Martin de Groot;Zhiyuan Zeng	2012	2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465829	real-time computing;load balancing;operations management;peak demand;microeconomics;dynamic demand;smart grid;business	Embedded	3.473132842067671	4.918762689287818	178485

Significant innovations in various vehicle mechanisms have contributed to several different degrees to electrification from mild hybrid versions, electrifying auxiliary functions to full electrification providing full power assist. Advancements in design and development of the power converters, motors and drives are one of the several underlying technologies contributing to an efficient operation and emissions reduction. Although respective advancements in each of these domains can be leveraged across mobile platforms, there are some limitations and gaps that are not implicit. This paper studies the opportunities and gaps for technologies in power conversion, electric motor and drives across on highway and off highway mobile vehicles applications. A model based simulation of some of the promising technologies is used to demonstrate the need for customized designs and development based on applications for electrified vehicles.

The increasing number of electric vehicles, heat-pumps or other household energy storage appliances are great candidates for DLC but in this paper only the currently available boilers have been considered. The authors prepared four case studies in order to quantify the potentials in the existing and future DLC infrastructure therefore analysed the distribution network loss reduction potential of DLC, the benefits of peak-shaving to reduce the procurement cost of the DSO, the attainable balancing energy (BE) reduction of the DSO and the possibility of offering ancillary services (AS) by directly controllable loads.

So, when we look for reasons for our inability to resolve P &equil; NP and related questions, we most likely find them dealing with a lack of understanding of particular computational problems and their lower bounds. This is the sense of Hopcroft's prediction: “...within the next five years, nobody will prove that any of these problems takes more than let's say n2 time. I think that's a reasonably safe conjecture and it also illustrates how little we know about lower bounds.” [MT]. Hopcroft's guess is uncanny in its accuracy—after six years and considerable effort by many researchers, his conjecture remains unchallenged.  The results in this paper offer a possible explanation for our failure to resolve these problems. Roughly, the main result of the sequel links lower bounds and a branch of mathematical logic known as model theory. In particular, we prove that the existence of nonpolynomial lower bounds is equivalent to the existence of nonstandard models of a sizable fragment of arithmetic. Since these are deep logical issues and there are very few techniques for handling them, and since the nonstandard models in question are non-effective, it seems plausible that this linking of complexity theory and logic explains our failure to obtain nontrivial lower bounds.  One of the aims of mathematical logic is to clarify the relation between mathematical theories and their interpretations—or models.	complex systems;computation;computational complexity theory;computational problem;theoretical computer science	Richard A.

1d173608f3f9c5901ea791f7a7b3585ccdd09959	a new ultracapacitor state of charge control concept to enhance battery lifespan of dual storage electric vehicles		The electric vehicle battery life is generally affected by its rapid utilization, accumulated heat and overall energy throughput. Inclusion of ultracapacitor along with battery provides enhanced flexibility in operating and utilizing the battery more adequately. In such dual storage systems, the energy management scheme plays an important role in determining the overall system efficiency. In this paper, a new concept to manage the state of charge (SOC) of ultracapacitor is proposed. The aim of the proposed approach is, based on the vehicle velocity at acceleration, to regulate the amount of energy that ultracapacitor should support in order to ensure its availability for an extended period. A two-stage artificial neural network based strategy is developed to achieve the aforementioned ultracapacitor SOC control. The battery energy throughput and its temperature rise during a complete battery discharge are taken as key parameters for the evaluation. It is shown in the paper that with the proposed approach, the energy storage system efficiency and battery life can be improved significantly. Finally, the applicability of the proposed concept is demonstrated experimentally.	artificial neural network;computer data storage;discharger;experiment;state of charge;throughput;velocity (software development)	Khaled A.

One of the most important applications is learning minimal contextual assumptions in automated compositional verification. We propose in this paper an efficient learning algorithm, called L , that learns and generates a minimal separating DFA. Our algorithm has a quadratic query complexity in the product of sizes of the minimal DFA’s for the two input languages. In contrast, the most recent algorithm of Gupta et al. has an exponential query complexity in the sizes of the two DFA’s. Moreover, experimental results show that our learning algorithm significantly outperforms all existing algorithms on randomly-generated example problems. We describe how our algorithm can be adapted for automated compositional verification. The adapted version is evaluated on the LTSA benchmarks and compared with other automated compositional verification approaches. The result shows that our algorithm surpasses others in 30 of 49 benchmark problems.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);dfa minimization;decision tree model;formal verification;l (complexity);local tangent space alignment;randomness;regular language;time complexity	Yu-Fang Chen;Azadeh Farzan;Edmund M.

The functions of communication networks are embedded into dispatching data networks in China, thus we use dispatching data networks in the paper. The structures of dispatching data networks are generally categorized into two types: 1) double-star; and 2) mesh. The correlation of nodes in double-star networks and power systems is “degree to degree,” whereas “degree to betweenness” is the correlation for mesh networks. Furthermore, the interactive model between power grids and dispatching data networks is presented by a dynamic power flow model. Taking the IEEE 39-bus system and China's Guangdong 500-kV system as examples, in the case of random attacks on the interdependent system, simulation results show that the power grid coupled with double-star dispatching data networks has lower probability of catastrophic failures than with the mesh structure, because the double-star dispatching data network has outstanding capability of delivering information even though some communication nodes are out of order. In contrast, under intentional attacks, the decrement of the transmission performance of the double-star network is more serious than that in the mesh network. Therefore, the power system exhibits much higher vulnerability when coupled with the double-star network.	approximation;betweenness;cascading failure;categorization;cyber-physical system;embedded system;failure analysis;ibm power systems;increment and decrement operators;interdependence;load shedding;mesh networking;simulation;star network;telecommunications network	Ye Cai;Yijia Cao;Yong Li;Tao Huang;Bin Zhou	2016	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2015.2478888	data modeling;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;distributed computing;power-system protection;computer security	HPC	-2.7835126287013314	7.671097502876054	179086

Here, we use GIS to visualize adoption of RPSs and electricity generation from renewable energy sources in the US and examine changes in renewable electricity and solar electric generation over time with the goal of informing future policies aimed at promoting the adoption of renewable energy technologies.	geographic information system;microsoft office project portfolio server;solar cell;web server	Chelsea Schelly;Jessica Price	2014	ISPRS Int.

This paper presents a new manufacturing service composition method to solve the multi-objective optimization problem based on quality of service (QoS). The proposed model not only presents different methods for calculating the transportation time and transportation cost under various structures but also solves the three-dimensional composition optimization problem, including service aggregation, service selection, and service scheduling simultaneously.

9acd5c11120ae83f3aeefae34af42b27a3cc3b20	control of supermarket refrigeration systems via online combinatorial optimization		Supermarket refrigeration systems consume 4% of the total commercial energy consumption in the United States. Improving their energy efficiency contributes to the sustainability of global energy systems and the supermarket business sector. This paper proposes a new control method that can save the energy consumption of multi-case supermarket refrigerators by explicitly taking into account their interconnected and switched system dynamics. Its novelty is a bilevel combinatorial optimization formulation to generate ON/OFF control actions for expansion valves and compressors. The inner optimization module keeps display case temperatures in a desirable range and the outer optimization module minimizes energy consumption. In addition to its energy-saving capability, the proposed controller significantly reduces the frequency of compressor switchings by employing a conservative compressor control strategy. However, solving this bilevel optimization problem associated with interconnected and switched systems is a computationally challenging task. To solve the problem in near real time, we propose two approximation algorithms that can solve both the inner and outer optimization problems at once. The first algorithm uses a linear approximation, and the second is based on the submodular structure of the optimization problem. Both are (polynomialtime) scalable algorithms and generate near-optimal solutions with performance guarantees. Our work complements existing optimization-based control methods (e.g., MPC) for supermarket refrigerators, as our algorithms can be adopted as a tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems arising in these methods.	approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);bilevel optimization;cloud computing;combinatorial optimization;computer cooling;concave function;control theory;controller (computing);linear approximation;linear system;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;polynomial;real-time computing;scalability;submodular set function;system dynamics;the matrix;time complexity;monotone	Insoon Yang;Sila Kiliccote;Ram Rajagopal;Claire J.

This study was motivated by an examination of a circuit pack testing procedure in an AT&T factory. However, the model may be representative of many manufacturing assembly operations. We assume that customers from n classes arrive according to independent Poisson processes with the same arrival rate into a singleserver queueing station where the service times are exponentially distributed. The service discipline requires that service be rendered simultaneously to a group of customers consisting of exactly one member from each class. The server is idle if there are not enough customers to form a group. There is a separate waiting area for customers belonging to the same class and the size of the waiting area is the same for all classes. Customers who arrive to find the waiting area for their class full, are lost. Performance measures of interest include blocking probability, throughput, mean queue length and mean sojourn time. Since the state space for this queueing system could be large, exact answers for even reasonable values of the parameters may not be easy to obtain. We have therefore focused on two approaches. First, we find upper and lower bounds for the mean sojourn time. From these bounds we obtain the asymptotic solutions as the arrival rate (waiting room, service rate) approaches zero (infinity). Second, for moderate values of these parameters we suggest an approximate solution method. We compare the results of our approximation against simulation results and report good correspondence.	approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);ergodic theory;erlang (unit);queueing theory;server (computing);simulation;state space;throughput	E.

2ed59bcd0d0716ab155673bbf6b125fcd079bd81	deriving knowledge of household behaviour from domestic electricity usage metering	hb economic theory;qa 75 electronic computers computer science	The electricity market in the UK is undergoing dramatic changes and requires a transformation of existing practices to meet the current and forthcoming challenges. One aspect of the solution is the deployment of demand side management (DSM) programmes to influence domestic behaviour patterns for the benefit of the overall network. Effective deployment of DSM requires segmentation of the population into a small number of groupings. Using a database of electricity meter data collected at a frequency of five minutes over a year from several hundred houses, households are clustered based on the shape of the average daily electricity usage profile. A novel method, incorporating evaluation criteria beyond compactness, of evaluating the resulting groupings is defined and tested. The results indicate the potentially most useful algorithms for use with load profile clustering. Patterns within the electricity meter data are approximated and symbolised to allow motifs (representing repeated behaviours) to be identified. Uninteresting motifs are automatically identified and discarded. The different possible parameters, including size of motif and number of symbols used in representing the data, are explored and the most appropriate values found for use with electricity meter data motif detection. The concept of variability of regular behaviour within a household is introduced and methods of representing the variability are considered. The novel method of using variability in timing of motifs is compared to other techniques and the results tested using the previously defined evaluation criteria.

First, methods of constructing sparse stealth attacks are developed for two typical scenarios: 1) random attacks in which arbitrary measurements can be compromised; and 2) targeted attacks in which specified state variables are modified. It is already demonstrated that stealth attacks can always exist if the number of compromised measurements exceeds a certain value. In this paper, it is found that random undetectable attacks can be accomplished by modifying only a much smaller number of measurements than this value. It is well known that protecting the system from malicious attacks can be achieved by making a certain subset of measurements immune to attacks. An efficient greedy search algorithm is then proposed to quickly find this subset of measurements to be protected to defend against stealth attacks. It is shown that this greedy algorithm has almost the same performance as the brute-force method, but without the combinatorial complexity. Third, a robust attack detection method is discussed. The detection method is designed based on the robust principal component analysis problem by introducing element-wise constraints. This method is shown to be able to identify the real measurements, as well as attacks even when only partial observations are collected. The simulations are conducted based on IEEE test systems.	greedy algorithm;ibm power systems;malware;mathematical optimization;random graph;robust principal component analysis;search algorithm;simulation;sparse matrix;stealth;with high probability	Jinping Hao;Robert J.

It is assumed that upon arrival of a low-priority call one call of such kind might be immediately transferred to the end of the queue of the high-priority calls. The transfer probabilities depend on the state of the queue of heterogeneous calls. Consideration was given both to the models with separate and common queues.

5fcb9794604773acd1e201dcda9bf5c81f88bf2b	microgrid value of ramping		The growing penetration of renewable generation in distribution networks, primarily deployed by end-use electricity customers, is changing the traditional load profile and inevitably makes supply-load balancing more challenging for grid operators. Leveraging the potential flexibility of existing microgrids, that is to help with supply-load balance locally, is a viable solution to cope with this challenge and mitigate existing net load variability and intermittency in distribution networks. This paper discusses this timely topic and determines the microgrid value of ramping based on its available reserve using a cost-benefit analysis. To this end, a microgrid ramping-oriented optimal scheduling model is developed and tested through numerical simulations to prove the effectiveness and the merits of the proposed approach in microgrid ramping valuation.	best, worst and average case;heart rate variability;load balancing (computing);load profile;microgrid;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;scheduling (computing);simulation;value (ethics)	Alireza Majzoobi;Mohsen Mahoor;Amin Khodaei	2017	CoRR		grid;renewable energy;real-time computing;load profile;scheduling (computing);valuation (finance);business;intermittency;microgrid	AI	3.3372231505813965	6.173912985480662	180485

Also there are linear operating costs and linear holding costs. The class of two-level hysteretic control rules is considered. Rather than proving the overall average cost optimality of a hysteretic rule, the purpose of this paper is to develop a tailor-made policy iteration algorithm for computing the optimal switch-on and switch-off levels for the slower server.

Specifically, f d maps string languages into (double-stranded) molecular languages, while $$f_{\ell}$$ performs the opposite mapping. Using these mappings, we obtain new characterizations for the families of sticker languages and of Watson-Crick languages, which lead to not only a unified view of the two families of languages but also provide a helpful view on the computational capability of DNA complementarity. Furthermore, we introduce a special type of a projection f pr which is composed of f d and a projection in the usual sense. We show that any recursively enumerable language L can be expressed as f pr (L m ) for a minimal linear language L m . This result can be strengthened to L = f pr (L s ), for a specific form of minimal linear language L s , which provides a simple morphic characterization for the family of recursively enumerable languages.	complementarity (physics);complementarity theory;dna computing;linear grammar;linearizer;morphic (software);natural computing;recursively enumerable language;recursively enumerable set	Kaoru Onodera;Takashi Yokomori	2007	Natural Computing	10.1007/s11047-007-9057-5	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;finite-state machine;recursively enumerable language;algorithm	Theory	-3.1215793057988193	17.504446384498742	180561

31243bcbcb86b35b4312fd910ef9f62beb85c93a	simulation and design of fast charging infrastructure for a university-based e-carsharing system		Carsharing is a mode of transportation that provides access to a set of vehicles in the form of organized short-term car rental, serving as a substitute for private car ownership with a number of transportation, environmental, and social benefits. Combining the mobility concept of carsharing with electric vehicles (EVs), referred to as e-carsharing, can contribute not only to more efficient use of the shared vehicles, but also to more sustainable urban mobility in smart cities. In this context, this paper advances the concept of university-based e-carsharing, to serve the mobility needs of an academic community in Bilbao, Spain, focusing on the technical design aspects to cover the energy requirements of the EV fleet of the proposed system through the installation of fast charging posts based on a battery-to-battery approach. In this regard, a MATLAB/Simulink model is implemented to simulate the fast charging infrastructure using the real-world data collected from the university parking lot in order to represent the potential utilization of the EVs. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system design, ensuring that the energy demand of the EVs is successfully covered and concurrently the charging station batteries operate out of the low charge zone.	battery charger;boost converter;diode bridge;extended validation certificate;matlab;network congestion;pdf/a;rectifier;requirement;simulation;simulink;smart city;state of health;stemming;systems design	Konstantinos N.

Derivations are restricted by the condition for row and column catenation. The grammars describe a wide variety of pictures and are more powerful than the matrix grammars for digital pictures introduced in our earlier paper. A distinct hierarchy is shown to exist between the different classes introduced. The models are closed under reflection (about base and rightmost vertical), halfturn, quarter-turn, transpose, and conjugation. Further closure properties such as union, product, star and homomorphism are examined. The models can be applied to generate several interesting patterns of  kolam  and to describe the repetitive patterns of two-dimensional crystallography.

3775fb87a1cfabd287b7e8414b37030c714d6019	multi-robot control architecture for hospital delivery service in unstable network environment		This paper describes the problem about controlling multiple robots in a real world when the network connection is unstable. Robots are deployed at the hospital for delivery service. Robots navigate autonomously through the hospital-wide hallway while delivering items from point to point. The delivery task is assigned and sent to the robot by the server via wireless network. To increase the performance of using fleet of robots, online task assignment and fleet optimization is required. However, the robots are frequently disconnected with the network since the robot continuously moves and the mission area covers multiple floors. The online communication cannot be guaranteed at all times. Therefore, this paper proposes a control architecture to cope with such unstable network connectivity. The server has a specific message board to communicate with the robot. Task assignment of the server or status report of the robot are transferred through this message board. In general, the server uses a fixed IP address, whereas a robot uses a dynamic IP address. Therefore, the connection is always initiated from the robot’s side by the heartbeat message. With this architecture, the communication between the server and the robot can be achieved in a partially online network environment. And, the delivery performance of the fleet of robots can be increased by the scheduler assigning the task online.	algorithm;computer-mediated communication;control system;control theory;heartbeat message;logistics;mathematical optimization;robot control;scheduling (computing);server (computing)	Seohyun Jeon;Jaeyeon Lee	2017		10.5220/0006410502700277	control engineering;engineering;architecture;robot control	Robotics	2.331180414733135	13.549183112432452	182899

The installation of smart meters is envisioned to increase residential consumers' involvement in the electric energy sector. The installations of local energy generations (photovoltaic, and micro-CHP) are on the rise in the residential sector. The smart metering technology coupled with intelligent home energy management systems will facilitate autonomous operation of residential devices while interacting with the grid for local energy optimization, demand response and demand-side management. This paper presents a multi-agent based home energy management system which integrates the smart metering technology, users' preferred settings and flexibility, and uses external (price) signals for residential energy optimization. A dynamic pricing mechanism was developed which takes into account the network loadings and the variations in the energy market. Simulation results show that a home energy management system, which integrates signals from external parties, can be beneficial to all parties - user, network operator and the energy supplier.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;home automation;interaction;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;simulation;smart meter	Ballard Asare-Bediako;Wil L.

4042cfe01a4a2d950936191527056493828e93e1	photovoltaic integration in smart city power distribution: a probabilistic photovoltaic hosting capacity assessment based on smart metering data		Maximizing the share of renewable resources in the electric energy supply is a major challenge in the design of smart cities. Concerning the smart city power distribution, the main focus is on the Low Voltage (LV) level in which distributed Photovoltaic (PV) units are the mostly met renewable energy systems. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of smart metering (SM) data in determining the maximum photovoltaic (PV) hosting capacity of an LV distribution feeder. Basically, the paper introduces a probabilistic tool that estimates PV hosting capacity by using user-specific energy flow data, recorded by SM devices. The probabilistic evaluation and the use of historical SM data yield a reliable estimation that considers the volatile character of distributed generation and loads as well as technical constraints of the network (voltage magnitude, phase unbalance, congestion risk, line losses). As a case study, an existing LV feeder in Belgium is analysed. The feeder is located in an area with high PV penetration and large deployment of SM devices. The estimated PV hosting capacity is proved to be much higher than the one obtained with a deterministic worst case approach, considering voltage margin (magnitude and unbalance).	apache axis;best, worst and average case;heart rate variability;library (computing);logical volume management;network congestion;page view;power supply;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;simulation;smart city;smart meter;software deployment;spatial variability;technical standard	Vasiliki Klonari;Jean-François Toubeau;Jacques Lobry;François Vallée	2016	2016 5th International Conference on Smart Cities and Green ICT Systems (SMARTGREENS)		probabilistic analysis of algorithms;renewable energy;reliability engineering;capacity planning;smart city;embedded system;photovoltaic system;distributed generation;probabilistic logic;low voltage;engineering	EDA	2.437676080986753	8.092678084930354	184367
acd5d058d90f45765a9b136eaddc9255704dd990	a review of some of the operations of power holding company of nigeria		Electric power supply is the most important commodity for national development in any nation. The Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) is responsible for generating, transmitting, distributing and selling electric power to the various consumers throughout the country. Although regular power supply is essential to the rapid development of any society, power supply in Nigeria is erratic and unreliable. The paper presents the results of an investigation conducted on some of the operations of the generating department, transmitting department and distributing department of PHCN. The paper also examines the various stages of power generation and some of the factors responsible for power outages. These factors include: overcurrent fault, earth fault, planned outages and load shedding. These problems were found to span the various stages of power generation and they also included generation capacity; insufficient and old equipment, unsuitable transmission structure, long, fragile network with lack of loops as well as high transmission and distribution losses.	load shedding;power supply;transmitter	A.

Under certain conditions, a downwards accumulation is bothèecient' (computable in a functional style in parallel time proportional to the depth of the tree) and`manipulable' (enjoying a number of distributivity properties useful in program construction). In this paper, we show that these conditions do in fact yield a stronger conclusion: the accumulation can be computed in parallel time proportional to the logarithm of the depth of the tree, on a Crew Pram machine.	binary tree;computable function;parallel random-access machine;tree accumulation	Jeremy Gibbons	1996	Theor.

This fixed operation schedule does not take the dynamics of occupancy level in the building into consideration, therefore may lead to waste of energy. An estimate of the number of occupants in the building with time can contribute to improving the control policy of the building's HVAC system by reducing energy consumption. In this paper, the auto-regressive hidden Markov model (ARHMM), is investigated to estimate the number of occupants in a research laboratory in a building using a wireless sensor network deployed. The network is composed of stand-alone sensing nodes with wireless data transmission capability, a base station that collects data from the sensing nodes, and a server to analyze the data from the base station. Experimental results and numerical simulation demonstrate that the ARHMM is more effective in estimating the number of occupants in the laboratory than the HMM algorithm, especially when the occupancy level fluctuates frequently.	algorithm;computer simulation;hidden markov model;markov chain;server (computing)	Bing Ai;Zhaoyan Fan;Robert X.

In the current schemas, the charging and discharging interval of the vehicles are normally announced by the owners in advance leading to the suboptimal profit gain in some situations and hence consumers dissatisfaction. In this paper, we propose an efficient charging/discharging scheduling mechanism for electric vehicles in multiple homes common parking lot for smart households prosumers. The proposed mechanism takes into account the optimal interval allocation considering the instantaneous electricity load and the vehicles request pattern. Based on the data from the vehicles, a mixed optimization model is formulated by the central scheduler which aims to maximize the profit of consumers and is then solved using an effective algorithm. The optimization results are then sent to the system controller determining the interval and energy trading patterns between the power grid and the vehicles. The proposed algorithm has low complexity and ensures the energy satisfaction for all consumers. The performance of the scheduling schema is verified through multiple simulation scenarios.	algorithm;cost efficiency;interval scheduling;load profile;mathematical optimization;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment	Alireza Mehrabi;Kiseon Kim	2018	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2018.2864548	electronic engineering;computer science;real-time computing;electronics;grid;control theory;scheduling (computing);vehicle-to-grid;cost efficiency;parking lot;electricity	Robotics	3.450147372158933	4.703145635529702	185221

Three issues arise when investigating this multi-project environment. First, the total budget should be distributed among different resource types to determine the general resource capacities, which correspond to the total amount for each renewable resource to be dedicated to the projects. With the general resource capacities at hand, the next issue is to determine the amounts of resources to be dedicated to the individual projects. The dedication of resources reduces the scheduling of the projects’ activities to a multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) ∗Corresponding Author.

f5d1d95d2ce912e5687777b5a23a9040edc66132	a novel predictive energy management system		Global warming, the decline of oil resources, as well as the introduction of emission regulations, has led to a research focus in new drive technologies. Whereas hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) can only be considered as a transition technology, electric vehicles (EV) and fuel cell vehicles (FCV) are zero emission technologies; HEV are only considered a bridge technology. FCV enable longer ranges and faster refills at the cost of a moderate increase in fuel cost. Challenges for an overall acceptance of fuel cell vehicles are the degradation mechanisms of the fuel cell that lead to a very limited lifetime. Current research focuses on energy management strategies to reduce the overall energy demand by predicting the vehicles coarse power consumption on the overall trip. This prediction is used to optimize the control of the drivetrain components. This paper reviews energy management strategies and points out the lack of research in the prediction of short-term speed changes. The knowledge of short-term speed changes can drastically reduce degradation mechanisms by avoiding power fluctuations in the fuel cell as well as in the battery. The proposed hierarchical model predictive control strategy is able to incorporate the knowledge of long-term energy consumption to minimize the energy demand as well as the short-term speed predictions to avoid degradation mechanisms. The suggested system will lead to longer lasting vehicles and to a better acceptance of fuel cell vehicles. To incorporate a drive data pool, this paper describes the development of onboard micro trips by evaluating the driving information and splitting them into sub-trips.	cell (microprocessor);control theory;elegant degradation;extended validation certificate;hierarchical database model;management system;uninterruptible power supply	Philipp Rehlaender;Philipp Kemper;Andreas Schwung;Ulf Witkowski	2017	2017 European Modelling Symposium (EMS)	10.1109/EMS.2017.34	battery (electricity);automotive engineering;trips architecture;energy consumption;drivetrain;model predictive control;energy management;business;zero emission;energy management system	Robotics	4.26612126714849	6.975595561349643	186157

A learner is called postdictively complete i all available data is correctly postdicted by each conjecture. Akama and Zeugmann presented, for each choice of natural number δ, a relaxation to postdictive completeness: each conjecture is required to postdict only all except the last δ seen data points. This paper extends this notion of delayed postdictive completeness from constant delays to dynamically computed delays. On the one hand, the delays can be di erent for di erent data points. On the other hand, delays no longer need to be by a xed nite number, but any type of computable countdown is allowed, including, for example, countdown in a system of ordinal notations and in other graphs disallowing computable in nitely descending counts. We extend many of the theorems of Akama and Zeugmann and provide some feasible learnability results. Regarding fairness in feasible learning, one needs to limit use of tricks that postpone output hypotheses until there is enough time to think about them. We see, for polytime learning, postdictive completeness (and delayed variants): 1. allows some but not all postponement tricks, and 2. there is a surprisingly tight boundary, for polytime learning, between what postponement is allowed and what is not. For example: 1. the set of polytime computable functions is polytime postdictively completely learnable employing some postponement, but 2. the set of exptime computable functions, while polytime learnable with a little more postponement, is not polytime postdictively completely learnable! We have that, for w a notation for ω, the set of exptime functions is polytime learnable with w-delayed postdictive completeness. Also provided are generalizations to further, small constructive limit ordinals.	computable function;data point;exptime;fairness measure;language identification in the limit;learnability;limit cycle;linear programming relaxation;np-completeness;ordinal data;time complexity	John Case;Timo Kötzing	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87987-9_32	discrete mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm	ML	4.730083804002686	17.047851884867907	186384

The major task of connecting DG units is to identify their optimal placement in the system and to evaluate the amount of power to be generated in the DG. By considering this objective, a hybrid technique using Genetic algorithm and Neural-network is proposed in this paper. By placing DGs at optimal locations and by evaluating generating power based on the load requirement, the total power loss in the system can be minimized without affecting the voltage stability of the buses. Due to reduction of total power loss in the system and improvement of bus voltages, the power quality of the system increases. The results show the improved performance of proposed method for different number of DGs connected in the system.	electric power quality;software release life cycle	S. Chandrashekhar Reddy;P. V. N.

A formal system that is flexible enough to model these large and often syntactically-rich non-compositional chunks as single units in naturally occurring text could considerably simplify large-scale semantic annotation projects, in which it would be undesirable to have to develop internal compositional analyses of common technical expressions that have specific idiosyncratic meanings. This paper will first define a notion of functorargument decomposition on phrase structure trees analogous to graph coloring, in which the tree is cast as a graph, and the elementary structures of a grammar formalism are colors. The paper then presents a formal argument that tree-rewriting systems, a class of grammar formalism that includes Tree Adjoining Grammars, are able to produce a proper superset of the functor-argument decompositions that string-rewriting systems can produce.	bottom-up parsing;categorial grammar;color;cubic function;formal grammar;formal system;graph coloring;head-driven phrase structure grammar;interaction;natural language;phrase structure rules;polynomial;rewriting;semi-thue system;time complexity	William Schuler;Aravind K.

In this setting, proofs correspond to the algorithm’s output space, such as a path through a graph or a grammatical derivation, and are given a weighted score, often interpreted as a probability, that depends on the score of the base axioms used in the proof. The desired output is a function over all possible proofs, such as a sum of scores or an optimal score. We describe the PRODUCT transformation, which can merge two weighted logic programs into a new one. The resulting program optimizes a product of proof scores from the original programs, constituting a scoring function known in machine learning as a “product of experts.” Through the addition of intuitive constraining side conditions, we show that several important dynamic programming algorithms can be derived by applying PRODUCT to weighted logic programs corresponding to simpler weighted logic programs.	algorithm;dynamic programming;logic programming;machine learning;product of experts;program transformation;scoring functions for docking;wafer-level packaging	Shay B.

f400057bebf3d38af673bce33315fcd3a8e7c9eb	optimal thermal unit commitment for solving duck curve problem by introducing csp, psh and demand response		Nowadays, the installations of photovoltaics (PVs) in the smart grid have been growing dramatically because the price of PVs is falling drastically. Undoubtedly, this is a great achievement for the recent smart grid technology. However, the colossal penetration of PVs’ power at the day-time changes the load demand of thermal generations (TGs) of a smart grid which creates duck shape load curve called duck curve. In a duck curve, peak and off-peak gaps are very large which increase the start-up cost (SUC) of TGs because the units of TGs must be turned ON and turned OFF frequently. Therefore, it is very significant to run TGs units optimally. Only an optimization technique is not enough to bring a good solution. This research considers concentrated solar power and pumped storage hydroelectricity (PSH) as the energy storages. Also, fuel cells are considered as the controllable loads in the demand side’s smart houses. In addition, this paper considers the real-time price-based demand response. The optimal unit commitment (UC) of TGs, PSHs, and other generators is introduced for saving the fuel cost and SUC of TGs. The optimal results of the proposed model are determined by using MATLAB® INTLINPROG optimization toolbox. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulation results have been compared with some other methods.	load profile;matlab;mathematical optimization;optimization toolbox;polythematic structured subject heading system;real-time transcription;simulation;smart tv;uc browser	Harun Or Rashid Howlader;Mohammad Masih Sediqi;Abdul Matin Ibrahimi;Tomonobu Senjyu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2790967	electricity generation;distributed computing;demand response;smart grid;computer science;photovoltaics;energy storage;pumped-storage hydroelectricity;control engineering;load management;power system simulation	EDA	4.171019991705735	5.989064476147163	187380

a05129cc053db28562831216e4b0e16dbd8402ca	control of a hybrid storage system (hss) comprising a redox-flow battery and a high speed flywheel for a hybrid compensation system		As individual technologies for storing energy feature characteristic advantages and disadvantages, they are suitable for distinct purposes each. In appliances that demand for heterogeneous requirements, the combination of two or more different storage technologies in a HSS appears to be advantageous. Here, requirements regarding the performance of the storage system are determined by the energy demand of a hybrid compensation system for provision of ancillary services in medium voltage grids. By a suitable design of the different storages within the HSS, a costly oversizing of one single storage technology considering the desired pupose can be prevented. Operating conditions unfavorable for a specific technology can be absorbed by another. In HSS, a common control system ensures that the present storage technologies are utilized in a way that total storage efficiency is best and that usability for the application is maximized. Within the present article, a HSS consisting of a RedOx-Flow Battery (RFB) and a high speed flywheel energy storage (FES) is introduced and evaluated.		Ralf B&#x00F6;hm;Christian Weindl;J.

Such variability poses additional challenges to the management of the continual variability in system loads. Consequently, the frequency regulation service requirements are substantially increased over those for systems without these VERs. The attractive rapid response and fast ramping capability characteristics of flywheel energy storage (FES) technology can be exploited in the FES deployment for frequency regulation service provision. Such deployment requires the effective management of the limited FES capacity and storage capability. In this paper, we construct optimized frequency regulation service offer strategies for an FES unit into the day-ahead markets (DAMs) and their associated real-time markets (RTMs). An independent grid operator (IGO) procures the service competitively through such offers. The FES offer strategies are obtained from the deployment of a robust optimization approach, which explicitly considers the uncertain nature of automatic generation control (AGC) signals and the amount of FES stored energy. The optimization objective is to maximize the FES service provision into the DAMs and the RTMs. To meet this objective, the FES offers only into particular DAMs and provides additional frequency regulation service in the RTMs by taking advantage of the most recent information of FES stored energy, even in those hours in which the FES does not participate in the DAMs. A salient characteristic of the proposed offer strategies is that all offered services are guaranteed to be provided, regardless of the actual AGC signals. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies with simulation studies that use PJM Interconnection historical AGC signal data. Representative results indicate that the proposed FES offer strategies result in guaranteed service provision without any exceptions. Such service provision represents a major improvement over that under the conventional strategy that offers the full FES capacity into each DAM but satisfies, on average, only 47.7 % of the regulation service requests. We also study the impacts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order No. 764 that allows DAM periods shorter than one hour. Specifically, we quantify the significant benefits emanating from the flexibility for limited storage capability devices such as FES units in frequency regulation service provision via simulation studies.	automatic gain control;heart rate variability;ibm power systems;interconnection;mathematical optimization;procurement;real-time clock;requirement;robust optimization;shin megami tensei: persona 3;simulation;software deployment;terminator 2: judgment day	Fang Zhang;Mirat Tokombayev;Yong-Hua Song;George Gross	2014	2014 Power Systems Computation Conference	10.1109/PSCC.2014.7038427	control engineering;simulation;engineering;operations management	HPC	2.7579067394995787	4.229180534225506	187718
3950151948cf3a8ab3841326a9b1676b85498dea	tractability conditions for numeric csps		Abstract The computational complexity of the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with semilinear relations over the reals has gained recent attraction. As a result, its complexity is known for all finite sets of semilinear relations containing the relation R + = { ( x , y , z ) ∈ R 3 | x + y = z } . We consider larger and more expressive classes of relations such as semialgebraic and o-minimal relations. We present a general result for characterising computationally hard fragments and, under certain side conditions, this result implies that polynomial-time solvable fragments are only to be found within two limited families of sets of relations. In the setting of semialgebraic relation, our result takes on a simplified form and we provide a full complexity classification for constraint languages that consist of algebraic varieties. Full classifications like the one obtained here for algebraic varieties or the one for semilinear relations appear to be rare and we discuss several barriers for obtaining further such results. These barriers have strong connections with well-known open problems concerning the complexity of various restrictions of convex programming.	cryptographic service provider	Peter Jonsson;Johan Thapper	2018	Theor.

Customers of two types arrive to the system according to the marked Markovian arrival process (MMAPMMAP). Type 1 customers have a non-preemptive priority, but the buffer for these customers is finite. The buffer for type 2 customers is infinite. The service time distribution is of phase-type (PHPH) depending on the type of customers. Some servers are always active. The rest of servers can be switched on or off depending on the number of customers in the system. The strategy of control by the number of active servers is of hysteresis type. Such a strategy is defined by two sets of thresholds. The servers are activated or switched off depending on the relation of the number of customers and the thresholds. The main contribution of the paper is development of a procedure for computation of the stationary distribution of the system states and the value of economical cost criterion under any fixed thresholds. Numerical results show effectiveness of the hysteresis control and importance of account of correlation in the arrival process and variance of service times.	hysteresis;mmap;queueing theory	Che Soong Kim;Alexander N.

c097b495092df4aab29eb6dd6f21afbed77ba003	exploiting flexibility in smart grids at scale		Large parts of the worldwide energy system are undergoing drastic changes at the moment. Two of these changes are the increasing share of intermittent generation technologies and the advent of the smart grid. A possible application of smart grids is demand response, i.e., the ability to influence and control power demand to match it with fluctuating generation. We present a heuristic approach to coordinate large amounts of time-flexible loads in a smart grid with the aim of peak shaving with a focus on algorithmic efficiency. A practical evaluation shows that our approach scales to large instances and produces results that come close to optimality.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;energy systems language;grasp;heuristic;iteration;iterative method;julius petersen;list scheduling;load management;local optimum;metaheuristic;mind;randomness;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;smart tv;yaws	Lukas Barth;Dorothea Wagner	2017	Computer Science - Research and Development	10.1007/s00450-017-0357-4	smart grid;energy system;computer science;real-time computing;algorithmic efficiency;heuristics;demand response;scheduling (computing);heuristic;peaking power plant	HPC	5.900140122369902	5.3102641573723	188610

There are K single FIFO servers and M arrival processes. The customers from a given arrival process can be served only by servers from a certain subset of all servers. The actual destination is the server with the smallest weighted queue length. The arrival processes are assumed to obey a large deviation principle while the service is exponential. A large deviation principle is established for the queue-length process. The action functional is expressed in terms of solutions to mathematical programming problems. The large deviation limit point is identified as a weak solution to a system of idempotent equations. Uniqueness of the weak solution is proved by establishing trajectorial uniqueness.	fifo (computing and electronics);functional derivative;idempotence;mathematical optimization;server (computing);time complexity	Anatolii A.

It can be shown that adding together large numbers of distributions almost always eventually produces a Gaussian distribution – this is called the central limit theorem, and you should encounter it in your first course on statistical mechanics, if not sooner. One thing that is almost always distributed as a Gaussian is the background noise in an experiment. That is to say, if you make a huge number of measurements of something, and plot the probability that each measurement will be in a small range between x and x+ δx, that function will be a Gaussian in most real world cases. For this reason, if we want to estimate the probability that some measurement is really telling us about something besides the fluctuations in the background, then we want to be able to integrate out the Gaussian distribution. Pitfalls for any summation process on a computer Any time you are summing numbers on a computer, you need to be aware of round-off errors. The computer allocates only a certain amount of memory to writing down a number, and then records a number in binary notation which is as close as possible to the actual number. This is part of the reason we make integers a separate data type on the computer. The amount of memory allocated to a floating point number will vary from computer to computer. Morten Hjorth-Jensen from the University of Oslo has a nice set of notes on computational physics which is a little bit too advanced, in general for this course, but which provides a nice example of something we can do to see the effects of round-off error. We can just sum (1/n) from 1 to 1,000,000 (or some other large number), and then take the same sum going in the opposite direction. I have written a version of the program myself, and it’s called sum 1 n.cc on the course program web page. On my laptop, I ran this program with regulat floating point precision, and got 14.357358 going forward (i.e. starting at 1), and 14.392652 going backward. I then changed the data type to double and I got 14.392727 for both numbers,	binary number;computation;computational physics;jensen's inequality;laptop;numerical integration;round-off error;web page	James E.

During market operation, the market operator is a leader of the game to decide market cleaning prices, considering the power loss minimization of VPP operator, whereas during VPP operation, the VPP operator becomes a leader to facilitate the demand side management (DSM) through proper monetary compensation, considering the market trading balance between power sellers and power buyers. An optimal scheduling strategy including power dispatch and market balance will be realised. Case studies prove the effectiveness of the proposed Stackelberg game-theoretic model through IEEE 30-bus test system. The market scheduling promotes the power exchange among VPPs. The VPP scheduling evaluates the optimal monetary compensation rate to motivate the DSM including load shifting and load curtailment.

All stochastic times in the system are considered to be exponentially distributed and independent of the random environment, while the access and service rates of the processors are subject to random fluctuations. It is shown under the assumption of 'fast' arrivals that the busy period length of the bus converges weakly, under appropriate normalization, to an exponentially distributed random variable. As a consequence, main steady-state performance measures such as system throughput, mean delay time, expected waiting time, and mean number of active processors can be approximately determined. The reliability of the proposed method is validated by comparing the new approximations with known exact results. >	multiprocessing;randomness	János Sztrik;Demetres D. Kouvatsos	1991	IEEE Trans.

Our experiments on weighted scale-free networks and small-world networks show the high correlation between global efficiency based centrality and VCG-based centrality (the Pearson correlation coefficients exceed 0.95); Then, inspired by the definition of global efficiency based centrality, we propose local efficiency based centrality, which, unlike global efficiency based centrality, can be calculated locally, and illustrates the effect of the proposed metric on the attack vulnerability of those weighted networks through comparing with strength-based attack.	biconnected graph;centrality;coefficient;computational model;experiment;imperative programming;simulation;weighted network	Yufeng Wang;Akihiro Nakao	2008	2008 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference	10.1109/APSCC.2008.28	network theory;computer simulation;network science;random walk closeness centrality;computer science;katz centrality;alpha centrality;scale-free network;machine learning;data mining;small-world network;network controllability;centrality;betweenness centrality;computer security;correlation;complex network	Web+IR	-3.4909964491751104	7.298785550046217	189991

In this paper, a single server queue with variable batch size service, Poisson bulk arrival with multiple working vacations and server breakdown is considered. In working vacation, the server works with different rates rather than completely stoping the service during the vacation period. In this model, during the working vacation the server starts the service if it finds at least one customer in the queue with a maximum of ‘b’ customers, otherwise the server serves with variable batch size. Service time in working vacation and in regular period follows general distribution. The probability generating function of a queue size at an arbitrary time epoch as well as other completion epochs is derived. Expected queue length in a steady state is obtained. Also a numerical illustration is presented.	numerical analysis;queueing theory;server (computing);steady state	S. Jeyakumar;B.

cd5eafed3080d6f57bd5c43defdd1a640d472f99	the efficient discovery of interesting closed pattern collections		Enumerating closed sets that are frequent in a given database is a fundamental data mining technique that is used, e.g., in the context of market basket analysis, fraud detection, or Web personalization. There are two complementing reasons for the importance of closed sets— one semantical and one algorithmic: closed sets provide a condensed basis for non-redundant collections of interesting local patterns, and they can be enumerated efficiently. For many databases, however, even the closed set collection can be way too large for further usage and correspondingly its computation time can be infeasibly long. In such cases, it is inevitable to focus on smaller collections of closed sets, and it is essential that these collections retain both: controlled semantics reflecting some notion of interestingness as well as efficient enumerability. This thesis discusses three different approaches to achieve this: constraint-based closed set extraction, pruning by quantifying the degree or strength of closedness, and controlled random generation of closed sets instead of exhaustive enumeration. For the original closed set family, efficient enumerability results from the fact that there is an inducing efficiently computable closure operator and that its fixpoints can be enumerated by an amortized polynomial number of closure computations. Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out that this connection does not generally hold for other constraint combinations, as the restricted domains induced by additional constraints can cause two things to happen: the fixpoints of the closure operator cannot be enumerated efficiently or an inducing closure operator does not even exist. This thesis gives, for the first time, a formal axiomatic characterization of constraint classes that allow to efficiently enumerate fixpoints of arbitrary closure operators as well as of constraint classes that guarantee the existence of a closure operator inducing the closed sets. As a complementary approach, the thesis generalizes the notion of closedness by quantifying its strength, i.e., the difference in supporting database records between a closed set and all its supersets. This gives rise to a measure of interestingness that is able to select long and thus particularly informative closed sets that are robust against noise and dynamic changes. Moreover, this measure is algorithmically sound because all closed sets with a minimum strength again form a closure system that can be enumerated efficiently and that directly ties into the results on constraint-based closed sets. In fact both approaches can easily be combined. In some applications, however, the resulting set of constrained closed sets is still intractably large or it is too difficult to find meaningful hard constraints at all (including values for their parameters). Therefore, the last part of this thesis presents an alternative algorithmic paradigm to the extraction of closed sets: instead of exhaustively listing a potentially exponential number of sets, randomly generate exactly the desired amount of them. By using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, this generation can be performed according to any desired probability distribution that favors interesting patterns. This novel randomized approach complements traditional enumeration techniques (including those mentioned above): On the one hand, it is only applicable in scenarios that do not require deterministic guarantees for the output such as exploratory data analysis or global model construction.

The problem we deal with is quite different from standard games of congestion as we consider the case in which higher congestion results in smaller costs per user. This is motivated by a situation in which some TV show is broadcast so that the same cost is needed no matter how many users follow the show. Using a mean-field approximation, we show that this results in multiple equilibria of threshold type which we explicitly compute. We show that the mean-field approximation becomes tight as the workload increases, thus the results obtained for the mean-field model well approximate the discrete one.	approximation algorithm;mean field particle methods;network congestion	Piotr Wiecek;Eitan Altman;Arnob Ghosh	2014	2014 7th International Conference on NETwork Games, COntrol and OPtimization (NetGCoop)		workload;admission control;real-time computing;queue management system;mean field theory;mathematical optimization;mathematics;queue	Theory	7.531895831431613	11.276173152804697	190237

Customers of two different types arrive to the first station in accordance with MMAP (Marked Markovian Arrival Process). The first type customers are satisfied with service at the first station only while the second type customers should be served successively at both stations. The system is studied in steady state.

4695cf5b7a869ebb2a8c981a3138d7a69649ba79	microgrid agent-based modelling and optimization under uncertainty. (modélisation et optimisation de micro réseaux sous incertitude avec une approche orientée agent)		We consider a microgrid for energy distribution, with a local consumer, a renewable generator (wind turbine) and a storage facility (battery), connected to the external grid via a transformer. We propose a 2 steps-ahead reinforcement learning algorithm to plan the battery scheduling, which plays a key role in the achievement of the consumer goals. The underlying framework is one of multi-criteria decision-making by an individual consumer who has the goals of increasing the utilization rate of the battery during high electricity demand (so as to decrease the electricity purchase from the external grid) and increasing the utilization rate of the wind turbine for local use (so as to increase the consumer independence from the external grid). Predictions of available wind power feed the reinforcement learning algorithm for selecting the optimal battery scheduling actions. The embedded learning mechanism allows to enhance the consumer knowledge about the optimal actions for battery scheduling under different time-dependent environmental conditions. The developed framework gives the capability to intelligent consumers to learn the stochastic environment and make use of the experience to select optimal energy management actions.

By modeling the framework with a virtual queuing system, we can derive each entry's waiting time, which is distributed to drivers' smart devices in real-time to improve highway throughput. Using this framework, a driver can wait at home instead of waiting in the ramp to save fuel consumption and reduce CO2 emission. Through analysis, we show that the proposed framework will bring economic efficiency and reduce environment pollution by leveraging today's communication and computing technology development. Simulation results show that the proposed entry control framework can significantly improve the capacity of highway systems.	ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;real-time clock;smart device;throughput	Yuang Chen;Fei Richard Yu;Bin Zhou	2013		10.1145/2512921.2512927	simulation;engineering;transport engineering;computer network	Mobile	5.020819103613614	6.992846060986729	191004

Customers are distinguished into normal customers and interjecting customers. All customers join a single queue waiting for service. A normal customer joins the queue at the end and an interjecting customer tries to cut in the queue. The waiting times of normal customers and interjecting customers are studied. Two parameters are introduced to describe the interjection behavior: the percentage of customers interjecting and the tolerance level of interjection by individual customers. The relationship between the two parameters and the mean and variance of waiting times is characterized analytically and numerically.		Qi-Ming He;Alireza A.

This paper proposes a general four-step approach that can be used to establish a model for the intrinsic complexity of a problem class in terms of solving time. Such a model allows prediction of the time to solve new problems in the same class and helps instructors develop more reliable test problems. A complexity model, furthermore, enhances understanding of the problem and can point to new aspects interesting for education and research. Students can use complexity models to assess and improve their learning level. The approach is explained using the K-map minimization problem as a case study. The implications of this research for other problems in electrical and computer engineering education are highlighted. An important aim of this paper is to stimulate future research in this area. An ideal outcome of such research is to provide complexity models for many, or even all, relevant problem classes in various electrical and computer engineering courses.	computer engineering;kerrison predictor;nonlinear system;solver;turing test	Abdulhadi Shoufan	2017	IEEE Transactions on Education	10.1109/TE.2016.2611666	computational problem;complete;database index;parameterized complexity;mathematical optimization;function problem;complexity;fp;counting problem;polynomial-time reduction;dynamic problem;#sat;computer science;structural complexity theory;machine learning;decision problem;worst-case complexity;reliability;complexity index;mathematics;boolean function;co-np-complete;algorithm;pspace-complete;descriptive complexity theory;regression analysis;statistics	AI	8.951979554852189	15.675672993902836	191557
0be289d8311676442c0750bed52848772f18d073	a new steganographic technique matching the secret message and cover image binary value		Steganography involves hiding a secret message or image inside another cover image. Changes are made in the cover image without affecting visual quality of the image. In contrast to cryptography, Steganography provides complete secrecy of the communication. Security of very sensitive data can be enhanced by combining cryptography and steganography. A new technique that uses the concept of Steganography to obtain the position values from an image is suggested. This paper proposes a new method where no change is made to the cover image, only the pixel position LSB (Least Significant Bit) values that match with the secret message bit values are noted in a separate position file. At the sending end the position file along with the cover image is sent. At the receiving end the position file is opened only with a secret key. The bit positions are taken from the position file and the LSB values from the positions are combined to get ASCII values and then form characters of the secret message	steganography	G.

This class also includes the recently proposed traffic models in high speed networks, exhibiting long range dependence. Under minimal conditions we obtain the rates of convergence to stationary distributions, finiteness of stationary moments, various functional limit theorems and the continuity of stationary distributions and moments. We use the continuity results to obtain approximations for stationary distributions and moments of an MMPP/GI/1 queue where the modulating chain has a countable state space. We extend all our results to feedforward networks where the external arrivals to each queue can be regenerative. In the end we show that the output process of a leaky bucket is regenerative if the input process is and hence our results extend to a queue with arrivals controlled by a leaky bucket.	approximation;feedforward neural network;leaky bucket;markov chain;modulation;quantum superposition;scott continuity;server (computing);state space;stationary process	Vinod Sharma	1998	Queueing Syst.	10.1023/A:1019129424256	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;rate of convergence	Metrics	9.301481036312447	12.323942613345187	191625

However, by focusing on the incremental effects of a new network user, the approximate model allows marginal effects to be estimated with good accuracy. This capability allows for the provisioning of personalized energy / emissions reducing tariffs to end users with inherent advantages both to operators, energy suppliers and users. One key advantage is the possibility to reduce waste capacity, and thus energy consumption in the network, by allowing the user to specify just the service capacity and demands he/she has. From an engineering point of view, the incremental model allows to tune sub-system characteristics jointly, especially transceivers, transmission and storage. From a configuration point of view, the model allows to determine which nodes in the network benefit most from back-up and renewable power sources. From a business perspective, the model allows to determine trade-offs between personalized bundle characteristics and the energy cost share in the marginal operating expense share.

e261d8209e039051a42dfadf1e53073eeb1d70ad	optimized household demand management with local solar pv generation		Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies are often associated with the objectives of smoothing the load curve and reducing peak load. Although the future of demand side management is technically dependent on remote and automatic control of residential loads, the end-users play a significant role by shifting the use of appliances to the off-peak hours when they are exposed to Day-ahead market price. This paper proposes an optimum solution to the problem of scheduling of household demand side management in the presence of PV generation under a set of technical constraints such as dynamic electricity pricing and voltage deviation. The proposed solution is implemented based on the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA). This solution is evaluated through a set of scenarios and simulation results show that the proposed approach results in the reduction of electricity bills and the import of energy from the grid.	automatic control;clonal selection algorithm;experiment;load profile;numerical analysis;page view;scheduling (computing);simulation;smoothing	Seyyed Hamid Elyas;Hamidreza Sadeghian;Hayder O.

The compact storage and efficient evaluation of feasible assembly sequences is one crucial concern. Ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) is a canonical form to represent and manipulate the Boolean functions efficiently, and appears to give improved results for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, assembly knowledge models of liaison graph and translation function are formulated by OBDDs, and OBDD-based representation of assembly sequences is proposed. A novel OBDD-based procedure was presented to generate all geometrically feasible assembly sequences from the OBDDs of liaison graph and translation relation. This procedure can be used conveniently on the computer and all the feasible sequences can be derived. The great advantage of OBDD-based scheme is that the storage space of OBDD-based representation of feasible assembly sequences does not increase with the part count of assembly dramatically so quickly as that of AND/OR graph does. We developed the prototype tool for generating assembly sequence using Visual C++ and CUDD package, and undertake some experimental tests. It was shown that the OBDD scheme generated feasible assembly sequences correctly and completely.	algorithm;binary decision diagram;c++;combinatorial optimization;influence diagram;knowledge representation and reasoning;mathematical optimization;prototype	Tianlong Gu;Huadong Liu	2008	Formal Methods in System Design	10.1007/s10703-008-0052-y	canonical form;boolean function;algorithm	AI	3.363499932819093	15.510287000934321	192418

Only the part of the second subtree which is different from the first needs to be searched. The pure literal rule of the Davis-Putnam procedure is a special case of complement searching.

Using a halffractional factorial design, this study experimentally manipulated five perceivable network topology factors (network partitioning, network diversity, wireless status, network footprint and connectivity) to assess the relationship between these factors and network risk judgments. The consistency of network risk ratings and rankings were evaluated for each of the 16 network topologies across a sample of 55 network security professionals who reviewed these topologies. Three robust significant main effects (network partitioning, wireless status, and connectivity) and one significant interaction (network partitioning X wireless status) were found. While some topologies were consistently rated and ranked as significantly more risky than others, there was some variability in ratings at each main effect level as well as the spread of the mean ratings between the two main effect levels (e.g., wireless and wired). We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to network risk metric rigor. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	experiment;heart rate variability;information system;network partition;network security;network topology	Jennifer Cowley;Frank L.

When a disaster strikes, the whole infrastructure including electricity shuts down for days or years depending on the nature of the disaster. In the absence of electricity, all human activities and businesses are either damaged or ruined. Hurricane Sandy left 8.5 million people across the East Coast without power [2]. One way of overcoming this problem is to use solar energy which is well know example of green technology. Generating electricity from solar energy through the process of photovoltaic can be used to power, heat, cool, and light our homes and businesses. Photovoltaic (PV) power systems provide emission free electricity fueled by the sun which is reliable, secure, noise free and does not need refueling. It also helps to reduce consumption of fossil fuels in power plants, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. When businesses fail to survive after a disaster, the overall economic health and social viability of a community is threatened requiring measures taken to return the community to normal after providing relief in the early stages of disaster [3]. Solar energy has the ability to enhance resilience in the communities by providing backup power even if the grid is not restored. This can be achieved by making use of solar microgrids and developing community solar which is a partnership between citizens, government and businesses. The “Resilient Community” partnership is a cooperative framework that is essential to fostering community disaster resilience [4]. The goal of this partnership is to maintain the economic and social viability of the community following a disaster. After the immediate disaster relief, it is important to provide continuous power to the community in case grid system takes longer to resume or is located at remote areas.	backup;code;electric sheep;emergency power system;fossil;ibm power systems;microgrid;page view	Salahuddin Qazi;William Young	2014	2014 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)	10.1109/CTS.2014.6867637	renewable energy;power station;grid parity;photovoltaic system;environmental impact of electricity generation;stand-alone power system;photovoltaics;distributed generation;rooftop photovoltaic power station;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;energy development	HCI	2.2847578708496568	7.2308480780870195	193990

Depending on network needs, these devices could alter their nominal energy consumption and provide multiple ancillary services, facilitating the cost-effective transition to a low-carbon power system. Previous work mainly focused on investigating single service provision from TCLs, while intersections among different services have not been considered. Furthermore, the intrinsic energy payback effect was not fully included within optimisation tools for TCL scheduling. This paper presents a novel demand side response model (DSRM), which enables the optimal scheduling of energy/power consumption of a heterogeneous population of TCLs and the simultaneous allocation of multiple ancillary services. The model explicitly considers the effect of the energy recovery after delivering the services so that the deliverability of scheduled services from TCLs is always guaranteed. The proposed DSRM is integrated into an advanced stochastic unit commitment model to investigate the system benefits of the flexibility from TCLs. Case studies demonstrate that: 1) time-varying provision of multiple services from TCLs significantly increases their benefits; 2) TCL operation which aims to minimise the amplitude of the energy recovery causes sub-optimal utilisation of the devices; and 3) ignoring the energy payback leads to overestimate the TCL value.	control theory;directory services restore mode;first-order predicate;frequency response;linear model;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;performance rating;real-time web;requirement;scheduling (computing);system requirements;tcl	Vincenzo Trovato;Fei Teng;G.

1dd2bb394182ad2ea14ddbc0a9a46d4bec037d9d	algorithms for fair load shedding in developing countries		Due to the limited generation capacity of power stations, many developing countries frequently resort to disconnecting large parts of the power grid from supply, a process termed load shedding. During load shedding, many homes are left without electricity, causing them inconvenience and discomfort. In this paper, we present a number of optimization heuristics that focus on pairwise and groupwise fairness, such that households (i.e. agents) are fairly allocated electricity. We evaluate the heuristics against standard fairness metrics in terms of comfort delivered to homes, as well as the number of times they are disconnected from electricity supply. Thus, we establish new benchmarks for fair load shedding schemes.	algorithm;load shedding	Olabambo I. Oluwasuji;Obaid Malik;Jie Zhang;Sarvapali D.

In order to ensure decidability, several constraints on grammars, commonly known as off-line parsability (OLP), were suggested, such that the recognition problem is decidable for grammars which satisfy OLP. An open question is whether it is decidable if a given grammar satisfies OLP. In this paper we investigate various definitions of OLP and discuss their interrelations, proving that some of the OLP variants are indeed undecidable. We then present a novel, decidable OLP constraint which is more liberal than the existing decidable ones.	han unification	Efrat Jaeger;Nissim Francez;Shuly Wintner	2005	Journal of Logic, Language and Information	10.1007/s10849-005-4511-1	tree-adjoining grammar;discrete mathematics;l-attributed grammar;philosophy;mathematics;linguistics;programming language;algorithm;satisfiability	NLP	-3.8348136176631	17.75941596276293	194447

Following these trends, the electrical power consumption in data centers becomes a significant value.

This combination allows independent decisions by self-interested EV agents, while ensuring that aggregate power demand from EV charging converges to a desired profile as determined by a control agent. This profile can yield reduced demand volatility, or a better match between the output of renewable energy sources and overall demand. We observe that price signals from the control agent are sufficient to motivate self-interested EV agents to adjust charging rate and produce the desired profile, even given a range of individual user preferences. We show that our hybrid coordination mechanism prevents herding in EV charging, which is typical in populations where all agents receive the same price signals and make similar charging decisions. Specifically, the control agent learns the responses of the EV agents in order to adjust its price signals, and eventually converges to coordinated charging, thereby producing the desired demand profile. We compare our approach with various benchmarks and show that EV charging congestion (herding) is reduced, while peaks and volatility of demand are mitigated.	agent-based model;aggregate data;benchmark (computing);charging argument;extended validation certificate;gri;mobile app;network congestion;population;the netherlands society for statistics and operations research;top-down and bottom-up design;user (computing);volatility	Konstantina Valogianni;Wolfgang Ketter;John Collins	2015			simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;smart grid	AI	1.995812886362011	4.579689437227304	195117

6a3737f25f15cbe6768d1f56662a06b3258e780c	towards a characterization of constant-factor approximable min csps		We study the approximability of Minimum Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Min CSPs) with a fixed finite constraint language Γ on an arbitrary finite domain. The goal in such a problem is to minimize the number of unsatisfied constraints in a given instance of CSP(Γ). A recent result of Ene et al. says that, under the mild technical condition that Γ contains the equality relation, the basic LP relaxation is optimal for constant-factor approximation for Min CSP(Γ) unless the Unique Games Conjecture fails. Using the algebraic approach to the CSP, we introduce a new natural algebraic condition, stable probability distributions on symmetric polymorphisms of a constraint language, and show that the presence of such distributions on polymorphisms of each arity is necessary and sufficient for the finiteness of the integrality gap for the basic LP relaxation of Min CSP(Γ). We also show how stable distributions on symmetric polymorphisms can in principle be used to round solutions of the basic LP relaxation, and how, for several examples that cover all previously known cases, this leads to efficient constant-factor approximation algorithms for Min CSP(Γ). Finally, we show that the absence of another condition, which is implied by stable distributions, leads to NP-hardness of constant-factor approximation.	apx;approximation algorithm;constraint logic programming;constraint satisfaction;cryptographic service provider;lp-type problem;lagrangian relaxation;linear algebra;linear programming relaxation;maxima and minima;np-hardness;unique games conjecture	Víctor Dalmau;Andrei A.

0019a2539997a8c38523268b4c03d0316457654d	on the predictive properties of performance models derived through input-output relationships		Building an analytical performance model is a challenge when little is known about the functionality and behavior of the system being modeled and/or when obtainingmodel parameters throughmeasurements is difficult. This paper addresses this problem by presenting an approach that derives analytic model parameters by observing the input-output relationships of a real system. More specifically, input (i.e., arrival rates for each job class) and output (i.e., average response time for each job class) measurements are used to estimate the per-class service demands andnumber of servers for a Queuing Network model of the system. This model, called the computed model (CM), provides the same output values for the same input values used to derive the CM. The important question is whether the CM has predictive power, i.e., can the CM predict the output values that would be observed in the real system for different values of the input? The CM’s parameters are obtained by solving a non-linear optimization problem. The paper shows through experiments that the CM is relatively robust and has predictive power over a range of input values.	apache ofbiz®;experiment;glossary of computer graphics;information system;input/output;linear programming;mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;network model;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;queueing theory;response time (technology)	Mahmoud Awad;Daniel A.

We show that by using predetermined fixedlength streams of ads (which we call patterns) to serve advertising, we can incorporate a variety of interesting features into the ad allocation optimization problem. In particular, our formulation optimizes for representativeness as well as userlevel diversity and pacing of ads, under reach and frequency requirements. We show how the problem can be solved efficiently using a column generation scheme in which only a small set of best patterns are kept in the optimization problem. Our numerical tests suggest that with parallelization of the pattern generation process, the algorithm has a promising run time and memory usage.	algorithm;column generation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;online advertising;optimization problem;parallel computing;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);scheme	S.

This relies on the empirical observation that the truth of a statement of the form “CIRCUIT-SAT belongs to a complexity class C” does not depend on the encoding, provided both the encoding and the class C are “natural”. In this sense most of the Complexity theory is “encoding invariant”. The notion of a polynomial time computable distribution from Average Case Complexity is one of the exceptions from this rule. It might happen that a distribution over some objects, like circuits, is polynomial time computable in one encoding and is not polynomial time computable in the other encoding. In this paper we suggest an encoding invariant generalization of a notion of a polynomial time computable distribution. The completeness proofs of known distributional problems, like Bounded Halting, are simpler for the new class than for polynomial time computable distributions.	boolean satisfiability problem;character encoding;circuit satisfiability problem;complex adaptive system;complexity class;computable function;decision problem;encode;linear programming relaxation;polynomial;time complexity	Nikolai K.

An effective cyber insurance policy can reduce the number of successful cyber attacks by incentivizing the adoption of preventative measures and the implementation of best practices of the users. To study cyber insurance in a holistic manner, we first establish a bi-level game-theoretic model that nests a zero-sum game in a moral-hazard type of principal-agent game to capture complex interactions between a user, an attacker, and the insurer. The game framework provides an integrative view of the cyber insurance and enables a systematic design of incentive compatible and attack-aware insurance policy. The framework is further extended to study a network of users and their risk interdependencies. We completely characterize the equilibrium solutions of the bi-level game. Our analytical results provide a fundamental limit on insurability, predict the Peltzman effect, and reveal the principles of zero operating profit and the linear insurance policy of the insurer. We provide analytical results and numerical experiments to corroborate the analytical results and demonstrate the network effects as a result of the strategic interactions among the three types of players.	best practice;black and burst;centralized computing;complex network;decision theory;experiment;firewall (computing);game theory;holism;interaction;interdependence;intrusion detection system;irreducibility;linear function;mass effect trilogy;matrix multiplication;maxima and minima;minimax;network topology;numerical analysis;optimization problem;software deployment;stochastic matrix;utility;wnn	Rui Zhang;Quanyan Zhu;Yezekael Hayel	2017	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2017.2672378	game theory;simulation;actuarial science;insurance;risk management;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-3.487706121393598	4.881252352774598	196313

We give effective methods for computing, for each of possibly several jobclasses, the second moment of the equilibrium waiting time for closed systems as well as for open systems. Both open and closed systems have a CPU operating under the processor-sharing ('time-slicing') discipline in which service-time requirements may depend on job-class. The closed system also includes a bank of terminals grouped according to job-classes, with the class structure allowing distinctions in the user's behavior in the terminal. In the contrasting open system, the job streams submitted to the CPU are Poisson with rate parameters dependent on job-classes. Our results are exact for the open system and, for the closed system, in the form of an asymptotic series in inverse powers of a parameter N. In fact, the result for open networks is simply the first term in the asymptotic series. For larger closed systems, the parameter N is larger and thus fewer terms of the series need be computed to achieve a desired degree of accuracy. The complexity of the calculations for the asymptotic expansions is polynomial in number of classes and, importantly, independent of the class populations.

At the same time, the operational safety, economy and environmental protection of ships are facing challenges. As a result, the concept of transformation from the “buying good ships” to “using ships well” is proposed for the shipbuilding and shipping industry. With the goal of upgrading in equipment intelligence, industrial chain capability and management intelligence upgrading, the overall architecture of Cyber-enabled ship control and management system based on “Two Terminals & Two Clouds” (2T2C), which consists of a perception and control terminal, an intelligent management terminal and a hybrid cloud platform, is proposed. The SOMS system based on 2T2C architecture is applied to iDolphin 38,800-ton intelligent bulk carrier and has achieved good results with real ship data: the intelligent system can effectively reduce the difficulty of using the ship, save fuel consumption and reduce accidents and control the full-life operating costs and energy consumption.	artificial intelligence;cloud computing;data center;discrete wavelet transform;machine perception;management system;safety engineering	Bohua Qiu;Yu Zhang;Muheng Wei;Yongjie Li;Yue Wang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM)	10.1109/ICPHM.2018.8448547	architecture;automotive engineering;cloud computing;maintenance engineering;energy consumption;management system;shipbuilding;business;fuel efficiency;control system	Robotics	3.6631606176641545	8.86907468893803	196886

For a chosen set of solar power, load and grid cost conditions, a dynamic programming (DP) based optimal control algorithm minimizes imported grid energy costs. The microgrid operation is optimized for different constraint values using DP. For example, imported grid energy costs are minimized with and without an important practical constraint such as constant current constant voltage (CCCV) battery charging. The increase in grid energy costs due to this necessary constraint quantifies its impact on the microgrid's performance. In this manner, we present an optimal vs. optimal comparison to capture the impact of constraints on grid costs or other objectives of interest. The unique contributions of this paper are our rigorous approach to evaluate the impact of constraints and the value of our results. It was observed that constraints on battery charging and battery capacity can result in significant increase in optimal cost of microgrid operation for the conditions assumed in our study.	algorithm;battery charger;constant current;constant-voltage speaker system;dynamic programming;microgrid;optimal control	Rakesh Patil;Ratnesh K.

We show that the acceptor model based on consensus games characterises context-sensitive languages, and conversely, that winning strategies in such games can be described by context-sensitive languages. We also discuss consensus game acceptors with a restricted observation pattern that describe nondeterministic linear-time languages.	acceptor (semiconductors);context-sensitive grammar;context-sensitive language;formal language;graph (discrete mathematics);information needs;time complexity	Dietmar Berwanger;Marie van den Bogaard	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21500-6_8	non-cooperative game;combinatorial game theory;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;distributed computing;sequential game	Theory	-0.896741113105481	14.254820489726717	197420

We assume that the packet interarrival times are independently distributed according to an arbitrary distribution function, that the service times are Markovian with possibly different service rates, that each of the servers has its own buffer for packet waiting, and that jockeying among buffers is permitted. Packets always join the shortest buffer(s). Jockeying takes place as soon as the difference between the longest and shortest buffers exceeds a pre-set number (not necessary 1). In this case, the last packet in a longest buffer jockeys instantaneously to the shortest buffer(s). We prove that the equilibrium distribution of packets in the system is modified vector-geometric. Expressions of main performance measures, including the average number of packets in the system, the average packet waiting time in the system and the average number of jockeying, are given. Based on the above solutions, numerical results are computed. By comparing the results for jockeying and non-jockeying models, we show that a significant improvement of the system performance is achieved for the jockeying model. The performance study of a great number of satellite systems basically depends on the analysis of the related queueing systems. The major interesting measures of such analysis includes the system throughput, the average packet delay on the satellite, and the buffer overflow probability for the case of finite buffer size. Multibeam satellite systems have been studied extensively (for example, see Chlamtac and Ganz 1986, and Chang 1983), and it has been shown that they provide a greater system flexibility and a better performance. In such a system, all earth stations are organized into disjoint zones; packets generated from earth zones arrive at the satellite by using different possible access techniques, one or several buffers are provided at the satellite for the waiting packets to be processed or transmitted; and finally, the packets are sent to their destinations by the multi-down-link beams. When there is more than one buffer on board, introducing jockeying of the waiting packets among the buffers seems to be a promising way to improve the performance of the systems. For example, if we allow a packet waiting in the buffer with many waiting packets to move to some other buffer with fewer waiting packets in it, then the average packet waiting time is obviously reduced. But the analysis of such jockeying systems is more difficult because we cannot deal with them by analysing only one specified input-output pair. Instead, we must handle the system as a whole. According to different assumptions made on the system, a variety of different jockeying models could arise. In this paper, we consider a very general type of jockeying model, in which the following assumptions are made. The arriving packets follow a general process; that is, the time between any two successive arriving packets is described by an arbitrary non-negative random variable, the interarrival time. All the interarrival times are identically and independently distributed. There are several buffers in the system, each of them with an infinite capacity. An arrival packet always joins the shortest waiting line if it cannot be processed immediately. For any waiting line, the waiting packets are processed according to first come first served (FIFO) discipline. The processing time for any packet is a Markovian, that is, an exponential random variable. When the difference of the waiting packet numbers between the longest waiting line and the shortest one exceeds a certain threshold value, the last waiting packet is allowed to move (jockey) to the shortest waiting line. Since Haight (1958) proposed and solved the shorter queue model (the shortest queue model with only two servers), the jockeying problem has been studied extensively, in particular 1 by Disney and Mitchell (1971), Elsayed and Bastani (1985), Kao and Lin (1990), Zhao and Grassmann (1990), Zhao (1990), and Adan, Wessels and Zijm (1991). Except Zhao and Grassmann, all authors considered only models with Markovian inputs. Among them, Kao and Lin solved the problem of jockeying as soon as the difference between queues exceeds one. They expressed their solution in terms of the eigenvalue of the rate matrix. Using the results of Kao and Lin, Zhao and Grassmann (1990) developed an explicit solution to the problem. They showed how to obtain certain initial probabilities for the system, and expressed the joint distributions of the queue lengths in the vector-geometric form. Recently, Nelson and Philips (1989) studied the response time for shortest queue routing by using approximations. As stated in their paper, shortest queue routing is a natural way to balance the load of a system across several processors and has been used as a load balancing mechanism as well as a scheduling mechanism in an effort to minimize job response time. In this paper, we consider the general input model with a very flexible jockeying rule, in which the last packet in the longest queue jockeys to the shortest queue with an arbitrary probability distribution as soon as the difference of the waiting packet numbers between the longest queue and the shortest queue exceeds r, r ≥ 1. Some special cases of this model have been considered by Zhao in his Ph.D thesis (Zhao 1990). After giving the definition of the model in the next section, we first consider the imbedded Markov chain of the model. We then obtain an explicit solution of the model, which also, as expected, has a vector-geometric form. Other interesting system measures are given, based on the probability distribution of the packet’s number in the system. Numerical results are presented and analyzed. It turns out that significant improvements of the system performance can be achieved by allowing jockeying among the queues. 1 The Model and the Imbedded Markov Chain In this section, we give the definition of the r difference jockeying problem with a general input, and point out some important properties of the transition probabilities. In order to give a formal definition of the shortest queue model with r difference jockeying, we make the following assumptions: a) The packets arrive singly with interarrival times identically and independently distributed 2 according to an arbitrary distribution function A(t) with A(t) = 0 if t < 0, and they are not allowed to renege or balk. b) There are c (c ≥ 2) servers (for example, transponders or down-link beams), numbered 1, 2, . . . , c, in the system and each of them has its own buffer. In each buffer, service is rendered according to FIFO (first come first served) discipline. The c servers have independent exponential service times. The service times are independent of arrivals. c) An arriving packet joins one of the shortest buffers with a pre-determined probability distribution. d) Jockeying among the buffers is permitted. The last packet in the longest buffer(s) instantaneously jockeys to the shortest buffer(s) with a pre-determined probability distribution as soon as the difference of the packet numbers between the shortest buffer(s) and the longest buffer(s) exceeds r, r ≥ 1. A queueing system satisfying a) – c) is called the shortest queue model and denoted by GI/(M/1). A shortest queue model satisfying d) is called the shortest queue model with r difference jockeying. When r = 1, we simply call it the shortest queue model with jockeying. When both the probability distributions mentioned in c) and d) are uniform, we call the shortest queue model symmetric; otherwise non-symmetric. Let Xk(t) represent the number of waiting packets in buffer k, k = 1, 2, . . . , c, at time t, t ≥ 0, including the packet in service, then { ~ X(t) = (X1(t), X2(t) , . . . , Xc(t)) ; t ≥ 0 } is a stochastic process. The state space of this process can be described as S = {~i = (i1, . . . , ic) | ij non-negative integer for j = 1, 2, . . . , c and |ik − il| ≤ r for k, l = 1, 2, . . . , c } . The main purpose of this paper is to determine the limiting probabilities π~i = lim t→∞ P{ ~ X(t) =~i } , ~i ∈ S , when they exist. In general, the above process is neither Markovian nor semi-Markovian. In order to analyze this model, we introduce the imbedded Markov chain for the system as follows. We obtain 3 an explicit formula for the probability distribution of buffer lengths (including the packets in service) for the imbedded Markov chain first. The probability distribution of the buffer lengths at a random time can then be found from the connection between a semi-Markov process and its imbedded Markov chain. If tl is the time just prior to the arrival of the lth packet, then { ~ Xl = (X1(tl), X2(tl), . . . ,Xc(tl)) ; l = 1, 2, . . . } is Markovian. Let 1/λ be the mean time between two successive arrivals, and let μ be the sum of all the service rates; that is, μ = ∑c k=1 μk. The imbedded Markov chain { ~ Xl ; l = 1, 2, . . . } formed in this way is ergodic if, and only if, the traffic intensity λ/μ is less than one. In the paper, we always assume that this is the case. In the stable condition, the limiting or equilibrium probabilities p~i = lim l→∞ P{ ~ Xl =~i} , ~i ∈ S , exist and they are the same as the stationary probabilities of the imbedded Markov chain. For any two states~i, ~j ∈ S, the transition probability p~i~j can be found by conditioning on the interarrival time Ul; that is, p~i~j = ∫ ∞ 0 P{ ~ Xl+1 = ~j | Ul = t , ~ Xl =~i } dA(t) . An explicit determination of p~i~j can be obtained by using conditional probability arguments. Since only elementary algebraic manipulations are involved for the derivation and the final explicit expression of p~i~j is cumbersome, we will not produce it here. The readers, who are interested in details of deriving the explicit expression of p~i~j , may refer to Zhao (1991), in which the same technique was used for obtainin	approximation;buffer overflow;c date and time functions;central processing unit;characteristic polynomial;emoticon;ergodicity;expanded memory;fifo (computing and electronics);let expression;linear algebra;load balancing (computing);markov chain;mitchell corporation;network packet;numerical analysis;queueing theory;response time (technology);root-finding algorithm;routing;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;state space;stationary process;stochastic process;telecommunications link;throughput;time complexity;transponder	Yiqiang Zhao;Winfried K.

However, the categorial formalism for which this equivalence has been established differs significantly from the versions of CCG that are in use today. In particular, it allows restriction of combinatory rules on a per grammar basis, whereas modern CCG assumes a universal set of rules, isolating all cross-linguistic variation in the lexicon. In this article we investigate the formal significance of this difference. Our main result is that lexicalized versions of the classical CCG formalism are strictly less powerful than TAG.	combinatory categorial grammar;lexicon;mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism;semantics (computer science);tree-adjoining grammar;turing completeness	Marco Kuhlmann;Alexander Koller;Giorgio Satta	2015	Computational Linguistics	10.1162/COLI_a_00219	natural language processing;generative grammar;categorial grammar;computer science;emergent grammar;linguistics;mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism;combinatory categorial grammar;algorithm;information and computer science	NLP	-2.9071173547238582	15.282308970930822	197790

In the case of viruses, the goal is to understand how the topology of the network and the properties of the nodes that comprise the network, together, impact the spread of the epidemics. In this paper, we propose rejuvenation as a way to cope with epidemics. Then, we present a model to study the effect of rejuvenation and of the topology on the steady-state number of infected and failed nodes. We distinguish between a state in which the virus is incubating and in which symptoms might not be visible and yet they may be contagious and infecting other nodes, and a state of failure where symptoms are clear. Sampling costs might be incurred to examine nodes in search for viruses at an early stage. Using the proposed model, we show that the sampling rate admits at most one local minimum greater than zero. Then, we numerically illustrate the impact of different system parameters on the optimal sampling rate, indicating when rejuvenation is more beneficial.	computer virus;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);social network;software propagation;steady state	Eitan Altman;Alberto Avritzer;Rachid El Azouzi;Daniel Sadoc Menasché;Leandro Pfleger de Aguiar	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops	10.1109/ISSREW.2014.61	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;information security;reliability;computer security;statistics	Arch	-3.83251977625819	6.493862185167176	198560

The fluctuation in power supply from these energy sources results in insecure and unstable operating points. Furthermore, the integration of distributed energy resources (DER), as well as distributed information systems, poses serious stability and security challenges in power network operation and management, necessitating reinforcement of the distribution grid. In the scientific literature, a wide range of applications of control theory have been suggested for balancing renewable energy generation and consumption. Above all, to overcome these problems we need to start considering new scenarios, stakeholders and services.	control theory;grid computing;information system;quantum fluctuation;scientific literature;uninterruptible power supply	Luigi Briguglio;Massimiliano Nigrelli;Frank Eichinger;Javier Lucio Ruiz-Andino;Valter Bella	2013	ERCIM News		computer security;grid computing;computer science;smart grid;internet of things	HPC	1.648379083869963	6.691198385335519	198947

However only 25 coal power generations had been installed by now, spread all over Indonesia. Coal necessities were supplied by 14 domestic coal mining companies. There are two factors that affect the price of coal i.e : distance and unit price. Distance between supplier and coal power generation would determine the transportation cost while unit price would determine the price of procurement. The aim of this research is to minimize total price of coal by optimizing the distance and unit price (USD/Ton), allocating the coal necessities and scheduling the delivery. The optimization would be simulated using software What’sBest. By this simulation, 24 power plants were suggested to change their existing suppliers, while only one power plant was fitted. This change could reduce USD 27 Million/year for total price of coal.	mathematical optimization;optimizing compiler;performance per watt;procurement;scheduling (computing);simulation	Muhamad Iqbal Felani;Ariyana Dwiputra Nugraha;Mujammil Asdhiyoga Rahmanta	2017		10.5220/0006250904600463	operations management	EDA	4.14701066520969	7.316919927453056	199385

It reports on case study research. Use of Information and Communication Technologies and access to e-services are constrained by the availability of electricity. In Zambia`s rural areas, 3.5% of households have access to electricity supply. This paper shows such electricity supply can be erratic. When supply is available, it follows a diurnal pattern. The electricity supply varies considerably, including voltage dips and brown outs. It can cause equipment to enter into unstable states, to fail or to damage. Qualitative engineering aspects interact also with social factors, especially in rural Africa. Interventions must be sensitive to the complex array of challenges for people to be able to appropriate the benefits of ICT and e-services.	control theory;e-services;instability;supply chain attack	Consider Mudenda;David L.

However, one important challenge with wind DG units is to provide low-cost and fast-responding reactive power compensation of the wind turbine's inductive load to ensure a stable voltage profile in the system. Since reactive power can only be compensated locally, we consider a scenario where a wind DG unit is co-located with a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging station or a parking lot, and we investigate how to align incentives to encourage PEV owners to participate in reactive power compensation for wind DG units. For this purpose, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage Stackelberg game between the wind DG unit and the PEV owners. We use backward induction to analyze the formulated game and derive the optimal pricing scheme. We assess the performance of our proposed scheme using field data and make suggestions for the size of the charging stations.	align (company);backward induction;cpu cache;discontinuous galerkin method;game theory;maximal set;plug-in (computing);simulation	Chenye Wu;Hamed Mohsenian Rad;Jianwei Huang	2012	2012 IEEE Third International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486035	control engineering;simulation;engineering;operations management	Robotics	2.589276574053156	4.605855627860673	199685

A reliability-differentiated pricing mechanism is developed to satisfy the different reliability requirements of the customers while encouraging the customers to consume electricity in such a way that the reliability of the overall distribution system can be enhanced. A dynamic spinning reserve pricing scheme is developed to stimulate PHEVs to participate in spinning reserve by providing economic benefits when the state of the distribution system becomes risky. Based on the formulated reliability-differentiated system, a hierarchical game approach is proposed in this paper to coordinate the charging process of PHEVs in a decentralized fashion. At the upper level of the hierarchical game, an evolutionary game is formulated to optimize the management of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capacity of each PHEV. Under the V2G strategies obtained from the evolutionary game, a noncooperative game is formulated at the lower level to coordinate the charging sequences of PHEVs. Various simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical game approach. The simulation results show that the hierarchical game approach is effective in enhancing both reliability of the distribution system and economic profits of the PHEVs.	differentiated service;differentiated services;electric power quality;holism;plug-in (computing);requirement;simulation	Jun Tan;Zhiqiang Wang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2015.2420111	pricing;database index;games;simulation;spinning;computer science;marketing;operations management;reliability	Mobile	2.206716299628981	4.67011315084608	199975
