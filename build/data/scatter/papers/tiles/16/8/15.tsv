FBAC algorithm utilizes dynamic resource allocation scheme to decrease the blocking probability of vertical handover connections within the limited capacity of system. Based on FBAC algorithm, we derive the handover blocking probability as new traffic load and handover traffic load increase. In order to evaluate the performance, we compare FBAC algorithm against traditional non-bounded and fixed bound schemes. Numerical results show that the FBAC scheme improves handover blocking probability in ubiquitous environment.	access network;algorithm;blocking (computing);erlang (unit);markov chain;numerical analysis	Jong Min Lee;Ok Sik Yang;Seong Gon Choi;Jun Kyun Choi	2006		10.1007/11807964_70	real-time computing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;access control;network interface;computer security;ubiquitous computing;bandwidth;computer network;access network	AI	2.0924617441849156	103.06597746480406	93736

In this formulation, they also consider the reservation of buffers on VPCs.

The proposed packet-scheduling algorithm was designed for the case in which streaming server peers rely on an errorrecovery strategy using retransmission and application-layer automatic repeat request rather than error protection using forward error correction. The proposed scheduler can maximize retransmission opportunities and reduce the frame loss rate by using the observed channel status from each server peer. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enhances errorrecovery performance in distributed multimedia streaming better than other schedulers. key words: error recovery, retransmission, ARQ, distributed media streaming, peer-to-peer, stored-video streaming	algorithm;automatic repeat request;error detection and correction;forward error correction;network packet;network scheduler;peer-to-peer;retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;streaming media	Young H.

Optimum packet transmission scheduling providing strict latency guarantee for realtime traffic while efficiently utilizing the network resources in a WMN is difficult, and one of the main challenges is to coordinate temporal operations of the mesh access points (APs). In this paper a connection-based scheduling scheme is proposed. Scheduling decisions for connections with a larger number of hops are made first, and that for connections with a fewer number of hops are done by using the remaining resources. When scheduling packet transmissions for each connection, the transmitting time of the AP with the highest traffic load along the route of the connection is determined first. At each hop, the transmitting time of a packet is determined to minimize the latency to the upstream hop or from the downstream hop while keeping the total amount of required AP resources small. A connection-based optimization problem is formulated and solved with an objective to minimize the total amount of required AP resources, subject to the latency requirement of the connection. Numerical results show that the proposed scheduling scheme achieves close-to-optimum performance at both the connection and packet levels.	blocking (computing);computational complexity theory;downstream (software development);heuristic;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;network packet;optimization problem;provisioning;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);transmitter;wireless access point;wireless mesh network	Jun Zou;Dongmei Zhao	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/TWC.2009.080645	computer simulation;wireless mesh network;fair-share scheduling;optimization problem;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;minimisation;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;wireless network;deadline-monotonic scheduling;silicon;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;network topology;packet switching;wireless;computer network	Embedded	3.5335798533978786	102.73358521851875	97976

The future mobile environment is expected to involve multimode connectivity to the Internet and dynamic switching of the connection mode depending on network conditions. The conventional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), however, is unable to maintain stable and efficient throughput across such interface changes. The two main issues are the handling of the change in host Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the reliability and continuity of TCP flow when the datalink interface changes. Although existing architectures addressing the first issue have already been proposed, the problem of congestion control remains. In this paper, considering a large change in bandwidth when the datalink interface changes, two new schemes to address these issues are proposed. The first scheme, Immediate Expiration of Timeout Timer, detects interface changes and begins retransmission immediately without waiting for a retransmission timeout as in existing architectures. The second scheme, Bandwidth-Aware Slow Start Threshold, detects the interface change and estimates the new bandwidth so as to set an appropriate slow start threshold for retransmission. Through simulations, the proposed schemes are demonstrated to provide marked improvements in performance over existing architectures. key words: multimodal, vertical hand-off, TCP congestion control	internet protocol suite;multimodal interaction;network congestion;retransmission (data networks);scott continuity;simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput;timer	Kazuya Tsukamoto;Yutaka Fukuda;Yoshiaki Hori;Yuji Oie	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.6.1825	internet protocol;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;active traffic management;the internet;addressing mode;telecommunications;computer science;handover;multimodal interaction;transmission control protocol;computer security;change detection;computer network	Networks	0.9652205142182319	102.76380078081162	103355

In particular, MNs are achieving an immediate performance improvement of about 14% simply through exercising choice in PoA handoff selection, for the nominal measure of 45 PoAs. The benefit increases rapidly to about 22% as the measure of PoA increases to about 300. Henceforth, and up to a topology of 1000 PoAs, the measure of service utility increases only marginally by 5%, yielding a total performance benefit increase of about 30%. The reason for such a small increase between 300 and 1000 PoA is emerging to be the issue of false positive choices in PoA handoff selection. In particular, due to the high density of PoA the MN appears to chose the PoA with the highest service utility measure, which however is only peripherally incident on the core direction of MN movement trajectory. As a result the MN is obliged sooner than expected into selecting a new PoA, as it moves out of the transmission range of the one previously selected. From the analysis, it becomes clear that where proactively established context state (e.g. IP Roaming) is not available, the MN must resort to reactive MIPv6 management practices. In this light, Proactive and standard reactive MIPv6 management are found to operate best in complementary roles particularly where HAR neighbourhood information is yet either unavailable or unattainable. That is to say, Proactive MIPv6 is an evolution of the reactive MIPv6 standard rather than a replacement. Ultimately it is important to note that the principle of proactive state establishment, analysed in the context of IP Roaming state for the purposes of critical IPv6 connectivity with new PoAs, can also be generalised for other types of IP connectivity state such as AAA or QoS. This is possible, since the resolution of Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Wirel. Commun. Mob. Comput. 2006; 6:559–583 582 T. PAGTZIS, J. CROWCROFT AND K. CLARK such context can be done much in the same manner (like IP Roaming state) during the beginning of MN’s cell residence period at the current PoA. This provides tentative availability of AAA privileges or QoS reservation at HAR neighbours at the cost of increased signalling overheads. However, such additional signalling cost is expected to compensate for the unavoidable nondeterminism in MN’s mobility pattern, as well as frequent transient ping-pong effects frequently observed in wireless networks.	aaa (video game industry);access network;john d. wiley;mobile ip;proactive parallel suite;quality of service;rate of convergence;real-time clock;real-time transcription;selectivity (electronic);simulation;unbounded nondeterminism;wireless access point	Theodoros Pagtzis;Jon A Crowcroft;Keith Clark	2006	Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1002/wcm.411	telecommunications;computer science;handover;adaptive system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	1.4752604125930022	103.13088307848462	103963

For instance, a wireless cellular device may be programmed to report bogus channel information to gain resource allocation advantages. Such non-cooperative behaviors are highly probable as the device’s software can be modified by the user. In this paper, we first analyze the impact of these rationally selfish behaviors on the performance of packet scheduling algorithms in timeslotted wireless networks. Using a mixed strategy game model, we show that the traditional maximum rate packet scheduling algorithmcan cause non-cooperative devices to converge to highly inefficient Nash equilibria, in which the wireless channel resources are significantly wasted. By using a repeated game to enforce cooperation, we further propose a novel game theoretic algorithm that can lead to an efficient equilibrium. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we propose a multi-source video streaming (MUVIS) system to support high quality video streaming service over IEEE 802.11-based wireless networks. We begin by collocating a streaming proxy with the wireless access point to help leverage both the media server and peers in the WLAN. By tracking the peer mobility patterns and performing content discovery among peers, we construct a multi-source sender group and stream video using a rate-distortion optimized scheme. We formulate such a multi-source streaming scenario as a combinatorial packet scheduling problem and introduce the concept of asynchronous clocks to decouple the problem into three steps. First, we decide the membership of the multi-source sender group based on the mobility pattern tracking, available video content in each peer and the bandwidth each peer allocates to the multi-source streaming service. Then, we select one sender from the sender group in each optimization instance using asynchronous clocks. Finally, we apply the point-to-point rate-distortion optimization framework between the selected sender-receiver pair. In addition, we implement two different caching strategies, simple caching simple fetching (SCSF) and distortion minimized smart caching (DMSC), in the proxy to investigate the effect of caching on the streaming performance. To design more realistic simulation models, we use the empirical results from corporate wireless networks to generate node mobility. Simulation results show that our proposed multi-source streaming scheme has better performance than the traditional server-only streaming scheme and that proxy-based caching can potentially improve video streaming performance.	asynchronous circuit;asynchronous system;cache (computing);computer simulation;content discovery platform;digital video;display resolution;distortion;mathematical optimization;media server;multi-source;network packet;numerical linear algebra;peer-to-peer;point-to-point protocol;proxy server;rate–distortion optimization;scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;speedup;streaming media;visual instruction set;wireless access point	Danjue Li;Chen-Nee Chuah;Gene Cheung;S.

Radio Resource Allocation (RRA) strategy is an important issue in the design of the Satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (SDMB) system, aiming at providing more efficient and cost-effective delivery of broadcast/multicast (BC/MC) services to a wide range of audience. Based on the single-level channel multiplexing framework, the existing RRA strategy only performs transport channel multiplexing and assumes one-to-one ideal mapping between logical and transport channels. However, the bit rates of the logical channels do not always exactly match those of the transport channels, and this leads to inefficient usage of radio resource. To solve this problem, in this paper, a novel RRA strategy, which is capable of optimally performing both logical and transport channel multiplexing, is proposed for the SDMB system. In order to improve the resource utilisation and reduce the power consumption, two new algorithms, namely Optimum Estimation Algorithm (OEA) and Power-Oriented Adaptation (POA) algorithm, are developed to optimize the proposed 2-level channel multiplexing scheme. In comparison with the existing single-level channel multiplexing scheme, simulation results show that the proposed 2-level channel multiplexing scheme achieves significantly better performance in terms of transport/physical channel utilisation, transmission power consumption as well as total transmission capacity.	digital distribution;multicast	Hongfei Du;Linghang Fan;Barry G.

Due to growing use of wireless LANs (WLANs) in residential areas and settings supporting flash crowds, chaotic unplanned deployments are becoming the norm rather than an exception. Environments in which these WLANs are deployed, have many nearby access points and stations on the same channel, either due to lack of coordination or insufficient available channels. Thus, inter-cell interference is common but not well-understood. According to conventional wisdom, the efficiency of an IEEE 802.11 network is determined by the number of active clients. However, we find that with a typical TCP-dominant workload, cumulative system throughput is characterized by the number of actively interfering access points rather than the number of clients. We verify that due to TCP flow control, the number of backlogged stations in such a network equals twice the number of active access points. Thus, a single access point network proves very robust even with over one hundred clients, while multiple interfering access points lead to a significant increase in collisions that reduces throughput and affects media traffic. Only two congested interfering cells prevent high quality VoIP calls. Based on these findings, we suggest a practical contention window adaptation technique using information on the number of nearby access points rather than clients. We also point out the need for collision-resilient rate adaptation in such a setting.

Currently, dedicated short range communication devices are using wireless access in vehicular environment (WAVE) mode of operation, but now IEEE is standardizing 802.11p WAVE. This work presents an in-depth simulation-based analysis of two reactive routing protocols, i.e., dynamic source routing (DSR) and ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) with modified IEEE 802.11a PHY/MAC layers (comparable to 802.11p) in modified VANET mobility models (freeway, stop sign, and traffic sign) in terms of load, throughput, delay, number of hops, and retransmission attempts. Results obtained using OPNET simulator show that in urban/highway mobility scenarios, AODV’s performance with forthcoming 802.11p at high bit rate would be better than DSR in terms of high throughput, less delay, and retransmission attempts. Moreover, this comprehensive evaluation will assist to address challenges associated with future deployment of routing protocols integrated upon devices with upcoming IEEE 802.11p, concerning specific macro-/micro-mobility scenarios.	routing	Muhammad Azhar Iqbal;Furong Wang;Xu Xie;Sarah M.

Therefore, the design and management of such networks must consider these requirements. Network congestion is a very important point that must be taken into consideration when a management system is designed. ATM networks support different types of services and this fact makes them less predictable networks. Congestion can be defined as a state of network elements in which the network cannot guarantee the established connections the negotiated QoS. This paper proposes a system to reduce short-term congestion in ATM networks. This system uses Artificial Intelligence techniques to predict future states of network congestion in order to take less drastic measures in advance.	atm turbo;artificial intelligence;network congestion;requirement;telecommunications network	Guiomar Corral;Agustín Zaballos;Joan Camps;Josep Maria Garrell i Guiu	2001		10.1007/3-540-47734-9_64	network traffic control;telecommunications;computer science;network congestion;computer security;slow-start;telecommunications network;computer network	Networks	-0.3887243772894163	102.93465873959401	122103

Therefore, VSP relies on the definition of multiple encapsulation sizes associated to a waveform, and an access adapted to the transport of variable size packets. We recall the VSP concept, insisting on its impact at the physical and access layers, and present an efficient coding and modulation scheme for the VSP solution, resources allocation constraints and packet sizes and slot sizes definition strategies.	datagram;mathematical optimization;virtual storage platform	Anne-Laure Philippot;Marie-Laure Boucheret;Katia Leconte;Catherine Morlet;Caroline Amiot-Bazile;Jungpil Yu	2005	Space Communications		internet protocol;turbo code;electronic engineering;waveform;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;communications satellite;packet switching;computer network	EDA	2.3367275616368226	104.6465676910549	122317

Content Distribution Networks can also efficiently provide collaborative playback service which allows a synchronous group of users to select, simultaneously watch altogether and share the control of a multimedia session. This paper presents the definition and analysis of the Hierarchical Cooperative Control Protocol (HCOCOP), which allows a synchronous group of users to share the control of the media streaming session provided by a Content Distribution Network. The analysis phase, which was supported by discrete-event simulation, was carried out to characterize the efficiency of the protocol on the basis of the following defined performance indices: blocking probability, denial probability, server load and network load. The performances obtained for architectures based on Content Distribution Networks are compared with those obtained for centralized architectures providing collaborative playbacks. The comparison shows that HCOCOP significantly improves performance of media streaming control.	blocking (computing);centralized computing;consensus dynamics;content delivery network;erlang (unit);event-driven programming;interactivity;performance;performance evaluation;point of view (computer hardware company);server (computing);simulation;streaming media;surrogates	Giancarlo Fortino;Carlo Mastroianni;Wilma Russo	2009	J.

Because of the restricted bandwidth of wireless links, header compression represents an essential prerequisite for the Mobile Internet, i.e., whenever an IP-based mobile end device has to communicate with an IP-based infrastructure. RFC 3095 on Robust Header Compression (ROHC) represents the state-ofthe-art header compression proposal. It provides a complex framework that allows to fine-tune compression efficiency versus robustness against link errors. We present a Java-based simulator/visualizer currently running ROHC Profile 2 (UDP/IP) in Uni-directional Mode that allows experimentation with all relevant ROHC parameters (like state transition timers and repeat counters) as well as with various link conditions. We present the implementation and report on simulation results. An average header length of about 2.8 bytes is achieved. In general, the tool is useful as an educational tool for assessing ROHC performance and to see Robust Header Compression at work, i.e., to explore the underlying parameter space. For the future, the simulator will be also used to generate realistic audio/video packet flows for evaluation with respect to audio/video decompression handling in the presence of packet losses.	byte;data compression;java;network packet;overhead (computing);robust header compression;simulation;timer	Xiaoyuan Gu;Hannes Hartenstein;Stefan Fischer	2002		10.1007/3-540-45997-9_20	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;visualization;computer science;operating system;robust header compression;database;distributed computing;computer security;statistics	Mobile	0.11009565232187103	103.32403030346973	130991
779bf97a64a01b180504cf49b3e48c5e06f48627	an adaptive dual control framework for qos design	distributed system;performance guarantee;rate ratio;e commerce;real time;adaptive control;simulation study;internet application;parameter estimation;quality of service;adaptive dual control;control strategy	The widespread deployment of the advanced computer technology in business and industries has demanded the high standard on quality of service (QoS). For example, many Internet applications, i.e. online trading, e-commerce, and real-time databases, etc., execute in an unpredictable general-purpose environment but require performance guarantees. Failure to meet performance specifications may result in losing business or liability violations. As systems become distributed and complex, it has become a challenge for QoS design. The ability of on-line identification and auto-tuning of adaptive control systems has made the adaptive control theoretical design an attractive approach for QoS design. However, there is an inherent constraint in adaptive control systems, i.e. a conflict between asymptotically good control and asymptotically good on-line identification. This paper first identifies and analyzes the limitations of adaptive control for network QoS by extensive simulation studies. Secondly, as an approach to mitigate the limitations, we propose an adaptive dual control framework. By incorporating the existing uncertainty of on-line prediction into the control strategy and accelerating the parameter estimation process, the adaptive dual control framework optimizes the tradeoff between the control goal and the uncertainty, and demonstrates robust and cautious behavior. The experimental study shows that the adaptive dual control framework mitigate the limitations of the conventional adaptive control framework. Compared with the conventional adaptive control framework under the medium uncertainty, the adaptive dual control framework reduces the deviation from the desired hit-rate ratio from 40% to 13%.

One of the applications of this type of strategies is that of remote sensing in terms of energy and sensor usage. Many remote sensors or sensor arrays reside on satellites and their use must be economized, while at the same time the agency managing satellite time would like to satisfy the users as much as possible. Here we have developed a cognitive based strategy that obtains models of users and resource use in real time and uses these models to obtain strategies that are compatible with management policies. The paper concentrates in obtaining the user models.	agent-based model;artificial neural network;mathematical optimization;multi-user;sensor;user agent	Juan Monroy;José Antonio Becerra;Francisco Bellas;Richard J.

The proposed method uses an improved access point (AP) with additional radio frequency (RF) module, SNIFFER, monitoring the movement of the station (STA). By using the SNIFFER, the proposed method can completely remove the probe delay. Furthermore, we also propose an effective handoff decision method taking into account the quality of service (QoS) in the application layer. The proposed method uses packet loss information and the received signal strength indication (RSSI) for the handoff decision. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the performance of the seamless multimedia service by drastically reducing the handoff delay and packet loss.	network packet;packet analyzer;public lending right;quality of service;radio frequency;seamless3d;wireless access point	Hye-Soo Kim;Sang-Hee Park;Chun-Su Park;Jae-Won Kim;Sung-Jea Ko	2006		10.1007/11753810_78	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;radio frequency;computer network	Mobile	1.5666678660742348	102.93858867331488	136409

To reduce the handover delay in the MBS, the IEEE 802.16e standard introduces an MBS zone, which is a group of base stations that are broadcasting the same multicast packets. However, this raises the MBS traffic load on Mobile WiMAX networks, particularly the wireless part. This paper presents an MBS architecture that is based on location-management areas (LMAs), which can increase the sizes of MBS zones to reduce the average handover delay without too much bandwidth waste. An analytical model is developed to quantify service-disruption time, bandwidth usage, and blocking probability for different sizes of MBS zones and LMAs while considering user mobility, user distribution, and MBS session popularity. Using this model, we also propose how to determine the best sizes of MBS zones and LMAs, along with performance guarantees. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that our LMA-based MBS scheme can achieve a bandwidth-efficient multicast delivery while retaining an acceptable service-disruption time.	blocking (computing);denial-of-service attack;erlang (unit);ieee 1471;interoperability;microwave;multicast;simulation;streaming media	Ji Hoon Lee;Sangheon Pack;Taekyoung Kwon;Yanghee Choi	2011	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2010.2096831	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;broadcasting;computer network	Mobile	2.0226589382195543	102.65584176843493	138930

However, since such a flow control is provided by the end hosts, end-to-end control cannot be applied to decision-making in a time-scale shorter than the round-trip delay. We have previously proposed a diffusion-type flow control mechanism to realize the extremely time sensitive flow control that is required for high-speed networks. In this mechanism, each network node manages its own traffic only on the basis of the local information directly available to it, by using predetermined rules. The implementation of decision-making at each node can lead to optimal performance for the whole network. Our previous studies showed that the mechanism works well, by itself, in high-speed networks. However, to apply this mechanism to actual networks, it needs to be able to coexist with other existing protocols. In this paper, we investigate the performance of diffusion-type flow control coexisting with TCP. We show that diffusiontype flow control can coexist with TCP and the two can be complementary. Then, we show that a combination of both controls achieves higher network performance than TCP alone in high-speed networks. key words: flow control, autonomous decentralized control, diffusion equation, high-speed networks	autonomous robot;coexist (image);complementarity theory;control flow;distributed control system;end-to-end principle;flow control (data);network performance	Chisa Takano;Kaori Muranaka;Keita Sugiyama;Masaki Aida	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.10.2850	diffusion equation;active traffic management;tcp delayed acknowledgment;simulation;tcp global synchronization;decision support system;tcp pacing;telecommunications;decentralised system;computer science;autonomous system;transmission control protocol;flow control;zeta-tcp;node;hstcp;tcp tuning;implementation;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;telecommunications network;computer network	Networks	-0.6353740649411697	104.16383428049315	151306

This paper addresses these two problems together, and proposes an optimal packetization scheme for video streaming over wireless network, which is independent of video coding method. To combat the packet erasure, priority packetization combined with multi-layer unequal error protection (UEP) is applied on video frames. Multi-layer UEP contains low-complexity duplication of high-priority packet in application layer and different retransmission limit in media access control layer. Content-aware rate-distortion optimization is also introduced in order to countermine the distortion caused by bit errors. Simulations show that our scheme gains 2.17 dB or more compared with the conventional scheme.	access control;bit error rate;computer simulation;data compression;decibel;distortion;layer (electronics);mathematical optimization;network packet;rate–distortion optimization;regular expression;retransmission (data networks);streaming media	Huanying Zou;Chuang Lin;Hao Yin;Zhen Chen;Feng Qiu;Xuening Liu	2006		10.1007/11922162_51	real-time computing;media access control;rate–distortion theory;telecommunications;computer science;access control;wireless network;rate–distortion optimization;war;packet switching;gene duplication;computer network	Networks	-3.3359560974574354	102.9622133569522	152274

The application QoS for each flow includes the maximum allowable ratio for the lost medium unit and the delay bound of the medium unit associated with the maximum allowable late ratio. The control mechanisms that support the application protocol include error control, real-time control for individual flow within the session, and synchronization control for the multimedia session. Moreover, the application protocol with the control mechanisms provides a quantitative expression for the quality of the synchronized session in terms of the QoS parameters. Measurement results show the effectiveness of the protocol.	application-layer framing;control system;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;file spanning;framing (world wide web);framing (social sciences);internet;multicast;overlay network;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;retransmission (data networks)	Chun-Chuan Yang;Sze-Horng Lee;Li-Yuan Cheng	2008	J.

When delivering video data without priority strategy over the Internet, it will seriously degrade the received picture quality. This paper proposes an Unequal Priority Arrangement (UPA) mechanism for video transmission on differentiated service networks. UPA determines the priority of a video packet according to the evaluation from both temporal and spatial domains simultaneously. From the temporal domain, UPA evaluates the packet significance based on the temporal position of the packet and the induced error propagation if the packet is lost. From the spatial domain, UPA evaluates the packet importance based on its content, where the ratio of intra-refreshed MBs is used. Moreover, according to the video complexity, UPA can flexibly adjust the weight based on the evaluation results from temporal and spatial domains. Simulation results show that delivering video data with UPA on differentiated service network outperforms traditional temporal-based and spatial-based priority strategies up to 1.8 dB and 1 dB, respectively.	data compression;decibel;differentiated service;group of pictures;image quality;internet;mathematical optimization;network packet;propagation of uncertainty;simulation;software propagation	Chu-Chuan Lee;Pao-Chi Chang;Shih-Jung Chuang	2006		10.1007/11949534_81	computer vision;real-time computing;the internet;telecommunications;image processing;differentiated service;computer science;propagation of uncertainty;multimedia;differentiated services;statistics	Metrics	-3.3201171616945024	102.99470449364449	152969

With limited computational cost, the DSPN solution allows the derivation of a number of interesting performance metrics, which can be instrumental for the development of accurate design and planning algorithms for cellular networks offering integrated services.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;integrated services;network packet;occam's razor;profiling (computer programming);programming paradigm;stochastic petri net	Marco Ajmone Marsan;Marco Gribaudo;Michela Meo;Matteo Sereno	2001		10.1007/3-540-45307-5_37	gprs core network;simulation;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	1.626873623993163	103.52270547901664	157990

In this paper, we describe the architecture of the cognitive radio system and the inter-system handover protocols. In the architecture, each cognitive terminal, which can access multiple radio systems, operates with a single local IP address. The control sequence and packet format are designed to achieve fast handover among the radio systems. Based on the architecture, we have developed a testbed system. On this system, we demonstrate that data can be delivered continuously and radio systems can be switched correctly without any packet loss. In addition, we present the result of the evaluation of the end-to-end latency on the testbed system. These testbed results demonstrate the system architecture described in the paper can achieve a cognitive radio system.	cognitive radio;testbed	Seishi Hanaoka;Masashi Yano;Tetsuhiko Hirata	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.1.14	internet protocol;wimax;embedded system;cognitive radio;cognitive network;telecommunications;computer science;handover;software-defined radio;packet loss;computer security;remote radio head;packet switching;computer network;systems architecture;data transmission	HCI	2.026907200146612	103.01730540584104	159340

The main goal is to reduce the call dropping probability and the call blocking probability and to maximize the bandwidth utilization. Mining the previous movements of the mobile users, generates local and global profiles, which are utilized effectively in prediction of the future path of the mobile user. This scheme is based on high level of prediction of the next base stations for the mobile user. The simulation is used to compare the performance of the proposed technique with other two techniques: FR-CAT2 and PR-CAT4. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a significantly better performance (in average about 25%) compared to the other two schemes.	data mining	Sherif Rashad;Mehmed M.

DVB-H uses a time-sliced transmission scheme enabling a receiver to turn radio reception off for those time-slices that are not of interest to the user and thus reducing the power consumption used for radio reception. One of the significant factors in tune-in time is the time from the start of media decoding to the start of correct output from decoding, which is minimized when a time-slice starts with a random access point picture such as an independent decoding refresh (IDR) picture in H.264/AVC standard. In IPDC over DVB-H, encapsulation to time-slices is performed independently from encoding in a network element called IP encapsulator. At the time of encoding, time-slice boundaries are typically not known exactly, and it is therefore impossible to govern the location of IDR pictures relative to time-slices. It is proposed that an additional stream consisting of IDR pictures only is transmitted to the IP encapsulator, which replaces pictures in a normal bit stream with IDR pictures according to time-slice boundaries in order to achieve the minimum tune-in delay. Replacing pictures causes a mismatch in the pixel values of the reference pictures between the encoder and decoder and the mismatch error is propagated in the reconstructed video. It has to be ensured that the propagated error is subjectively negligible. Furthermore, the """"spliced"""" stream resulting from the operation of the IP encapsulator should comply with the Hypothetical Reference Decoder (HRD) specification of H.264/AVC. Error propagation caused by the proposed splicing method is analysed and a video rate control system is proposed to satisfy the HRD requirements for the spliced stream. Simulation results show that in addition to fulfilling H.264/AVC compliancy, good average quality of decoded video is achieved with minimum tune-in delay and complexity"""	bitstream;control system;dvb-h;data compression;datacasting;digital video broadcasting;elegant degradation;encapsulation (networking);encoder;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;ip camera;independence day: resurgence;internet protocol device control;pixel;preemption (computing);propagation of uncertainty;random access;requirement;simulation;software propagation;streaming media;video coding format;wireless access point	Mehdi Rezaei;Miska M.

The presentation of the multimedia objects has to be carried out in accordance with the specification of temporal relationships between the objects. The retrieval of multimedia objects from the document server(s) is influenced by factors such as temporal specification of objects presentations, throughput offered by the network service provider, and the buffer resources on the client system. Flexibility in the temporal specification of the multimedia document may help in deriving an object retrieval schedule that can handle variations in network throughput and buffer resource availability. In this paper, we develop techniques for deriving a flexible object retrieval schedule for a distributed multimedia document presentation. The schedule is based on flexible temporal specification of the multimedia document using the difference constrai nts approach. We show how the derived retrieval schedule can be validated and modified to ensure that it can work with the offered network throughput and the available buffer resources.	network service provider;schedule (computer science);throughput	K.

Packet headers show coding redundancy from both a practical and a design perspective. The focus of this paper is on the experimental evaluation of this framework. This is accomplished using the proof of concept design and implementation of a novel in-band, path-coupled signaling protocol for IPv4/IPv6. The implementation of this signaling protocol is being carried out based on the ns2 simulator. Ns2 simulation results are then compared with similar RSVP-ns2 simulations carried out in identical conditions. Further, simulation results show that while being more lightweight than RSVP, the performance of the in-band signaling protocol presented in this paper is very close if not identical to that of RSVP in ns2.	network packet	Istvan Matyasovszki;Colin Flanagan;John Nelson	2005	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2005.05.007	internet protocol;embedded system;signalling;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;discrete event simulation;operating system;redundancy;proof of concept;computer security;service quality;computer network;systems architecture	Networks	1.8435166869294208	103.18929755930114	173167

The primary aim of this study is to present an adaptation scheme that is QoE-driven for optimising content provisioning and network resource utilisation for video applications over wireless networks. The proposed scheme encompasses the application of a QoE-driven model for optimising content provisioning and network resource utilisation. The content provisioning is optimised by the determination of initial content quality by adapting the video sender bitrate (SBR) according to users’ QoE requirement. By finding the impact of the QoS parameters on end-to-end perceptual video quality, the optimum trade-off between SBR and frame rate is found and the benefits to network providers in maximising existing network resources are demonstrated. The QoE is measured in terms of the mean opinion score. The proposed scheme makes it possible for content providers to achieve optimum streaming (with an appropriate SBR) suitable for the network and content type for a requested QoE. The scheme is also beneficial for network providers for network resource provision and planning, and therefore maximising existing network infrastructure by providing service differentiation.	end-to-end principle;provisioning;quality of service;standard business reporting	Asiya Khan;Lingfen Sun;Emmanuel Jammeh;Emmanuel C.

This paper proposes a joint session admission control scheme that maximizes overall network revenue with quality of service (QoS) constraints over both WLANs and CDMA cellular networks. WLANs operate under IEEE 802.11e medium access control (MAC) protocol, which supports QoS for multimedia traffic. A cross-layer optimization approach is used in CDMA networks taking into account both physical layer linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) receivers and network layer QoS requirements. Numerical examples illustrate that the network revenue earned in the proposed joint admission control scheme is significantly more than that when the individual networks are optimized independently.	radio resource management	Fei Richard Yu;Vikram Krishnamurthy	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-31957-3_103	embedded system;code division multiple access;telephone network;telecommunications;computer science;access control;resource management;operating system;wireless network;mean squared error;mobile computing;computer security;service quality	Mobile	2.099774803820213	102.8437614460571	174985

The set-point is self-tuned from an initial value to an optimum value according to the requirement of the control system. If the initial set-point is far from the optimum set-point, especially when the size of the bottleneck buffer equals to the value of the bandwidth-delay product, the loss ratio and the delay and delay jitter must be increased. Aimed at improving all parameters of QoS regardless of the properties of the network such as the buffer size and the link speed, this paper derives a fuzzy controller to select the initial set-point based on the measured maximum queuing delay to make the initial set-point close to the optimum value. As a result, parameters of QoS are not degraded when bottleneck links have different buffer sizes and link speeds. The proposed algorithm is tested through the use of extensive simulations to prove its capability to improve network performance in comparison with existing algorithms.

The delivered data must conform to certain time or value based application specific consistency requirements. The design of mechanisms for such data delivery is challenging given that dynamic data changes rapidly and unpredictably, the latter making it very hard to use simple prediction techniques. To address these challenges we develop mechanisms to obtain timely and consistency-preserving updates for dynamic data by pulling data from the source at strategically chosen points in time, providing quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Motivated by the need for practical system design, but using formal analytical techniques, we offer a systematic approach based on control-theoretic principles. We present a stochastic controller based on the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) technique as a means for deciding when to next refresh data from a source. A simple enhancement of the LQG algorithm allows us to provide QoS guarantees. Using real-world traces of real-time data we show the superior performance of our feedback-driven control-theoretic approach by comparing with a previously proposed adaptive refresh technique, a pattern matching technique, and a proportional controller with dynamically changing tuning criteria.	algorithm;control theory;digital footprint;dynamic data;formal methods;pattern matching;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time data;requirement;state space;stochastic control;systems design;theory;tracing (software)	Ratul kr.

It is necessary to provide not only the minimum requirements for Quality of Service (QoS), but also to assure the Quality of Experience (QoE) support for multimedia applications. In this context, the usage of only one link quality metric for routing different types of packets within the network is not enough to ensure applications with suitable QoS and QoE levels. This paper presents a variation of the WMN routing protocol Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR), to achieve QoS and QoE requirements for multimedia applications. It is based on the dynamic choice of metrics and in a Fuzzy Link Cost (FLC) to determine the best routes for multimedia packets. The proposed FLC metric is based on a fuzzy system that uses two link quality metrics, namely Expected Transmission Count (ETX) and Minimum Delay (MD), to define a new metric. Simulations were performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed metric compared to the ones present in the original OLSR and other current versions of this protocol. For comparison purposes, it was considered different performance evaluation QoS metrics and the quality of videos received by the user in a higher competition scenario.	computer simulation;etx (form factor);expected transmission count;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;link-state routing protocol;mesh networking;optimized link state routing protocol;performance evaluation;quality of service;requirement;software metric;web science;wireless mesh network	Rafael L.

The proposed model simulates n virtual Dj's (one per channel) playing songs at the same time. Every virtual Dj takes into account the songs played by the other ones, programming a sequence of songs whose order is also coherent. That is, every song played in a channel takes into account both, the song previously played in the same channel and the songs being played in the other channels at the same time.

Based on opportunistic scheduling, users access the available medium (channel) in a decentralized manner. The rate adaptation problem of the WLAN multimedia networks is then formulated as a general-sum switching control dynamic Markovian game by modelling the video states and block fading channel qualities of each user as a finite states Markovian chain. A value iteration algorithm is proposed to compute the Nash equilibrium policy of such a game and the convergence of the algorithm is also proved. We also give assumptions on the system so that the Nash equilibrium transmission policy of each user is a randomization of two pure policies with each policy nondecreasing on the buffer state occupancy. Based on this structural result, we use the policy gradient algorithm to compute the Nash equilibrium policy.	algorithm;gradient;iteration;iterative method;markov chain;markov decision process;multi-user;nash equilibrium;scalability;scheduling (computing)	Jane W.

A packet flow in such a network may be unsuccessful if it experiences errors. This may lead to situations in which a flow receives significantly less service than it is supposed to, while other receives more, making it difficult to provide fairness. In this paper we propose a QoS-aware fair scheduling mechanism in ad hoc networks considering guaranteed and besteffort flows in the presence of link errors. The proposed mechanism provides short-term fairness for error free sessions and long-term fairness for the erroneous sessions and allows a lagging flow to receive extra service and a leading flow to give up its extra service in a graceful way. It also maximizes the resource utilization by allowing spatial reuse of resource. We also propose a CSMA/CA based implementation of our proposed method.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;experience;fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);network packet;quality of service;scheduling (computing);traffic flow (computer networking)	Muhammad Mahbub Alam;Md.

UDP and TCP transport layer protocols are designed to deliver data across wired networks. Mobility of users in such a wireless system results in transport layer protocols facing a very different packet loss and delay pattern. The use of an efficient mobility management protocol is essential to the performance of the protocols and the relevant applications running on top. In this papery the performance of UDP and TCP transport layers is evaluated on a wireless IP access network running the BCMP localised mobility management protocol, through simulations using the ns-2 simulation platform. Data and multimedia applications are employed to test their performance. UDP and various TCP variants are tested and the objective is to evaluate their performance in such a system and to examine the effect of the mobility of users.	performance evaluation	Nikos Georganopoulos;Hamid Aghvami	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39867-7_27	telecommunications;computer science;mobility model;computer security;transport layer;computer network	Vision	1.137944015153003	102.87897220034611	184826

The end-to-end throughput in the route may not be the maximum when the network has multiple link data rates, as a small hop number implies a large geographic distance (link distance) for each hop. Due to the radio signal attenuation, this results in a low SNR at the receiving node and, consequently, a low available link data rate. Reducing the link distance by using routes with more hop counts can increase the link data rate. However, this may not necessarily improve the end-to-end throughput because more nodes have to be included in the routes. In this paper, we first investigate and analyze the impact of link distance on end-to-end throughput in multirate multihop wireless networks. Analysis and simulation results show that changing the link distance affects the network throughput. To achieve a high network throughput, a proper link distance requirement has to be set for each hop, depending on different parameters such as load density. Based on this finding, we then propose a crossing-layer adaptive searching range (ASR) routing algorithm. ASR can be integrated into existing routing protocols. According to the local network load density, ASR can help improve the network performance by adjusting the link distance in the routes.	algorithm;automated system recovery;data rate units;end-to-end principle;geographical distance;haplogroup cz (mtdna);hoc (programming language);link distance;network packet;network performance;radio wave;routing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput;url shortening	Xiaoxin Wu;Gang Ding;Wenwu Zhu	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.2004892	optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.268732106371096	103.3199063030006	187519

Many studies have been done on real-time communications in wireless networks in order to overcome a higher bit error rate in wireless channels. However, none of work deals with firm real-time communications which can be applied to multimedia communications. In this paper, we propose an adaptive error correcting scheme for firm real-time multimedia communications in wireless networks in order to maximize the expected net profit. The proposed scheme adaptively selects an error correcting code under the current air state and the message state of a message stream. Throughout simulation results, we show that the suggested scheme provides more profit than single error-correcting code schemes.	forward error correction;real-time computing;real-time transcription	Kyong Hoon Kim;Jong Kim;Sung Je Hong	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e88-b.7.2794	real-time computing;simulation;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;statistics;computer network	Mobile	1.0596766407736535	103.55114216128003	187948

This paper focuses on multimedia traffic management in wireless networks, where we consider to provide differentiated Quality of Service (QoS) levels. We address the complex task of traffic scheduling with multi-objective requirements in the presence of errors introduced by the radio channel. In particular, we focus on managing downlink traffic in both wireless ATM and WiFi scenarios, referring to an infrastructure wireless access network where a central coordinator takes scheduling decisions for the mobile users in its cell. Our scheduler is based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with reinforcement learning. The ANN is trained from examples to behave as an ‘‘optimal’’ scheduler, according to an Actor-Critic model. The results obtained in scheduling concomitant voice, video and Web traffic classes permit to show the significant capacity improvement that can be achieved by our scheme with respect to other techniques previously proposed in the literature. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed Distributed Dynamic Channel Reservation (DDCR) method applies to mutlicarrier wireless dynamic TDMA LANs, where self-organized BSs act as hubs offering wireless access to Mobile Terminals (MTs). The method is suitable for unlicensed wireless environment, and especially in scenaria where BSs of different providers are installed in a common coverage area. In the proposed approach, BSs are competing to access and reserve time on separate frequencies, using a dynamic TDMA/TDD technique. The paper introduces etiquette rules, and contention disciplines, whilst eliminates any hidden terminal phenomena. Additionally, it defines carrier selection rules, allowing BSs to select the less congested carrier, based on real time measurements. Finally, the paper evaluates and compares the performance of the contention disciplines and MAC techniques, through simulations.	atm turbo;quality of service	Giannis F. Marias;Lazaros F.

Satellite communication systems, with their wide-area coverage and direct access to large number of users, clearly have an inherent advantage in supporting multicast applications. In order to remain competitive against other broadband technologies, however, next generation satellite systems will be required to support both unicast and multicast flows and offer optimal sharing of system resources between these flows. We show that, in a multiple spot-beam system, a high load variation across spotbeam queues may force lower allocated session rates for active flows, and be perceived as unsatisfactory by potential users when both unicast and multicast flows are active in the system. We propose an optimization framework for balancing the spot-beam queue service rates such that the sum of the rate variances of all active multicast flows is minimized. This is achieved through the re-distribution of system power among spot-beam queues, by taking into account the load on the queues and the channel states. We conclude that it is possible to increase the average session rates of multicast flows by up to16%, and the rates of unicast flows by up to4% after this optimization is applied.	communications satellite;mathematical optimization;multicast;next-generation network;random access;unicast	Gun Akkor;Michael H.

This strategy makes it possible to respond to link failures early enough to maintain data-session continuity. A simple, two-phase approach is proposed. In the first phase, the presence of a bit error rate violation along the packet link during short, fixed-length time segments is determined. In the second phase, the failure decision is made on the basis of a sequential algorithm. A simple table lookup implementation of the algorithm that requires no real-time computation is described. >		Seyhan Civanlar	1991	IEEE Trans.

A significant echo cancellation problem for this type of network is due to the fact that the delay is variable. This means that the canceller needs to track the delay and to reconverge for each change quickly enough to maintain efficiency in its control of the echo. This paper describes a system for dealing with abrupt changes in the network impulse response. The proposed model consists of an arrangement of echo cancellers, each referring to a particular delay, with the most appropriate canceller coefficients being chosen throughout the simulation as the system converges to the changing delay.	echo suppression and cancellation;network packet	V.

The demand for high throughput has driven to architectures that use multiple hops in the presence of infrastructure. We propose an architecture for multihop cellular networks (MCNs). MCNs combine the benefits of having a fixed infrastructure of base stations and the flexibility of Ad hoc networks. They are capable of achieving much higher throughput than current cellular systems, which can be classified as single-hop cellular networks (SCNs). In this work, we propose an extended architecture for MCN using the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless LANs for connection-less service and a TDMA-based solution for real-time support. We provide a general overview of the architecture and the issues involved in the design of MCNs, in particular the challenges to be met in the design of a routing protocol, a channel assignment scheme, and a mobility management scheme. We also propose a routing protocol called Base-Assisted Ad hoc Routing (BAAR) protocol for use in such networks and a model for the performance analysis of MCNs and SCNs. We also conduct extensive experimental studies on the performance of MCNs and SCNs under various load (TCP, UDP, and real-time sessions) and mobility conditions. These studies clearly indicate that MCNs with the proposed architecture and routing protocol are viable alternatives for SCNs, in fact they provide much higher throughput. MCNs are very attractive for best-effort packet radio where they can achieve an increase in throughput up to four when compared to similar SCNs. But for real-time traffic, even though they do outperform SCNs, they also suffer from a few disadvantages such as frequent hand-offs and throughput degradation at high mobility. We also present results from a detailed comparison study of our architecture for MCN with the Hybrid Wireless Network (HWN) architecture and Integrated Cellular Ad hoc Relaying (iCAR) Architecture.

The uctuation of wireless channel conditions can add a signiicant amount of delay to video packets and cause them to miss their play-out time. If a video is smoothed, it is possible to selectively deliver packets delayed at the base-station to reduce the impact of the missing packets to the video quality. In this paper, we present a simple yet eeective packet selection algorithm which accomplishes this goal. The algorithm determines whether to transmit a packet based on channel conditions as well as how likely higher priority layers in the rest of the video may be delivered on time. We introduce the concept of \quality index"""" to measure the performance of the algorithm. Results from trace-driven simulations show that the performance of the algorithm is close to optimum under a wide variety of channel conditions when the threshold is set between 0.7 and 0.9."""	network packet;packet switching;selection algorithm;simulation;smoothing;transmitter	Zhimei Jiang;Leonard Kleinrock	2000	J.

A handheld device, called personal wireless hub (PWH), of each mobile patient first gathers and aggregates the vital sign and context-aware data for various telemedicine applications. PWH transmits the aggregated data to the remote healthcare center over multiple wireless interfaces such as cellular, WLAN, and WiMAX. The aggregated data contain both periodic data and those nonperiodic unpredictable emergency messages that are sporadic and delayintolerant. This paper addresses the problem of providing QoS (e.g., minimum delay, sufficient data rate, acceptable blocking, and/or dropping rate) by designing a packet scheduling and channel/network allocation algorithm over wireless networks. The proposed resource-efficient QoS mechanism is simple and collaborates with an adaptive security algorithm. The QoS and security are achieved mainly with the collaboration of differentiator, delay monitor, data classifier, and scheduler modules within the PWH. This paper also discusses secure data transmission over body sensor networks by introducing key establishment and management algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves low-blocking probability, meets delay requirements, and provides energyefficient secure communication for the combination of vital signs and context-aware data.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;biometrics;blocking (computing);challenge–response authentication;crosstalk;data rate units;differentiator;elegant degradation;erlang (unit);heisenbug;interference (communication);key exchange;message authentication code;mobile device;network packet;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);secure communication;session key;simulation;usb hub	Narasimha Challa;Hasan Çam;Madhur Sikri	2008	EURASIP J.

There are few accepted tools/metrics that can be used to evaluate the suitability of a watermarking technique for a specific application. This lack of a universally adopted set of metrics/methods has motivated us to develop a web-based digital watermark evaluation system called the Watermark Evaluation Testbed or WET. There have been more improvements over the first version of WET. We implemented batch mode with a queue that allows for user submitted jobs. In addition to StirMark 3.1 as an attack module, we added attack modules based on StirMark 4.0. For a new image fidelity measure, we evaluate conditional entropy as an image fidelity measure for different watermarking algorithms and different attacks. Also, we show the results of curve fitting the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis data using the Parzen window density estimation. The curve fits the data closely while having only two parameters to estimate.	algorithm;batch processing;bit error rate;conditional entropy;curve fitting;digital watermarking;extrapolation;fits;image quality;interpolation;job queue;kernel density estimation;mean squared error;negative probability;receiver operating characteristic;requirement;taguchi loss function;taguchi methods;testbed;web application;window function	Hyung Cook Kim;Eugene T.
