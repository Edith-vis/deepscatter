94848d3ee893dc4c88ce66f8e86be6b5e60514ff	failure deterministic finite automata	proceedings international	Inspired by failure functions found in classical pattern matching algorithms, a failure deterministic finite automaton (FDFA) is defined as a formalism to recognise a regular language. An algorithm, based on formal concept analysis, is proposed for deriving from a given deterministic finite automaton (DFA) a language-equivalent FDFA. The FDFA’s transition diagram has fewer arcs than that of the DFA. A small modification to the classical DFA’s algorithm for recognising language elements yields a corresponding algorithm for an FDFA.	algorithm;deterministic finite automaton;diagram;finite-state machine;formal concept analysis;formal grammar;pattern matching;regular language	Derrick G.

c93e33cbac0889e7c1a9fede54338e4b991a4c6c	parameterized complexity of weighted satisfiability problems: decision, enumeration, counting	weighted satisfiability;parameterized complexity;post s lattice;parameterized counting complexity;polynomial delay enumeration	We consider the weighted satisfiability problem for Boolean circuits and propositional formulae, where the weight of an assignment is the number of variables set to true. We study the parameterized complexity of these problems and initiate a systematic study of the complexity of its fragments. Only the monotone fragment has been considered so far and proven to be of same complexity as the unrestricted problems. Here, we consider all fragments obtained by semantically restricting circuits or formulae to contain only gates (connectives) from a fixed set B of Boolean functions. We obtain a dichotomy result by showing that for each such B, the weighted satisfiability problems are either W[P]-complete (for circuits) or W[SAT]-complete (for formulae) or efficiently solvable. We also consider the related enumeration and counting problems.	parameterized complexity	Nadia Creignou;Heribert Vollmer	2015	Fundam.

400d2907a8f929de56a6128f8e7c3daa6ac04a77	a unifying approach for multistack pushdown automata	qa75 electronic computers computer science	We give a general approach to show the closure under complement and decide the emptiness for many classes of multistack visibly pushdown automata (Mvpa). A central notion in our approach is the visibly path-tree, i.e., a stack tree with the encoding of a path that denotes a linear ordering of the nodes. We show that the set of all such trees with a bounded size labeling is regular, and path-trees allow us to design simple conversions between tree automata and Mvpa’s. As corollaries of our results we get the closure under complement of ordered Mvpa that was an open problem, and a better upper bound on the algorithm to check the emptiness of bounded-phase Mvpa’s.	algorithm;automata theory;binary tree;deterministic pushdown automaton;stack (abstract data type);tree automaton	Salvatore La Torre;Margherita Napoli;Gennaro Parlato	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-44522-8_32	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	-3.781418958781611	21.180955861039646	49205

The basic idea is to represent the data items appearing on any communication link of a systolic network by a data sequence and to specify the operation on each cell by a set of equations using operators on sequences. The model is then applied successfully to a complex system that we suggest for pipelining the computation of the elemental stiffness matrices for finite element analysis. t(> 1985 Academic Press, Inc.	complex system;computation;elemental;finite element method;multiplexing;pipeline (computing);stiffness matrix	Rami G.

These algorithms are useful when the amount of time or memory resources are limited, or a rapid response time is required. An example of such a problem is pathfinding in video games where numerous units may be simultaneously required to react promptly to a player's commands. Classic real-time heuristic search algorithms cannot be deployed due to their obvious state revisitation (“scrubbing”). Recent algorithms have improved performance by using a database of precomputed subgoals. However, a common issue is that the precomputation time can be large, and there is no guarantee that the precomputed data adequately cover the search space. In this paper, we present a new approach that guarantees coverage by abstracting the search space, using the same algorithm that performs the real-time search. It reduces the precomputation time via the use of dynamic programming. The new approach eliminates the learning component and the resultant “scrubbing.” Experimental results on maps of tens of millions of grid cells from Counter-Strike: Source and benchmark maps from Dragon Age: Origins show significantly faster execution times and improved optimality results compared to previous real-time algorithms.	a* search algorithm;analysis of algorithms;associative entity;benchmark (computing);best, worst and average case;branching factor;dspace;database;dynamic programming;finite-state machine;hash table;heuristic;hill climbing;linear function;map;memory footprint;memory scrubbing;online and offline;pathfinding;precomputation;read-only memory;real-time search;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;real-time web;response time (technology);resultant;row (database);run time (program lifecycle phase);state space	Ramon Lawrence;Vadim Bulitko	2013	IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games	10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2230632	beam search;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;dynamic programming;incremental heuristic search;best-first search;monte carlo tree search;combinatorial search;search algorithm	AI	9.983309146377222	27.557581549541826	49645

Recently, it was proved [9,5,12,4] that for some restricted classes of systems the direct sum is terminating if R, and R, are. In this paper we present a novel approach to modularity. Rather than considering the union (direct sum) of the sets of rewrite rules, we consider the family (set) of them, introducing a new reduction relation called a modular reduction. One of the significant points is that we can prove a theorem on its termination which holds for general systems. Let Y be a set of variables, and 9 be a set of function symbols. The set of terms on 9 and V is denoted by Y( 9, V). Let %i,. . . , Fn be pairwise disjoint sets of function symbols and let s be their union. Then a modular term rewriting system MR on .7( F, V) is a family of term rewriting systems R, on 7( 3, V), i.e., MR = {R,, . . . , R, }. Each member R, is called a module of MR. Computation in modular term rewriting systems is defined by the following reduction relation:	abstract rewriting system;computation;newman's lemma;r language;rewrite (programming)	Masahito Kurihara;Ikuo Kaji	1990	Inf.

It is shown that computing lower and upper bounds of expected outcomes is Σ 1– and Σ 0 2–complete, respectively. Deciding (universal) almost–sure termination as well as deciding whether the expected outcome of a program equals a given rational value is shown to be Π 2–complete. Finally, it is shown that deciding (universal) positive almost–sure termination is Σ 2–complete (Π 0 3–complete).	exptime;randomized algorithm;semiconductor industry;universal quantification	Benjamin Lucien Kaminski;Joost-Pieter Katoen	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-48057-1_24	artificial intelligence;mathematics;algorithm	AI	6.691055047224613	20.799253876067407	49890

From this, we show that the number of nondeterministic moves of a finite automaton, if limited, is bounded by $2^{n} - 2$ where $n$ is the number of states. If the finite automaton is over a one-letter alphabet, using Gohon's result the number of nondeterministic moves, if limited, is less than $n^{2}$ . In both cases, we present families of finite automata demonstrating that the upper bounds obtained are almost tight. We also show that the limitedness problem of the number of nondeterministic moves of finite automata is PSPACE-hard. Since the problem is already known to be in PSPACE, it is therefore PSPACE-complete.	deterministic finite automaton;finite-state machine;nondeterministic algorithm;nondeterministic finite automaton;pspace;pspace-complete	Hing Leung	1998	Acta Informatica	10.1007/s002360050133	powerset construction;nondeterministic finite automaton with ε-moves;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;büchi automaton;nondeterministic finite automaton;state diagram;letter;quantum finite automata;computer science;two-way deterministic finite automaton;deterministic finite automaton;deterministic automaton;automata theory;ω-automaton;mathematics;finite-state machine;upper and lower bounds;timed automaton;generalized nondeterministic finite automaton;nondeterministic algorithm;algorithm	Logic	-1.2749897030444648	21.6412784338927	49911
98d67cf24ab5db67e7bc6fb0b36eba0760646c2c	wireless sensor network based soil moisture monitoring system design	soil science;wireless	Soil moisture is the amount of water in the soil. It plays a crucial role for efficient photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and transportation of minerals and other nutrients through the plant. Proper irrigation schedule is very critical to plant growth. This paper presents a soil moisture monitoring system which comprises of commercially available soil moisture sensor Decagon EC-5, low power nRF24L01 wireless transceiver, and MPC82G516A microcontroller. The sensed soil moisture content from the EC-5 sensor node will be transmitted to the coordinator via 2.5GHZ wireless signal. The coordinator will transmit the data to the computer using RS232 interface. The key components used in the proposed system are low cost and more flexible. The locally developed MPC82G516A microcontroller consumes low power due to its 1-T instruction time. In addition, the EC-5 sensing electrode also has advantages of easy installation and replacement in the farm. The developed system provides a better data transmitted and processed wirelessly and it can serve as a basis for efficient irrigation scheduling.	microcontroller;rs-232;scheduling (computing);sensor node;transceiver	Danny Wen-Yaw Chung;Jocelyn F.

ResiDI transmits events using wireless technologies embedded in WSANs to reduce the wire load capacity of traditional systems. In addition, the nodes are equipped with batteries, as a backup system. These features allow the ResiDI to be installed anywhere in the house, without the need for drilling or changing any other pre-existing infrastructure. Furthermore, the roles and intelligence of ResiDI are distributed among the network nodes. Besides increasing precision in decision-making through a neural network, the ResiDI seeks to reduce node energy consumption by means of a temporal correlation mechanism. As proof of concept, a prototype was developed to integrate with ResiDI in order to demonstrate its viability. When compared with an approach in the literature, real and simulated results show that ResiDI makes three key contributions: (i) 22.03% increase in decision-making; (ii) 44.35% reduction in node energy consumption in a homogeneous way; and (iii) 95.24% efficiency in information transmission. Finally, ResiDI provides a gain in response time of 30.21%, so that the decision-making process is performed faster.	as-interface;home automation	Geraldo P. R. Filho;Leandro A.

The previous best pseudorandom generator for regular branching programs used a seed of length $O(\log n \cdot (\log \log n + \log (1/\epsilon) )$, and was due to Braverman et. al. and Brody and Verbin (FOCS 2010). Our pseudorandom generator is the INW generator due to Impagliazzo et. al. (STOC 1994). Our work shares some similarity with the recent work of Kouck\'{y} et. al. (STOC 2011)who get similar seed length for permutation branching programs. However, our work proceeds by analyzing the eigenvalues of the stochastic matrices that arise in the transitions of the branching program which arguably makes the technique more robust. As a corollary of our techniques, we present new results on the ``small biased spaces for group products'' problem by Meka and Zuckerman (RANDOM 2009). We get a pseudorandom generator with seed length $ \log n \cdot (\log |G|+ \log (1/\epsilon))$. Previously, using the result of Kouck\'{y} et. al., it was possible to get a seed length of $\log n \cdot (|G|^{O(1)} + \log (1/\epsilon))$ for this problem.	binary decision diagram;computable function;polynomial;pseudorandom generator;pseudorandomness;stochastic matrix;symposium on foundations of computer science;symposium on theory of computing;time complexity	Anindya De	2011	2011 IEEE 26th Annual Conference on Computational Complexity	10.1109/CCC.2011.23	labeling theory;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;random number generation;probabilistic method;linear algebra;probability;mathematics;computational complexity theory;vegetation;statistics;polynomial;algebra	Theory	9.95903072758979	22.279548239187704	50450

Each cell is an independent computing agent with its own computing program, which produces objects. The interaction between cells consists of the exchange of objects through membranes. The output of a computation is a partially ordered set of objects which leave the super-cell through its external membrane. The fundamental properties of computations in such super-cell systems with external output are investigated.

Their goal is to work together to compute a function of the union of their observations. This can be as simple as counting the total number of observations, or more complex non-linear functions such as tracking the entropy of the induced distribution. Assuming that it is too costly to simply centralize all the observations, it becomes quite challenging to design solutions which provide a good approximation to the current answer, while bounding the communication cost of the observers, and their other resources such as their space usage. This survey introduces this model, and describe a selection results in this setting, from the simple counting problem to a variety of other functions that have been studied.	approximation;centralisation;counting problem (complexity);linear function;nonlinear system;space–time tradeoff	Graham Cormode	2013	SIGMOD Record	10.1145/2481528.2481530	mathematical optimization;simulation	ML	6.820084608319117	30.948617562990854	50851

The system consists of a set of mobile software agents to control the cart and provides a novel method for alignment. To avoid excessive energy consumption through the collection of the carts, we have used ant colony optimisation that uses the vector values of the scattered carts in the field. Waiting time and route to the destination of each cart is computed based on the cluster to be created. These routes and waiting times are conveyed by the mobile software agent to each cart, causing the group to form into rough lines. Because the carts are clustered by the similarity of their vectors, we have observed that several groups have appeared to have been successfully aligned by this method. We also propose a line forming technique for intelligent carts to actually align themselves.	algorithm;align (company);ant colony optimization algorithms;cluster analysis;distributed computing;experiment;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;robot;rough set;serialization;simulation;software agent;word lists by frequency	Yasushi Kambayashi;Keisuke Satta;Ko Shibata;Shota Sugiyama;Munehiro Takimoto;Hidemi Yamachi	2014	IJIIDS	10.1504/IJIIDS.2014.066641	embedded system;simulation;computer science;autonomous system	Robotics	4.954163470569656	29.267411028362847	51022

For example, we show that if a setA and its complement conjunctively reduce to some sparse set, then they also are conjunctively reducible to a P(A ⊕ SAT)-printable tally set. As a consequence, the class IC[log,poly] of sets with low instance complexity is contained in theEL 1 Σ -level of the extended low hierarchy. By refining our techniques, we also show that all word-decreasing self-reducible sets in IC[log, poly] are in NP ∩ co-NP and therefore low for NP. We derive similar results for sets inR d p (SPARSE) andR hd p (R c p (SPARSE)), as well as in some nondeterministic reduction classes to sparse sets.	co-np;function problem;low and high hierarchies;sparse language;sparse matrix;turing reduction;unary language	Vikraman Arvind;Johannes Köbler;Martin Mundhenk	1996	Mathematical systems theory	10.1007/BF01201814	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;sparse language;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;algorithm	Theory	5.878466995916429	19.088425380964505	51055

Building on the quantum fingerprinting protocol of Buhrman et al., Yao recently showed that a large class of efficient classical public-coin protocols can be turned into efficient quantum protocols without public coin. This raises the question whether this can be done always, i.e. whether quantum communication can always replace a public coin in the SMP model. We answer this question in the negative, exhibiting a communication problem where classical communication with public coin is exponentially more efficient than quantum communication. Together with a separation in the other direction due to Bar-Yossef et al., this shows that the quantum SMP model is incomparable with the classical public-coin SMP model. In addition we give a characterization of the power of quantum fingerprinting by means of a connection to geometrical tools from machine learning, a quadratic improvement of Yao’s simulation, and a nearly tight analysis of the Hamming distance problem from Yao’s paper.	communication complexity;fingerprint (computing);hamming distance;machine learning;message passing;quantum channel;quantum fingerprinting;quantum information science;qubit;randomness;simulation;symmetric multiprocessing;time complexity;yao graph	Dmitry Gavinsky;Julia Kempe;Ronald de Wolf	2004	CoRR		quantum information;hamming distance;quantum information science;quantum complexity theory;theoretical computer science;quantum network;quantum capacity;communication complexity;mathematics;quantum convolutional code;quantum channel;quantum computer;computational complexity theory;quantum algorithm;physics;algorithm;quantum mechanics;quantum sort	Theory	8.539567786080758	24.38284230522093	51280

bfe722b61974da31bfcab4e7e6ef26d1db325b9c	modular inversion hidden number problem- a lattice approach		The Modular Inversion Hidden Number Problem (MIHNP) was introduced by Boneh, Halevi and Howgrave-Graham in Asiacrypt 2001 (BHH’01). They provided two heuristics in Method I, two-third of the output bits are required to solve the problem, whereas the more efficient heuristic (Method II) requires only one-third of the bits of the output. After more than a decade, here Sarkar in [28] identified that the claim in Method II is actually not correct and a detailed calculation justified that this method too requires two-third of the bits of the output, contrary to the claim in BHH’01. He reconstructed the lattice and give a bound which heuristically solve with half of the output bits. Although J.Xu et al in [29] solved it with only one-third of the output bits asymptotically but that technique is difficult to understand and implement. Here we essentially use similar idea of [28] but in a clever way such that it is a better bound although we solve the problem heuristically with only half of the output bits in asymptotic sense. This is better method and a lot easier to understand and implement. Also experimental results support the claim corresponding to our heuristics. In the last section we actually talk about a variant of this which seems to be hard to solve under lattice attack.	asiacrypt;graham scan;heuristic (computer science)	Pranjal Dutta	2015	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;algorithm	Crypto	7.52982257123472	26.553729258421374	51778

1681feee90d47279ffa45d938c2cafcb0660058a	fully decentralized computation of aggregates over data streams	experimental analysis	In several emerging applications, data is collected in massive streams at several distributed points of observation. A basic and challenging task is to allow every node to monitor a neighbourhood of interest by issuing continuous aggregate queries on the streams observed in its vicinity. This class of algorithms is fully decentralized and diffusive in nature: collecting all data at few central nodes of the network is unfeasible in networks of low capability devices or in the presence of massive data sets.  The main difficulty in designing diffusive algorithms is to cope with duplicate detections. These arise both from the observation of the same event at several nodes of the network and/or receipt of the same aggregated information along multiple paths of diffusion. In this paper, we consider fully decentralized algorithms that answer locally continuous aggregate queries on the number of distinct events, total number of events and the second frequency moment in the scenario outlined above. The proposed algorithms use in the worst case or on realistic distributions sublinear space at every node. We also propose strategies that minimize the communication needed to update the aggregates when new events are observed. We experimentally evaluate for the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithms on realistic simulated scenarios.	aggregate data;best, worst and average case;computation;experiment;streams;sensor;streaming algorithm	Luca Becchetti;Ilaria Bordino;Stefano Leonardi;Adi Rosén	2010	SIGKDD Explorations	10.1145/1964897.1964919	real-time computing;computer science;sensor;machine learning;data mining;distributed computing;accelerometer;experimental analysis of behavior;activity recognition	DB	6.783491444788055	31.067359933932742	51917

Auxiliary Boolean registers are not necessary for this. In the current paper, we show that, in the case of the parity functions, shorter instruction sequences are possible with the use of an auxiliary Boolean register in the presence of instructions to complement the content of auxiliary Boolean registers. This result supports, in a setting where programs are instruction sequences acting on Boolean registers, a basic intuition behind the storage of auxiliary data, namely the intuition that this makes possible a reduction of the size of a program.	parity bit;parity function;processor register	Jan A.

Of particular interest are languages having a measure equal to 1 with respect to all positive Bernoulli distributions (Bernoulli sets). The main object of the paper is to study conditions ensuring that a given language has a finite Bernoulli completion, i.e., it is included in a finite Bernoulli set. Some characterizations of languages having finite Bernoulli completions are given. In the case of a two-letter alphabet it is shown that one can decide whether a finite language has a finite Bernoulli completion or not. Moreover, any finite code over a two-letter alphabet has a finite Bernoulli completion. Finally, we prove that two finite languages have the same measure with respect to all Bernoulli distributions if and only if each of the two languages can be obtained from the other by using a finite number of times three suitable measure-invariant transformations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Levenshtein automata of degree n for a word W are defined as finite state automata that recognize the set of all words V where the Levenshtein distance between V and W does not exceed n. We show how to compute, for any fixed bound n and any input word W, a deterministic Levenshtein automaton of degree n for W in time linear to the length of W. Given an electronic dictionary that is implemented in the form of a trie or a finite state automaton, the Levenshtein automaton for W can be used to control search in the lexicon in such a way that exactly the lexical words V are generated where the Levenshtein distance between V and W does not exceed the given bound. This leads to a very fast method for correcting corrupted input words of unrestricted text using large electronic dictionaries. We then introduce a second method that avoids the explicit computation of Levenshtein automata and leads to even improved efficiency. Evaluation results are given that also address variants of both methods that are based on modified Levenshtein distances where further primitive edit operations (transpositions, merges and splits) are used.	automata theory;computation;damerau–levenshtein distance;dictionary;finite-state machine;levenshtein automaton;levenshtein distance;lexicon;trie	Klaus U.

Focusing only on worst case analysis or asymptotic computations leads to the development of complex data structures or hard to implement algorithms. Randomized algorithms appear in this scenario as a very useful tool in order to obtain easier implementations within a good expected time bound. However, parallel implementations of these algorithms are hard to develop and require an in-depth understanding of the language, the compiler and the underlying parallel computer architecture. In this paper we show how we can use speculative parallelization techniques to execute in parallel iterative algorithms such as randomized incremental constructions. In this paper we focus on the convex hull problem, and show that, using our speculative parallelization engine, the sequential algorithm can be automatically executed in parallel, obtaining speedups with as little as four processors, and reaching 5.15x speedup with 28 processors.	automatic parallelization;average-case complexity;best, worst and average case;central processing unit;compiler;computation;computational geometry;computer architecture;convex hull;data structure;fastest;graphics;iteration;memory hierarchy;parallel computing;randomized algorithm;scheduling (computing);sequential algorithm;speculative execution;speedup	Marcelo H.

For a long time this was supposed to be also the lower bound, but a result by Hromkovic et al. showed how to build an e-free NFA with only O(n log 2 (n)) transitions. The current lower bound on the number of transitions is Ω(n log(n)). A rough running time estimation for the common follow sets (CFS) construction proposed by Hromkovic et al. yields a cubic algorithm. In this paper we present a sequential algorithm for the CFS construction which works in time O(n log(n)+size of the output). On a CREW PRAM the CFS construction can be performed in time O(log(n)) using O(n + (size of the output)/ log(n)) processors. We also present a simpler proof of the lower bound on the number of transitions.	nondeterministic finite automaton;regular expression	Christian Hagenah;Anca Muscholl	2000	ITA	10.1051/ita:2000116	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;finite-state machine;programming language;regular expression;algorithm;algebra	DB	-1.1242551668702099	21.390469154942082	53655

To prove this we introduce a similar relation on finite formal languages which also has this property. As a consequence we get that every property which is hereditary with respect to ? has a test in O(|P|c), whereas c depends on the property. This test has an easy parallelization with the same costs. On a parallel machine (CRCW PRAM) it may be implemented in such a way that it runs in constant time and needs O(|P|c)processors.	formal language	Jens Gustedt	1995	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

We investigate here the impact of nominal sets on the definition of Cellular Automata and on their computational capabilities, with a special focus on the emergent behavioural properties of this new model and their significance in the context of computation-oriented interpretations of physical phenomena. An investigation of the relations between Nominal Cellular Automata and Wolframu0027s Elementary Cellular Automata is carried out, together with an analysis of interesting particles, exhibiting “nominal” behaviour, in a particular kind of rules, reminiscent of the class of totalistic Cellular Automata, that we call “bagged”.	automata theory;cellular automaton	Tommaso Bolognesi;Vincenzo Ciancia	2017	J.

We also study the three party communication model, and exhibit an exponential gap in 3-round protocols that differ in the starting player. Finally, we show new connections of these questions to circuit complexity, that motivate further work in this direction.	circuit complexity;communication complexity;randomized algorithm;statistical model;time complexity	Noam Nisan;Avi Wigderson	1991		10.1145/103418.103463	complexity class;circuit complexity;statistical model;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;average-case complexity;ph;models of communication;decision tree model;theoretical computer science;worst-case complexity;communication complexity;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;asymptotic computational complexity;game complexity;algorithm;statistics	Theory	8.86629558029913	24.465004276984633	54343

The CAN is developed by Bosch corp. In the early 1980’s for automobile network. The data from various sensors in the flowing-water tank are converted to digital by the analog to digital converter and formatted to fit the CAN protocol at the CAN module. Nine CAN modules are connected to another CAN Modules through a CAN BUS for the efficient communications and processing. This design reduces the cost for wiring and improves the data transmission reliability by recognizing the sensor errors and data transmission errors. Also each CAN Module processes sensor’s error data, transmission errors data and it can be served as a master-slave system as well. Via the real experiments, effectiveness of the Fieldbus Network System using DPQ algorithm in CAN Network is verified.	algorithm;fieldbus	Hwi-Myung Ha;ZhiTao Wang;Jang-Myung Lee	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13963-0_38	embedded system;real-time computing;distributed computing	Networks	0.9000693887400308	30.64820372959779	54675

We show that bounded-error QFAs are more powerful than PFAs. But, in contrary to the binary problems, the computational powers of Las-Vegas QFAs and bounded-error PFAs are equivalent to deterministic finite automata (DFAs). Lastly, we present a new family of unary promise problems with two parameters such that when fixing one parameter QFAs can be exponentially more succinct than PFAs and when fixing the other parameter PFAs can be exponentially more succinct than DFAs.	automata theory;automaton;promise problem;unary operation	Aida Gainutdinova;Abuzer Yakaryilmaz	2018	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-017-1799-0	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	0.7735276946213399	22.185569340998487	54687
adab7063d83450ccc7f74bb78817643711034fc9	preface of special issue on theoretical aspects of computer science		This special issue contains nine articles which are based on extended abstracts that were presented at the 28th Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS), which was held at Technische Universität Dortmund, Germany, March 10– 12, 2011. These extended abstracts were among the top papers of those that were chosen for presentation at STACS 2011 in a highly competitive peer-review process (after which only 54 papers out of 271 submission were accepted). Compared with the original extended abstracts the articles have been strongly revised and extended by full proofs and additional results. They underwent a further rigorous reviewing process, following the TOCS standard, completely independent from the selection process of STACS 2011. Three articles are about formal languages. The first two investigate size issues for automata and (extended) regular expressions, respectively, while the third one investigates the syntactic monoids of regular languages over infinite alphabets. The article Series Parallel Digraphs with Loops by Stefan Gulan studies the question which kinds of finite automata can be translated into regular expressions of linear size. It gives a very comprehensive answer to this question by showing that such linear translations are possible from automata with a certain underlying graph structure, series parallel loop graphs, into regular expressions and vice versa.

The TEP was introduced in earlier work as a simple candidate for the ( very) long term goal of separating L andLogDCFL. The input to the problem is a rooted, balanced binary tree of heighth, whose internal nodes are labeled with binary functions on [k] = {1, . . . , k} (each given simply as a list ofk2 elements of[k]), and whose leaves are labeled with elements of [k]. Each node obtains a value in [k] equal to its binary function applied to the values of its chil dren. The output is the value of the root. The first restricted compu tation model, calledfractional pebbling, is a generalization of the black/white pebbling game on gra phs, and arises in a natural way from the search for good upper bounds on the size of nondet erministic branching programs solving the TEP for any fixedh, if the binary tree of height h has fractional pebbling cost at mostp, then there are nondeterministic branching programs of siz e O(kp) solving the height h TEP. We prove a lower bound on the fractional pebbling cost of d-ary trees that is tight to within an additive constant for each fixed d. The second restricted computation model we study is a semantic restriction on (non)deterministic branching programs solving the TEP – thrifty branching programs. Deterministic (resp. nondeterminist ic) thrifty BPs suffice to implement the best known algorithms, based on black pebbling (resp. fr actional pebbling), for the TEP. In earlier work, for each fixedh a lower bound on the size of thrifty deterministic branching programs was proved that is tight for sufficiently large k. We give an alternative proof that achieves the same bound for all k andh. We also show the bound still holds in a less-restricted model.	algorithm;binary decision diagram;binary tree;model of computation;self-balancing binary search tree;utility functions on indivisible goods	Dustin Wehr	2010	CoRR		computer simulation;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;algorithm	Theory	9.301492315755128	22.38543604968093	54713

There is a large body of research on grammar inference within the theory of formal languages. However, there is surprisingly little known on grammar inference for graph grammars. In this paper we take a further step in this direction and work within the framework of node label controlled (NLC) graph grammars. Specifically, we characterize, given a set of disjoint and isomorphic subgraphs of a graph G, whether or not there is a NLC graph grammar rule which can generate these subgraphs to obtain G. This generalizes previous results by assuming that the set of isomorphic subgraphs is disjoint instead of non-touching. This leads naturally to consider the more involved “non-confluent” graph grammar rules.	formal language;grammar induction;graph rewriting;natural language processing	Hendrik Blockeel;Robert Brijder	2009	CoRR		grammar systems theory;context-sensitive grammar;tree-adjoining grammar;combinatorics;formal language;discrete mathematics;link grammar;null graph;graph property;grammar induction;regular grammar;computer science;affix grammar;machine learning;regular tree grammar;mathematics;voltage graph;graph;attribute grammar;unrestricted grammar;adaptive grammar;complement graph;mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism;line graph;algorithm	NLP	-4.517142494016059	20.36339247300874	54733

We present a simulation of  S ( n )-space bounded alternating Turing machines (ATM) by one-tape lg ∗   S ( n )-reversal bounded ATMs. We also show that ATMs making a constant number of reversals recognize only regular languages. This shows that there is a striking difference in computational power between machines making a constant number of reversals and those making an ‘almost’ constant (i.e., lg ∗  n ) number of reversals.	alternating turing machine	Maciej Liskiewicz;Krzysztof Lorys;Marek Piotrów	1987	Theor.

The computational power of the model is investigated under several variants, depending on the type of switches (or switch operations) assumed by the network nodes. Computational power is evaluated by focusing on the set of problems computable in constant time in each variant. A hierarchy of such problem classes corresponding to different variants is shown to exist and is placed relative to traditional classes of complexity theory. •Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, The Haifa University, Haifa, Israel.

Precision agriculture technology improves sustainable production by providing more farmers with the ability to obtain highly accurate machine control in rough or varied terrain. This experiment tests the use of low cost single frequency L1-band RTK GPS in a RTN covering a wide area. Wired Internet is not available in the field for many farmers so cellular internet such as 3G/4G must be relied on for connectivity. Where 3G/4G have limited coverage, satellite Internet could be used. A mobile satellite Internet antenna can be placed on a support vehicle and moved to a site where multiple tractors are harvesting or planting. The Internet is then shared with precision agriculture farming equipment nearby. Having better logistical and fiscal access to machine control and the Internet could assist the farmer and the United States Department of Agriculture in efforts to sustain adequate crop yields, project future agriculture needs, and better protect crops from pests and diseases. This experiment provides information on how to configure “Internet to Tractor” for RTK GPS RTN concept with a discussion of the limitations and future product development.	global positioning system;internet;l band;logistics;msat;new product development;real time kinematic;real-time computing	Stacey D.

NDT is a technique that allows the examination of material properties without causing any damage to the material in the process. A wireless sensor network facilitates the collaborative effort to monitor a certain aspect without the need for expensive wired infrastructures. In this paper we describe the system architecture of a NDT system that is ultra low power, low cost, easy to use, and autonomously integrates into our WSN platform to collaboratively monitor the status conditions of industrial equipment. Our system was successfully deployed to monitor the thickness of a compound-metal (tungsten and steel) sheets used in vibration screens, which are utilized in the harsh industrial environments of the Oil-Sands, located in northern Alberta, Canada. The integration of the two technologies, WSN-based NDT, will bring about new applications in the field of low cost wireless material examination in real-time.

The socalled strongly recognizing morphisms can be seen as a deterministic computation model which provides minimal objects (known as the syntactic morphism) and a trivial complementation procedure. We give a quadratic-time algorithm for computing the syntactic morphism from any given strongly recognizing morphism, thereby showing that minimization is easy as well. In addition, we give algorithms for efficiently solving various decision problems for weakly recognizing morphisms. Weakly recognizing morphism are often smaller than their strongly recognizing counterparts. Finally, we describe the language operations needed for converting formulas in monadic second-order logic (MSO) into strongly recognizing morphisms, and we give some experimental results. 1998 ACM Subject Classification F.4.1 Mathematical Logic; F.4.3 Formal Languages	algorithm;automata theory;chaitin's constant;decision problem;deterministic automaton;mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;model of computation;monadic predicate calculus;omega;omega-regular language;regular language;time complexity	Lukas Fleischer;Manfred Kufleitner	2015		10.4230/LIPIcs.FSTTCS.2015.112	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	Logic	-1.3872905278795462	20.41370634308567	56817
3f781c66e1b8bae43800bcc48464c70e10573179	resolution and the binary encoding of combinatorial principles		We investigate the size complexity of proofs in Res(s) – an extension of Resolution working on s-DNFs instead of clauses – for families of contradictions given in the unusual binary encoding. A motivation of our work is size lower bounds of refutations in Resolution for families of contradictions in the usual unary encoding. Our main interest is the k-Clique Principle, whose Resolution complexity is still unknown. The approach is justified by the observation that for a large class of combinatorial principles (those expressible as Π2 first-order formulae) short Res(log n) refutations for the binary encoding are reducible to short Resolution refutations of the unary encoding. Our main result is a n lower bound for the size of refutations of the binary k-Clique Principle in Res(b 1 2 log log nc). This improves the result of Lauria, Pudlák et al. [24] who proved the lower bound for Resolution, that is Res(1). A lower bound in Res(log n) for the binary k-Clique Principle would prove a lower bound in Resolution for its unary version. Resolution lower bounds for the (unary) k-Clique Principle are known only when refutations are either treelike [10] or read-once [4] (regular Resolution). To contrast the proof complexity between the unary and binary encodings of combinatorial principles, we consider the binary (weak) Pigeonhole principle Bin-PHPn for m > n. Our second lower bound proves that in Res(s) for s ≤ log 1 2− (n), the shortest proofs of the Bin-PHPn , requires size 2 1−δ , for any δ > 0. By a result of Buss and Pitassi [15] we know that for the (unary, weak) Pigeonhole principle PHPn , exponential lower bounds (in the size of PHP m n ) are not possible in Resolution when m ≥ 2 √ n log n since there is an upper bound of 2 √ n log . Our lower bound for Bin-PHPn , together with the fact short Res(1) refutations for PHPn can be translated into short Res(log n) proofs for Bin-PHPn , shows a form of tightness of the upper bound of [15]. Furthermore we prove that Bin-PHPn can be refuted in size 2 Θ(n) in treelike Res(1), contrasting with the unary case, where PHPn requires treelike Res(1) refutations of size 2 Ω(n log n) [9, 16]. In order to compare the complexity of refuting binary encodings in Resolution with respect to their unary version, we study under what conditions the complexity of refutations in Resolution will not increase significantly (more than a polynomial factor) when shifting between the unary encoding and the binary encoding. We show that this is true, from unary to binary, for propositional encodings of principles expressible as a Π2-formula and involving total variable comparisons. We then show that this is true, from binary to unary, when one considers the functional unary encoding. In particular, we derive a polynomial upper bound in Res(1) for the binary version Bin-rLOPn of a variant of the Linear Ordering principle, rLOPn, which exponentially separates read-once Resolution from Resolution (see [2]). Finally we prove that the binary encoding of the general Ordering principle Bin-OPn – with no total ordering constraints – is polynomially provable in Resolution. These last results can be interpreted as addressing the property that shifting to the binary encoding is preserving the proof hardness of the corresponding unary encodings when working in Resolution.	best bin first;binary file;clique (graph theory);first-order predicate;php;pigeonhole sort;polynomial;proof complexity;propositional calculus;provable security;time complexity;unary coding;unary operation	Stefan S.

3056543ca386400acefef336f4135f77052f884d	a survey on operational state complexity		Descriptional complexity is the study of the conciseness of the various models representing formal languages. The state complexity of a regular language is the size, measured by the number of states of the smallest, either deterministic or nondeterministic, finite automaton that recognises it. Operational state complexity is the study of the state complexity of operations over languages. In this survey, we review the state complexities of individual regularity preserving language operations on regular and some subregular languages. Then we revisit the state complexities of the combination of individual operations. We also review methods of estimation and approximation of state complexity of more complex combined operations. 2 Y. Gao, N. Moreira, R. Reis, S.

For instance, context-sensitive languages are the languages generated by growing grammars, or equivalently those accepted by Turing machines whose work tape’s size is proportional to that of their input. A few years ago, a new characterisation of context-sensitive languages as the sets of traces, or path labels, of rational graphs (infinite graphs defined by sets of finite-state transducers) was established. We investigate a similar characterisation in the more general framework of graphs defined by term transducers. In particular, we show that the languages of term-automatic graphs between regular sets of vertices coincide with the languages accepted by alternating linearly bounded Turing machines. As a technical tool, we also introduce an arborescent variant of tiling systems, which provides yet another characterisation of these languages.

We show that if a function ofn variables has aring-protocol or atree-protocol of communication complexity bounded by ϕ, then there is a circuit of size $$2^{0(\phi )} n$$ that computes an inverse of the function. Consequently, we prove that although invertingNC 0 Boolean circuits isNP-hard, planarNC 1 Boolean circuits can be inverted inNC, and hence in polynomial time. From the ring-protocol theorem, we derive an ω(n logn) lower bound on the VLSI area required to lay out any one-way function. Our results on inverting boolean circuits can be extended to algebraic circuits over finite rings. We prove that on certain topologies no one-way function can be computed with low communication complexity.	boolean circuit;linear algebra;multiparty communication complexity;one-way function;polynomial;time complexity	Shang-Hua Teng	1994	Journal of Cryptology	10.1007/BF02318547	circuit complexity;boolean circuit;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;majority function;decision tree model;boolean expression;computer science;karp–lipton theorem;communication complexity;complexity index;mathematics;one-way function;algorithm;parity function;algebra	Crypto	8.593651684319003	22.428415162691582	58262

As an example application, a reliable battery is presented which consists of battery cells, a cell switching circuit, a battery cell array manager and a system safety manager. This is useful for managing the existing energy infrastructure in an efficient and smart manner such that batteries last for a longer time. The RelBat system is built on a management system which performs its management activities by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating area, monitoring its state, calculating data, reporting the data and controlling its environment (modifying the temperature). Related work has focused on a battery model system which adapts to the current profile of the device, while this research focuses on the deployment of smarter batteries to self-manage lifetime.	block cipher mode of operation;cell (microprocessor);cell relay;safe operating area;simulation;software deployment;sustainable electronics;switching circuit theory;system safety	Obinna Okpokwasili;Saraju P.

7c863079fb137324c87091541fb9cd572731b2c3	graph logics with rational relations		We investigate some basic questions about the interaction of regular and rational relations on words. The primary motivation comes from the study of logics for querying graph topology, which have recently found numerous applications. Such logics use conditions on paths expressed by regular languages and relations, but they often need to be extended by rational relations such as subword or subsequence. Evaluating formulae in such extended graph logics boils down to checking nonemptiness of the intersection of rational relations with regular or recognizable relations (or, more generally, to the generalized intersection problem, asking whether some projections of a regular relation have a nonempty intersection with a given rational relation). We prove that for several basic and commonly used rational relations, the intersection problem with regular relations is either undecidable (e.g., for subword or suffix, and some generalizations), or decidable with non-primitive-recursive complexity (e.g., for subsequence and its generalizations). These results are used to rule out many classes of graph logics that freely combine regular and rational relations, as well as to provide the simplest problem related to verifying lossy channel systems that has non-primitive-recursive complexity. We then prove a dichotomy result for logics combining regular conditions on individual paths and rational relations on paths, by showing that the syntactic form of formulae classifies them into either efficiently checkable or undecidable cases. We also give examples of rational relations for which such logics are decidable even without syntactic	directed acyclic graph;lossy compression;primitive recursive function;rational set;recursion;regular expression;regular language;silicon controlled rectifier;substring;suffix tree;topological graph theory;undecidable problem;verification and validation	Pablo Barceló;Diego Figueira;Leonid Libkin	2013	Logical Methods in Computer Science	10.2168/LMCS-9(3:01)2013	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Logic	-4.2975441572699955	18.66429328163503	58779

An important query type that is the focal point in such application scenarios regards actuation queries, where proper action is dictated based on a trigger condition placed upon the current value that a monitored function receives. Recent work [Sharfman et al. 2006, 2007b, 2008] studies the problem of (nonlinear) sophisticated function tracking in a distributive manner. The main concept behind the geometric monitoring approach proposed there is for each distributed site to perform the function monitoring over an appropriate subset of the input domain. In the current work, we examine whether the distributed monitoring mechanism can become more efficient, in terms of the number of communicated messages, by extending the geometric monitoring framework to utilize prediction models. We initially describe a number of local estimators (predictors) that are useful for the applications that we consider and which have already been shown particularly useful in past work. We then demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating predictors in the geometric monitoring framework and show that prediction-based geometric monitoring in fact generalizes the original geometric monitoring framework. We propose a large variety of different prediction-based monitoring models for the distributed threshold monitoring of complex functions. Our extensive experimentation with a variety of real datasets, functions, and parameter settings indicates that our approaches can provide significant communication savings ranging between two times and up to three orders of magnitude, compared to the transmission cost of the original monitoring framework.	approximation algorithm;focal (programming language);nonlinear system;theory	Nikos Giatrakos;Antonios Deligiannakis;Minos N.

Here,   M(ƒ     ∗   )   denotes the 2  n   × 2  n  -matrix obtained by setting    M(ƒ     ∗   )     x,y   =  1 if ƒ(x,y)=1  −1 if ƒ(x,y)=0.    Further, we refer to the usual product of real matrices and vectors and denote by   ¦v¦   the Euclidean norm of real vectors  v . In this paper it will be shown by geometric arguments that for each function   ƒ: {0,1}     n    × {0,1}     n    → {0,1}   the following is true.    - The length of each probabilistic communication protocol which computes ƒ with error bounded by   1  2   −   1  s  ,  s   ϵ   N , can be estimated from below by   1  4  (n − log     2   ∥ƒ||−log     2    √s−2)  .    - The number of edges of any threshold circuit of depth two computing ƒ cannot be smaller than   2     n−1   ‖ƒ‖     #N# These results yield better lower bounds on probabilistic communication complexity as well as on the complexity of threshold circuits of depth two. Further, characterizing ∥ƒ∥ by the eigenvalues of   M(ƒ     ∗   )   we obtain a method to construct iteratively functions which are hard to compute in the above models. This implies lower bounds for decision problems that previous probabilistic techniques from Yao (1983), Halstenberg and Reischuk (1988) and Hajnal et al. (1987) cannot be applied to.	distributed computing	Matthias Krause	1996	Theor. Comput.

Biological neurons need more energy to transmit a ''spike'' than not to transmit one, and hence the energy complexity of a threshold circuit is defined as the number of gates in the circuit that output ''1'' during computation. Since the firing activity of neurons in the brain is quite sparse, the following question arises: what Boolean functions can or cannot be computed by threshold circuits with small energy complexity. In the paper, we partially answer the question, that is, we show that there exists a trade-off among three complexity measures of threshold circuits: the energy complexity, size, and depth. The trade-off implies an exponential lower bound on the size of constant-depth threshold circuits with small energy complexity for a large class of Boolean functions.

This added capability is shown to yeild the Boolean closure of the class of word relations defined by multitape finite automata. Several properties of this extended model are investigated. In particular it is shown that this model is incomparable to the nondeterministic multitape finite automata and is strictly weaker than two-way multitape finite automata.	automaton;finite-state machine;media controls	Arnold L.

def3039bae1266883b2b2022d09b3788ba5c9c95	approximating addition by xor: how to go all the way		In this paper, we study approximation of addition by XOR, taking P. Sarkar’s publication [1] as the reference work and starting point. In this work, among various results, it was claimed that explicit formulas seemed difficult to obtain when the number n of summands is more than 5. In the first part of our work, we show a systematic way to find explicit formulas: the complexity to compute them is O(n), which allows large values of n. We present some numerical computation and point out a conjectural observation on the coefficients. In the second part, we study a generalization of P. Sarkar’s work to q-ary addition, instead of binary. We show that the mechanics of the addition is essentially the same as in the binary case. In particular, sequence of carries behaves very similarly: it is a Markov chain whose transition matrix can be computed. Running some experiments on small values of n leads us to a conjecture, the first part of which is intuitive and the second part of which reveals an amazing coincidence (and is probably not!). Finally, in a section titled “very last news”, we refer to a paper published by Holte in 1997, that was brought to us after our first post and that we had missed before. It happens that this paper studies the topic and solves a major part of our open problems. Henceforth, the present post is an updated version of our previous “Approximating Addition by XOR: how to go (a little) further than P. Sarkar”, taking into account this previous Holte’s reference. 1 Cryptographic motivation As recalled in [1], cryptographic algorithm designers are particularly interested in non linear functions that are easy to compute. Arithmetic addition is a good candidate for them. For example its algebraic degree grows rapidly with respect to the bits of inputs. Famous algorithms, such as SHA-1 or SHA-2 involve arithmetic addition of more than 2 terms (up to 7 terms actually). General analysis of hash functions use approximation of addition by XOR, setting that the probability that both results are equal is 1/2. P. Sarkar’s work, for which we give some further result, essentially says that this approximation is asymptotically the right one.

The present paper is devoted to the class V‘. We show that it is related with the syntax of w-languages, is decidable with V, and can be easily described as in the case of locally and piecewise testable languages.	arnold;automata theory;automaton;congruence of squares;continuation;discrete mathematics;finite-state machine;john d. wiley;lecture notes in computer science;linear algebra;perrin number;stacs;springer (tank);switching circuit theory;syntactic monoid;x-machine	Jean-Pierre Pécuchet	1988	Theor.

In both cases, we get decidability for all hyperedge replacement graph grammars as inputs. Colorability, Hamiltonicity, and planarity are shown to be compatible so that our decidability results apply to them. Is there a graph in the generated language having the property?

Understanding time and memory consumption, and how they are related to one another, is therefore a question of considerable practical importance. In the field of proof complexity, these resources correspond to the length and space of resolution proofs for formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF). There has been a long line of research investigating these proof complexity measures, but while strong results have been established for length, our understanding of space and how it relates to length has remained quite poor. The key technical contribution of this paper is the following, somewhat surprising, theorem: Any CNF formula F can be transformed by simple substitution into a new formula F ′ such that if F has the right properties, F ′ can be proven in resolution in essentially the same length as F but the minimal space needed for F ′ is lower-bounded by the number of variables that have to be mentioned simultaneously in any proof for F . As immediate corollaries of this, we get simpler proofs for previously known optimal lower bounds for space and for the recent space-length separation in [Ben-Sasson and Nordström 2008]. Moreover, applying our theorem to so-called pebbling formulas defined in terms of pebble games on directed acyclic graphs, and then studying black-white pebblings on these graphs, we obtain a host of space-length trade-off results for space in the range from constant to O(n/ log log n), most of them superpolynomial or even exponential. ∗Research supported by the Israeli Science Foundation and by the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation. †Research supported in part by the Ericsson Research Foundation, the Foundation Olle Engkvist Byggmästare, and the Foundation Blanceflor Boncompagni-Ludovisi, née Bildt. ‡Part of this work performed while at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and while visiting the Technion.

As a continuation of automata theory based on complete residuated lattice-valued logic, in this paper, we mainly deal with the problem concerning pumping lemma in L-valued context-free languages (L-CFLs). As a generalization of the notion in the theory of formal grammars, the definition of L-valued context-free grammars (L-CFGs) is introduced. We also discuss a special case of L-CFGs, L-right (or left)-linear grammars, and show the equivalence between L-linear grammars and L-regular grammars. This result shows that we generalize the pumping lemma in L-valued regular languages (L-RLs) more recently established by the second author.	context-free grammar;context-free language;residuated lattice	Hongyan Xing;Daowen Qiu	2009	Fuzzy Sets and Systems	10.1016/j.fss.2008.06.016	indexed language;context-sensitive grammar;tree-adjoining grammar;indexed grammar;discrete mathematics;pumping lemma for regular languages;deterministic context-free grammar;information processing;phrase structure grammar;pumping lemma for context-free languages;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;context-free language;automaton;definite clause grammar;context-free grammar;embedded pushdown automaton;algorithm;fuzzy control system	NLP	-3.5841194847085345	20.804968949645854	61648

A composition table has been built for C2¢4; the table can be used by a path consistency algorithm, such as Alien’s, to propagate knowledge xpressed in the algebra as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). An important question which has not been answered so far is whether path consistency decides consistency for CZ.A atomic relations. We provide an example showing that the answer to the question is unfortunately negative: path consistency does not decide consistency for CZA atomic relations. We will then define an algebra of cyclic time points, C’P.A.. which, somehow, is for C~-.A what Vilain and Kautz’s linear time point algebra, 127~.A, is for 1277.4. C’PA is a subalgebra of CYCt, an algebra of ternary relations for cyclic ordering of 2D orientations also recently known in the literature. The pointisable part of CZA, i.e., the part one can translate into CPA, includes all atomic relations; from this, a complete solution search procedure for general CZ,4 CSPs derives, which uses results known for the algebra CYCt.	algorithm;constraint satisfaction problem;local consistency;ternary numeral system;time complexity	Amar Isli	2001			time complexity;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;local consistency;statistics	AI	6.398753635022181	19.011287714334593	62013

Since the sequential tree concatenation is not associative, we get two essentially different iterated sequential concatenation operations that we call the bottom-up star and top-down star operation, respectively. We establish that the worst-case state complexity of bottom-up star is (n + 3 2 ) · 2n−1. The bound differs by an order of magnitude from the corresponding result for string languages. The state complexity of top-down star is similar as in the string case. We consider also the state complexity of the star of the concatenation of a regular tree language with the set of all	best, worst and average case;bottom-up parsing;concatenation;iteration;kleene star;regular tree grammar;top-down and bottom-up design;tree automaton	Yo-Sub Han;Sang-Ki Ko;Xiaoxue Piao;Kai Salomaa	2015	Acta Cybern.	10.14232/actacyb.22.2.2015.11	combinatorics;mathematics;discrete mathematics;regular tree grammar;decision tree model;kleene star;formal language;state complexity	Logic	-1.3134071479920562	20.87592494572667	62033

We provide formal, recursive definitions of n-gram similarity and distance, together with efficient algorithms for computing them. We formulate a family of word similarity measures based on n-grams, and report the results of experiments that suggest that the new measures outperform their unigram equivalents.	algorithm;edit distance;experiment;grams;longest common subsequence problem;n-gram;recursion;string metric	Grzegorz Kondrak	2005		10.1007/11575832_13	case-based reasoning;semantic similarity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;edit distance;similarity;metric;string;computer science;similitude;longest common subsequence problem;normalized compression distance;formal specification;mathematics;programming language;distance;similarity;jaro–winkler distance;algorithm;string searching algorithm	DB	1.0317879982582316	19.246705466600158	62224

The classes are defined by logical means, relying on metafinite model theory for so called R-structures (see [11], [10]). More precisely, based on a real analogue of Fagin’s theorem [11] we deal with two classes MAX-NPR and MIN-NPR of maximization and minimization problems, respectively, and figure out their intrinsic logical structure. It is proven that MAX-NPR decomposes into four natural subclasses, whereas MIN-NPR decomposes into two. This gives a real number analogue of a result by Kolaitis and Thakur [12] in the Turing model. Our proofs mainly use techniques from [16]. Finally, approximation issues are briefly discussed.	acm turing award;apx;approximation algorithm;automated theorem proving;backtracking;computational complexity theory;descriptive complexity theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;max;maximal set;optimization problem;system of polynomial equations;time complexity	Uffe Flarup Hansen;Klaus Meer	2005		10.1007/11549345_40	optimization problem;minimisation;combinatorics;systems modeling;computer science;turing machine;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;algorithm;model theory	Theory	5.246807105101552	20.16142460250742	62940

Each solution is analyzed and the three methods arc compared in order to determine the conditions under which each is preferable t,o the others. The expected value of the time required to locate the desired record is used as the basis for comparison and evaluation. The problem being considered can be explicitly stated as follows: at the beginning of the problem, the tape being searched is positioned immediately after the N~th record; i.e. the N~th record has just been read into """"main"""" memory. The records are ordered in a known sequence. We are searching for a record e0n-raining given position-determining data. We therefore are able to determine the direction in which the desired record lies, but we do not know how far away it is. We have a tape handler which is capable of three movements: (1) reading forward one record, (2) backspacing one record (without reading), and (3) rewinding the tape to the first record. We will assume that after a read operation is performed, the direction to the desired t~eord can be determined in a negligible amount of time. Notation The symbols used are defined as follows: N~ we have just read the Nlth record at the start of the problem N~ we have just read the N~th record at an intermediate stage of the search-see text, method C n the desired record is the nth one in the file (n is in general unknown) P~ the probability distribution function of n E(n) the expected value of n R, R~ the mm~ber of records being backspaced in one group-see text, methods B and C C the number of backspace cycles required to locate the desired record r~ the number of read operations required to find the desired record after C backspace cycles have been performed t~ the time required to read one record G lhe time required to backspace one record t .... the time required to rewind over one record"""	computer data storage;media controls	R.

In this paper we improve the sufficient condition to P NP. More generally, in this paper we completely characterize which types of one-way functions stand or fall together with (plain) one-way functions-equivalently, stand or fall together with P NP. We look at the four attributes used in Rabi and Sherman's seminal work on algebraic properties of one-way functions (see [M. Rabi, A.

In this categorization there are 3^4=81 potential types of one-way functions. We prove that each of these 81 feature-laden types stands or falls together with the existence of (plain) one-way functions.	best, worst and average case;one-way function;operator associativity	Lane A.

A way of doing so, independent of any special properties that M might have, is to partition its states, inputs, and outputs into classes, collectively referred to as an abstraction. Since abstractions map many fsms into a non-deterministic machine defining an indistinguishability class, given a particular M, an optimal abstraction will minimize the size of this class. Algorithms for constructing such abstractions have been investigated in previous work.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we are interested in large fsms generated by some random procedure, and want to find abstractions that minimize the expected size of an indistinguishability class.

The MG representation can be used directly, so that even rather sophisticated analyses of properly non-CF languages can be defined very succinctly. As with the similar stack-based CFmethods, finite memory suffices for the recognition of infinite languages, and a fully connected left context for probabilistic analysis is available at every point.	a-normal form;finite-state machine;mg (editor);priority queue;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;stack-oriented programming language	Edward P.

From a practical viewpoint, it is beneficial to approximately solve CSPs. When one tries to approximate the total number of truth assignments that satisfy all Boolean constraints for (unweighted) Boolean CSPs, there is a known trichotomy theorem; namely, all such counting problems are neatly classified into three categories under polynomial-time approximation-preserving reductions. In contrast, we obtain a dichotomy theorem of approximate counting for complex-weighted Boolean CSPs, provided that all complex-valued unary constraints are freely available to use. The expressive power of those unary constraints enables us to prove a stronger, complete classification theorem. This makes a step forward in the quest for the approximation-complexity classification of all counting CSPs. To deal with complex weights, we employ proof techniques of factorization and arity reduction along the line of solving Holant problems. We introduce a novel notion of T-constructibility that naturally induces approximation-preserving reducibility. Our result also gives an approximation analogue of the dichotomy theorem on the complexity of exact counting for complex-weighted Boolean CSPs.	approximation algorithm;artificial intelligence;constraint satisfaction problem;cryptographic service provider;database theory;graph theory;holographic algorithm;polynomial;time complexity;unary operation	Tomoyuki Yamakami	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-18318-8_23	boolean circuit;and-inverter graph;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;boolean expression;#sat;graph theory;maximum satisfiability problem;mathematics;constraint satisfaction problem;algorithm;satisfiability	Theory	6.932394695925502	19.15450805524012	63859

Four descriptional complexity parameters are considered: the number of places, transitions, inhibitor arcs, and the maximal degree of a transition. Each of these parameters is aimed to be minimized, a special attention being given to the number of places. Four constructions are presented having the following values of parameters (listed in the above order): (5, 877, 1022, 729), (5, 1024, 1316, 379), (4, 668, 778, 555), and (4, 780, 1002, 299). The decrease of the number of places with respect to previous work is primarily due to the consideration of non-deterministic computations in Petri nets. Using equivalencies between models our results can be translated to multiset rewriting with forbidding conditions, or to P systems with inhibitors.	petri net	Sergiu Ivanov;Elisabeth Pelz;Sergey Verlan	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-09704-6_17	real-time computing;distributed computing;algorithm	Logic	-1.1182085918618092	21.006019180647545	63909

Given binary relations R,S, a componentwise reducibility is defined by R ≤ S ⇐⇒ ∃f ∀x, y [xRy ↔ f(x)Sf(y)]. Here f is taken from a suitable class of effective functions. For us the relations will be on natural numbers, and f must be computable. We show that there is a Π1-complete equivalence relation, but no Π 0 k-complete for k ≥ 2. We show that Σk preorders arising naturally in the abovementioned areas are Σk-complete. This includes polynomial time mreducibility on exponential time sets, which is Σ2, almost inclusion on r.e. sets, which is Σ3, and Turing reducibility on r.e. sets, which is Σ 0 4.	computability theory;computable function;computational complexity theory;exptime;polynomial;simulation preorder;time complexity;turing completeness;turing reduction	Egor Ianovski;Russell G.

This nicely contrasts the result on the effectiveness of the Higman-Haines sets for the family of context-free languages. The non-effectiveness is based on a non-recursive trade-off result between the language description mechanism of Church-Rosser languages and the corresponding Higman-Haines sets, which in turn is also valid for all supersets of the language family under consideration, and in particular for the family of recursively enumerable languages.

The most general models of restarting automata make use of auxiliary symbols in their rewrite operations, although this ability does not directly correspond to any aspect of the analysis by reduction. Here we put restrictions on the way in which restarting automata use auxiliary symbols, and we investigate the influence of these restrictions on their expressive power. In fact, we consider two types of restrictions. First, we consider the number of auxiliary symbols in the tape alphabet of a restarting automaton as a measure of its descriptional complexity. Secondly, we consider the number of occurrences of auxiliary symbols on the tape as a dynamic complexity measure. We establish some lower and upper bounds with respect to these complexity measures concerning the ability of restarting automata to recognize the (deterministic) context-free languages and some of their subclasses.	automaton;blum axioms;computational complexity theory;context-free language;descriptive complexity theory;expressive power (computer science);model of computation;natural language;rewrite (programming)	Tomasz Jurdzinski;Friedrich Otto	2006	Theor.

For DNF related problems, the complexity of the monotone case strongly differs from the arbitrary case. We show that it is DP-complete to check whether a monomial is a prime implicant for an arbitrary formula, but checking prime implicants for monotone formulas is in L. We show PP-completeness of checking whether the minimum size of a DNF for a monotone formula is at most k. For k in unary, we show the complexity of the problem to drop to coNP. In [Uma01] a similar problem for arbitrary formulas was shown to be Σp2-complete. We show that calculating the minimal DNF for a monotone formula is possible in output-polynomial time if and only if P = NP. Finally, we disprove a conjecture from [Rei03] by showing that checking whether two formulas are isomorphic has the same complexity for arbitrary formulas as for monotone formulas.	co-np;monomial;np-completeness;newton–cotes formulas;p versus np problem;time complexity;turing completeness;unary operation;monotone	Judy Goldsmith;Matthias Hagen;Martin Mundhenk	2005		10.1007/11549345_36	time complexity;implicant;boolean algebra;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;isomorphism;algorithm;algebra	Theory	5.304423540953926	21.142077273765015	64758

The present paper discusses the reduction of homogeneous grammars with respect to the number of non-context-free productions. More specifically, it demonstrates that for every phrase-structure grammar, there exists an equivalent homogeneous grammar that has only three non-context-free productions of the form 00→ e , 11→ e , and 22→ e .	context-free language	Alexander Meduna;Dusan Kolár	2002	Inf.

The behaviour of such an automaton is a mapping, called a formal power series, assigning to each word a weight in some semiring. We generalize Buchi's and Elgot's fundamental theorems to this quantitative setting. We introduce a weighted version of MSO logic and prove that, for commutative semirings, the behaviours of weighted automata are precisely the formal power series definable with particular sentences of our weighted logic. We also consider weighted first-order logic and show that aperiodic series coincide with the first-order definable ones, if the semiring is locally finite, commutative and has some aperiodicity property.	automata theory;automaton	Manfred Droste;Paul Gastin	2007	Theor.

In this case, y is at least as random as x. Thus, the S-reducibility classifies relative randomness of c.e. reals such that the c.e. random reals are complete in the class of c.e. reals under the S-reducibility. In this paper we investigate extensions of the S-reducibility outside the c.e. reals. We show that the straightforward extension does not behave satisfactorily. Then we introduce two new extensions which coincide with the S-reducibility on the c.e. reals and behave reasonably outside the c.e. reals. Both of these extensions imply the rH-reducibility of Downey, Hirschfeldt and LaForte [6]. At last we show that even under the rH-reducibility the computably approximable random reals cannot be characterized as complete elements of this reduction.	approximation algorithm;axiom of reducibility;existential theory of the reals;randomness;rod downey;solovay–strassen primality test	Xizhong Zheng;Robert Rettinger	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-27798-9_39	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	9.063837559449581	20.77812728045238	65708

The stack automaton has a two-way input tape, a finite control and a stack. The stack is similar to a push-down store, in that writing and erasing occur only at the top. However, the stack head may also move up or down the stack in a read only mode. Here, nonerasing stack automata only, are considered. These are stack automata that never erase a symbol from their stack. It is shown that the deterministic, nonerasing stack automaton is equivalent to a deterministic, off-line Turing machine whose storage tape never grows beyond n logz n cells where n is the length of the input. Also, it is shown that the nondeterministic, nonerasing stack automaton is equivalent to a nondeterministic off-line Turing machine whose tape never grows beyond n ~ cells.	automata theory;compiler;magnetic tape data storage;nondeterministic algorithm;online and offline;pushdown automaton;turing machine	John E.

Our algorithm automatically solves all the multi-party protocol problems addressed in complexity-based cryptography during the last 10 years. It actually is a completeness theorem for the class of distributed protocols with honest majority. Such completeness theorem is optimal in the sense that, if the majority of the players is not honest, some protocol problems have no efficient solution [C].	algorithm;cryptography;time complexity	Oded Goldreich;Silvio Micali;Avi Wigderson	1987		10.1145/28395.28420	combinatorics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;algorithm	Theory	8.074769920914767	24.298316220439112	65927

The importance of organisation of conventional arithmetical computations is determined by the next factors. The first one is methodological only. It is rather interesting to study the limits of applicability of the model in question. The second factor is theoretical. The proposed methods and algorithms make it possible to realize the original variants of specialised system productions. The novelty and originality consists in the unification of substitution rules and the program notion, in the nontraditionat data representation and, also, in taking into account cells failure. The third factor consists in the natural pragmatic desire to execute all operations prescribed by the method or algorithm, using simulation or image processing by means of the same processor. For example, if in the cellular algorithm simulation there is an arithmetical calculation, there is no sense to send it to another arithmetical processor. In our previous paper [1] the new realization of cellular methods of logical and arithmetical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division were proposed. In this paper the results of [1] are carried over the case, when some of the cells of automaton have limited possibilities of functioning. In practice this is expressesd in failure or malfunction of the corresponding ceils, and in theory these cells cannot be used otherwise as context for the identification of the fact of a cell defect the sign """"*"""" is used."""	algorithm;arithmetical hierarchy;automata theory;cellular automaton;computation;data (computing);image processing;simulation;software bug;unification (computer science)	V.

However, deploying additional WiFi hotspots that can provide both increased coverage and enhance user quality of service largely depends upon the number of access points already existing and user densities. Extracting usage patterns and information from the available data has the potential to answer several business-focussed questions. In this paper, we show that by plotting WiFi locations in a two-dimensional space of incoming (downloading) and outgoing (uploading) data amount, in conjunction with the simple k-means clustering, it is possible to gain insight into the basic data usage patterns. When combined with information about geographic location of the WiFi hotspots such analysis can answer questions related to spatial patterns of data usage and make informed business decisions including charging customers at selected locations for WiFi service.	cluster analysis;download;email;geographic coordinate system;hotspot (wi-fi);internet;k-means clustering;quality of service;upload;wireless access point;world wide web	Deepali Arora;Stephen W.

Recently, major progress was made by Lovett who proved that the communication complexity is bounded by O( √ r · log r). Lovett’s proof is based on known estimates on the discrepancy of low-rank matrices. We give a simple, direct proof based on a hyperplane rounding argument that in our opinion sheds more light on the reason why a root factor suffices and what is necessary to improve on this factor.	communication complexity;discrepancy function;low-rank approximation;memory bound function;rounding	Thomas Rothvoß	2014	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	9.64290923795422	20.51185553140597	66218

The purpose of this study is to explore the application of wireless monitoring technology in industry. Since that it is at the stage of research feasibility, various sensors used for the applications select the level limited to the ordinary teaching using sensor. AGV uses vehicle manipulator developed by Wuhan Depushi Technology Company and some sensors are simulated. The results of simple basic experiments showed that the wireless module can achieve point to multipoint communication.

The basis of all these methods is to show that rewriting preserves regular languages. To this end, letters are annotated with natural numbers, called match heights. If the minimal height of all positions in a redex is h then every position in the reduct will get height h + 1. In a match-bounded system, match heights are globally bounded. Using recent results on deleting systems, we prove that rewriting by a match-bounded system preserves regular languages. Hence it is decidable whether a given rewriting system has a given match bound. We also provide a sufficient criterion for the absence of a match-bound. The problem of existence of a match-bound is still open. Match-boundedness for all strings can be used as an automated criterion for termination, for match-bounded systems are terminating. This criterion can be strengthened by requiring match-boundedness only for a restricted set of strings, for instance the set of right hand sides of forward closures.	application domain;automata theory;computation;decision problem;eisenstein's criterion;finite-state machine;information flow (information theory);match moving;memory bound function;newman's lemma;pushdown automaton;reachability;reduction strategy (code optimization);regular language;rewrite (programming);rewrite order;rewriting;semi-thue system;simulation;stack (abstract data type);termination analysis	Alfons Geser;Dieter Hofbauer;Johannes Waldmann	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45138-9_39	decidability;integer;discrete mathematics;letter;string;rewriting;computer science;mathematics;programming language;confluence;algorithm	Logic	-4.257510645757781	20.19828357012741	66486

OPC standard supports the group of specifications known as OPC-Data Access (OPC-DA), OPC-Historical Data Access (OPC-HDA) and OPC-Unified Architecture (OPC-UA). In this paper, the vibration and acoustic data of an air-compressor have been recorded through accelerometer and microphone, respectively. The data is continuously monitored and archived through OPC. The sensing units are placed on predefined sensitive positions of air-compressor to record the data. The MATLAB based platform interacts with OPC server for reading and writing of data acquired from field devices. The recorded data is used for real-time monitoring and fault recognition in air-compressor. The National Instruments (NI) based four channel Data Acquisition (DAQ) module, channel input module: NI9234 and USB chassis: NIcDAQ-9171, is used for connection of sensing units. For experimental analysis, a Matrikon OPC server (2.0.0.5529) is used.

We present several lower and upper bounds for time, space and cooperation (communication) complexity measures for CDGSs that emerge from these simulations. It is widely known that the class of languages recognizable by BWBPs equals the NC1 class, i.e., the class of languages recognizable by fan-in two, logarithmic-depth and polynomial-size uniform Boolean circuits. With respect to this result and the simulations presented in this paper, the class of the Szilard languages associated to derivations in CDGSs are related to the NC1 class.	binary decision diagram;boolean circuit;chomsky hierarchy;communication complexity;computation;fan-in;formal grammar;grammar systems theory;model of computation;nc (complexity);polynomial;simulation	Liliana Cojocaru	2007	Ninth International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC 2007)	10.1109/SYNASC.2007.76	context-sensitive grammar;boolean circuit;tree-adjoining grammar;discrete mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;context-free grammar;programming language;algorithm;algebra	Theory	8.616827830832671	22.736042118662596	66613

This algorithm was first discussed by Knuth [6]; since then formal developments have been given by Dijkstra [4] and Dromey [5], among many others. The novel aspects of the present treatment are: (i) the result is expressed as a (very short) functional program; and (ii) the derivation makes use of the calculus of lists described by Bird [ 11. In order to make this paper as self-contained as possible, we shall indicate the concepts and notations of [l] used in our derivation as we go along. However, we do assume some familiarity with the basic ideas of functional programming. (For an introduction to functional programming, see Bird and Wadler [3].) The calculus of lists is based on the definition of lists as an algebraic structure (actually, a monoid) under the primitive operation of concatenation, denoted by the sign *.

The smart battery charging voltage and current can be adjusted according to different ambient temperatures to provide a safe operation. In addition, the current battery status and warning message can be transmitted through wireless message transmission to a smartphone. The user can use the application on the open platform of the smartphone which receives the smart battery's real-time status. If the smart battery has an abnormal status, the abnormal status notification will be sent to the smartphone. Because the different batteries may have different battery characteristics, the charging procedure needs to be in keeping with the battery characteristics in order to set the appropriate parameters. This design also provides for the user to set the charging parameter values.	open platform;real-time clock;smart battery charger;smartphone	Ying-Wen Bai;Hao-Ting Huang	2017	2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229289	open platform;embedded system;voltage;battery (electricity);smart battery;bluetooth;wireless;transmission (mechanics);computer science	Visualization	1.1273821068028451	32.07942977670738	66767

This system consists of data collection layer, processing layer, and presentation layer. Each radar station is installed with MD-3641/3642 radar. Using the 16-bits SCM PIC24 as CPU, an embedded hardware based on ETX PC is designed for radar telemetry. A logic diagram for the embedded radar controller is illustrated. Internet communication technology is adopted to complete the data transmission between center and radar station. A target echo identifying algorithm is presented to denoise the radar image and compute the accurate position of the objects overlaid on the electronic charts. Applied result shows that these techniques and approaches are efficient and feasible.	radar	Jiangling Hao;Mingyang Pan;Deqiang Wang;Lining Zhao;Depeng Zhao	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11194-0_34	the internet;electronic engineering;diagram;control theory;computer science;radar imaging;distributed computing;presentation layer;data transmission;radar;telemetry	EDA	0.8573682919179128	30.041578844741146	66974

The uSDCard, as the middle layer, connects the smart phone with the ZigBee compatible devices. The smart phone, as the terminal, processes data and manages the TelosB Motes. We use the smart phone as the final terminal because it has a rich set of user interfaces and has access to various kinds of networks, allowing our system to be extended more easily and more user-friendly.

aff13832656fe51e655eaf2cbdc7a83f7d4b539d	one-way bounded-error probabilistic pushdown automata and kolmogorov complexity - (preliminary report)		One-way probabilistic pushdown automata (or ppda’s) are a simple model of randomized computation with last-in first-out memory device known as stacks and, when error probabilities are bounded away from 1 / 2, ppda’s can characterize a family of bounded-error probabilistic context-free languages (BPCFL). We resolve a fundamental question raised by Hromkovic and Schnitger [Inf. Comput. 208 (2010) 982–995] concerning the limitation of the language recognition power of bounded-error ppda’s. More specifically, we prove that a well-known language—the set of palindromes—cannot be recognized by any bounded-error ppda; in other words, this language stays outside of BPCFL. Furthermore, we show that, with bounded-error probability, no ppda can determine whether the center bit of input string is 1 (one). For those impossibility results, we utilize a complexity measure of algorithmic information known as Kolmogorov complexity. In our proofs, we first transform ppda’s into an ideal shape and then lead to a key lemma by employing a Kolmogorov complexity argument.	deterministic pushdown automaton;kolmogorov complexity;stack (abstract data type)	Tomoyuki Yamakami	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-62809-7_27	discrete mathematics;deterministic context-free grammar;nested word;deterministic pushdown automaton;embedded pushdown automaton;combinatorics;kolmogorov complexity;probabilistic logic;pushdown automaton;bounded function;computer science	Theory	0.9935044708523769	21.884384003236843	68528
96a89225ca0637a1dd71ded0c39784644b45009c	finite state incompressible infinite sequences	normality	In this paper we define and study finite state complexity dips in infinite sequences and finite state incompressible infinite sequences. We show that the finite state complexity does not only depend on the codes for finite transducers, but also on how the codes are mapped to transducers. As a consequence we relate the finite state complexity to the plain (Kolmogorov) complexity, to the process complexity and to prefix complexity. Working with prefix-free sets of codes we characterise Martin-Löf random sequences in terms of finite state complexity: the weak power of finite transducers is compensated by the high complexity of enumeration of finite transducers. We also prove that every finite state incompressible sequence is normal, but the converse implication is not true. These results also show that our definition of finite state incompressibility is stronger than all other known forms of finite automata based incompressibility in particular the notion related to finite automaton based betting systems introduced in [25]. The paper concludes with a discussion of open questions.		Cristian S.

Our results identify a sufficient condition for a language to be low for PP, and we show that this condition is at least as weak as other previously studied criteria. We extend a result of Köbler et al. by proving that all sparse co-C = P languages are in APP, and are thus PP-low. Our results also imply that AWPP ⊂eq APP, and thus APP contains many other established subclasses of PP-low, thereby reducing several different lowness results to membership in APP. We also show that AWPP and APP are Σ 0 2 -definable classes. Some of our results are reminiscent of amplifying certainty in probabilistic computation.	awpp (complexity);bqp;computation;error detection and correction;gapp;pp (complexity);probabilistic turing machine;sparse matrix	Stephen A.

0c7b97f15a53d9e1a71bf6cc7c3f9da359a26b38	flattening in (tissue) p systems	settore inf 01 informatica	One of the main ideas of membrane systems as introduced by Gheorghe Păun in [7] is the distributed way of computation in the different membrane regions of a membrane system. On the other hand, even for the original variant of membrane systems using catalysts it has been shown that all computations can be carried out in only one single membrane for getting computational completeness (see [3]). Using the idea of flattening which we are going to discuss in this note, especially for P systems working in the sequential transition mode, one often can show that the number of membranes does not matter; for example, as is well known, with transition P systems using only non-cooperative rules one can characterize the family of Parikh sets of regular languages, no matter how many membranes are used. Whereas without any doubt for communication P systems, where computations are carried out by moving objects through membranes, the underlying membrane structure of a P system or the underlying graph structure of a tissue P system will always play an essential role, in the case of transition P systems or tissue P systems with evolution rules a flattening procedure may allow for reducing the number of membranes or cells to one, i.e., to pure multiset rewriting, without changing the main concept for the computational power of such systems. Yet depending on the exact definitions of how these systems are supposed to use their rules and how to get the final results, specific issues have to be discussed carefully. This note addresses to experts in the area of P systems; hence, in general we only refer the reader to [8] and the P page [9] for specific notions and results used or stated afterwards. Formal definitions for a general model of static (tissue) P systems can be found in [5], a formal framework for dynamically evolving structures in [4].	computation;directed graph;formal system;gheorghe păun;p system;regular language;rewriting	Rudolf Freund;Alberto Leporati;Giancarlo Mauri;Antonio E.

In the our previous work, the couple RFID passive tags were installed on motorcycles to detect the larceny conditions. The main problem was found in the last experiments that the RFID tags attached with the ignition key cannot be hung flexibly. Therefore, the BLE4.0, which is the low-power-consumption device, is dangle on the motorcycle's key and the RFID tags is installed on the bike's hidden body. The anti lost devices have been applied for responsibility of BLE-tags slave mode, installed on a key. The HM-11 BLE 4.0 module combination with an Arduino board has a function as the master mode, reading the MAC address (called ID) of BLE slave devices. The results show that the maximum distance, in which the BLE master module can detect the BLE slave's ID, is approximately 18 meters. The proposed method is reliable because the BLE devices can be hung on the key together while the motorbike is running on the speed not over than 80km/hr. Finally, the experimental results guarantee that, when relatively compared with the previous method, accuracy of the MATS is improved efficiently; moreover, this proposed system can actually be used in the real situation at the Prachinburi province, Thailand.	apple id;arduino;bluetooth;experiment;larceny;low-power broadcasting;mac address;radio-frequency identification;sensor	Wittaya Koodtalang;Thaksin Sangsuwan	2016	2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)	10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824705	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Mobile	-0.7130709853119261	31.397611157536886	69312

d5ac8a7d2836adf7a3a3f3e928da28871de48256	estimation of physical buildings parameters using interval thermostat data		Significant energy savings can be achieved by retrofitting the enclosures and HVAC systems of existing residential buildings. Identification of building retrofit opportunities currently requires on-site energy assessments that are inconvenient to homeowners, expensive, and are of variable accuracy, making it challenging to deliver cost-effective retrofit opportunities at scale. Massive deployment of communicating thermostats provides a possibility for remote energy assessment by analyzing the associated interval indoor temperature and heating system run-time data. In this paper, we present a methodology to estimate the overall building insulation level, HVAC system efficiency, and building airtightness from the communicating thermostat data. The methodology uses a grey-box model of a residential building and includes identification of basic model parameters, followed by estimation and non-parametric modeling of generally variable external and internal heat gains/losses. In this way, it is also possible to predict indoor temperature and energy consumption of the building under various retrofit scenarios and user behaviors. Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.	interval arithmetic;machine learning;realms of the haunting;software deployment;system identification	Amine Lazrak;Michael Zeifman	2017		10.1145/3137133.3137161	heating system;architectural engineering;building insulation;thermostat;software deployment;energy consumption;hvac;building airtightness;retrofitting;engineering	HCI	4.363282379401122	30.617079482537687	69466

We consider the case where some vertices are designated as being final and we built, in a breadth-first manner, a marking of edges that lead to such vertices (i.e., for every vertex that can reach a final one, we mark all out-going edges laying on some shortest path to a final vertex). Our main result is that the edge-marked version of a pushdown graph may itself no longer be a pushdown graph, as we prove that this enrich graph may have an undecidable MSO theory.

The system proposed collects the data on pricing published by the Spanish Electrical Grid and analyzes them to determine the operation time intervals with the lowest prices. To this end, it was developed an auto-configurable easy-to-deploy system based on intelligent power outlets that connect to each other through a shared Wi-Fi network. Such a system is able to measure the current of the appliances connected to them by means of current intensity sensors. The collected data are sent to a central control device that generates statistics and performs actions depending on such data. Thanks to the system, electricity consumption can be collected easily and monitored through a user-friendly interface to enhance price-aware decision-making for the demand side under the Internet of Energy (IoE) paradigm.	auto-configuration;cipher;experiment;https;hypertext transfer protocol;internet of things;mesh networking;open-source software;operation time;programming paradigm;prototype;real-time web;scheduling (computing);self-organization;sensor;software development;usability;user (computing)	Óscar Blanco-Novoa;Tiago M.

For the active control of additional weight carried by overloaded vehicles, essential IT technologies such as sensors, measurement, and data processing have been applied. The integration of vehicle load monitoring systems with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology has a possibility of reducing installation efforts and costs, and enabling the quick and easy configuration of data acquisition and control systems. In this paper, we try to verify that WSN technology can replace the wiring sensor applications for vehicle monitoring issues. The WSN-based system includes: inclinometer sensors which measure variation of inclination values with load changes;, an Access Point (AP) that logs the data collected from all these sensors;, and a weight estimation algorithm. To reach the goal, we performed an experiment with real deployment and estimated the weight of trucks with an error of less than 3%. The result shows that it is possible to adopt WSN for commercial vehicle load monitoring.	algorithm;control system;data acquisition;human body weight;sensor;software deployment;wiring	Ji-Eun Jung;Byunghun Song;Sooyeol Park	2011	SIGBED Review	10.1145/2095256.2095260	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;data processing;computer science;control system;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security	Embedded	1.3816425870412534	30.58360666059964	70544

However, in all cases, these results were obtained by making use of several powerful features, such as membrane polarization, label changing, division of non-elementary membranes, priorities, or cooperative rules. This paper contributes to the research effort of introducing a class of P systems with active membranes having none of the features mentioned above, but still preserving the power and the efficiency. The additional feature we consider instead are the operations of endocytosis and exocytosis: moving a membrane inside a neighboring membrane, or outside the membrane where it is placed. We investigate the power and the efficiency of these systems (also using membrane division) by first proving that they can simulate (with a linear slowdown and without introducing non-determinism) rewriting P systems with 2-replication, for which the universality and the possibility of solving NP-complete problems in polynomial time are known. In this way, the universality and efficiency are also obtained for our systems. We also give a direct and simple proof for the universality result – without using division rules (the proof uses nine membranes, but we do not know whether this number can be decreased).	algorithmic efficiency;karp's 21 np-complete problems;membrane computing;p system;polarization (waves);polynomial;rewriting;simulation;time complexity;turing completeness;universal turing machine;universality probability	Shankara Narayanan Krishna;Gheorghe Paun	2005	Natural Computing	10.1007/s11047-005-3771-7	time complexity;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;np-complete;computer science;turing machine;membrane computing;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm;p system	AI	1.5321531792883873	24.656925624592933	71453

Then, a new method of achieving the characterization of the family of recursively enumerable languages by scattered context grammars is given; in fact, this family is characterized by scattered context grammars with only five nonterminals and a single erasing production. Finally, it is demonstrated that the number of nonterminals can be decreased by one in the present characterizations if scattered context grammars start their derivations from a word rather than a single symbol.	recursively enumerable language;terminal and nonterminal symbols	Alexander Meduna	1995	Acta Informatica	10.1007/BF01178263	natural language processing;context-sensitive grammar;tree-adjoining grammar;indexed grammar;complexity;l-attributed grammar;phrase structure grammar;computer science;philosophy of language;parsing;mathematics;programming language;algorithm	PL	-1.4630950308188935	18.704173331312177	71629

This introductory tutorial illustrates the basics, providing useful examples of quantum computations: elementary operations in single-qubit, two-qubit and three-qubit systems, immersions of gates on higher dimensional spaces, generation of single and multi-qubit states, procedures to synthesize unitary, controlled and diagonal matrices. To perform the analysis of quantum processes, we directly derive diagrams of states from physical implementations of quantum circuits associated to the processes. Complete diagrams are then rearranged into simplified diagrams, to visualize the overall effects of computations. Conversely, diagrams of states help to conceive new quantum algorithms, by schematically describing desired manipulations of quantum information with intuitive diagrams and then by guessing the equivalent complete diagrams, from which the corresponding quantum circuit is obtained effortlessly.

Central to our approach is the notion of a test setwhich can be used to verify that a given nondeterministic polynomial-time machine obeys the promise on a given input. Basically, we show that a promise class C has a many-one complete language if and only if there is a test set forC which has a p-optimal proof system. As an application we are able to improve earlier results. For example, we show that NP\co-NP has a many-one complete language, provided that the set TAUT of all valid boolean formulas as well as the set SAT of all satisfiable boolean formulas have p-optimal proof systems. We also apply the result to other classes and show, for example, that the probabilistic complexity classes BPP, RP , andZPP have many-one complete languages, provided that the setTAUT2 of all valid 2-formulas in quantified propositional logic has a p-optimal proof system. Finally it is shown that already a collapse of tally sets at the double exponential time level implies the existence of a (p-)optimal proof system for TAUT.	bpp (complexity);complexity class;exptime;many-one reduction;np (complexity);proof calculus;propositional calculus;rp (complexity);randomized algorithm;test set;time complexity	Johannes Köbler;Jochen Messner	1998		10.1109/CCC.1998.694599	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;logic;algorithm	Theory	8.269228270954025	21.31464121793923	71885
2b380b31624ad6d32a672fc546302c58d6b8a7be	a generalised twinning property for minimisation of cost register automata*	minimisation;weighted automata;twinning property;cost register automata	Weighted automata (WA) extend finite-state automata by associating with transitions weights from a semiring S, defining functions from words to S. Recently, cost register automata (CRA) have been introduced as an alternative model to describe any function realised by a WA by means of a deterministic machine. Unambiguous WA over a monoid (M, ⊗) can equivalently be described by cost register automata whose registers take their values in M, and are updated by operations of the form x: = y ⊗ c, with c ∈ M. This class is denoted by CRA⊗c(M).  We introduce a twinning property and a bounded variation property parametrised by an integer k, such that the corresponding notions introduced originally by Choffrut for finite-state transducers are obtained for k = 1. Given an unambiguous weighted automaton W over an infinitary group (G, ⊗) realizing some function f, we prove that the three following properties are equivalent: i) W satisfies the twinning property of order k, ii) f satisfies the k-bounded variation property, and iii) f can be described by a CRA⊗c(G) with at most k registers.  In the spirit of tranducers, we actually prove this result in a more general setting by considering machines over the semiring of finite sets of elements from (G, ⊗): the three properties are still equivalent for such finite-valued weighted automata, that is the ones associating with words subsets of G of cardinality at most ℓ, for some natural ℓ. Moreover, we show that if the operation ⊗ of G is commutative and computable, then one can decide whether a WA satisfies the twinning property of order k. As a corollary, this allows to decide the register minimisation problem for the class CRA⊗c(G).  Last, we prove that a similar result holds for finite-valued finite-state transducers, and that the register minimisation problem for the class CRA.c (B*) is Pspace-complete.	automaton;bounded variation;computable function;credit bureau;finite-state machine;finite-state transducer;pspace-complete	Laure Daviaud;Pierre-Alain Reynier;Jean-Marc Talbot	2016	2016 31st Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)	10.1145/2933575.2934549	minimisation;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Logic	1.678411528807289	20.04757937480696	71924

Furthermore, it shows through theoretical analysis and experiments that the special structure of the constructed automata does, in quite a general way, render the usual upper bounds on automata operations vastly overpessimistic.	algorithm;automata theory;automaton;experiment;finite-state machine;powerset construction;presburger arithmetic;quadratic function;quantifier (logic);time complexity;tree accumulation;well-formed formula	Pierre Wolper;Bernard Boigelot	2000		10.1007/3-540-46419-0_1	time complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;continuous spatial automaton;quantum finite automata;computer science;nested word;deterministic automaton;automata theory;ω-automaton;mathematics;automaton;upper and lower bounds;mobile automaton;algorithm	Logic	-2.3500434158901635	20.262370129283333	71942

We study the phase transition associated with random QSAT instances. We focus on a certain subclass of closed quantified Boolean formulas that can be seen as quantified extended 2-CNF formulas. The evaluation problem for this class is coNP-complete. We carry out an advanced practical and theoretical study, which illuminates the influence of the different parameters used to define random quantified instances.	boolean algebra	Nadia Creignou;Hervé Daudé;Uwe Egly;Raphaël Rossignol	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-79719-7_5	phase transition;true quantified boolean formula;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;maximum satisfiability problem;mathematics;linguistics;algorithm;satisfiability	AI	7.665578538369759	19.55170793023034	72067

We consider two cases of interest, the rst when the length of communication between the players is bounded and the second if it is not. While in the rst case we can carry over the relations between the corresponding Turing complexity classes, in the second case we observe in contrast with Turing complexity that a one round Merlin-Arthur protocol is as powerful as a general interactive proof system and, in particular, can simulate a one-round Arthur-Merlin protocol. Moreover, we show that sometimes a Merlin-Arthur protocol can be more eecient than an Arthur-Merlin protocol, and than a Merlin-Arthur protocol with limited communication. This is the case for a boolean function whose set of zeroes is a code with high minimum distance and a natural uniformity condition. Such functions provide an example when the Merlin-Arthur complexity is 1 with one-sided error 2 (2 3 ; 1), but at the same time the nondeterministic decision tree complexity is (n). The latter should be contrasted with another fact we prove. Namely, if a function has Merlin-Arthur complexity 1 with one-sided error probability 2 (0; 2 3 ], then its nondeterministic complexity is bounded by a constant. Other results of the paper include connections with the block sensitivity and related combinatorial properties of a boolean function.	arthur–merlin protocol;circuit complexity;complexity class;computation;decision tree model;existential quantification;interactive proof system;monte carlo algorithm;non-deterministic turing machine;proof calculus;simulation;social inequality	Ran Raz;Gábor Tardos;Oleg Verbitsky;Nikolai K.

Since that time, only two explicit universal Chaitin machines have been proposed, both by Chaitin himself. Concrete algorithmic information theory involves the study of particular universal Turing machines, about which one can state theorems with specific numerical bounds, rather than include terms like O(1). We present several new tiny Chaitin machines (those with a prefix-free domain) suitable for the study of concrete algorithmic information theory. One of the machines, which we call Keraia, is a binary encoding of lambda calculus based on a curried lambda operator. Source code is included in the appendices. We also give an algorithm for restricting the domain of blank-endmarker machines to a prefix-free domain over an alphabet that does not include the endmarker; this allows one to take many universal Turing machines and construct universal Chaitin machines from them."""	64-bit computing;advanced intelligent tape;algorithm;algorithmic information theory;algorithmically random sequence;binary file;boundary element method;chaitin's constant;combinatory logic;computable function;computation;concrete mathematics: a foundation for computer science;currying;lambda calculus;lisp machine;numerical analysis;omega;programming language;register machine;time complexity;universal turing machine	Michael A.

Existing centralized monitoring stations, however, are unable to properly estimate human exposure due to the low resolution spatiotemporal data. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) uses real-time capable instrumentation could not only provide fine-grained readings of multiple environmental factors, but also create real-time mapping of the contaminants. In this paper we present a WSN system which is capable of sensing multiple environmental factors, collecting data from multiple dispersed sensor nodes and displaying the aggregated data in real-time. Each individual sensor node is capable of probing multiple factors, including temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, PM2.5, UV radiation, and geographical location. Sensor data are transmitted to a server, which then be stored into a database through Wi-Fi networks. Each sensor node is portable enough to be carried for personal use, enabling broad potential application of our system.	centralized computing;image resolution;location (geography);real-time clock;sensor node;server (computing)	Rita Tse;Yubin Xiao	2016	2016 IEEE 17th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2016.7523588	sensor web;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;environmental monitoring;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	2.268540639197049	30.93357198689334	72560

This was a static analysis, and empirical investigations were used to connect formal results to performance. Here we replace this experimentation with an introductory runtime analysis of performance. We study a base-line, unbiased modularization that makes use of a complete module set (CMS), with special focus on strings that grow logarithmically with the problem size. We learn that even unbiased modularizations can have profound effects on problem performance. Our (1+1) CMS-EA optimizes a generalized OneMax problem in Ω(n2) time, provably worse than a (1+1) EA. More generally, our (1+1) CMS-EA optimizes a particular class of concatenated functions in O(2lm k n) time, where lm is the length of module strings and k is the number of module positions, when the modularization is aligned with the problem separability. We compare our results to known results for traditional EAs, and develop new intuition about modular encapsulation. We observe that search in the CMS-EA is essentially conducted at two levels (intra- and extra-module) and use this observation to construct a module trap, requiring super-polynomial time for our CMS-EA and O(n ln n) for the analogous EA.	analysis of algorithms;concatenation;encapsulation (networking);like button;linear separability;static program analysis;time complexity;unbiased rendering	R.

The formal language of scheduling events cannot be speciied by BNF grammars, but we use instead the Augmented BNF grammars, which combine breadth{ rst and depth-rst derivations. Their recognizers feature one or more FIFO or LIFO tapes. The basic scheduling policies are covered: FCFS, time-slicing, mutex. Combined policies, such as readers/writers and back-ground/foreground, are obtainable by composition. Constraints on the minimum number of data structures (i.e. queues) for priority scheduling policies may be proved by using a pumping lemma. The construction of schedule checkers is presented in the form of augmented LL(1) parsers. For scheduling algorithms, such as shortest job rst, which depend on parameters and in particular on time, a syntax-directed approach is proposed , which adds semantic attributes and functions to the underlying augmented BNF grammar.	algorithm;beta normal form;compiler;data structure;fifo (computing and electronics);finite-state machine;formal language;mutual exclusion;parsing;pumping (computer systems);pumping lemma for context-free languages;scheduling (computing);time slicing (digital broadcasting)	Luca Breveglieri;Stefano Crespi-Reghizzi;Alessandra Cherubini	1999		10.1007/3-540-48321-7_12	fair-share scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;operating system;machine learning;database;mathematics;distributed computing;semantics;programming language;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;algorithm	AI	-3.4332047191401545	23.64490737908034	72713

Our model of quantum broadcast channel is new. (2) We discovered that quantum broadcast is essentially a combination of pairwise quantum channels and a classical broadcast channel. This is a somewhat surprising conclusion, but helps us in both our lower and upper bounds. (3) We provide tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal bias /spl epsiv/ of a coin which can be flipped by k parties of which exactly g parties are honest: for any 1 /spl les/ g /spl les/ k, /spl epsiv/ = 1/2 - /spl Theta/ (g/k). Thus, as long as a constant fraction of the players are honest, they can prevent the coin from being fixed with at least a constant probability. This result stands in sharp contrast with the classical setting, where no non-trivial coin-flipping is possible when g /spl les/ k/2.	quantum channel	Andris Ambainis;Harry Buhrman;Yevgeniy Dodis;Hein Röhrig	2004	Proceedings. 19th IEEE Annual Conference on Computational Complexity, 2004.	10.1109/CCC.2004.1313848	game theory;communications protocol;combinatorics;quantum information science;computer cluster;quantum t-design;computer science;theoretical computer science;quantum capacity;quantum pseudo-telepathy;probability;mathematics;quantum channel;upper and lower bounds;quantum computer;classical capacity;quantum algorithm;physics;algorithm;quantum mechanics	Theory	8.434742307117673	24.807455044583623	74395

This relation is carried out taking into account the discreteness in the dynamics of both PN and CA. In particular, generalized PN as well as one-dimensional CA are used. The work consists in modeling with PN both a single process with a shared resource and two parallel processes with several shared resources. The PN models are simplified by reduction rules and then the corresponding one-dimensional CA is obtained. Finally, the global dynamics of the FMS modeled is described by using the analysis methods of CA.	automata theory;cellular automaton;deadlock;diagram;dynamical system;lambda calculus;petri net	Irving Barragán;Juan Carlos Seck Tuoh Mora;Joselito Medina	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-37798-3_30	cellular automaton;computer science;artificial intelligence;petri net;algorithm	Robotics	-4.1502177292190865	27.39469900504939	74663

By dividing a two dimensional space into tiles, a system can allow users to specify regions of interest using a query rectangle and then retrieving all information related to tiles overlapping with the query. In this paper, we derive the necessary and suucient conditions for strictly optimal allocations of two-dimensional data. These methods, when they exist, guarantee that for any query, the minimum number of tiles are assigned the same storage device, and hence ensures maximal retrieval concurrency.	concurrency (computer science);information retrieval;mathematical optimization;maximal set;region of interest	Khaled A.

Section I contains a method of constructing a finite deterministic machine (if one exists) which is expectation equivalent to a given probabilistic sequential machine {Theorem 1.3 and Theorem 1.7). In Section II the method is extended giving invariant subspace conditions for the existence of an input-state calculable (deterministic transitions but random output) machine which has the same first N central moments of output as a given probabilisfic sequential machine (Theorems 2.4 and 2.5). The common practice of using behaviorally equivalent machines as interchangeable submachines of other machines is formalized in Section I I I . Indistinguishability is the only equivalence which meets the interchangeability condition (Theorem 3.4). It is also proven that some finite deterministic machine can distinguish between two tape equivalent machines which are not expectation equivalent (Theorem 3.2). Section IV provides bounds ell the length of input strings necessary for deciding whether the following relations hold between arbitrary members of their domains: ---E (Theorem 4.3), ~ . (Theorem 4.5), the reduction relations RE (Theorem 4.4) and R.v (Corollary 4.5).	computability;turing completeness	Carl V.

Probabilistic martingales can simulate the “betting games” of [BMR98], and can cover the same class that a “natural proof” diagonalizes against, as implicitly already shown in [RSC95]. The notion would become a full-fledged measure on bounded-error complexity classes such as BPP and BPE if it could be shown to satisfy the “measure conservation” axiom of [Lut92] for these classes. We give a sufficient condition in terms of simulation by “decisive” probabilistic martingales that implies not only measure conservation, but also a much tighter bounded error probabilistic time hierarchy than is currently known. In particular it implies BPTIME[O(n)] 6= BPP, which would stand in contrast to recent claims of an oracleA giving BPTIME[O(n)] = BPP. This paper also makes new contributions to the problem of defining measure on P a d other sub-exponential classes. Probabilistic martingales are demonstrably stronger than deterministic martingales in the sub-exponential case.	approximation;bpp (complexity);complexity class;computing the permanent;deterministic algorithm;natural proof;p (complexity);randomized algorithm;simulation;time complexity;viz: the computer game	Kenneth W.

In this paper we examine the structure of classes in between NC and L based on counting functions or, equivalently, based on arithmetic circuits. The classes PNC and C=NC , defined by a test for positivity and a test for zero, respectively, of arithmetic circuit families of logarithmic depth, sit in this complexity interval. We study the landscape of Boolean hierarchies, constant-depth oracle hierarchies, and logarithmic-depth oracle hierarchies over PNC and C=NC . We provide complete problems, obtain the upper bound L for all these hierarchies, and prove partial hierarchy collapses. In particular, the constant-depth oracle hierarchy over PNC collapses to its first level PNC, and the constant-depth oracle hierarchy over C=NC 1 collapses to its second level.	arithmetic circuit complexity;decision problem;fan-in;integrated circuit;l (complexity);nc (complexity);nl (complexity)	Samir Datta;Meena Mahajan;B.

This class of groups can be characterized algebraically as well as through some language-theoretical properties as well as through certain combinatorial properties of presentations. Here we use the fact that a finitely generated group is context-free if and only if it admits a finite complete presentation of a certain form that we call a virtually free presentation. It is known that the generalized word problem for context-free groups is decidable. Here we show how prefix-rewriting systems can be used to solve this problem. In fact, we show that the Knuth-Bendix completion procedure always terminates when applied to prefix-rewriting systems on virtually free presentations of context-free groups. In addition, we present a specialized completion algorithm for prefix-rewriting systems on virtually free presentations which has polynomial-time complexity. Thus, the uniform generalized word problem for virtually free presentations of context-free groups is decidable in polynomial-time. Since finitely generated subgroups of context-free groups are again context-free, they admit presentations of the same form. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a virtually free presentation of a context-free group G and a finite subset U of G as input, computes a virtually free presentation for the subgroup of G that is generated by U.	context-free grammar;context-free language;knuth–bendix completion algorithm;polynomial;rewriting;time complexity	Robert Cremanns	1997	Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing	10.1007/s002000050069	time complexity;word problem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	Theory	5.084440119140437	19.00503451831437	76337
2b581a8af5239c3879b186fdcca9b6c4c36d3854	revising the membrane computing model for byzantine agreement		We refine our earlier version of P systems with complex symbols. The new version, called cP systems, enables the creation and manipulation of high-level data structures which are typical in high-level languages, such as: relations (graphs), associative arrays, lists, trees. We assess these capabilities by attempting a revised version of our previously best solution for the Byzantine agreement problem – a famous problem in distributed algorithms, with non-trivial data structures and algorithms. In contrast to our previous solutions, which use a greater than exponential number of symbols and rules, the new solution uses a fixed sized alphabet and ruleset, independent of the problem size. The new ruleset follows closely the conceptual description of the algorithm. This revised framework opens the way to further extensions, which may bring P systems closer to the conceptual Actor model.	byzantine fault tolerance;membrane computing	Radu Nicolescu	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-54072-6_20	computer science;artificial intelligence;genealogy;algorithm	Crypto	5.445680108515539	25.09750411183804	76368

Even though this algorithm does not determine whether or not the DFA is shuffle decomposable, the sublinear time complexity of only determining the two words under the assumption of decomposability is surprising given the complexity of shuffle, and demonstrates an interesting property of the operation.

The system collects a wide variety of environmental data and provides the precise cultivation control needed to produce high value-added crops; however, there are the problems of packet transmission errors in wireless sensor networks or system failure due to having the equipment in a hot and humid environment. In this paper, we propose a reliable wireless control system for hydroponic tomato cultivation using the 400 MHz wireless band and the IEEE 802.15.6 standard. The 400 MHz band, which is lower than the 2.4 GHz band, has good obstacle diffraction, and zero-data-loss communication is realized using the guaranteed time-slot method supported by the IEEE 802.15.6 standard. In addition, this system has fault tolerance and a self-healing function to recover from faults such as packet transmission failures due to deterioration of the wireless communication quality. In our basic experiments, the 400 MHz band wireless communication was not affected by the plants' growth, and the packet error rate was less than that of the 2.4 GHz band. In summary, we achieved a real-time hydroponic liquid supply control with no data loss by applying a 400 MHz band WSN to hydroponic tomato cultivation.	anatomic node;arabic numeral 0;bit error rate;control system;entity name part qualifier - adopted;experiment;exposure to humidity;fault tolerance;hydroponics;information and communication theory;interoperability;megahertz;network packet;node - plant part;premature obstetric labor;prototype;real-time clock;sensor node;verification of theories;waisman syndrome	Hirofumi Ibayashi;Yukimasa Kaneda;Jungo Imahara;Naoki Oishi;Masahiro Kuroda;Hiroshi Mineno	2016		10.3390/s16050644	embedded system;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering	Embedded	2.6552495622303116	30.58217786757531	77243

Such robustness in the design is achieved through the use of a hierarchical directory that grows in a manner similar to a multidimensional B-tree. For most practical directory sizes of at most 2s* entries, we guarantee no more than three diik accesses for an exact match search. Like the grid file, the directory corresponds to a rectilinearly partitioned attribute space which is represented as d-dimensional extendible &ray. Hence range and partial-range searches are efficiently executed in 0(n~), where no is the number of rectangular cells that cover the response region.	b-tree;directory (computing);extendible hashing;extensibility;grid file;key distribution;merkle tree	Ekow J.

The multiple channel temperature acquisition method collects and analyzes system including flexible and stable field bus for the sensors, communication between intelligent module and control unit is proposed. In this temperature monitoring system, a total of 3 kinds of networks which independently marked by ∗(1), ∗(2), and ∗(3) were proposed, with ∗(1) being the lowest priority and ∗(3) being the highest priority. The lowest priority is field bus (ITU Bus) which connects all the grouped sensors into different channels of different intelligent acquisition modules. The ITU network protocol is a star type, and the network structure is independent on the sensors. The bus can connect different types of sensors such as strainmeter, stressmeter, jointmeter, rock-deformeter, piezometer et al., the measurement scope could be extended wider. This study provides a measuring technique has been successfully implemented in monitoring of the Xiluodu arch dam construction, and ultimately solved the shortcoming of manual measurement technique.

c9b0f0abd98c66b63fb2bb25401d3107205598a6	the information content of systems in general physical theories		What kind of object is a quantum state? Is it an object that enc odes an exponentially growing amount of information (in the size of the system) or more akin to a pro bability distribution? It turns out that these questions are sensitive to what we do with the informat ion. For example, Holevo’s bound tells us thatn qubits only encoden bits of classical information but for certain communicatio n complexity tasks there is an exponential separation between quantum an d cl ssical resources. Instead of just contrasting quantum and classical physics, we can place bot h within a broad landscape of physical theories and ask how non-quantum (and non-classical) theor ies are different from, or more powerful than quantum theory. For example, in communication complex ity, certain (non-quantum) theories can trivialise all communication complexity tasks. In rece nt work [C. M. Lee and M. J. Hoban, Proc. Royal Soc. A 472 (2190), 2016], we showed that the immense pow er f the information content of states in general (non-quantum) physical theories is not limited to communication complexity. We showed that, in general physical theories, states can be t aken as “advice” for computers in these theories and this advice allows the computers to easily solv e any decision problem. Aaronson has highlighted the close connection between quantum communic ation complexity and quantum computations that take quantum advice, and our work gives further indications that this is a very general connection. In this work, we review the results in our previo us work and discuss the intricate relationship between communication complexity and computers t aking advice for general theories.	communication complexity;computation;computer;decision problem;physical information;quantum mechanics;quantum state;qubit;ruth aaronson bari;self-information;theory;time complexity	Ciarán M.

The SAT-based appro ch divides into three steps: encoding, preprocessing, and search. It is oft en argued that by encoding arbitrary Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal fo rm (CNF), structural properties of the original problem are not reflected in the CN F. This should result in the fact that CNF-level preprocessing and SAT solver tech niques have an inherent disadvantage compared to related techniques applicabl e on the level of more structural SAT instance representations such as Boolean ci rcuits. In this work we study the effect of a CNF-level simplification technique c alled blocked clause elimination (BCE). We show that BCE is surprisingly effecti ve both in theory and in practice on CNFs resulting from a standard CNF encoding fo r circuits: without explicit knowledge of the underlying circuit structure, it achieves the same level of simplification as a combination of circuit-level simplifi cations and previously suggested polarity-based CNF encodings. Experimentally, we show that by applying BCE in preprocessing, further formula reduction and faster solving can be achieved, giving promise for applying BCE to speed up solver s.	academy;boolean satisfiability problem;conjunctive normal form;encoder;experiment;level of detail;preprocessor;solver;variable elimination;whole earth 'lectronic link	Matti Järvisalo;Armin Biere;Marijn Heule	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12002-2_10	discrete mathematics;boolean expression;#sat;computer science;maximum satisfiability problem;theoretical computer science;mathematics;boolean satisfiability problem;algorithm	AI	6.661649973220622	27.636454833311696	78693

[3] gave constructions of Boolean functions (computable by polynomial-size circuits) with large lower bounds  for read-once branching program (1-b.p.’s): a function in P with the lower bound 2  n − − polylog( n), a function in quasipolynomial time with the lower bound 2  n − −  O(log  n), and a function in LINSPACE with the lower bound 2  n − − log  n − −  O (1). We point out alternative, much simpler constructions of such Boolean functions by applying the idea of almost k-wise independence more directly, without the use of discrepancy set generators for large affine subspaces; our constructions  are obtained by derandomizing the probabilistic proofs of existence of the corresponding combinatorial objects. The simplicity  of our new constructions also allows us to observe that there exists a Boolean function in AC0 [2] (computable by a depth 3, polynomial-size circuit over the basis { ∧ , ⊕ ,1}) with the optimal lower bound 2  n − − log  n − −  O(1) for 1-b.p.’s.    	boolean satisfiability problem	Valentine Kabanets	2000		10.1007/10719839_20	implicant;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;boolean expression;product term;computer science;maximum satisfiability problem;karp–lipton theorem;mathematics;boolean function;upper and lower bounds;complete boolean algebra;algorithm;two-element boolean algebra;parity function	Crypto	8.545112401805614	21.735829299347202	78775

These distributed indexes offer a rich design space of a) logical decompositions of sensor relation schema into indexes, as well as b) physical mappings of these indexes onto sensors. In this poster, we explore this space for energy-efficient data organizations (logical and physical mappings of tuples and attributes to sensor nodes) and devise purely local query optimization techniques for processing queries that span such decomposed relations. We propose four design techniques: (a) fully decomposing the base sensor relation into distinct sub-relations, (b) spatially partitioning these sub-relations across the sensornet, (c) localized query planning and optimization to find fully decentralized optimal join orders, and (d) locally caching join results. Together, these optimizations reduce the overall network energy consumption by 4 times or more when compared against the standard single multidimensional distributed index on a variety of synthetic query workloads simulated over both synthetic and real-world datasets. We validate the feasibility of our approach by implementing a functional prototype of our data organizer and query processor on Mica2 motes and observing comparable message cost savings.

We show that this proof system is fairly strong, even when restricted to multilinear arithmetic formulas of a very small depth. Specifically, we show the following: 1. Algebraic proofs manipulating depth 2 multilinear arithmetic formulas polynomially simulate Resolution, Polynomial Calculus (PC) and Polynomial Calculus with Resolution (PCR) proofs; 2. Polynomial size proofs manipulating depth 3 multilinear arithmetic formulas for the functional pigeonhole principle; 3. Polynomial size proofs manipulating depth 3 multilinear arithmetic formulas for Tseitin’s graph tautologies. By known lower bounds, this demonstrates that algebraic proof systems manipulating depth 3 multilinear formulas are strictly stronger than Resolution, PC and PCR, and have an exponential gap over bounded-depth Frege for both the functional pigeonhole principle and Tseitin’s graph tautologies. Algebraic proofs manipulating depth 2 multilinear arithmetic formulas polynomially simulate Resolution, Polynomial Calculus (PC) and Polynomial Calculus with Resolution (PCR) proofs; Polynomial size proofs manipulating depth 3 multilinear arithmetic formulas for the functional pigeonhole principle; Polynomial size proofs manipulating depth 3 multilinear arithmetic formulas for Tseitin’s graph tautologies. We also illustrate a connection between lower bounds on multilinear proofs and lower bounds on multilinear circuits. In particular, we show that (an explicit) super-polynomial size separation between proofs manipulating general arithmetic circuits and proofs manipulating multilinear circuits implies a super-polynomial size lower bound on multilinear circuits for an explicit family of polynomials.	boolean circuit;frege;integrated circuit;linear algebra;pigeonhole sort;polynomial;proof calculus;simulation;time complexity	Ran Raz;Iddo Tzameret	2006	computational complexity	10.1007/s00037-008-0246-0	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;proof complexity;algorithm;algebra	Theory	8.254171767501887	21.702911910305616	80406

Mining for association rules between items in a large database of sales transactions is an important database mining problem. However, the algorithms previously reported in the literature apply only to static databases. That is, when more transactions are added, the mining process must start all over again, without taking advantage of the previous execution and results of the mining algorithm. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for mining association rules within the context of a dynamic database, (i.e., a database where transactions can be added). It is an extension of our Partition algorithm which was shown to reduce the I/O overhead significantly as well as to lower the CPU overhead for most cases when compared with the performance of one of the best existing association mining algorithms.	algorithm;association rule learning;central processing unit;database;input/output;overhead (computing);structure mining	Edward Omiecinski;Ashok Savasere	1998		10.1007/BFb0053471	gsp algorithm;association rule learning;information processing;computer science;dynamic programming;data mining;database;data stream mining;apriori algorithm;information system;algorithm	DB	8.918615341595563	29.1164211246491	80959

Solution-phase DNA chemistry, though not unlimited, provides the only currently-available experimental system. Its practical feasibility, however, is controversial. We have sought to extend the feasibility and generality of DNA computing by a novel application of the theory of counting . The biochemically equivalent operation for DNA counting is well known. We propose a DNA algorithm that employs this new operation. We also present an implementation of this algorithm by a novel DNA-chemical method. Preliminary computer simulations suggest that the algorithm can signi cantly reduce the DNA space complexity (i.e., the maximum number of DNA molecules that must be present in the test tube during computation) for solving 3SAT to O(20:4n). If the observation is correct, our algorithm can solve 3SAT instances of size up to or exceeding 120 variables.	algorithm;computation;computer simulation;dna computing;dspace;experimental system;parallel computing	Mitsunori Ogihara;Animesh Ray	1997				Comp.	3.900225893341875	25.30715971070051	81003

This encoding uses a constant sized alphabet. This improves on an earlier result of Schulman, who showed how to recover when the fraction of errors is bounded by 1/240.

Nondeterminism may occur only when the length of the unread input is less t hank+ 1. We develop a comprehensive theory of predictable semiautomata. Using a ovel semiautomaton, called the core, we present a test for predictability. We then intro duce the predictor semiautomaton, based on a look-ahead semiautomaton, that is essential ly deterministic. We describe two ways of using the predictor to simulate a nondeterminist ic emiautomaton. The first simulation predicts the set of states reachable by every pre fix of the input word as long as the prefix is in the language of the semiautomaton. The second simulation is similar, but it stops as soon as it infers that the input word is not in the lang u ge of the semiautomaton. Moreover, the membership of a word in the language of a semiau tomaton can be decided completely deterministically. Finally, we show that, if a s emiautomaton withn states over a one-letter alphabet is k-predictable,k being the smallest such integer, then k≤ n−1, and this bound can be reached. For semiautomata over arbitrary a lphabets,k≤ (n2−n)/2, and this bound can be reached for a suitable input alphabet.	algorithm;automata theory;best, worst and average case;computation;kerrison predictor;mathematical structure;maximal set;nondeterministic finite automaton;semiautomaton;simulation;tor messenger	Janusz A.

c5e7491ce4488668e92407a5bceb487ccf6e46e3	a superpolynomial lower bound for the size of non-deterministic complement of an unambiguous automaton		Unambiguous non-deterministic finite automata (UFA) are non-deterministic automata (over finite words) such that there is at most one accepting run over each input. Such automata are known to be potentially exponentially more succinct than deterministic automata, and nondeterministic automata can be exponentially more succinct than them. In this paper we establish a superpolynomial lower bound for the state complexity of the translation of an UFA to a non-deterministic automaton for the complement language. This disproves the formerly conjectured polynomial upper bound for this translation. This lower bound only involves a one letter alphabet, and makes use of the random graph methods. The same proof also shows that the translation of sweeping automata to non-deterministic automata is superpolynomial. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation → Models of computation	deterministic automaton;deterministic finite automaton;finite-state machine;non-deterministic turing machine;nondeterministic finite automaton;polynomial;rado graph;random graph;theory of computation;time complexity;unambiguous finite automaton	Mikhail Raskin	2018		10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2018.138	succinctness;conjecture;finite-state machine;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;expressive power;mathematics;automaton;polynomial;alphabet;upper and lower bounds	Theory	-0.11835394027774837	21.393096104753003	81630
9e9a92c30f7f4696301ea51029a556ef9f98f841	wireless sensor network simulation for fault detection in industrial processes		Sensor data is extremely important to monitor machines at the shop-floor level and its environmental surrounding conditions for condition-based monitoring, machine diagnosis and process adaptation to new requirements. Based on the described scope, self-diagnostics and self-organizing capabilities are core functionalities of any Industrial Wireless Sensor Network (IWSN). In the present work, a simulated case study was developed with the main intent of validating techniques implemented for sensor data diagnosis of error detection and equipment failure. The scenarios explored try to mimic some common situations of a manufacturing environment when dealing with WSNs, where a piece of sensor equipment suddenly stops working or an unpredictable change in the environment leads to faulty data readings. This paper introduces Castalia and describes how it was used to simulate a direct application of an Optical Metrology System on an industrial Resistance Spot Welding process, which is composed of a camera and several luminosity sensors. More specifically, a sensor data validation module was proposed, implemented and used to extend Castalia functionalities.	data validation;edge detection;error detection and correction;failure;fault detection and isolation;machine learning;multi-agent system;online and offline;order management system;organizing (structure);requirement;self-organization;sensor;sensor web;simulation	Rui Pinto;Rosaldo J.

This factoring operation is done implicitly when one refers to u0027u0027tree structuresu0027u0027 or u0027u0027arraysu0027u0027 as generic objects. Structural uniformities in data graphs can often be exploited to facilitate and systematize the accessing of nodes in the graph and the implementation of the graph in a computer. This paper presents a model for data graphs which can be used to study such uniformities. The main results reported algebraically characterize, in terms of structural uniformities, those classes of data graphs which can be implemented by u0027u0027relative addressingu0027u0027 and by u0027u0027relocatable realizationsu0027u0027.

We introduce a novel approach that is semantics-based, independent of the syntactic appearance of the system specification. Basically, we model the system under test as a random variable, whose sample space consists of all possible behavior sets (with respect to the specification) over the known interface of the black-box. The entropy of the system is measured as the (Shannon) entropy of the random variable. In our criterion, the coverage of a test set is measured as the expected amount of entropy decrease (i.e. the expected amount of information gained) once the test set is run. Since our criterion is syntactic independent, we study the notion of information-optimal software testing where, within a given constraint, a test set is selected to gain the most information.	alphabet (formal languages);automaton;best, worst and average case;black box;black-box testing;computer cooling;concurrency (computer science);entropy (information theory);fastest;finite-state machine;greedy algorithm;information theory;maximal set;observable;shannon (unit);software testing;synchronization (computer science);system under test;test case;test data;test set;time complexity;transition system;white-box testing	Linmin Yang;Zhe Dang;Thomas R.

GPRS stands for General Packet Radio Service, it has a lot of advantages like widely used, high transmission speed, low power consumption and so on. The system uses microcontroller chip MSP430F2274 and wireless transceiver chip CC2500. The whole network consists of the control center and up to 100 groups of control network, and each control network has up to 100 terminal nodes, terminal nodes measure humidity, current, voltage and other information, and send these information to the transition points by the RF wireless transceiver module, then the transition points transmit information to the control center through GSM/GPRS networks. The control center will deal with the data so that it can know the situation of each streetlight. According to the result the control center gives orders to each streetlight to control the switch state and illumination of them.

To solve this problem, we introduce the PDtree data structure, which avoids exponential time and space complexity associated with prior work by allowing user specification of the tree structure. A straightforward parallelization approach using a Cray MTA-2 provides a speedup that is linear in the number of processors, but introduces nondeterminism into probability estimates. We prove a general convergence result that bounds the non-deterministic deviation of probability estimates relative to a sequential implementation. Beyond PDtrees, this convergence result applies to any counting application that takes a multithreaded streaming approach.	central processing unit;cray mta-2;dspace;data mining;data structure;parallel computing;speedup;thread (computing);time complexity;tree structure	Chad Scherrer;Nathaniel Beagley;Jarek Nieplocha;Andrès Márquez;John Feo;Daniel G.

CADE is the major forum for the presentation of research in all aspects of automated deduction, including foundations, applications, implementations, and practical experience. The five papers selected for the special issue (out of 36 papers presented at the conference) underwent a new and thorough reviewing and revision process, in accordance with the high standards of JAR. During this process, one paper was withdrawn. The paperCombining SAT Solvers with Computer Algebra Systems to Verify Cominatorial Conjectures by Edward Zulkoski, Curtis Bright, Albert Heinle, Ilias Kotsireas, Krzysztof Czarnecki and Vijay Ganesh integrates a computer algebra system within the inner loop of a CDCL (Conflict-Driving Clause Learning) satisfiability solver. The resulting MathCheck tool is illustrated on two graph-theoretic conjectures on hypercubes and the construction of Hadamard matrices. Andrew Reynolds and Jasmin Christian Blanchette present A Decision Procedure for (co)datatypes in SMT Solvers. It decides universal problems involving datatypes and codatatypes by combining rewriting with a theory solver. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated on problems generated from Isabelle/HOL formalizations using Sledgehammer. In the paper Abstract Interpretation as Automated Deduction, Vijay D’Silva and Caterina Urban show how several lattices that are commonly used and studied in abstract interpretation can be generated as fragments of a first-order theory of arithmetic, thereby advancing the	abstract interpretation;automated theorem proving;boolean satisfiability problem;computer algebra system;conference on automated deduction;conflict-driven clause learning;constraint learning;decision problem;first-order logic;first-order predicate;graph theory;hol (proof assistant);hadamard transform;inner loop;isabelle;jasmin;journal of automated reasoning;natural deduction;rewriting;solver	Amy P.

A tiling system becomes an effective device for recognition when a scanning strategy on pictures is fixed. We define a Tiling Automaton as a tiling system together with a scanning strategy and a suitable data structure. In this framework it is possible to define determinism, nondeterminism and unambiguity. The class of languages accepted by tiling automata coincides with REC family. Tiling automata are able to simulate on-line tessellation automata. Then (deterministic) tiling automata are compared with the other known (deterministic) automata models for recognition of two-dimensional languages.

Like epsilon transitions, failure transition do not consume input symbols, but unlike them, they may only be taken when no other transition is applicable. At a semantic level, this conveniently models catch-all clauses and allows for compact language representation. This work investigates the transition-reduction problem for deterministic finite-state automata (DFA). The input is a DFA A and an integer k. The question is whether k or more transitions can be saved by replacing regular transitions with failure transitions. We show that while the problem is NP -complete, there are approximation techniques and heuristics that mitigate the computational complexity. We conclude by demonstrating the computational difficulty of two related minimisation problems, thereby cancelling the ongoing search for efficient algorithms.	algorithm;approximation;approximation algorithm;automata theory;catch-all;computation;computational complexity theory;deterministic finite automaton;experiment;failure semantics;finite-state machine;heuristic (computer science);np-completeness;pattern matching;polynomial;procedural generation;simulation;time complexity	Henrik Björklund;Johanna Björklund;Niklas Zechner	2014	Theor.

Thus, a PRAM[*, ⇑, ⇓] may be more powerful, to within a polynomial in time, than either a PRAM[*] or a PRAM[⇑, ⇓], since  PRAM [*] −  PTIME  =  PRAM [⇑, ⇓] −  PTIME  =  PSPACE .	random access	Jerry L.

Many platforms have been designed based on different charging technologies for a wide range of scenarios, including structural monitoring, habitat monitoring, wearable devices, volcano monitoring, and so on. However, these existing platforms cannot be deployed quickly and flexibly in many harsh environments, resulting in high deployment cost. In this article, we propose Q-Charge, a wireless charging platform integrated with a quadcopter, which is able to provide desirable energy for large-scale sensing applications. Q-Charge is composed of three components: an energy transfer module, a programmable quadcopter unit, and a cloud server. A wireless charger is installed on a quadcopter to achieve remote energy delivery, and a sink node retrieves data packets from sensors and forwards them to the cloud via a service gateway. Our platform has been successfully implemented for building structure and farmland monitoring, which demonstrates Q-Charge to be effective and efficient.	battery charger;habitat;network packet;sensor;server (computing);software deployment;virtual private server;wearable technology	Jiming Chen;Songyuan Li;Shuo Chen;Shibo He;Zhiguo Shi	2017	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2017.1700071	computer network;software deployment;wireless sensor network;sink (computing);computer science;cloud computing;default gateway;inductive charging;server;quadcopter	Mobile	2.347196344104554	32.240099928020435	84123

Many well-known operations such as catenation, bi-catenation, shuffle, literal shuffle and insertion are just particular instances of the operation T. Hence, our results offer a uniform treatment for classical methods, notably the Schutzenberger product. We also investigate some other related operations.

Our aim is to establish a theoretical relation between two well-known automata recognizing the language of E, namely the position automaton PE constructed by Glushkov or McNaughton and Yamada, and the equation automaton EE constructed by Mirkin or Antimirov. We define the notion of c-derivative (for canonical derivative) of a regular expression E and show that if E is linear then two Brzozowski’s derivatives of E are aci-similar if and only if the corresponding c-derivatives are identical. It allows us to represent the Berry-Sethi’s set of continuations of a position by a unique c-derivative, called the c-continuation of the position. Hence the definition of CE, the c-continuation automaton of E, whose states are pairs made of a position of E and of the associated c-continuation. If states are viewed as positions, CE is isomorphic to PE . On the other hand, a partial derivative, as defined by Antimirov, is a class of c-derivatives for some equivalence relation, thus CE reduces to EE . Finally CE makes it possible to go from PE to EE, while this cannot be achieved directly (from the state graphs). These theoretical results lead to an O(|E|2) space and time algorithm to compute the equation automaton, where |E| is the size of the expression. This is the complexity of the most efficient constructions yielding the position automaton, while the size of the equation automaton is not greater and generally much smaller than the size of the position automaton. ∗En hommage à Valentin Antimirov.	algorithm;automaton;continuation;finite-state machine;regular expression;turing completeness	Jean-Marc Champarnaud;Djelloul Ziadi	2002	Theor.

This decision has to rely only on measuring in the computational basis the e ect of iterating the gates on the classical states. It turns out that instead of individual gates, we can only design procedures for families of gates. To achieve our goal we borrow some elegant ideas of the theory of program testing: we characterize the gate families by speci c properties, we develop a theory of robustness for them, and show that they lead to self-testers. In particular we prove that the universal and fault-tolerant set of gates consisting of a Hadamard gate, a c-NOT gate, and a phase rotation gate of angle =4 is self-testable.	controlled not gate;fault tolerance;hadamard transform;inverter (logic gate);iterated function;quantum gate;self-replication;software testing;theory;universal quantification;with high probability	Wim van Dam;Frédéric Magniez;Michele Mosca;Miklos Santha	2007	SIAM J.

The network collects environmental data from over 240 sensors, including the EC-5, MPS-1 and MPS-2 soil moisture and soil water potential sensors and self-made sap flow sensors, across a heterogeneous deployment comprised of MICAz, IRIS and TelosB wireless motes. A low-cost sensor board and software driver was developed for communicating with the analog and digital sensors. Innovative techniques (e.g., balanced energy efficient routing and heterogeneous over-the-air mote reprogramming) maintained high success rates (>96%) and enabled effective software updating, throughout the large-scale heterogeneous WSN. The edaphic properties monitored by the network showed strong agreement with data logger measurements and were fitted to pedotransfer functions for estimating local soil hydraulic properties. Furthermore, sap flow measurements, scaled to tree stand transpiration, were found to be at or below potential evapotranspiration estimates. While outdoor WSNs still present numerous challenges, the ASWP testbed proves to be an effective and (relatively) low-cost environmental monitoring solution and represents a step towards developing a platform for monitoring and quantifying statistically relevant environmental parameters from large-scale network deployments.	analog;data logger;deploy;device driver;estimated;genetic heterogeneity;hydrology;iris <angiosperm>;numerous;rps27 protein, human;reprogram;routing;seizures;sensor node;testbed;sensor (device);transpiration	German Villalba;Fernando Plaza;Xiaoyang Zhong;Tyler W.

It gives an unconditional lower bound on the computation time from a given program in absence of auxiliary information. Variants known as logical depth and computational depth are expressed in Kolmogorov complexity theory. We derive quantitative relation between logical depth and computational depth and unify the different depth notions by relating them to A. Kolmogorov and L. Levin’s fruitful notion of randomness deficiency. Subsequently, we revisit the computational depth of infinite strings, study the notion of super deep sequences and relate it with other approaches.	angular defect;computation;computational complexity theory;kolmogorov complexity;logical depth;offset binary;randomness;time complexity	Luis Filipe Coelho Antunes;Armando Matos;André Souto;Paul M.

Given a finite automaton A , if the language L(A ) is piecewise testable, we want to express it as a Boolean combination of languages of the above form. The idea is as follows. If the language is k-PT, then there exists a congruence ∼k of finite index such that L(A ) is a finite union of ∼k-classes. Every such class is characterized by an intersection of languages of the from Lu, for |u| ≤ k, and their complements. To represent the ∼k-classes, we make use of the ∼k-canonical DFA. We identify the states of the ∼k-canonical DFA whose union forms the language L(A ) and use them to construct the required Boolean combination.

375d27375712aaa29eee9a538a60bb22b9427a5f	red-blue pebble game: complexity of computing the trade-off between cache size and memory transfers		The red-blue pebble game was formulated in the 1980s~\citeHK81 to model the I/O complexity of algorithms on a two-level memory hierarchy. Given a directed acyclic graph representing computations (vertices) and their dependencies (edges), the red-blue pebble game allows sequentially adding, removing, and recoloring red or blue pebbles according to a few rules, where red pebbles represent data in cache (fast memory) and blue pebbles represent data on disk (slow, external memory). Specifically, a vertex can be newly pebbled red if and only if all of its predecessors currently have a red pebble; pebbles can always be removed; and pebbles can be recolored between red and blue (corresponding to reading or writing data between disk and cache, also called I/Os or memory transfers). Given an upper bound on the number of red pebbles at any time (the cache size), the goal is to compute a game execution with the fewest pebble recolorings (memory transfers) that finish with pebbles on a specified subset of nodes (outputs get computed). In this paper, we investigate the complexity of computing this trade-off between red-pebble limit (cache size) and number of recolorings (memory transfers) in general DAGs. First we prove this problem PSPACE-complete through an extension of the proof PSPACE-hardness of black pebbling complexity~\citeGLT80. Second, we consider a natural restriction on the red-blue pebble game to forbid pebble deletions, or equivalently, forbid discarding data from cache without first writing it to disk. This assumption both simplifies the model and immediately places the trade-off computation problem within NP. Unfortunately, we show that even this restricted version is NP-complete. Finally, we show that the trade-off problem parameterized by the number of transitions is W[1]-hard, meaning that there is likely no algorithm running in a fixed polynomial for constant number of transitions.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;computational problem;directed acyclic graph;input/output;karp's 21 np-complete problems;memory hierarchy;np (complexity);pspace;pspace-complete;pebble smartwatch;pebble game;pokémon red;polynomial	Erik D.

cda00f51516e4f6735a036df7e2d9ca949ec624f	why 1.02? the root hermite factor of lll and stochastic sandpile models		The much celebrated LLL algorithm, in contrast to its short and simple code, exhibits highly enigmatic behavior; and in contrast to its broad usage, and the numerous breakthroughs it has sparked since 1982, our understanding so far of its inner workings has been completely in the dark. In this paper, we develop and present an illuminating mathematical framework to think about LLL, which at once clearly explains most of its well-known peculiarities. More precisely, we establish, with compelling theoretical and experimental evidence, that LLL behaves essentially identically to a certain stochastic variant of the sandpile model that we introduce here. The once mysterious properties of LLL then turn out to be natural, familiar ones in the realm of the sandpiles. We also make a couple of new discoveries on the sandpile side along the way, which may be of some interest to the researchers working in that area. A deep understanding of LLL is of practical and critical importance to determining the post-quantum cryptographic standards in near future. The Achilles’ heel of lattice-based cryptography, currently one of the most promising candidates for the next generation cryptosystem that would replace RSA and ECC within the next several decades, is that it lacks a solid guarantee for its security, which eventually comes down to the question, “Could LLL be improved, while retaining its time complexity?” Our theory enables one to formulate a very strong argument that the answer is “No,” which substantially boosts our confidence in the security of lattice-based cryptosystems. Hence another way to summarize our work is: statistical physics may play a central role in ensuring the reliability of the cryptosystem that is soon to be deployed in the emerging era of quantum computers.	abelian sandpile model;computer;cryptosystem;lattice-based cryptography;lenstra–lenstra–lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm;next-generation network;post-quantum cryptography;quantum computing;time complexity	Jintai Ding;Seungki Kim;Tsuyoshi Takagi;Yuntao Wang	2018	CoRR		discrete mathematics;mathematical analysis;abelian sandpile model;lattice (order);cryptography;hermite polynomials;existential quantification;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;cryptosystem	Crypto	5.079509628012485	27.211231677646595	87085

31752319858d071a3f87b35479bfdf499b8bba54	lattice agreement in message passing systems		This paper studies the lattice agreement problem and the generalized lattice agreement problem in distributed message passing systems. In the lattice agreement problem, given input values from a lattice, processes have to non-trivially decide output values that lie on a chain. We consider the lattice agreement problem in both synchronous and asynchronous systems. For synchronous lattice agreement, we present two algorithms which run in log(f) and min{O(log2h(L)), O(log2f)} rounds, respectively, where h(L) denotes the height of the input sublattice L, f < n is the number of crash failures the system can tolerate, and n is the number of processes in the system. These algorithms have significant better round complexity than previously known algorithms. The algorithm by Attiya et al. [Attiya et al. DISC, 1995] takes log(n) synchronous rounds, and the algorithm by Mavronicolasa [Mavronicolasa, 2018] takes min{O(h(L)), O(sqrt(f))} rounds. For asynchronous lattice agreement, we propose an algorithm which has time complexity of 2 ∗min{h(L), f + 1} message delays which improves on the previously known time complexity of O(n) message delays. The generalized lattice agreement problem defined by Faleiro et al in [Faleiro et al. PODC, 2012] is a generalization of the lattice agreement problem where it is applied for the replicated state machine. We propose an algorithm which guarantees liveness when a majority of the processes are correct in asynchronous systems. Our algorithm requires min{O(h(L)), O(f)} units of time in the worst case which is better than O(n) units of time required by the algorithm in [Faleiro et al.

In this work we consider the property of being computable by a read-once width-2 Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (OBDD), also known as a branching program, in two settings. In the first setting the order of the variables is fixed and given to the algorithm, while in the second setting it is not fixed. That is, while in the first setting we should accept a function f if it is computable by a width-2 OBDD with a given order of the variables, in the second setting we should accept a function f if there exists an order of the variables according to which a width-2 OBDD can compute f . Width-2 OBDDs generalize two classes of functions that have been studied in the context of property testing linear functions (over GF (2)) and monomials. In both these cases membership can be tested by performing a number of queries that is independent of the number of variables, n (and is linear in 1/ǫ, where ǫ is the distance parameter). In contrast, we show that testing computability by width-2 OBDDs when the order of variables is fixed and known requires a number of queries that grows logarithmically with n (for a constant ǫ), and we provide an algorithm that performs Õ(logn/ǫ) queries. For the case where the order is not fixed, we show that there is no testing algorithm that performs a number of queries that is sublinear in n.	algorithm;binary decision diagram;computability;computable function;grammatical framework;graph (discrete mathematics);linear function;monomial;property testing	Dana Ron;Gilad Tsur	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03685-9_51	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;property testing;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	9.121955960047794	21.86406845222526	87587

28b4296c6994207c189647e4b415b69958cec131	the relation of two patterns with comparable languages	comparable languages	A pattern is a string consisting of terminais and variables. The language defined by a pattern is the set of terminal strings obtained by substituting (consistently) terminal strings to its variables. A pattern simulâtes another pattern when its language contains that of the other one. If q simulâtes p, one may think that there must be a substitution that applied to a produces p itself This hypothesis is considered under different assumptions. It results that it is true only for very restricted patterns (with variables only) and only when erasing substitutions are considered. The relation between two patterns is studied also in the case that the languages they produce are equal. Résumé. Un motif est un mot formé de terminaux et de variables. Le langage défini par un motif est l'ensemble des mots terminaux obtenus en substituant (de façon consistante) les mots terminaux aux variables du motif. Un motif simule un autre motif si le langage du premier motif contient le langage du second motif Si q simule p, on peut penser qu'il doit exister une substitution qui, appliquée à q, produit p. Ce problème est considéré sous différentes hypothèses. Il résulte de cette discussion que le problème a une réponse positive seulement pour des motifs très particuliers (contenant seulement des variables) et seulement lorsqu'on considère des substitutions effaçantes. On étudie aussi la relation entre deux motifs lorsque les langages produits sont égaux.

We show that, just as in the communication complexity model, the unbounded-error quantum query complexity is exactly half of its classical counterpart for any (partial or total) Boolean function. Moreover, connecting the query and communication complexity results, we show that the ''black-box'' approach to convert quantum query algorithms into communication protocols by Buhrman-Cleve-Wigderson [STOC'98] is optimal even in the unbounded-error setting. We also study a related setting, called the weakly unbounded-error setting, where the cost of a query algorithm is given by q+log(1/2(p-1/2)), where q is the number of queries made and p>1/2 is the success probability of the algorithm. In contrast to the case of communication complexity, we show a tight multiplicative @Q(logn) separation between quantum and classical query complexity in this setting for a partial Boolean function. The asymptotic equivalence between them is also shown for some well-studied total Boolean functions.	decision tree model	Ashley Montanaro;Harumichi Nishimura;Raymond H. Putra	2011	Theor. Comput.

This paper proposes multilayer communication network architecture for monitoring and controlling of wind power farms which consists of wind power farm layer, local control center layer, regional control center layer, central control center layer and neighbor control center layer. Based on the logical node concept of IEC 61400-25 standard, wind turbine is modeled and simulated by four different information including analogue measurements, status information, protection and control information, and meteorological mast information through OPNET modular.

This approach is useful for planning algorithms utilizing data from vehicular networks, for example. These algorithms may be robust to some data staleness and this robustness can be used to save energy. Our model relies on the statistical distribution of user queries depending on which we develop sensor sampling schedules while optimizing system cost. For Poisson arrivals of user queries, we develop an optimal data sampling strategy which samples the network at regular intervals. For hyper-exponential query inter arrivals, we discuss methods to find an optimal sampling strategy. We show that optimal strategies can be discovered using dynamic programming techniques but the process is highly computational. Due to this reason, we suggest suboptimal sampling strategies which are nearly as efficient as the optimal strategy. We carefully design the cost function for the sensing system such that it is truly representative of most platforms we want to optimize for. Our model is generic and can be used to model any system that aggregates information which is then queried in real-time by users.	algorithm;computation;dynamic programming;loss function;real-time web;replay attack;sampling (signal processing);time complexity	Debojit Dhar;Sathish Gopalakrishnan;Karim Rostamzadeh	2012		10.1145/2386958.2386965	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;data mining	Mobile	6.769025515210042	31.072957144023164	88968

In this work, a discrete structure representation of SN P systems with extended rules and without delay is proposed. Specifically, matrices are used to represent SN P systems. In order to represent the computations of SN P systems by matrices, configuration vectors are defined to monitor the number of spikes in each neuron at any given configuration; transition net gain vectors are also introduced to quantify the total amount of spikes consumed and produced after the chosen rules are applied. Nondeterminism of the systems is assured by a set of spiking transition vectors that could be used at any given time during the computation. With such matrix representation, it is quite convenient to determine the next configuration from a given configuration, since it involves only multiplication and addition of matrices after deciding the spiking transition vector.	computation;computer simulation;discrete mathematics;linear algebra;matrix representation;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;neuron;olami–feder–christensen model;p system;parallel computing;regular expression;stochastic matrix;the matrix	Xiangxiang Zeng;Henry N.

Such systems guarantee that the prover can only convince the verifier of true statements. In the context of centralized computation, a celebrated result shows that interactive proofs are extremely powerful, allowing polynomial-time verifiers to decide any language in PSPACE. In this work we initiate the study of interactive distributed proofs : a network of nodes interacts with a single untrusted prover, who sees the entire network graph, to decide whether the graph satisfies some property. We focus on the communication cost of the protocol --- the number of bits the nodes must exchange with the prover and each other. Our model can also be viewed as a generalization of the various models of """"distributed NP'' (proof labeling schemes, etc.) which received significant attention recently: while these models only allow the prover to present each network node with a string of advice, our model allows for back-and-forth interaction. We prove both upper and lower bounds for the new model. We show that for some problems, interaction can exponentially decrease the communication cost compared to a non-interactive prover, but on the other hand, some problems retain non-trivial cost even with interaction."""	centralized computing;computation;interactive proof system;interactivity;pspace;polynomial;time complexity	Gillat Kol;Rotem Oshman;Raghuvansh R.

We identify the undecidable variants of the problems, and then we concentrate on the remaining two cases. In the first case, when we are interested in the probability of all runs that visit zero in some counter, we show that the qualitative zero-reachability is decidable in time which is polynomial in the size of a given pMC and doubly exponential in the number of counters. Further, we show that the probability of all zero-reaching runs can be effectively approximated up to an arbitrarily small given error ε > 0 in time which is polynomial in log(ε), exponential in the size of a given pMC, and doubly exponential in the number of counters. In the second case, we are interested in the probability of all runs that visit zero in some counter different from the last counter. Here we show that the qualitative zero-reachability is decidable and SquareRootSum-hard, and the probability of all zero-reaching runs can be effectively approximated up to an arbitrarily small given error ε > 0 (these results apply to pMC satisfying a suitable technical condition that can be verified in polynomial time). The proof techniques invented in the second case allow to construct counterexamples for some classical results about ergodicity in stochastic Petri nets.	approximation algorithm;automata theory;automaton;ergodicity;petri net;polynomial;reachability problem;ring counter;time complexity;undecidable problem	Tomás Brázdil;Stefan Kiefer;Antonín Kucera;Petr Novotný;Joost-Pieter Katoen	2014		10.1145/2603088.2603161	markov chain;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;reachability;petri net;algorithm	Logic	2.641022748075317	22.423509144144955	89659

We require the agreement condition that all values decided upon are initial values of some processor. We show that the problem has a simple ( k −1)-resilient protocol in a totally asynchronous system. In an attempt to come up with a matching lower bound on the number of failures, we study the uncertainty condition, which requires that there must be some initial configuration from which all possible input values can be decided. We prove using a combinatorial argument that any k -resilient protocol for the k -set agreement problem would satisfy the uncertainty condition, while this is not true for any ( k −1)-resilient protocol. This result seems to strengthen the conjecture that there is no k -resilient protocol for this problem. We prove this result for a restricted class of protocols. Our motivation for studying this problem is to test whether the number of choices allowed to the processors is related to the number of faults . We hope that this will provide intuition towards achieving better bounds for more practical problems that arise in distributed computing, e.g., the renaming problem. The larger goal is to characterize the boundary between possibility and impossibility in asynchronous systems given multiple faults.	asynchronous circuit;consensus (computer science)	Soma Chaudhuri	1993	Inf.

We first extend the result in [31], to show that the “n/2 clique only function”, which is easily seen to be computable by deterministic polynomial size read-twice programs, cannot be computed by nondeterministic polynomial size read-once programs, although its complement can be so computed. We then exhibit an explicit Boolean functionf such that every nondeterministic syntactic read-k-times branching program for computingf has size exp $$\left( {\Omega \left( {\frac{n}{{4^k k^3 }}} \right)} \right).$$	binary decision diagram;boolean algebra;computable function;exptime;np (complexity);polynomial	Allan Borodin;Alexander A.

This made the technique difficult to use for most real-world applications. A recently proposed minimisation scheme based on the non-equispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT) lowers the complexity in the particle number M from $$\mathcal{O}(M^2)$$ to $$\mathcal{O}(M \log M).$$ However, the NFFT is hard to parallelise, and the runtime on modern CPUs lies still in the orders of an hour for about 50,000 particles, to a day for 1 million particles. Our contributions to remedy this problem are threefold: we design the first GPU-based NFFT algorithm without special structural assumptions on the positions of nodes, we introduce a novel nearest-neighbour identification scheme for continuous point distributions, and we optimise the whole algorithm for n-body problems such as electrostatic halftoning. For 1 million particles, this new algorithm runs 50 times faster than the most efficient technique on the CPU, and even yields a speedup of 7,000 over the original algorithm.	central processing unit;computation;dither;fast fourier transform;graphics processing unit;identification scheme;parallel algorithm;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);speedup;web search engine	Pascal Gwosdek;Christian Schmaltz;Joachim Weickert;Tanja Teuber	2011	Journal of Real-Time Image Processing	10.1007/s11554-011-0236-3	sampling;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;theoretical computer science;algorithm;statistics	ML	7.769962305020878	28.914256208536457	90656

In this article, we deal with the enumeration and the exhaustive generation of the accessible configuration of the system. Our work is based on a new recursive decomposition theorem for SPM configurations using the notion of staircase bases. Based on this theorem, we provide a recursive formula for the enumeration of SPM(n) and a constant amortized time (CAT) algorithm for the generation of all SPM(n) configurations. The extension of the same approach to the Ice Pile Model is also discussed.	abelian sandpile model;algorithm;amortized analysis;recursion;structured criticality;super paper mario	Wenjie Fang;Roberto Mantaci	2015	CoRR		combinatorics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Logic	-4.450551410974038	25.16445575859917	91327

We show that identity testing of depth 3 (ΣΠΣ) arithmetic circuits over a field F is polynomial time equivalent to identity testing of depth 2 (ΠΣ) arithmetic circuits over U2(F), the algebra of upper-triangular 2× 2 matrices with entries from F. Such a connection is a bit surprising since we also show that, as computational models, ΠΣ circuits over U2(F) are strictly ‘weaker’ than ΣΠΣ circuits over F. The equivalence further shows that PIT of depth 3 arithmetic circuits reduces to PIT of width-2 planar commutative Algebraic Branching Programs(ABP). Thus, identity testing for commutative ABPs is interesting even in the case of width-2. Further, we give a deterministic polynomial time identity testing algorithm for a ΠΣ circuit over any constant dimensional commutative algebra over F. While over commutative algebras of polynomial dimension, identity testing is at least as hard as that of ΣΠΣ circuits over F.	algorithm;arithmetic circuit complexity;computational model;polynomial identity testing;polynomial-time reduction;time complexity;triangular matrix;turing completeness	Chandan Saha;Ramprasad Saptharishi;Nitin Saxena	2009	Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC)	10.4230/LIPIcs.FSTTCS.2009.2333	time complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;data structure;computer science;mathematics;computational complexity theory;algorithm;algebra	Theory	8.928722764784368	22.06711735454275	91738

Derivations in a PLL(k) grammar are governed by a new type of control mechanism. Each contextfree LL(k) grammar is a PLL(k) grammar. Important non contextfree languages, e. g. declarative programming languages, can be described by PLL(k) grammars. An algorithm for the syntactical check of PLL(k) languages is developed and shown that its implementation on a Turing machine takes o(n2 ) time in the worst case. Using RAM models an improvement can be achieved with O(n) expected time complexity.	algorithm;average-case complexity;best, worst and average case;context-free grammar;declarative programming;ll parser;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;programming language;random-access memory;time complexity;turing machine	H.

We define multihead probabilistic finite automata with “log-space constructible” transition probabilities, and we describe a simple technique to simulate these automata by standard log-space probabilistic Turing machines. Next, we represent log-space probabilistic complexity classes as proper hierarchies based on corresponding multihead two-way probabilistic finite automata, and we show their (deterministic log-space) reducibility to the second levels of these hierarchies. We relate the number of heads of a multihead probabilistic finite automaton to the bandwidth of its configuration transition matrix for an input string; partially based on this relation, we find a simpler log-space complete problem for PL (the class of languages recognized by log-space unbounded-error probabilistic Turing machines), and we discuss possibilities for space-efficient deterministic simulations of probabilistic automata.	probabilistic automaton	Ioan I.

Weighted grammars and languages are first defined, and stochastic grammars and languages are defined as a special case of weighted grammars and languages. Fuzzy grammars and languages, which have some properties similar to weighted grammars and languages, are also discussed. Stochastic automata are defined from the language recognition viewpoint. Languages accepted by stochastic finite-state and pushdown automata, with and without a cutpoint, are studied. Weighted and stochastic programmed and indexed grammars, and stochastic nested stack automata are defined. Finally, some decidability problems of stochastic (weighted, fuzzy) languages are discussed, and problems for further research are suggested.	automata theory;decision problem;formal language;fuzzy logic;indexed grammar;pushdown automaton;stack (abstract data type);stochastic grammar	King-Sun Fu;T.

ec33c4e0c38e6867d011e1b5635aa4b52842ae97	polynomial time introreducibility	polynomial time;recursion theory	Abstract. We introduce the polynomial time version, in short ≤ P T -introreducibility, of the notion of introreducibility studied in Recursion Theory. We give a simpler proof of the known fact that a set is ≤ P T -introreducible if and only if it is in P. Our proof generalizes to virtually all the computation bounded reducibilities ≤ r , showing that a set is ≤ r -introreducible if and only if it belongs to the minimum ≤ r -degree. It also holds for most unbounded reducibilities like ≤ m , ≤ c , ≤ d , ≤ p , ≤ tt , etc., but it does not hold for ≤ T . A very strong way for a set L to fail being ≤ r -introreducible is that L is not ≤ r -reducible to any coinfinite subset of L . We call such sets ≤ r -introimmune. It is known that ≤ T -introimmune sets exist but they are not arithmetical. In this paper we ask for which reducibilities ≤ r there exist arithmetical ≤ r -introimmune sets. We show that they exist for the reducibilities ≤ c and ≤ N m . Finally, we prove separation results between introimmunities.	computability theory;computation;existential quantification;p (complexity);polynomial;recursion;time complexity	Patrizio Cintioli;Riccardo Silvestri	2002	Theory of Computing Systems	10.1007/s00224-002-1040-z	time complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;product order;computability theory;comparability;computer science;mathematics;directed set;algorithm	Theory	8.294894276974011	20.378269352694527	92267

The prototype described in this paper represents the integration of automatic passenger counting with automatic vehicle location to allow the automatic collection of transit system performance. The system involves the incorporation of RF/ID tags into bus passes for the purpose of improving the methods of data collection regarding transit users. Passengers carrying the tags can then be uniquely identified. In addition, RF/ID tags are placed at the bus stops to track the movement of busses along the route. This paper details the system hardware and software architecture, the functionality of the system, passenger and cost considerations, and the application of the system for possible use in route control strategies.	algorithm;automatic vehicle location;database;prototype;rf modulator;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);simulation;software architecture;software prototyping	Manuel D.

9cb7bf86d95914b4869960a714825aeeb404df52	adversarial wifi sensing		Wireless devices are everywhere, at home, at the office, and on the street. Devices are bombarding us with transmissions across a wide range of RF frequencies from a few kilohertz to terahertz. Many of these invisible transmissions pass through our bodies, while others reflect off, carrying information about our location, movement, and other physiological properties. While they are a boon to medical professionals with carefully calibrated instruments, they may also be revealing private data about us to potential attackers nearby. In this paper, we examine the problem of adversarial WiFi sensing, and consider whether our wireless reflections pose a real risk to our personal privacy. We identify an adversarial localization attack, where bad actors using smartphones can localize and track individuals in their home or office from outside walls, by leveraging reflections of ambient WiFi transmissions. We experimentally validate this attack in 11 realworld locations, and show user tracking with high accuracy.

Cellular automata [9], Lindenmayer systems [18], systolic trellis automata [3], Russian parallel [4] and Indian parallel [4] grammars are some examples of such models based on formal language and automata theories. In these devices the parallelism is local. Symbols are rewritten independently of each other. No major cooperation between the parallel processes occurs, although, for instance, in L-systems with interactions some minor cooperation appears. However, the development of massively parallel processing systems increased the importance of interprocessor communication in the new generation computer design. Communication plays a major role in parallel processing architectures, where inappropriate interconnection topologies could lengthen the paths of messages, reduce the system reliability and introduce most embarassing performance limitations. Cooperating /distributed grammar systems are an attempt of modelling the process of communication [2]. They consist of a system of grammars working together to produce words of a language. Each of the grammars rewrites the sentential form until a certain condition is met. Then it passes it to the next grammar, and so on, until a terminal string is obtained. The model captures the main features of a communication process, but the individual grammars work sequentially in the sense that, at each moment, only one grammar is allowed to rewrite the sentential form. Parallel Communicating Grammar Systems are aimed to combine the notions of parallelism and communication into a suitable model for theoretical investigation of the properties of parallel processing systems.

a648a0f1a9ea6c00a11dd881ab7e1ae2fdf0fa48	privacy-preserving planarity testing of distributed graphs		We study the problem of privacy-preserving planarity testing of distributed graphs. The setting involves several parties that hold private graphs on the same set of vertices, and an external mediator that helps with performing the computations. Their goal is to test whether the union of their private graphs is planar, but in doing so each party wishes to deny from his peers any information on his own private edge set beyond what is implied by the final output of the computation. We present a privacy-preserving protocol for that purpose which is based on the Hanani-Tutte Theorem. That theorem enables translating the planarity question into the question of whether a specific system of linear equations over the field F2 is solvable. Our protocol uses a diverse cryptographic toolkit which includes techniques such as homomorphic encryption, oblivious Gaussian elimination, and private set intersection. This is the first time that a solution to this problem is presented.	algorithm;clique (graph theory);clique problem;computation;cryptography;decision problem;directed graph;emoticon;gaussian elimination;graph coloring;graph isomorphism problem;hanani–tutte theorem;homomorphic encryption;linear equation;malware;maximal set;planar graph;planarity testing;privacy;scalability;semiconductor industry;system of linear equations;tutte theorem;vertex (graph theory)	Guy Barshap;Tamir Tassa	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-95729-6_9	mathematics;system of linear equations;cryptography;planarity testing;discrete mathematics;vertex (geometry);gaussian elimination;homomorphic encryption;secure multi-party computation;intersection (set theory)	Theory	8.155675880542118	25.3641195403301	94431

The matrices representing quantum gates, and the vectors modeling qubit states grow exponentially with an increase in the number of qubits. However, by using a novel data structure called the Quantum Information Decision Diagram (QuIDD) that exploits the structure of quantum operators, a useful subset of operator matrices and state vectors can be represented in a form that grows polynomially with the number of qubits. This subset contains, but is not limited to, any equal superposition of n qubits, any computational basis state, n-qubit Pauli matrices, and n-qubit Hadamard matrices. It does not, however, contain the discrete Fourier transform (employed in Shor’s algorithm) and some oracles used in Grover’s algorithm. We first introduce and motivate decision diagrams and QuIDDs. We then analyze the runtime and memory complexity of QuIDD operations. Finally, we empirically validate QuIDD-based simulation by means of a general-purpose quantum computing simulator QuIDDPro implemented in Cþþ. We simulate various instances of Grover’s algorithm with QuIDDPro, and the results demonstrate that QuIDDs asymptotically outperform all other known simulation techniques. Our simulations also show that well-known worst-case instances of classical searching can be circumvented in many specific cases by data compression techniques.	algorithmic efficiency;best, worst and average case;computation;computer;data compression;data structure;diagram;discrete fourier transform;exptime;emoticon;experiment;hadamard transform;integer factorization;measurement in quantum mechanics;pauli group;persistence (computer science);persistent data structure;polynomial;quantum fourier transform;quantum algorithm;quantum computing;quantum decoherence;quantum gate;quantum information;quantum simulator;qubit;requirement;root of unity;shor's algorithm;simulation;time complexity	George F.

We present a multi-core tree-based compression method, which works by leveraging sharing among sub-vectors of state vectors. An algorithmic analysis of both worst-case and optimal compression ratios shows the potential to compress even large states to a small constant on average (8 bytes). Our experiments demonstrate that this holds up in practice: the median compression ratio of 279 measured experiments is within 17% of the optimum for tree compression, and five times better than the median compression ratio of Spin's Collapse compression. Our algorithms are implemented in the LTSmin tool, and our experiments show that for model checking, multi-core tree compression pays its own way: it comes virtually without overhead compared to the fastest hash table-based methods.	algorithm;automatic variable;benchmark (computing);best, worst and average case;byte;central processing unit;control system;emoticon;experiment;fastest;hash table;heuristic;hierarchical database model;high- and low-level;ltsmin;liveness;maximal set;model checking;multi-core processor;mutual exclusion;overhead (computing);parallel computing;reachability;recursion (computer science);scalability;scheduling (computing);self-balancing binary search tree;speedup;time complexity	Alfons Laarman;Jaco van de Pol;Michael Weber	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22306-8_4	data compression;model checking;data compression ratio;hash table;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;data structure;computer science;theoretical computer science;compression ratio;lossless compression;programming language;algorithm	OS	8.69865579380295	30.074547792683664	95108

Moreover, such unique design constraints are often coupled with the requirement of high synchronism among the distributed acquisition units, minimal energy consumption, and large communication bandwidth. Such severe constraints have led scholars to suggest wired centralized monitoring solutions, which have only recently been complemented with wireless technologies. This article suggests a hybrid wireless-wired monitoring system combining the advantages of wireless and wired technologies within a distributed high-frequency-sampling framework. The suggested architecture satisfies the mentioned constraints, thanks to an ad-hoc design of the hardware, the availability of efficient energy management policies, and up-to-date harvesting mechanisms. At the same time, the architecture supports adaptation capabilities by relying on the remote reprogrammability of key application parameters. The proposed architecture has been successfully deployed in the Swiss-Italian Alps to monitor the collapse of rock faces in three geographical areas.	centralized computing;hoc (programming language);sampling (signal processing)	Cesare Alippi;Romolo Camplani;Cristian Galperti;Antonio Marullo;Manuel Roveri	2013	TOSN	10.1145/2489253.2489258	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	3.5460064234183655	31.990443003261674	95273

Industrial low power wireless protocols are one of the key enablers of that revolution but still energy consumption is what is limiting ubiquitous deployments of perpetual and unattended devices. The adoption of energy harvesting technologies is enabling autonomously powered control and monitoring systems on industries, infrastructures, and cities. Yet, putting these systems together require a clear understanding of their capabilities and behavior in order to dimension their energy needs and to contribute to the development of a new generation of self-powered ubiquitous devices. Therefore, this paper discusses, through a use case, the tradeoff to reliably dimension scavenger properties to network requirements and application needs, with the main objective to enable industries to optimize the adoption of that technologies while keeping low technical risks.	block cipher mode of operation;duty cycle;internet;requirement;sampling (signal processing);simulation;spatial variability	Borja Martínez;Marius Monton;Ignasi Vilajosana;Xavier Vilajosana	2016	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2015.2483750	embedded system;synchronization;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;fixed wireless;wireless;computer network	Embedded	3.724954667489138	32.058746864289596	95516

Our analysis reveals that, under reasonable assumptions about query distributions, DIMs scale quite well with network size (both insertion and query costs scale as O(√N)). In detailed simulations, we show that in practice, the insertion and query costs of other alternatives are sometimes an order of magnitude more than the costs of DIMs, even for moderately sized network.

123122e3272a518c839b9a1b0bd67063d645b858	on the computational complexity of partial word automata problems		We consider computational complexity of problems related to partial word automata. Roughly speaking, a partial word is a word in which some positions are unspecified, and a partial word automaton is a finite automaton that accepts a partial word language— here the unspecified positions in the word are represented by a “hole” symbol ⋄. A partial word language L can be transformed into an ordinary language L by using a ⋄-substitution. In particular, we investigate the complexity of the compression or minimization problem for partial word automata, which is known to be NP-hard. We improve on the previously known complexity on this problem, by showing PSPACE-completeness. In fact, it turns out that almost all problems related to partial word automata, such as, e.g., equivalence and universality, are already PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we also study these problems under the further restriction that the involved automata accept only finite languages. In this case, the complexity of the studied problems drop from PSPACE-completeness down to coNP-hardness and containment in Σ 2 depending on the problem investigated.	automaton;co-np;computational complexity theory;finite-state machine;np-hardness;pspace;pspace-complete;partial word;turing completeness;universality probability	Markus Holzer;Sebastian Jakobi;Matthias Wendlandt	2014	Fundam.

6e7cd5a50dfa325f1b6c5ddf0b16beb6379f2fbf	one-way quantum computer simulation	simulation;quantum computing;1wqc	In one-way quantum computation (1WQC) model, universal quantum computations are performed using measurements to designated qubits in a highly entangled state. The choices of bases for these measurements as well as the structure of the entanglements specify a quantum algorithm. As scalable and reliable quantum computers have not been implemented yet, quantum computation simulators are the only widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However, simulating the quantum computations on a standard classical computer in most cases requires exponential memory and time. In this paper, a general direct simulator for 1WQC, called OWQS, is presented. Some techniques such as qubit elimination, pattern reordering and implicit simulation of actions are used to considerably reduce the time and memory needed for the simulations. Moreover, our simulator is adjusted to simulate the measurement patterns with a generalized flow without calculating the measurement probabilities which is called extended one-way quantum computation simulator (EOWQS). Experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed simulators and that OWQS and EOWQS are faster as compared with the well-known quantum circuit simulators, i.e., QuIDDPro and libquantum for simulating 1WQC model.

In this paper, we describe a rock-collapse forecasting system based on a hybrid wireless-wired architecture, where a set of acquisition units is connected through a fieldbus to a base station, which collects and wirelessly transmits acquired measurements to a remote control room. The main features of the proposed rock-collapse forecasting system are the ability to process data sampled at high-frequency rates locally and in real time, the run-time remote reconfigurability of the forecasting application, and the possibility to distribute intelligent processing through the system layers to balance energy consumption and the application performance. Five instances of the proposed system have been deployed along the Swiss-Italian Alps.	fieldbus;pet rock;reconfigurability;remote control;sensor	Cesare Alippi;Giacomo Boracchi;Manuel Roveri	2016	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2015.2429913	embedded system;communications protocol;synchronization;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;forecasting;computer science;engineering;sensor;computer security;statistics;computer network	Robotics	2.6644971786947114	30.793162595796122	96689

For example it has been an open question for some time as to whether the smallest known universal Turing machines of Minsky, Rogozhin, Baiocchi and Kudlek are efficient (polynomial time) simulators of Turing machines. These are some of the most intuitively simple computational devices and previously the best known simulations were exponentially slow. We discuss recent work that shows that these machines are indeed efficient simulators. In addition, another related result shows that Rule 110, a well-known elementary cellular automaton, is efficiently universal. We also discuss some old and new universal program size results, including the smallest known universal Turing machines. We finish the survey with results on generalised and restricted Turing machine models including machines with a periodic background on the tape (instead of a blank symbol), multiple tapes, multiple dimensions, and machines that never write to their tape. We then discuss some ideas for future work.	universal turing machine	Turlough Neary;Damien Woods	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-27660-6_32	linear speedup theorem;combinatorics;turing reduction;time hierarchy theorem;pspace;turing machine examples;nspace;computer science;turing machine;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;universal turing machine;turing completeness;description number;mathematics;multitape turing machine;probabilistic turing machine;dspace;computational complexity theory;non-deterministic turing machine;algorithm;quantum turing machine;register machine;dtime;super-recursive algorithm	Theory	0.712778298452113	22.649660530454415	96773
19e42fb11e1ffabf004d74f4a534a7cd41aef5d0	more efficient queries in pcps for np and improved approximation hardness of maximum csp	computer and information science;query complexity;data och informationsvetenskap;correctness proof	In the PCP model, a verifier is supposed to probabilistically decide if a given input belongs to some language by posing queries to a purported proof of this fact. The probability that the verifier accepts an input in the language given a correct proof is called the completeness c; the probability that the verifier rejects an input not in the language given any proof is called the soundness s. For a verifier posing q queries to the proof, the amortized query complexity is defined by q / log2(c/s) if the proof is coded in binary. It is a measure of the average “efficiency” of the queries in the following sense: An ideal query should preserve the completeness and halve the soundness. If this were the case for all queries, the amortized query complexity would be exactly one.#R##N##R##N#Samorodnitsky and Trevisan [STOC 2000] gave a q-query PCP for NP with amortized query complexity 1+2/ $\sqrt{q}+\varepsilon$ for any constant e > 0. In this paper, we examine to what extent their result can be sharpened. Using the layered label cover problem recently introduced by Dinur et al. [STOC 2003], we devise a new “outer verifier” that allows us to construct an “inner verifier” that uses the query bits more efficiently than earlier verifiers. This enables us to construct a PCP for NP that queries q positions in the proof and has amortized query complexity $1+2/ \sqrt{q}+\varepsilon$. As an immediate corollary, we also obtain an improved hardness of approximation result for the Maximum q-CSP problem.#R##N##R##N#Since the improvement compared to previous work is moderate, we then examine if there is an underlying reason for this. Our construction in this paper follows a paradigm for query efficient PCPs for NP outlined by many previous researchers and it combines a state-of-the-art “outer verifier” with a natural candidate for a query efficient “inner verifier”. We prove in the full version of this paper that all natural attempts to construct more query efficient versions of our verifier are doomed to fail. This implies that significantly new ideas regarding proof composition and encoding of PCP proofs are required to construct PCPs for NP that are more query efficient than the one we propose in his paper.	approximation;np (complexity)	Lars Engebretsen;Jonas Holmerin	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-31856-9_16	query optimization;discrete mathematics;probabilistically checkable proof;interactive proof system;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm;information and computer science	Theory	9.715384954756313	20.310585006856734	97195

fe7f2056e7c7b95fbadfbe7c0264386a80c8c8a0	computational learning theory		In this paper we study the question how many queries are needed to “halve a given version space”. In other words: how many queries are needed to extract from the learning environment the one bit of information that rules out fifty percent of the concepts which are still candidates for the unknown target concept. We relate this problem to the classical exact learning problem. For instance, we show that lower bounds on the number of queries needed to halve a version space also apply to randomized learners (whereas the classical adversary arguments do not readily apply). Furthermore, we introduce two new combinatorial parameters, the halving dimension and the strong halving dimension, which determine the halving complexity (modulo a small constant factor) for two popular models of query learning: learning by a minimum adequate teacher (equivalence queries combined with membership queries) and learning by counterexamples (equivalence queries alone). These parameters are finally used to characterize the additional power provided by membership queries (compared to the power of equivalence queries alone). All investigations are purely information-theoretic and ignore computational issues.	adversary (cryptography);computation;computational learning theory;division by two;information theory;modulo operation;randomized algorithm;randomized rounding;turing completeness;version space learning	Jan van Leeuwen;David P.

This game family can be interpreted in many different game-theoretic settings, ranging from zero-player automata to a more economic setting of team multiplayer games with hidden information. Each setting gives rise to a model of computation that we show corresponds to a classic complexity class. In this way we obtain a uniform framework for modeling various complexities of computation as games. Most surprising among our results is that a game with three players and a bounded amount of state can simulate any (infinite) Turing computation, making the game undecidable. Our framework also provides a more graphical, less formulaic viewpoint of computation. This graph model has been shown to be particularly appropriate for reducing to many existing combinatorial games and puzzles - such as Sokoban, rush hour, river crossing, tipover, the warehouseman's problem, pushing blocks, hinged-dissection reconfiguration, Amazons, and Konane (hawaiian checkers) - which have an intrinsically planar structure. Our framework makes it substantially easier to prove completeness of such games in their appropriate complexity classes.	automata theory;complexity class;directed graph;game of the amazons;game theory;model of computation;simulation;sokoban;turing;undecidable problem	Erik D.

In this system, two all-powerful noncommunicating provers convince a randomizing polynomial time verifier in polynomial time that the inputx belongs to the languageL. We show that the class of languages having tow-prover interactive proof systems is nondeterministic exponential time. We also show that to prove membership in languages inEXP, the honest provers need the power ofEXP only. The first part of the proof of the main result extends recent techniques of polynomial extrapolation used in the single prover case by Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, Nisan, and Shamir. The second part is averification scheme for multilinearity of a function in several variables held by an oracle and can be viewed as an independent result onprogram verification.

We give a new structure theorem for such identities that improves the known deterministic <i>d</i><sup><i>k</i></sup><sup><i>O</i>(<i>k</i>)</sup>-time blackbox identity test over rationals [Kayal and Saraf, 2009] to one that takes <i>d</i><sup><i>O</i>(<i>k</i><sup>2</sup>)</sup>-time. Our structure theorem essentially says that the number of independent variables in a real depth-3 identity is very small. This theorem affirmatively settles the strong rank conjecture posed by Dvir and Shpilka [2006].  We devise various algebraic tools to study depth-3 identities, and use these tools to show that any depth-3 identity contains a much smaller <i>nucleus identity</i> that contains most of the “complexity” of the main identity. The special properties of this nucleus allow us to get near optimal rank bounds for depth-3 identities. The most important aspect of this work is relating a field-dependent quantity, the <i>Sylvester-Gallai rank bound</i>, to the rank of depth-3 identities. We also prove a high-dimensional Sylvester-Gallai theorem for all fields, and get a general depth-3 identity rank bound (slightly improving previous bounds).	algorithm;chinese room;fan-in;linear algebra;logp machine;neeraj kayal;suicidegirls;sylvester–gallai theorem;time complexity	Nitin Saxena;Seshadhri Comandur	2010	2010 IEEE 51st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science	10.1145/2528403	ideal theory;variables;ideal;multidimensional analysis;mathematical optimization;combinatorial design;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;complexity;chinese remainder theorem;mathematics;deterministic system;incidence geometry;theory;algorithm;statistics;algebra	Theory	9.921612927112479	23.763467359514667	97763

It is shown that no set has minimal degree with respect to polynomial many-one or Turing reducibility. This extends a result of Ladner in which only recursive sets are considered. A polynomial reducibility ≤<supscrpt><italic>h</italic></supscrpt><subscrpt><italic>T</italic></subscrpt> is defined. This reducibility is a strengthening of polynomial Turing reducibility, and its properties relate to the P = ? NP question. For this new reducibility, a set of minimal degree is constructed under the assumption that P = NP. However, the set constructed is nonrecursive, and it is shown that no recursive set is of minimal ≤ <supscrpt><italic>h</italic></supscrpt><subscrpt><italic>T</italic></subscrpt> degree.	degree (graph theory);many-one reduction;p versus np problem;polynomial-time reduction;recursive language;recursive set;turing reduction;tutte polynomial	Steven Homer	1987	J.

Classically, such problems are modelled as static balls into bins processes, where <i>m</i> balls (tasks) are to be distributed to <i>n</i> bins (servers). In a seminal work, [Azar et al.; JoC'99] proposed the sequential strategy Greedy[d] for <i>n</i> = <i>m</i>. When thrown, a ball queries the load of <i>d</i> random bins and is allocated to a least loaded of these. [Azar et al.; JoC'99] showed that <i>d</i>=2 yields an exponential improvement compared to <i>d</i>=1. [Berenbrink et al.; JoC'06] extended this to <i>m ⇒ n</i>, showing that the maximal load difference is independent of <i>m</i> for <i>d</i>=2 (in contrast to <i>d</i>=1).  We propose a new variant of an <i>infinite</i> balls into bins process. In each round an expected number of λ <i>n</i> new balls arrive and are distributed (in parallel) to the bins and each non-empty bin deletes one of its balls. This setting models a set of servers processing incoming requests, where clients can query a server's current load but receive no information about parallel requests. We study the Greedy[d] distribution scheme in this setting and show a strong self-stabilizing property: For <i>any</i> arrival rate λ=λ(n) < 1, the system load is time-invariant. Moreover, for <i>any</i> (even super-exponential) round <i>t</i>, the maximum system load is (w.h.p.) O(1 over 1-λ•log<i>n</i> over 1-λ) for <i>d</i>=1 and O(log <i>n</i> over 1-λ) for <i>d</i>=2. In particular, Greedy[2] has an exponentially smaller system load for high arrival rates.	centralized computing;distributed computing;load (computing);maximal set;queueing theory;self-stabilization;server (computing);time complexity;time-invariant system	Petra Berenbrink;Tom Friedetzky;Peter Kling;Frederik Mallmann-Trenn;Lars Nagel;Christopher Wastell	2016		10.1145/2933057.2933092	self-stabilization;markov chain;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;load balancing;dynamical system;mathematics	Theory	7.948820809234501	30.488416442923263	99423

Specifically, it is shown that if one restricts attention to three-state automata allowing transitions only between adjacent states, then no artificial randomization is required in the middle state of the optimal machine. The success in this problem of what will be called simultaneous induction suggests the possibility of obtaining characterizations of optimal automata in more general problems by similar techniques.

We focus on deterministic chains, since nondeterministic transducer chains of length two define the recursively enumerable sets. Deterministic chains recognize in linear time a superset of context-free deterministic languages. This family is $\mathcal{CH}$ closed under Boolean operations, disjoint shuffle,and reverse deterministic pushdown translation, but not under homomorphism. Equivalent definitions of the family in terms of composition of syntax-directed translation schemes and control languages are considered. The family is a strict hierarchy ordered by the length of the chain. The complexity of $\mathcal{CH}$ is obviously linear, but not all linear-time parsable languages are in $\mathcal{CH}$. On the other hand it strictly includes the Boolean closure of deterministic languages.

We deal with regular CNF formulas and use a generalized Davis-Putnam (DP) procedure for testing their satisfiability. We establish the location of the threshold for different cardinalities of the truth value set and show experimentally that the location of the threshold increases logarithmically in the cardinality of the truth value set. We also provide a theoretical explanation of this fact. The DP procedure and the classical random 3-SAT problem appear to be a particular case of our approach.	boolean satisfiability problem	Ramón Béjar;Felip Manyà	1999		10.1007/BFb0095115	phase transition;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	5.423930609889086	20.074053960900216	99793

While the massive parallelism of DNA strands makes exhaustive searches possible, complementarity constitutes a powerful computational tool. It is also very fruitful to view complementarity as a language-theoretic operation: “bad” words obtained through a generative process are replaced by their complementary ones. This idea seems particularly suitable for Lindenmayer systems. D0L systems augmented with a specific complementarity transition, Watson?Crick D0L systems, have turned out to be a most interesting model and have already been extensively studied. A language is generated by a Watson?Crick D0L system as a sequence of words. Consequently, the systems can be applied also to compute functions in a natural way. In the present paper, attention is focused on uni-transitional systems, where at most one complementarity transition takes place in the generated sequence. In spite of their seeming simplicity, uni-transitional systems represent a vast extension of ordinary D0L systems. This becomes apparent in their capacity of defining functions. Quite remarkably, all basic decision problems for uni-transitional systems are algorithmically equivalent among themselves, as well as equivalent to a celebrated open problem. We investigate also a simpler case of systems with regular triggers, as well as pose some open problems.		Arto Salomaa	2002	Theor. Comput.

This concept finds many applications, e.g maximal frequent itemsets, minimal functional dependencies, emerging patterns between consecutive database instances and materialized view selection. For large transactions and relational databases defined on n items or attributes, the running time of any border computations are mainly dominated by the time T (for standard sequential algorithms) required to test the interestingness, in general the frequencies, of sets of candidates.  In this paper we propose a general parallel algorithm for computing borders whatever the application is. We prove the efficiency of our algorithm by showing that: (i) it generates exactly the same number of candidates as the standard sequential algorithm and, (ii) if the interestingness test time of a candidate is bounded by Δ then for a multi-processor shared memory machine with p cores, we prove that the total interestingness time Tp < T/p + 2 Δ n. We implemented our algorithm in the maximal frequent itemset (MFI) mining setting and our experiments confirm our theoretical performance guarantee.	association rule learning;computation;experiment;functional dependency;materialized view;maximal set;multiprocessing;parallel algorithm;relational database;sequential algorithm;shared memory;time complexity	Nicolas Hanusse;Sofian Maabout	2011		10.1145/2063576.2063814	materialized view;multi-core processor;relational database;computer science;theoretical computer science;parallel;data mining;database;parallel algorithm;functional dependency	DB	7.845979422725399	29.58800521919921	100289

We discuss accepting and analyzing versions of such grammar systems with context-free productions. In accepting parallel communicating grammar systems, rules of the form α→A with a word α and a nonterminal A are applied as in the generating case, and the language consists of all terminal words which can derive the axiom. We consider the usual variant and a restricted variant of accepting parallel communicating grammar systems and prove that all types of these accepting grammar systems characterize the family of recursively enumerable languages if the usual variant is considered, and that of context-free languages if the restricted one is used. The first result also holds if λ-rules are forbidden. Moreover, we study analyzing parallel communicating grammar systems the derivations of which perform the generating counterparts backwards. This requires a modification of the concept of generating derivation yielding to strong-returning parallel communicating grammar systems which also generate the family of recursively enumerable languages.	grammar systems theory	Henning Bordihn;Jürgen Dassow;György Vaszil	2000	Grammars	10.1023/A:1009958707255	grammar systems theory;natural language processing;context-sensitive grammar;id/lp grammar;synchronous context-free grammar;link grammar;operator-precedence grammar;regular grammar;computer science;affix grammar;regular tree grammar;extended affix grammar;mathematics;context-free language;emergent grammar;linguistics;context-free grammar;programming language;attribute grammar;unrestricted grammar;ambiguous grammar;adaptive grammar;grammar-based code;mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism;algorithm	NLP	-1.3714680701358521	18.56221132837214	100627

The learner has access to label queries; a label query with input string w returns both the output and the label of the state reached by w. Because different automata may have the same output behavior, we consider the case in which the teacher may “unfold” M to an output equivalent machine M ′ and label the states of M ′ for the learner. We give lower and upper bounds on the number of label queries to learn the output behavior of M in these different scenarios. We also briefly consider the case of randomly labeled automata with randomly chosen transition functions.	anamorphism;automaton;finite-state machine;randomness	Dana Angluin;Leonor Becerra-Bonache;Adrian-Horia Dediu;Lev Reyzin	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04414-4_17	discrete mathematics;quantum finite automata;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;ω-automaton;mathematics;finite-state machine;timed automaton;algorithm	Theory	3.24588001429719	18.28275665315474	100752

79d9bab0c97c8feab87bb1bb24409626a36467bb	implementing parallel shortest-paths algorithms		We have implemented a parallel version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm for the single-source shortest paths problem. Our software has been developed on the CM-5 using C with CMMD communication primitives. We have empirically compared the eeciency of our implementation with a sequential implementation of the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm developed by Cherkassky, Goldberg and Radzik. We have performed our experiments using fty randomly generated graphs with vertex counts in the range between 2 10 and 2 15 and edge counts in the range between 2 11 and 2 21. In our experiments, the parallel implementation becomes faster than the sequential implementation when the average degree of the input graphs exceeds 2 5 or 2 6. For the dense graphs in our test suite, we obtain speedups of up to 3.3 on 32 processors and up to 8.3 on 128 processors. In the implementation we discuss in this paper, several design decisions were taken in view of the limited time we had to complete a working version of our software. For example, instead of performing any kind of dynamic load balancing, we try to keep the computation load balanced by applying a straightforward data distribution scheme at the beginning of the computation. Moreover, in the code that runs on each processor, we avoid any sophisticated data structures and only use linear arrays. We are currently experimenting with alternative implementations that may lead to improved speedups, particularly on the denser graphs of our test suite.	bellman–ford algorithm;central processing unit;computation;connection machine;data structure;experiment;load balancing (computing);procedural generation;shortest path problem;test suite	Marios C.

To prove termination, N.Dershowitz [1] introduces quasi-simplification orderings that are monotonic extensions of the embedding relation. He proves that they are well quasi-ordered and a fortiori well-founded by using a theorem from Kruskal [5], which shows that file simple tree insertion order """"rio (defined below) is a well quasi-ordering over a certain set of trees. (Well-founded means that every nonempty set contains at least one minimal element; well quasi-ordered means that every nonempty set contains at least one and at most a finite number of noncomparable minimal elements.) Dershowitz's method is powerful, but cannot be used when the rewriting system .contains a rule whose right hand side is embedded in the left hand side. The purpose of this paper is to overcdme this constraint, when the rewriting system uses a finite ranked aiphabet, by generalizing Kruskal's theorem to obtain a family of quasi-orders TIO(S, co) that are strictly included in TIO but are still well quasi-orders. This generalization is parallel to the generalization described in the next paragraph. G. Higman [3] inoludes a well-known subsidiary result, Theorem 4.3, which has the following result as a special case: The set of all words Y.* over the finite alphabet E is well quasi-ordered by the simple word insertion order WIO.

0db00626c2011bebcd5e5ef1d37399b061eaa521	delayed path coupling and generating random permutations via distributed stochastic processes	stochastic process;approximation;probability distribution;random permutation;bounding box	We analyze various stochastic processes for generating permutations almost uniformly at random in distributed and parallel systems. All our protocols are simple, elegant and are based on performing disjoint transpositions executed in parallel. The challenging problem of our concern is to prove that the output configurations in our processes reach almost uniform probability distribution very rapidly , i.e. in a (low) polylogarithmic time. For the analysis of the aforementioned protocols we develop a novel technique, called delayed path coupling , for proving rapid mixing of Markov chains. Our approach is an extension of the path coupling method of Bubley and Dyer. We apply delayed path coupling to three stochastic processes for generating random permutations. For one process, we apply standard (though non-trivial) coupling arguments, for the second one we construct a non-Markovian coupling, and for the third one we prove the existence of a non-Markovian coupling. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first non-trivial applications of non-Markovian coupling for proving rapid mixing of Markov chains. We apply our analysis in diverse areas. We develop a simple permutation network of a polylogarithmic depth generating permutations with almost uniform distribution. A simple EREW PRAM algorithm generating random permutations in time O(log log n) with O(n log n) processors follows. We improve technique of cryptographic defense against traffic analysis by showing that the underlying stochastic process converges in time O(log n) (instead of polylogarithmic time) and thereby dramatically reduce the size of a security parameter. Other applications include load sharing in distributed systems, design of fault resistant systems, and parallel algorithms generating random permutations for models with restricted concurrent writes/reads.	central processing unit;cryptography;distributed computing;loose coupling;markov chain;parallel algorithm;parallel random-access machine;polylogarithmic function;security parameter;stochastic process;time complexity;traffic analysis	Artur Czumaj;Przemyslawa Kanarek;Miroslaw Kutylowski;Krzysztof Lorys	1999			independent and identically distributed random variables;random variate;probability distribution;random graph;stochastic process;probability theory;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;random permutation;discrete mathematics;random field;stochastic ordering;continuous-time stochastic process;convergence of random variables;minimum bounding box;stochastic optimization;random permutation statistics;approximation;random function;stable process;stochastic simulation;mathematics;stationary sequence;golomb–dickman constant;statistics	Theory	8.59180648737137	26.650406596093834	101274
18f45f08abef1ff93e2755af14c7847755759505	dynamic bitmap index recompression through workload-based optimizations	indexing;optimization;bitmap;compression;modeling	Many large-scale read-only databases and data warehouses use bitmap indices in an effort to speed up data analysis. These indices have the dual properties of compressibility and being able to leverage fast bit-wise operations for query processing. Numerous hybrid run-length encoding compression schemes have been proposed that greatly compress the index and enable querying without the need to decompress. Typically, these schemes align their compression with the computer architecture's word size to further accelerate queries.  Previously, we introduced Variable Length Compression (VLC), which uses a general encoding that can achieve better compression than word-aligned schemes. However, VLC's querying efficiency can vary widely due to mismatched alignment of compressed columns. In this paper, we present an optimizer which recompresses the bitmap over time. Based on query history, our approach allows the VLC user to specify the priority of compression versus query efficiency, then possibly recompress the bitmap accordingly. In an empirical study using scientific data sets, we showed that our approach was able to achieve both better compression ratios and query speedup over WAH and PLWAH. On the largest data set, our VLC optimizer compressed up to 1.73x better than WAH, and 1.46x over PLWAH. We also show a slight improvement in query efficiency in most experiments, while observing lucrative (11x to 16x) speedup in special cases.	align (company);bitmap index;column (database);computer architecture;database;experiment;mathematical optimization;read-only memory;run-length encoding;speedup;vlc media player	Fredton Doan;David Chiu;Brasil Perez Lukes;Jason Sawin;Gheorghi Guzun;Guadalupe Canahuate	2013		10.1145/2513591.2513641	search engine indexing;systems modeling;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;database;bitmap;compression	DB	9.192629392822036	29.15938251032183	101362

Given the severity of potential climate changes, environmental impact on cities, and pollution, it is a domain where sensor networks can have great impact and as such, is getting more and more attention. Current data collection techniques are indeed rather limited and make use of very expensive sensing stations, leading to a lack of appropriate observations. In this paper, we present SensorScope, a collaborative project between environmental and network researchers, that aims at providing an efficient and inexpensive out-of-the-box environmental monitoring system, based on a wireless sensor network. We especially focus on data gathering and present the hardware and network architecture of SensorScope.

7e751e31465dd68ba516da50742a6fac05da8b47	decidable and expressive classes of probabilistic automata		Hierarchical probabilistic automata (HPA) are probabilistic automata whose states are partitioned into levels such that for any state and input symbol, at most one transition with non-zero probability goes to a state at the same level, and all others go to states at a higher level. We present expressiveness and decidability results for 1-level HPAs that work on both finite and infinite length input strings; in a 1-level HPA states are divided into only two levels (0 and 1). Our first result shows that 1-level HPAs, with acceptance threshold 1/2 (both in the finite and infinite word cases), can recognize non-regular languages. This result is surprising in the light of the following two facts. First, all earlier proofs demonstrating the recognition of non-regular languages by probabilistic automata employ either more complex automata or irrational acceptance thresholds or HPAs with more than two levels. Second, it has been previously shown that simple probabilistic automata (SPA), which are 1-level HPAs whose accepting states are all at level 0, recognize only regular languages. We show that even though 1-level HPAs with threshold 1/2 are very expressive (in that they recognize non-regular languages), the non-emptiness and non-universality problems are both decidable in EXPTIME. To the best our knowledge, this is the first such decidability result for any subclass of probabilistic automata that accept non-regular languages. We prove that these decision problems are also PSPACE-hard. Next, we present a new sufficient condition when 1-level HPAs recognize regular languages (in both the finite and infinite cases). Finally, we show that the emptiness and universality problems for this special class of HPAs is PSPACE-complete.	alphabet (formal languages);automata theory;cns;client–server model;cobham's thesis;decision problem;exptime;goto;ibm notes;markov chain;microsoft customer care framework;pspace;pspace-complete;prasad v. tetali;probabilistic turing machine;probabilistic automaton;regular language;server (computing);universal turing machine;universality probability	Rohit Chadha;A.

This paper presents a graphical means of identifying those signals for design of a supervision system by analysing the causal structure in the bond graph model of a process. The global fault isolation scheme is initially implemented at a central monitoring system based on the alarm states generated at distributed controlling units. In safety critical systems, to minimise dependence on network communication, causality analysis is used to identify appropriate sensors that lead to information decoupling between various localised units of the process. Consequently, each controlling unit, called a smart station, is able to perform its own fault isolation and Fault Tolerant Control (FTC). The central monitoring system is used only for supervision of interfaces between different smart stations and operator mode management.	algorithm;control system;fault tolerance	Arun K.

Our approach requires some special features of the underlying group. In particular, its order is unknown and it contains a subgroup in which the discrete logarithm problem is tractable. Therefore, our instantiation holds in the class group of a non maximal order of an imaginary quadratic field. Its algebraic structure makes it possible to obtain such a linearly homomorphic scheme whose message space is the whole set of integers modulo a prime p and which supports an unbounded number of additions modulo p from the ciphertexts. A notable difference with previous works is that, for the first time, the security does not depend on the hardness of the factorization of integers. As a consequence, under some conditions, the prime p can be scaled to fit the application needs.	cobham's thesis;computational diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman problem;discrete logarithm;homomorphic encryption;imaginary time;maximal set;modulo operation;universal instantiation	Guilhem Castagnos;Fabien Laguillaumie	2015	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Crypto	8.04932938695011	25.77918326035328	102666

Under appropriately chosen assumptions on the underlying family ${cal T}$ of transductions, we establish elementary, decidability, and complexity properties of the corresponding family ${cal L}({cal T})$ of languages generated by $cal T$-grammars. These results are special instances of slightly more general properties of so-called $Gamma$-controlled $cal T$-grammars, since regular control does not increase the generating power of $cal T$-grammars. In a $Gamma$-controlled $cal T$-grammar we restrict the iteration of $cal T$-transductions to those sequences of transductions that belong to a given control language, taken from a family $Gamma$ of control languages.

These functions are clearly monotone. Howev er, the naive way of computing them is adding the weights of the satisfied variables and checking if the sum is greater than the threshold; this algorithm is inherently non-monotone since addition is a nonmonotone function. In this work we by-pass this addition step and construct a polynomial size logarith m c depth unbounded fan-in monotone circuit for every weighted threshold function, i.e., we show that we ighted threshold functions are in mAC. (To the best of our knowledge, prior to our work no polynomial mon otone circuits were known for weighted threshold functions.) Our monotone circuits are applicable for the cryptographic tool of secret sharing schemes . Using general results for compiling monotone circuits (Yao, 1989 ) and monotone formulae (Benaloh and Leichter, 1990) into secret sharing schemes, we get secret sha ring schemes for every weighted threshold access structure. Specifically, we get: (1) information-th eoretic secret sharing schemes where the size of each share is quasi-polynomial in the number of users, and (2) computational secret sharing schemes where the size of each share is polynomial in the number of use rs.	access structure;algorithm;circuit complexity;compiler;cryptography;fan-in;numerical aperture;polynomial;quasi-polynomial;secret sharing;yao graph;monotone	Amos Beimel;Enav Weinreb	2006	Inf.

The objects now are not Boolean functions or decision problems, but (families of) multivariate polynomials over an arbitrary ground field.

Now Valiant's central hypothesis is that some p-definable polynomials are not p-computable (corresponding to problems not in P). Valiant's hypothesis implies that the permanent is not p-computable (in characteristic different from two). As early as 1913, P61ya and Szeg5 considered the problem whether the permanent can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix.

We identify several classes of CSPs that encompass many practical problems and for which symmetry breaking for various forms of value or variable interchangeability is tractable using dedicated search procedures. We also show the limits of efficient symmetry breaking for such dominance-detection schemes by proving intractability results for some classes of CSPs.	cobham's thesis;constraint satisfaction problem;expspace;symmetry breaking;time complexity	Pierre Flener;Justin Pearson;Meinolf Sellmann;Pascal Van Hentenryck;Magnus Ågren	2008	Constraints	10.1007/s10601-008-9059-7	mathematical optimization;symmetry breaking;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;communicating sequential processes;mathematics;programming language;constraint satisfaction problem	AI	8.053508192289986	18.52255951784882	103645

In this paper we develop techniques to attack the termination and complexity problems of confluent one-rule string-rewriting systems. With given such a system we associate another rewriting system over another alphabet. The behaviour of the two systems is closely related and the termination problem for the new system is sometimes easier than for the original system.

For fimction coml)utation , many examples are known in which randomization allows considerable savings in resources like space and time over deterministic algorithms, or even """"only"""" simplifies them. But to what extent is this seeming power of randomness over determinism real? Tbe most famous concrete version of this question regards the power of B P P , the class problems solvable by probabilistic polynomial time algorithms making small constant error. We know nothing beyond the trivial relation P C_ B P P C E X P , so both P = B P P (read """"randomness is useless"""") or B P P = E X P (read """"randomness is all-powerful"""") are currently equally possible. A major problem is shrinking this gap in our knowledge, or at the very least eliminating the (proposterous) second possibility. A fundamental discovery (that emerged in the early 80's in the sequence of seminal papers [18, 4, 19]) regarding this problem is the """"hardness versus randomness"""" paradigm. It relates this major problem to another equally important one: are there natural hard functions? Roughly speaking, """"computationally hard"""" functions can be used to construct """"efficient pseudo-random generators"""". These in turn lower the randomness requirements of any efficient probabilistic algorithm, allowing for a nontrivial deternfinistic simulation. Thus, under various complexity a.qsumptions, randomness is weak or even """"useless"""", and the challenge becomes to use the'weakest possible assumption, at the hope of finally removing it altogether. Only two methods are known for converting hard functions into t)seudo-random sequences: the BMY-generator (introduced by Blum, Micali and Yao) and the NW-generator (introduced by Nisan and Wigderson). The BMY-generator [4, 19, 8, 9], in which the hardness versus randonmess paradigm first appeared, uses one-way functions. Its construction facilitates using either nonuniform or uniform hardness ~sumptions. The results ar t (informally) summarized below, for nonuiniform assumptions.

If A is an alphabet of k letters, a k-language is a nonempty set of words of length k, that is, a uniform language of length k. By a new construction, we show that the maximal state complexity of a k-language is (k − 1)/(k − 1) + 2 + 1, and every k-language of this complexity is also a uniform language of length k of the maximal state complexity previously known. We then prove that, for every i between minimal and maximal complexities, there is a language of complexity i: for each i we exhibit such a language. We introduce “pi automata” accepting languages whose words are permutations of the alphabet; the complexities of these languages form a complete hierarchy between k − k + 3 and 2 + 1. We start with an automaton with k−k+3 states and show that states can be added one at a time, until the automaton has 2+1 states. We construct another class of automata, based on k-ary trees, whose languages define a complete hierarchy of complexities between 2 + 1 and the maximal complexity. Here, we start with an automaton with the maximal number of states and remove states one at a time, until an automaton with 2 + 1 states is reached. ∗This research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada under grants no.

13811154a867f61ea8b2fd5162d31fc4c4aa0f2a	relating proof complexity measures and practical hardness of sat	datavetenskap datalogi;computer science	Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers have improved enormously in performance over the last 10–15 years and are today an indispensable tool for solving a wide range of computational problems. However, our understanding of what makes SAT instances hard or easy in practice is still quite limited. A recent line of research in proof complexity has studied theoretical complexity measures such as length, width, and space in resolution, which is a proof system closely related to state-of-the-art conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) SAT solvers. Although it seems like a natural question whether these complexity measures could be relevant for understanding the practical hardness of SAT instances, to date there has been very limited research on such possible connections. This paper sets out on a systematic study of the interconnections between theoretical complexity and practical SAT solver performance. Our main focus is on space complexity in resolution, and we report results from extensive experiments aimed at understanding to what extent this measure is correlated with hardness in practice. Our conclusion from the empirical data is that the resolution space complexity of a formula would seem to be a more fine-grained indicator of whether the formula is hard or easy than the length or width needed in a resolution proof. On the theory side, we prove a separation of general and tree-like resolution space, where the latter has been proposed before as a measure of practical hardness, and also show connections between resolution space and backdoor sets.	backdoor (computing);boolean satisfiability problem;computational problem;conflict-driven clause learning;constraint learning;dspace;experiment;proof calculus;proof complexity;solver	Matti Järvisalo;Arie Matsliah;Jakob Nordström;Stanislav Zivny	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33558-7_25	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;#sat;computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	8.956410045265876	18.701005345053108	104773

The construction of almost everywhere complex recursive functions appears much more difficult than the construction of infinitely often complex recursive functions. There have been found no “natural” examples of recursive functions requiring more than polynomial time for all but finitely many inputs. It is shown that from a single example of a moderately a.e. complex recursive function, one can obtain a.e. very complex recursive functions.	computable function;polynomial;primitive recursive function;recursion (computer science);time complexity;μ-recursive function	John Gill;Manuel Blum	1974	J.

In this paper, we analyse different restricted variants of NEPs that preserve the computational power of the general model. We prove that any recursively enumerable language can be generated by a NEP where the derivation rules can be applied at arbitrarily chosen positions, the control of the communication is done by finite automata with at most three states, and either the rule sets are singletons or the underlying graph is a complete graph. If one uses networks with arbitrary underlying graphs and allows the additional application of insertions and deletions only to the right-most or the to left-most position of the derived words for some nodes, then we only need automata with only one state to control the communication in the network. Clearly, this result is optimal; moreover, finite automata with two states are necessary and sufficient in order to generate all the recursively enumerable languages when the derivation rules can be applied only at arbitrarily chosen positions.	automata theory;british informatics olympiad;central processing unit;computation;computational model;database normalization;directed graph;finite-state machine;noise-equivalent power;recursion;recursively enumerable language;recursively enumerable set	Jürgen Dassow;Florin Manea;Bianca Truthe	2012	Natural Computing	10.1007/s11047-012-9331-z	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;normal-form game;recursively enumerable language;algorithm	Theory	1.3116414468446218	22.92606992098129	105440

This paper develops a new method for proving limits of nonlocal strategies that make use of prior entanglement among players (or, provers, in the terminology of multi-prover interactive proofs). Instead of proving the limits for usual isolated provers who initially share entanglement, this paper proves the limits for """"commuting-operator provers"""", who share private space, but can apply only such operators that are commutative with any operator applied by other provers. Obviously, these commuting-operator provers are at least as powerful as usual isolated but prior-entangled provers, and thus, limits in the model with commuting-operator provers immediately give limits in the usual model with prior-entangled provers. Using this method, we obtain an n-party generalization of the Tsirelson bound for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, for every n. Our bounds are tight in the sense that, in every n-party case, the equality is achievable by a usual nonlocal strategy with prior entanglement. We also apply our method to a three-prover one-round binary interactive proof system for NEXP. Combined with the technique developed by Kempe, Kobayashi, Matsumoto, Toner and Vidick to analyze the soundness of the proof system, it is proved to be NP-hard to distinguish whether the entangled value of a three-prover one-round binary-answer game is equal to one or at most 1-1/p(n) for some polynomial p, where n is the number of questions. This is in contrast to the two-prover one-round binary-answer case, where the corresponding problem is efficiently decidable. Alternatively, NEXP has a three-prover one-round binary interactive proof system with perfect completeness and soundness 1 middot 2-poly."""	computational complexity theory;information theory;interactive proof system;kempe chain;nexptime;np-hardness;nonlocal lagrangian;polynomial;proof calculus;quantum entanglement;quantum information;quantum nonlocality;social inequality;toner;tsirelson's bound	Tsuyoshi Ito;Hirotada Kobayashi;Daniel Preda;Xiaoming Sun;Andrew Chi-Chih Yao	2008	2008 23rd Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity	10.1109/CCC.2008.12	game theory;educational technology;discrete mathematics;quantum information;information theory;computer science;mathematics;physics;algorithm;quantum mechanics;polynomial	Theory	8.276543156005188	23.703885143682232	105956

In this work, we extend its capabilities by implementing methods to manipulate transducers and we go one level higher than existing formal language systems and implement methods to manipulate objects representing classes of independent languages (widely known as code properties). Our methods allow users to define their own code properties and combine them between themselves or with fixed properties such as prefix codes, suffix codes, error detecting codes, etc. The satisfaction and maximality decision questions are solvable for any of the definable properties. The new online system LaSer allows one to query about a code property and obtain the answer in a batch mode. Our work is founded on independence theory as well as the theory of rational relations and transducers, and contributes with improved algorithms on these objects.	algorithm;batch processing;decision problem;formal language;prefix code;python;sensor;transducer;on-line system	Stavros Konstantinidis;Casey Meijer;Nelma Moreira;Rogério Reis	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40946-7_16	batch processing;theoretical computer science;symbolic computation;regular language;suffix;python (programming language);formal language;computer science;code (cryptography);prefix	PL	-4.282048267671223	19.03507150584108	106246

We show that for a core subset of the language (which considers only communication primitives) termination is decidable. Moreover, we prove that by adding either global priorities or events to this core language, we obtain Turing equivalent languages. The proof is through encodings of Random Access Machines (RAMs), a well known Turing equivalent formalism, into our subsets of BlenX. All the encodings are shown to be correct.

We show that if for all ` ∈ τ we have ` ∈ O(|x|) then Bτ i = FP p i−1(wit, τ̇), those multifunctions computable in polynomial time with at most O(p(`(x))) queries to a Σpi−1 witness oracle for ` ∈ τ and p a polynomial. We use our algebras to obtain independence results in bounded arithmetic. In particular, we show if Si 2 proves Σ b j = PH for some j ≥ i then Si 2 1B(Σ̂bi+1) S2. This implies if PNP 6= PNP (log) then S1 2 does not prove the polynomial hierarchy collapses. We then consider a subtheory, Z, of the well-studied bounded arithmetic theory S2 = ∪iS 2. Using our algebras (mainly the i = 1 variants of our algebras) we establish the following properties of this theory: (1) Z cannot prove the polynomial hierarchy collapses. In fact, even Z+Π̂0-consequences of S2 cannot prove the hierarchy collapses. (2) If Z ⊆ Si 2 for any i then the polynomial hierarchy collapses. (3) If Z proves the polynomial hierarchy is infinite then for all i, Si 2 ` Σpi 6= Πpi .	computable function;legacy plug and play;multi-function printer;ph (complexity);polynomial hierarchy;recursion;theory (mathematical logic);time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Chris Pollett	2000	Ann.

For nondeterministic space classes C above NL, we show that all S:';L-complete sets for C collapse to a single s[;f degree (Le., all S:,;L-complete sets for Care S[i.L-equivalent), and that all S:';NL_ complete sets for Care NL-isomorphic (and thus P-isomorphic).

Innumerable constructions of expander graphs have been found since the pioneering work by Margulis. However, for hypergraphs, no such construction is known. In the talk we construct so-called ”expander relations” that even generalize hypergraphs. The construction uses a type of semidirect product (a generalization of the so-called zig zag product) of relational structures. Our approach is more algorithmic than the known graph expander constructions. We will use these tools to derandomize Erdos’ classical random construction for graphs with large girth and chromatic number and also Nesetril and Rodl’s socalled girth machine. As a complexity theoretical application of this combinatorial result we show that the following two complexity classes are equivalent. One is the class of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP for short). This class essentially contains hypergraph coloring problems. The class MMSNP (Monotone Monadic Strict NP) introduced by Feder and Vardi can also be defined in terms of colorings. A typical language in MMSNP is the language of loopless, undirected graphs which are 2-colorable without monochromatic triangles. Feder and Vardi proved that in a random sense these classes are equivalent. We derandomize this proof.

In this work, we consider a variant of SN P systems with two restrictions: (1) all neurons contain only spikes (neurons are homogeneous in this case, since they can be considered as containers of spikes), while the spiking rules are moved on the synapses; (2) all synapses are homogeneous in the sense that each synapse has the same set of rules. These restrictions correspond to the fact that the SN P system consists of only one kind of neurons and one kind of synapses. The computational power of SN P systems with homogeneous neurons and synapses is investigated. Specifically, it is proved that such systems are Turing universal as both number generating and number accepting devices.	p system;synapse	Keqin Jiang;Wenli Chen;Yuzhou Zhang;Linqiang Pan	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.07.097	bio-inspired computing;random neural network;computer science;membrane computing;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;spiking neural network;p system	ML	1.8337106107527545	24.69959487960015	107202

The current model incorporates a four-layer application technique: string-to-AND/OR pairwise binary bit + fuzzy quantum with noise conversions. This technique promotes a lossless data compression ratio of 2:1 up to values ≈ 3:1, generating a spatiallyefficient compressed data file compared to nowadays data compressors. Data decompression/specific data reconstruction initiates an AND/OR pattern match technique in respect of fuzzy quantum indicators in the binary function field. The reconstruction of data occurs in the 4th layer using encryption methods. It is hypothesized that significant data compression ratio of 2n:1 for n>3:1 ratios, e.g., 32∼64:1 are achievable via fuzzy qubit indexing over classical byte blocks for every bit position fragmented into a ( 1 2 upper + 1 2 lower)-bit noise frequency parallel to its counterpart signal comprised of AND/ORed-bit polarity orientation, ready for an identical data decompression.	algorithm;bit numbering;bitstream;british undergraduate degree classification;byte;code;coding theory;computation;computer simulation;data compression ratio;database transaction;digital media;encode;embedded system;encryption;flux qubit;fractal;interaction;locality of reference;overhead (computing);pattern matching;provable security;quantum computing;quantum mechanics;quantum noise;quantum system;security engineering;service-oriented architecture;text corpus	Philip B.

Furthermore, we study a particular form of the complement problem. Given a nite set of terms, we ask whether its complement can be nitely represented by schematizations, using only the equality predicate without negation. The answer is negative as there are ground terms too complex to be represented by schematizations with limited resources.	algorithm;iteration;microsoft word for mac;presburger arithmetic;subsumption architecture	Miki Hermann;Gernot Salzer	1998		10.1007/BFb0055775	complement;word problem;philosophy of language;parsing;calculus;diophantine equation;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	AI	-2.9061409613248093	19.142287212920017	107597

The instances are ordered and unordered trees with nodes labeled by constant identifiers. The concepts are tree patterns and unions of tree patterns (forests) where all the internal nodes are labeled with constants and the leaves are labeled with constants or variables. A tree pattern matches any tree with its variables replaced with constant subtrees. We show that ordered trees, in which the children are matched in a strict left-to-right order, are exactly learnable from equivalence queries, while ordered forests are learnable from equivalence and membership queries. Unordered trees are exactly learnable from superset queries, and unordered forests are learnable from superset and equivalence queries. Negatively, we also show that each of the query types used is necessary for learning each concept class.	concept class;identifier;pattern matching;tree (data structure);turing completeness	Thomas R.

ca7e272161547c68c38cf6bf12533c49ffeff81d	binary 3-compressible automata		A finite deterministic automaton A = (Q,Σ, δ) is k-compressible if there is a word w ∈ Σ such that the image of the state set Q under the natural action of w is reduced by at least k states. In such case w is called a k-compressing word for A. It is known that, for any alphabet Σ and any k ≥ 2, there exist words that are k-compressing for each k-compressible automaton with the input alphabet Σ. Such words are called k-collapsing. It has been proved that recognizing 2collapsing words over a 2-element alphabet may be done in polynomial time, while recognizing 2-collapsing words over an alphabet of size ≥ 3 is co-NP-complete. A natural question in this context, whether recognizing 3-collapsing words over a 2-element alphabet is easy or hard, has remained open.

First we consider the problem of determining the minimal number of components necessary to generate all recursively enumerable languages. We present a construction which improves the currently known best bounds of seven (with three predefined clusters) and six (in the non-clustered case) to five, in both cases (having four clusters in the clustered variant). We also show that in the case of unary languages four components are sufficient. Then, by defining systems with dynamical clusters, we investigate the minimal number of different query symbols necessary to obtain computational completeness. We prove that for this purpose three dynamical clusters (which means two different query symbols) are sufficient in general, which (although the number of components is higher) can also be interpreted as an improvement in the number of necessary clusters when compared to the case of predefined clusters.	grammar systems theory	Erzsébet Csuhaj-Varjú;György Vaszil	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22600-7_10	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	HPC	1.1717414783877198	20.08829000069581	108905

As an example we can point out an elaborate analysis of average computational complexity of the QUICKSORT algorithm in [7]. The analysis was done for uniformly distributed partitions (all probabilities have equal values). It will be demonstrated in this paper that this assumption allows us to estimate the average complexity of the QUICKSORT algorithm from [7]. However, in the general case this assumption does not always provide an upper bound for the average case complexity of an arbitrary algorithm. It will be demonstrated that the worst-case computational complexity w(n) is much larger than the average case complexity a(n) and, therefore, does not provide and adequate measure of efficiency of divide-and-conquer algorithms (DCAs).	algorithm;average-case complexity;best, worst and average case;computational complexity theory;quicksort	Boris S.

However, few discussions have been made for the nondeterministic case. This paper discusses the nondeterministic case, using ATM (alternating Turing machine) and NTM (nondeterministic Turing machine). The main results are as follows. (1) When R(n)= 0(S(n)), and R(n)=ω(log(S(n)), S(n) = ω (n), NRS,(Ro(1)(n) and S0(1)(n)) ATBS(R0(1)(n), S0(1)(n), R 0(1)(n))NRS R0(1)(n)), S0(1)(n), S0(1)(n)).

Strong lower bounds for this problem would have important implications in circuit complexity. All of our results apply to myopic protocols (where players see only one layer ahead, but can still see arbitrarily far behind them.) Furthermore, our results apply to the maximum communication complexity, where a protocol is charged for the maximum communication sent by a single player rather than the total communication sent by all players. Our main result is a lower bound of $n/2$ bits for deterministic protocols, independent of the number of players. We also provide a matching upper bound, as well as an $\Omega(n/k\log n)$ lower bound for randomized protocols, improving on the bounds of Chakrabarti. In the non-Boolean version of the problem, we give a lower bound of $n (\log^{(k-1)} n)(1-o(1))$ bits, essentially matching the upper bound from Damm et al.	circuit complexity;communication complexity;damm algorithm;one-way function;pointer (computer programming);pointer jumping;randomized algorithm	Joshua Brody	2009	2009 24th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity	10.1109/CCC.2009.30	combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;artificial neural network;statistics	Theory	9.115509695416549	24.022554832835166	109339

We introduce a novel list organization framework that we call Lists on Lists (LOL), which regards the list as a set of sublists that are manageable in the same way that individual records are. A LOL organization involves a reorganization operation on the accessed record level, as well as another on the sublist which it belongs to (the record's context). We show that it is beneficial to consider the reorganization of the context together with the accessed record, since other records within the context are likely to be accessed in the near future. With the aid of an automaton-based partitioning algorithm, we demonstrate that we can accurately classify the different contexts of the sublist. Using this framework, we were able to empirically achieve asymptotic search costs that are significantly superior to the move-to-front heuristic, widely acknowledged as the best algorithm for such environments.	locality of reference;organizing (structure)	Abdelrahman Amer;B.

38fe77a6bdc3d0f15cdaaa3ab71d9009c54e504d	closure of resource-bounded randomness notions under polynomial-time permutations		An infinite bit sequence is called recursively random if no computable strategy betting along the sequence has unbounded capital. It is well-known that the property of recursive randomness is closed under computable permutations. We investigate analogous statements for randomness notions defined by betting strategies that are computable within resource bounds. Suppose that S is a polynomial time computable permutation of the set of strings over the unary alphabet (identified with N). If the inverse of S is not polynomially bounded, it is not hard to build a polynomial time random bit sequence Z such that Z ◦ S is not polynomial time random. So one should only consider permutations S satisfying the extra condition that the inverse is polynomially bounded. Now the closure depends on additional assumptions in complexity theory. Our first main result, Theorem 4, shows that if BPP contains a superpolynomial deterministic time class, such as DTIME(nlogn), then polynomial time randomness is not preserved by some permutation S such that in fact both S and its inverse are in P. Our second main result, Theorem 11, shows that polynomial space randomness is preserved by polynomial time permutations with polynomially bounded inverse, so if P = PSPACE then polynomial time randomness is preserved. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation → Complexity classes, Theory of computation → Pseudorandomness and derandomization	bpp (complexity);computable function;computational complexity theory;dtime;pspace;polynomial;pseudorandomness;randomized algorithm;randomness;recursion;theory of computation;time complexity;unary operation	André Nies;Frank Stephan	2018		10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2018.51	combinatorics;randomness;discrete mathematics;stable polynomial;mathematics;matrix polynomial;alternating polynomial;degree of a polynomial;square-free polynomial;bounded function;randomness tests	Theory	8.399090552270083	20.99407886613559	109891

We present two methods for solving this multi-regular language filtering problem. The first, although providing the ideal solution, requires a stack, has a worst-case compute time that grows quadratically in σ’s length and conditions its output at any point on arbitrarily long windows of future input. The second method is to algorithmically construct a transducer that approximates the first algorithm. In contrast to the stack-based algorithm, however, the transducer requires only a finite amount of memory, runs in linear time, and gives immediate output for each letter read; it is, moreover, the best possible finite-state approximation with these three features.	algorithm;approximation;automata theory;best, worst and average case;cellular automaton;computational mechanics;finite-state machine;microsoft windows;regular language;stack-oriented programming language;structural analysis;time complexity;time series;transducer	Carl S.

Regular expressions are important both in theoretical fields and applicative fields. Especially the Kleene star plays an important role. It woul be convenient if we had expressions for denoting context-free languages withou nonterminal symbols or complicated operators. This p+cr introduces the notion of the star operator of degree two: the Kleene star is regarded as ;he star operator of degree one. We study properties of the class of extended regular languages of star degree at most two over an alphabet X, in short ERL(2, t”), which is the closure of the family of finite languages under the operations, knion, concatenation, the Kleene star, and the star operator of degree two. We also introduce the class of completely linearly nested context-free languages over 2, in short CLNCFL(Z), and skw that these two classes of languages are the same. We also study certain other properties of ERL(2,Z); for example, we show the incomparableness of inclusion problems between (1) ERL(2,Z) and the class of linear languages, and (2) ERL(2, Z) and the class of deterministic context-free languages, etc. 2,Z).

We present a method for deciding the 2-colourability of hypergraphs. This method which we call H-resolution is closely related to resolution of boolean formulas and the relation.between the two is investigated.	boolean satisfiability problem;computational problem;propositional calculus	Nathan Linial;Michael Tarsi	1985	Theor.

Getting a minimal automaton is a fundamenta l issue in the use and implementation of finite automata tools in frameworks like text processing, image analysis, linguistic computer science, and many other applications. Although minimization algorithms are rather old, there wer e recently some new developments which are explained or sketched in this chapter. There are two main families of minimization algorithms. The first are by a sequence of refinements of a partition of the set of states, the second by a seque nce of fusions or merges of states. Hopcroft’s and Moore’s algorithms belong to the first family . The linear-time minimization of acyclic automata of Revuz belongs to the second family. We describe, prove and analyze Moore’s and Hopcroft’s algor ithms. One of our studies is the comparison of these algorithms. It appears that they qui te different both in behavior and in complexity. In particular, we show that it is not possible to simulate the computations of one of the algorithm by the other. We also state the results known ab out average complexity of both algorithms. We describe the minimization algorithm by fusion for acycli c automata, and for a more general class of automata, namely those recognizing regular la ngu ges having polynomially bounded number of words. Finally, we consider briefly incremental algorithms for bui lding minimal automata for finite sets of words. We consider the updating of a minimal automaton whe n a word is added or removed.	approximation algorithm;automaton;browser user interface;computation;computer science;dfa minimization;directed acyclic graph;dynamic problem (algorithms);finite-state machine;image analysis;linear algebra;simulation;time complexity;word error rate	Jean Berstel;Luc Boasson;Olivier Carton;Isabelle Fagnot	1990	CoRR		time complexity;discrete mathematics;image analysis;nondeterministic finite automaton;continuous spatial automaton;growcut algorithm;quantum finite automata;computer science;theoretical computer science;deterministic finite automaton;automata theory;ω-automaton;mathematics;finite-state machine;dfa minimization;mobile automaton;timed automaton;algorithm	Theory	-1.5876113671298318	21.70482246196949	111821

Picture array generation is one such problem for which different systems have been constructed in the literature. Incorporating the feature of permitting symbols in the rules, array systems are constructed here for generating picture languages consisting of picture arrays. The advantage of this approach is that there is a reduction in the number of membranes used in the construction, in comparison to the existing array system model. © 2013 Springer.	p system	K. G.

Our main theorem, proved using the pathset complexity framework recently introduced in [56], shows that the average-case k-CYCLE problem (on Erdős-Rényi random graphs with an appropriate edge density) is 12 + 1 poly(n) hard for mNC . As a corollary, via O’Donnell’s hardness amplification theorem [43], we obtain an explicit monotone function of n variables (in the class mSAC) which is 12 + n −1/2+ε hard for mNC under the uniform distribution, for any desired ε > 0. (This bound is nearly tight, since every monotone function has correlation Ω( logn √ n ) with a function in mNC [44].) Unlike previous lower bounds for monotone circuits (i.e. under non-product distributions), these correlation bounds extend smoothly to negation-limited circuits. By a simple argument using Holley’s monotone coupling theorem [30], we show the following lemma: under any product distribution, if a balanced monotone function f is 1 2 +δ hard for monotone circuits of a given size and depth, then f is 12 + (2 t+1 − 1)δ hard, up to the same size and depth, for (non-monotone) boolean circuits with t negation gates. Our correlation bounds against mNC thus extend to NC circuits with ( 12 − ε) log n negations. (This improves a previous 1 6 log log n lower bound [7] on the negation-limited complexity of an explicit monotone function; by [21], NC circuits with dlog(n+ 1)e negations are equivalent to full NC.)	best, worst and average case;boolean circuit;erdős number;erdős–rényi model;hardness of approximation;integrated circuit;random graph;smoothing;monotone	Benjamin Rossman	2015		10.4230/LIPIcs.CCC.2015.392	circuit complexity;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;average-case complexity;computer science;mathematics	Theory	9.165852998313287	21.840810353449996	112039

In order to achieve the objective, the following approaches are implemented. Firstly, smart sensor nodes for vibration and impedance monitoring are designed. In the design, Imote2 platform which has high performance microcontroller, large amount of memory, and flexible radio communication is implemented to acceleration and impedance sensor nodes. Acceleration sensor node is modified to measure PZT’s dynamic strain along with acceleration. A solar-power harvesting unit is implemented for power supply to the sensor system. Secondly, operation logics of the multi-scale sensor nodes are programmed based on the concept of the decentralized sensor network. Finally, the performance of the multi-scale sensor system is evaluated on a lab-scale beam to examine the long-term monitoring capacities under various weather conditions.	nominal impedance	Duc-Duy Ho;Khac-Duy Nguyen;Han-Sam Yoon;Jeong-Tae Kim	2012	IJDSN	10.1155/2012/709208	embedded system;wireless sensor network;sensor node;soft sensor;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Robotics	2.1444987963043367	31.652016192979016	112281

2cb9318161fb8bc1b5be1f41dec4b16636640c61	on the power of randomized branching programs	branching program	"""We de ne the notion of a randomized branching program in the natural way similar to the de nition of a randomized circuit. We exhibit an explicit function fn for which we prove that: 1) fn can be computed by polynomial size randomized read-once ordered branching program with a small one-sided error; 2) fn cannot be computed in polynomial size by deterministic read-once branching programs; 3) fn cannot be computed in polynomial size by deterministic read-k-times ordered branching program for k = o(n= log n) (the required deterministic size is exp nk ). 1 Preliminaries Di erent models of branching programs introduced in [13, 15], have been studied extensively in the last decade (see for example [19]). A survey of known lower bounds for di erent models of branching programs can be found in [17]. Developments in the eld of digital design and veri cation have led to the introduction of restricted forms of branching programs. In particular, ordered read-once branching programs are now commonly used in the circuit veri cation [9], [20]. But many important functions cannot be computed by read-once branching programs of polynomial size. For more information see the survey [9] and papers [18], [16]. It is known that di erent models of randomized circuits with weak enough restrictions on the error of randomized computation have only polynomial advantage over nonuniform deterministic models (see [2], [4], [3], and survey [6]). In the paper we de ne the notion of a randomized branching program in a natural way similar to the de nition of a randomized circuit. Our goal is to show that randomized computation with a small error for readonce polynomial branching programs can be more powerful than deterministic ones. The argument that can help the intuition in this direction is that ampli cation method does not work for the case of restricted number of input veri cations. Note that in the paper [7] it is presented an explicit function which needs exponential size for presentation by a nondeterministic read-k-times branching program for k = o(log n). We use the variant of a de nition of a branching program from the paper [7]. A deterministic branching program P for computing a function g : n ! f0; 1g, where is a nite set, is a directed acyclic multi-graph with a single source node, distinguished sink nodes labeled """"accept"""" and """"reject"""". For each non-sink node there is a variable xi such that all out-edges from this node are labeled by \xi = """" for some 2 and for each there is exactly one such labeled edge. The label \xi = """" indicates that only inputs satisfying xi = may follow this edge in the computation. We call a node v an xi-node if all output edges of the node v are labeled by """"xi = """", 2 . A deterministic branching program P computes a function g : n ! f0; 1g, in the obvious way; that is, g( 1; : : : ; n) = 1 i there is a computation on < 1; : : : ; n > starting in the source state and leading to the accepting state. A randomized branching program is a one which has in addition to its standard (deterministic) inputs some specially designated inputs called random inputs. When these random inputs are chosen from the uniform distribution, the output of the branching program is a random variable. We call a node v of the randomized branching program a """"random generator"""" node if output edges of the node v are labeled by random inputs. We say a randomized branching program (a,b)-computes a function g if it outputs 1 with probability at most a for input x such that g(x) = 0 and outputs 1 with probability at least b for inputs x such that g(x) = 1. A randomized branching program computes the function g with one-sided """"-error if it (""""; 1)-computes the function g. For a branching program P , we de ne size(P ) (complexity of the branching program P ) as the number of internal nodes in P . { 2 { From the de nition of the complexity of a branching program it follows that the size of randomized branching program is the sum of random generator nodes and xi-nodes. Read-once branching programs are branching programs in which for every path, every variable is tested no more than once. A read-once ordered branching program is a read-once branching program which respects a xed ordering of the variables, i.e. if an edge leads from an xi-node to an xj-node, the condition (i) < (j) has to be ful lled. A read-k-times branching program is a branching program with the property that no input variable xi appears more than k times on any path in the program. A read-k-times ordered branching program is a read-k-times branching program which is partitioned into k layers such that the each layer is a read-once ordered respecting the same ordering . In [5] it is proved that deterministic ordered read-(k+1)-times branching programs are more powerful than deterministic ordered read-k-times branching programs. Namely classes of functions computed by deterministic polynomial-size read-k-times ordered branching programs form proper hierarchy for k = o(n1=2= log2 n). We exhibit an explicit function fn : f0; 1; 0̂; 1̂g2n ! f0; 1g, for which we prove that: (i) Function fn can be computed with one sided """"(n)-error by randomized read-once ordered branching program with the size O n6 """"3(n) log2 n """"(n) (Theorem 1). (ii) Any deterministic read-once branching program that computes function fn has the size no less than 2n (Theorem 2). (iii) Any deterministic read-k-times ordered branching program for computing function fn has size no less than 2(n 1)=(2k 1) (Theorem 3). Function fn can be easily de ned as a boolean function. For technical reasons in the proofs we prefer to use the above notation. Note that one can think of each internal node of a branching program as a state of a computation. This point of view is essential for the investigation of the amount of space necessary to compute functions. Restricted models of branching programs are useful for the investigation of time-space tradeo s. We can think of read-k-time (k 1) restrictions as a restriction on time, say time kn (see survey [8] for more information). This approach draws time-space tradeo point of view to our results. Recent results on the general lower bounds on randomized space and time can be found in [1] and [11]. 2 Function Consider the nite alphabet = f0; 1; 0̂; 1̂g. As usual and n denote the set of all words of nite length and the length n over respectively. For 1; 2 2 , x 2 de ne Proj 1 ; 2(x) to be the longest subsequence x0 of the sequence x that consists only of symbols 1 and 2. De ne function fn : 2n ! f0; 1g as follows: f(x) = 1 i 1) Proj0;1(x) and Proj0̂;1̂(x) have the same length and 2) i-th symbol in Proj0;1(x) is i i the i-th symbol in Proj0̂;1̂(x) is ̂i for all i. Informally speaking inputs of fn are words over the alphabet which consists of two { 3 { kinds of zeroes and two kinds of ones. fn(x) = 1 i a subsequence z of x formed by the rst kind of zeroes and ones and a subsequence y of x formed by the second kind of zeroes and ones are binary notations of the same natural number. As it is mentioned in the section above, function fn can be easily de ned as a boolean function f 0 n : f0; 1g4n ! f0; 1g. One can encode, for example, 0 by 00, 1 by 01, 0̂ by 10, and 1̂ by 11. Our presentation help us to make main ideas of proof methods more clear and help us to avoid several technical details in proofs. 3 Results Theorem 1. Function fn can be computed with one sided """"(n)-error by randomized readonce ordered branching program of size O n6 """"3(n) log2 n """"(n)! : Proof: Randomized read-once ordered branching program P that computes fn works as follows: Phase 1. (probabilistic). Choose d(n) to be some function in O(n), s.t. d(n) > 2n. P randomly selects a prime number p from the set Qd(n) = fp1; p2; : : : ; pd(n)g of rst d(n) prime numbers. P selects a prime number p in the following way. P use t = dlog d(n)e random variables y1; y2; : : : ; yt, where yi 2 f0; 1g and Prob(yi = 1) = Prob(yi = 0) = 1=2. The branching program P reads its random inputs in the xed order y1; y2; : : : ; yt. Sequence y = y1y2 : : : yt is interpreted as binary notation of the numberN(y). P selects i-th prime number pi 2 Qd(n) i N(y) = i mod d(n). Phase 2. (deterministic). Let 2 2n be a valuation of x. Denote = Proj0;1( ), = Proj0̂;1̂( ). We treat ̂i to be the number 0 if ̂i = 0̂, and to be the number 1 if ̂i = 1̂. Sequences and are interpreted as binary notations of numbers N( ) and N( ). P reads input sequence x = in the order x1; : : : ; x2n. Along the computation path, P a) veri es if j j = j j, b) counts modulo p the numbersN( ) and N( ) (a = N( ) mod p and b = N( ) mod p) in the following way. In the beginning of computation a := 0 and b := 0. When P reads i-th input symbol i 2 f0; 1g of the sequence (respectively i-th input symbol ̂i 2 f0̂; 1̂g of the sequence ) then a := a+ i2i mod p (respectively b := b+ ̂i2i mod p). Let 0 and 0 be rst parts of the length t and k respectively of subsequences and that were tested during the path from the source to the internal node (state) v. For the realization of the procedure described in the phase 2 it is su cient to store in the state v four numbers: t; k 2 f0; 1; : : : ; ng, a = N( 0) (mod p), and b = N( 0) (mod p). If j j 6 = j j then P outputs 1 correct answer with probability 1. Consider the case j j = j j. { 4 { If N( ) = N( ) (mod p) then P outputs 1 else P outputs 0. From the description of P it follows that if N( ) = N( )) then P with probability 1 outputs correct answer. If N( ) 6= N( ) then it can happen that N( ) = N( ) (mod p) for some p 2 Qd(n). In these cases P make error output. For x = it holds that jN( ) N( )j 2n < p1p2 pn where p1; p2; : : : ; pn are rst n prime numbers. This means that in the case when N( ) 6= N( ) the probability """"(n) of the error of P on the input x = is no more than 2n=d(n). The size of P is no more than 2t+1 1 + X p2Qd(n) n Xl=1(n+ 1)2p2: It is known from the number theory that the value of the i-th prime is of order O(i log i).

However, only a small number of stu dies have been developed that give a structural interpretation of this graph. Such an in terpretation is crucially important in order to test protocols and optimal routing algorit hms, to design efficient networks, and for failure detection purposes. Moreover, most rese arch does not highlight the role that IXPs have on the AS-level structure of the Internet , although their role is recognized as fundamental. The initial contribution of this study is an analys is of the most important AS-level topologies that are publicly found on the web and a analysis of the topology obtained when they are merged. We compiled structural inform ation from this topology making considerable use of the k-core decomposition techni que to delineate various particular classes of nodes. Next, we associated node properti es with a reasonable modus operandi of the ASs on the Internet. The second contribution is a study of the impact that ASs connected to IXPs and BGP connections crossing IXPs have on the AS-level topology. To achieve this, we developed a procedure to gather reliable information related to IXPs and their participants.	border gateway protocol;cluster analysis;clustering coefficient;compiler;dimes;degeneracy (graph theory);die (integrated circuit);diff utility;emoticon;gnome;graph theory;internet;level structure;network topology;norm (social);population;routing;san diego supercomputer center;sensor;traceroute	Enrico Gregori;Alessandro Improta;Luciano Lenzini;Chiara Orsini	2011	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2010.09.002	routing;simulation;telecommunications;news;computer science;operating system;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-0.78966091748554	28.433123881492218	113578

ThenC outputs “0” if the number of “1”s in an input x ∈ {0, 1} to C is a multiple ofm and, otherwise, C outputs “1.” The function MOD2 is the so-called PARITY function, and MODn+1 is the OR function. Let s be the size of the circuit C, that is,C consists ofs threshold gates, and letbe the energy complexity of C, that is, at most e gates inC output “1” for any inputx ∈ {0, 1}. In the paper, we prove that a very simple inequality n/(m − 1) ≤ s holds for every circuitC computing MODm. The inequality implies that there is a tradeoff between the sizes and energy complexity e of a threshold circuit C computing MODm, and yields a lower bound e = Ω((log n − log m)/ log log n) on e if s = O(polylog(n)). We actually obtain a general result on the so-called generalized mod function, from which the result on the ordinary mod function MODm immediately follows.	logic gate;modulo operation;parity function;social inequality	Kei Uchizawa;Takao Nishizeki;Eiji Takimoto	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03816-7_61	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;boolean function;upper and lower bounds;algorithm	Theory	9.038111709712771	22.654694599181898	113637

The primary goal in a scientific experiment is computation of some inference from the observations and available models. From this basic problem flows a broad set of practical and theoretical issues, among them assurance of data integrity, sufficiency of data to support the inferences made concerning models/hypotheses, and what tools and hardware are required not just to take observations but enable a community of non-engineers to participate in and adapt a sequence of experiments as new observations are obtained. The resulting constraints for designing systems for such purposes are quite different from those commonly assumed in the infancy of sensor network research, and even now in much ongoing systems research. We describe these constraints in light of experience in deploying sensor networks in support of scientific study at the center for embedded networked sensors (CENS).	computation;data integrity;ecology;embedded system;emergence;experiment;iteration;sensor;systems theory;terrestrial television	Gregory J.

2234a35ef4c4788ac38576c18664956a6146b44d	reconstruction of non-degenerate homogeneous depth three circuits		A homogeneous depth three circuit C computes a polynomial f = T1 + T2 + ... + Ts , where each Ti is a product of d linear forms in n variables over some underlying field F. Given black-box access to f , can we efficiently reconstruct (i.e. proper learn) a homogeneous depth three circuit computing f ? Learning various subclasses of circuits is natural and interesting from both theoretical and practical standpoints and in particular, properly learning homogeneous depth three circuits efficiently is stated as an open problem in a work by Klivans and Shpilka (COLT 2003) and is well-studied. Unfortunately, there is substantial amount of evidence to show that this is a hard problem in the worst case. We give a (randomized) poly(n, d, s)-time algorithm to reconstruct non-degenerate homogeneous depth three circuits for n = Ω(d2) (with some additional mild requirements on s and the characteristic of F). We call a circuit C as non-degenerate if the dimension of the partial derivative space of f equals the sum of the dimensions of the partial derivative spaces of the terms T1, T2, . . . , Ts. In this sense, the terms are “independent” of each other in a non-degenerate circuit. A random homogeneous depth three circuit (where the coefficients of the linear forms are chosen according to the uniform distribution or any other reasonable distribution) is almost surely non-degenerate. In comparison, previous learning algorithms for this circuit class were either improper (with an exponential dependence on d), or they only worked for s < n (with a doubly exponential dependence of the running time on s). The main contribution of this work is to formulate the following paradigm for efficiently handling addition gates and to successfully implement it for the class of homogeneous depth three circuits. The problem of finding the children of an addition gate with large fan-in s is first reduced to the problem of decomposing a suitable vector space U into a (direct) sum of simpler subspaces U1, U2, . . . , Us. One then constructs a suitable space of operators S consisting of linear maps acting on U such that analyzing the simultaneous global structure of S enables us to efficiently decompose U. In our case, we exploit the structure of the set of low rank matrices in S and of the invariant subspaces of U induced by S . We feel that this paradigm is novel and powerful: it should lead to efficient reconstruction of many other subclasses of circuits for which the efficient reconstruction problem had hitherto looked unapproachable because of the presence of large fan-in addition gates.

In our model, each proxy in the set of candidates has a finite storage capacity for replicating objects and charges fee for use. The optimization problem is to find a set of proxies from candidates set for replicating objects at them such that the total access cost is minimized, subject to the constraints that the objects placed at a proxy should not exceed the storage capacity of the proxy and the total fees charged by the proxies should not exceed a pre-specified budget. We formulate this problem as a combinational optimization problem and show that this optimization problem is NP complete. We propose two heuristics and evaluate them by simulation. The simulation results show that these two heuristics could significantly reduce the access cost.	content delivery network;proxy server;replication (computing)	Xuanping Zhang;Weidong Wang;Xiaopeng Tan;Yonghu Zhu	2003		10.1007/3-540-36901-5_56	optimization problem;replication;the internet;np-complete;cpu cache;combinatorial optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;operating system;database;distributed computing;object-oriented programming;algorithm;replication	ECom	6.360787893146889	28.688916840087305	113931
1db1d9a50327435f0a930ecff90e0e37e1ae1c80	a super-logarithmic lower bound for hypercubic sorting networks	sorting network;lower bound	Hypercubic sorting networks are a class of comparator networks whose structure maps eeciently to the hypercube and any of its bounded degree variants. Recently, n-input hypercubic sorting networks with depth 2 O(p lg lg n) lg n have been discovered. These networks are the only known sorting networks of depth o(lg 2 n) that are not based on expanders, and their existence raises the question of whether a depth of O(lg n) can be achieved by any hypercubic sorting network. In this paper, we resolve this question by establishing an ? lg n lg lg n lg lg lg n lower bound on the depth of any n-input hypercubic sorting network. Our lower bound can be extended to certain restricted classes of non-oblivious sorting algorithms on hypercubic machines.	comparator;grid network;map;sorting algorithm;sorting network	C.

The first method is a characterization. We show restrictions to context-free tree grammars such that, for each restricted context-free tree grammar, a regular tree grammar can be constructed that induces the same tree language. The other two methods are approximations. An arbitrary context-free tree language can be approximated by a regular tree grammar with a restricted pushdown storage. Furthermore, we approximate weighted context-free tree languages, induced by weighted linear nondeleting context-free tree grammars, by showing how to approximate optimal weights for weighted regular tree grammars.	approximation algorithm;context-free grammar;context-free language;regular tree grammar;stack (abstract data type);tree automaton	Markus Teichmann	2017			programming language;tree-adjoining grammar;regular tree grammar;indexed language;l-attributed grammar;mathematics;context-free grammar;rule-based machine translation	NLP	-2.7850811159361477	20.526587423274822	114939

6973504258e58ff81a1f175873efbc3a0eb6f789	on the complexity of l-reachability		We initiate a complexity theoretic study of the language based graph reachability problem (L–Reach) : Fix a language L. Given a graph whose edges are labelled with alphabet symbols of the language L and two special vertices s and t, test if there is path P from s to t in the graph such that the concatenation of the symbols seen from s to t in the path P forms a string in the language L. We study variants of this problem with different graph classes and different language classes and obtain complexity theoretic characterizations for all of them. Our main results are the following: • Restricting the language using formal language theory we show that the complexity of L–Reach increases with the power of the formal language class. We show that there is a regular language for which the L–Reach is NL-complete even for undirected graphs. In the case of linear languages, the complexity of L–Reach does not go beyond the complexity of L itself. Further, there is a deterministic context-free language L for which L–DagReach is LogCFL-complete. • We use L–Reach as a lens to study structural complexity. In this direction we show that there is a language A in TC0 for which A–DagReach is NPcomplete. Using this we show that P vs NP question is equivalent to P vs DagReach−1(P)1 question. This leads to the intriguing possibility that by proving DagReach−1(P) is contained in some subclass of P, we can prove an upward translation of separation of complexity classes. Note that we do not know a way to upward translate the separation of complexity classes.	complexity class;computational complexity theory;concatenation;deterministic context-free language;formal language;graph (discrete mathematics);logcfl;nl (complexity);nl-complete;p versus np problem;reachability problem;regular language;structural complexity (applied mathematics);tc0	Balagopal Komarath;Jayalal Sarma;K.

A languageL has an AND function if there is a polynomial timef such thatf(x,y) εL ⇔x εL andy ε L. L has an OR function if there is a polynomial timeg such thatg(x,y) ε⇔xεL oryεL. While all NP complete sets have these functions, Graph Isomorphism, which is probably not complete, is also shown to have both AND and OR functions. The results in this paper characterize the complete sets for the classes Dp and pSAT[O(logn)] in terms of AND and OR and relate these functions to the structure of the Boolean hierarchy and the query hierarchies. Also, this paper shows that the complete sets for the levels of the Boolean hierarchy above the second level cannot have AND or OR unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Finally, most of the structural properties of the Boolean hierarchy and query hierarchies are shown to depend only on the existence of AND and OR functions for the NP complete sets.	boolean hierarchy;graph isomorphism;logical connective;np-completeness;polynomial hierarchy;time complexity	Richard Chang;Jim Kadin	1995	Mathematical systems theory	10.1007/BF01303054	time complexity;and-inverter graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;characteristic function;boolean expression;computer science;technical report;karp–lipton theorem;mathematics;graph isomorphism;matrix polynomial;complete boolean algebra;algorithm;parity function	Theory	7.114982019072874	19.734744811089723	117197

If, in addition, A is a member of C then A is almost complete and weakly complete for C, respectively. Weak hardness for the exponential time classes E = DTIME(2lin(n)) and EXP = DTIME(2poly(n)) has been extensively studied in the literature, whereas the nontriviality of the concept of almost completeness has been established only recently.#R##N##R##N#Here we continue the investigation of these measure theoretic hardness notions for the exponential time classes and we establish the relations among these notions which had been left open.

These results exhibit a surprising degree of independence of the measure concepts for E and EXP.#R##N##R##N#Finally, we give structural separations for some of these concepts and we show the nontriviality of almost hardness for the bounded query reducibilities of fixed norm.	theory;time complexity	Klaus Ambos-Spies	2000		10.1007/3-540-44612-5_11	time complexity;complexity class;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;measure;completeness;computer science;turing machine;mathematics;structural analysis;algorithm	Theory	6.261762583988908	21.688402235032296	117592

To this end, we derive an improved inapproximability result for the biclique edge cover problem. The obtained lower bounds on approximability can be sharpened in the case where the input is given as a deterministic finite automaton over a binary alphabet. This settles most of the open problems stated in [4]. Note that the biclique edge cover problem was recently studied by the authors as lower bound method for the nondeterministic state complexity of finite automata [5].	approximation algorithm;automata theory;bipartite dimension;cryptography;deterministic automaton;deterministic finite automaton;edge cover;finite-state machine;hardness of approximation;modulo operation;nondeterministic finite automaton;p versus np problem;regular language	Hermann Gruber;Markus Holzer	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73208-2_21	nondeterministic finite automaton with ε-moves;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;nondeterministic finite automaton;state diagram;quantum finite automata;computer science;nested word;two-way deterministic finite automaton;deterministic finite automaton;deterministic automaton;ω-automaton;mathematics;finite-state machine;dfa minimization;upper and lower bounds;algorithm	Theory	9.119905852235949	22.16551579577343	117767

Unlike conventional hashing, extendible hashing has a dynamic structure that grows and shrinks gracefully as the database grows and shrinks. This approach simultaneously solves the problem of making hash tables that are extendible and of making radix search trees that are balanced. We study, by analysis and simulation, the performance of extendible hashing. The results indicate that extendible hashing provides an attractive alternative to other access methods, such as balanced trees.	extendible hashing;extensibility;hash function;hash table;identifier;key (cryptography);self-balancing binary search tree;simulation;unique key	Ronald Fagin;Jürg Nievergelt;Nicholas Pippenger;H.

This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.	computation;computer;cryptosystem;discrete logarithm;information;integer factorization;physical computing;polynomial;quantum computing;quantum mechanics;randomized algorithm;regular expression;simulation;time complexity;universal turing machine	Peter W.

Like visibly pushdown automata, the input symbols determine the stack operations. In this paper, we prove that functionality is decidable in PSpace for visibly pushdown transducers. The proof is done via a pumping argument: if a word with two outputs has a sufficiently large nesting depth, there exists a nested word with two outputs whose nesting depth is strictly smaller. The proof uses technics of word combinatorics. As a consequence of decidability of functionality, we also show that equivalence of functional visibly pushdown transducers is Exptime-Complete.	stack (abstract data type);transducer	Emmanuel Filiot;Jean-François Raskin;Pierre-Alain Reynier;Frédéric Servais;Jean-Marc Talbot	2010	CoRR		deterministic pushdown automaton;finite state transducer;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;nested word;mathematics;pushdown automaton;embedded pushdown automaton;algorithm	NLP	-3.0926454557032477	20.782057748353495	118946

To meet this demand and enable the integration of renewable resources, electrical distribution networks are beginning to adopt smart-grid technologies by providing bidirectional communication between the distribution grid and the electric meter. The question of how appliances within the home will interface with the smart-grid is still an open question. We propose to use wireless sensor networks as a platform to enable detailed household monitoring, demand response, load scheduling, occupancy-based control, intelligent lighting, and other general-purpose control strategies. In this vision, the smart-grid interface is a single input to the building control system which consists of a wide variety of other sensors and supports many applications that greatly extend the capabilities of the smart-grid. To explore this concept we have: developed efficient and accurate energy disaggregation algorithms, developed reliable multicast and broadcast network protocols, evaluated 10 strategies for energy savings, designed a WSN-based building monitoring and control platform, and evaluated this approach in both offices and a residential home.	algorithm;communications protocol;control system;general-purpose markup language;internet;multicast;scheduling (computing);sensor;smartphone;tablet computer	Alan Marchiori	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks	10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986155	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;computer network	Mobile	1.5271170890179482	32.20649550772169	119330

For example, it is well known that the global climate change dramatically influences the visual appearance of mountain areas like the European Alps. Very destructive geological processes may be triggered or intensified, impacting the stability of slopes, possibly inducing landslides. Unfortunately, the interactions between these complex processes is poorly understood. Therefore, one needs to develop wireless sensing technology as a new scientific instrument for environmental sensing under extreme conditions. Large variations in temperature, humidity, mechanical forces, snow coverage, and unattended operation play a crucial role in long-term deployments. We argue that, in order to significantly advance the application domain, it is inevitable that sensor networks be created as a quality scientific instrument with known and predictable properties, and not as a research toy delivering average observations at best. In this paper, key techniques for achieving highly reliable, yet resource efficent wireless sensor networks are discussed on the basis of productive wireless sensor networks measuring permafrost processes in the Swiss Alps.	application domain;interaction;sensor;smart board;software feature	Jan Beutel;Bernhard Buchli;Federico Ferrari;Matthias Keller;Marco Zimmerling;Lothar Thiele	2011	2011 Design, Automation & Test in Europe	10.1109/DATE.2011.5763236	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science	Mobile	3.726552818983163	31.744819131225427	119441
29629bb2644e29bdd0e5e237a4ecbec43d7f9c7f	distributed traffic flow prediction with label proportions: from in-network towards high performance computation with mpi		Modern traffic management should benefit from the diverse sensors, smart phones, and social networks data that offer the potential of enhanced services. In disaster scenarios, it is no longer guaranteed that a central server and reliable communication is always available. This motivates a distributed computing setting with restricted communication. Also in distributed High Performance Computing communication costs have to be reduced to the minimum and costly broadcast to all compute nodes hould be avoided. We want to learn local models with high communication efficiency. They still require the exchange of label information in a setting of supervised learning. The transmission of all labels among the nodes can be as costly as communicating all observations. Sophisticated methods are required to trade-off prediction performance against communication costs. We hereby present an in-network algorithm based on local models that only sends label counts to neighboring nodes. Therefore the method is a novel approach that transfers no data about individual observations, but just aggregated label information. We outline its MPI implementation. And evaluate our approach on real world data in a traffic monitoring scenario. Tests reveal that in comparison to sending all labels, the algorithm is scalable.

We begin by defining a particular class of condition/event nets called Q, suitable for modeling repetitive workcell tasks. Nets E Q are either deterministic or exhibit a restricted kind of conflict called choice among alternatives. We show how the repetitive behavior of such a net may be studied by decomposing this conflict into deterministic components associated with mutually exclusive alternatives. Next, a unified description of the important temporal extensions of PN theory is presented, with a special emphasis on formal analysis. We then extend the PN notion of coverability in the temporal sense and demonstrate that, for netsen, the period of repetition (cycle time) can be directly computed from the durations associated with the individual operations, once the decomposition into components is performed. In particular, when the durations are specified in the form of minimum and maximum values, this period of repetition may be described by optimistic and pessimistic bounds. A typical assembly example adapted from our work with the multirobot workcell testbed at LAAS is also presented to illustrate two forms of temporal analysis.	local area augmentation system;magnetic-core memory;optimistic concurrency control;petri net;robotics;testbed	Paul Freedman	1991	IEEE Trans.

In vector form we denote such an equation system by X = f(X) and call f a system of positive polynomials (SPP). Equation systems of this kind appear naturally in the analysis of stochastic models like stochastic context-free grammars (with numerous applications to natural language processing and computational biology), probabilistic programs with procedures, web-surfing models with back buttons, and branching processes. The least nonnegative solution μf of an SPP equation X = f(X) is of central interest for these models. Etessami and Yannakakis [J. ACM, 56 (2009), pp. 1–66] have suggested a particular version of Newton’s method to approximate μf . We extend a result of Etessami and Yannakakis and show that Newton’s method starting at 0 always converges to μf . We obtain lower bounds on the convergence speed of the method. For so-called strongly connected SPPs we prove the existence of a threshold kf ∈ N such that for every i ≥ 0 the (kf + i)th iteration of Newton’s method has at least i valid bits of μf . The proof yields an explicit bound for kf depending only on syntactic parameters of f . We further show that for arbitrary SPP equations, Newton’s method still converges linearly: there exists a threshold kf and an αf > 0 such that for every i ≥ 0 the (kf + αf · i)th iteration of Newton’s method has at least i valid bits of μf . The proof yields an explicit bound for αf ; the bound is exponential in the number of equations in X = f(X), but we also show that it is essentially optimal. The proof does not yield any bound for kf , but only proves its existence. Constructing a bound for kf is still an open problem. Finally, we also provide a geometric interpretation of Newton’s method for SPPs.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;computational biology;context-free language;iteration;least fixed point;natural language processing;newton;newton's method;polynomial;randomized algorithm;rate of convergence;self-propelled particles;stochastic context-free grammar;stochastic process;strongly connected component;time complexity	Javier Esparza;Stefan Kiefer;Michael Luttenberger	2010	SIAM J.

Furthermore, we show that the addition of a fuse operator, that merges several vertices together, to PQFD equational systems does not increase their expressive power.	deterministic automaton;expressive power (computer science);graph (discrete mathematics);quantifier (logic);transduction (machine learning);turing completeness;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Arnaud Carayol;Thomas Colcombet	2003		10.1007/3-540-45061-0_48	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;deterministic automaton;mathematics;graph isomorphism;programming language;deterministic system;chordal graph;expressive power;algorithm	Logic	-4.207074326351295	20.884431276643568	120486

The server is asked to continuously monitor a function defined over the values observed across all streams while minimizing the communication. We study a variant in which the server is equipped with a broadcast channel and is supposed to keep track of an approximation of the set of nodes currently observing the k largest values. Such an approximate set is exact except for some imprecision in an -neighborhood of the k-th largest value. This approximation of the Top-k-Position Monitoring Problem is of interest in cases where marginal changes (e.g. due to noise) in observed values can be ignored so that monitoring an approximation is sufficient and can reduce communication. This paper extends our results from [6], where we have developed a filter-based online algorithm for the (exact) Top-k-Position Monitoring Problem. There we have presented a competitive analysis of our algorithm against an offline adversary that also is restricted to filter-based algorithms. Our new algorithms as well as their analyses use new methods. We analyze their competitiveness against adversaries that use both exact and approximate filter-based algorithms, and observe severe differences between the respective powers of these adversaries.	adversary (cryptography);approximation algorithm;competitive analysis (online algorithm);marginal model;online algorithm;online and offline;server (computing)	Alexander Mäcker;Manuel Malatyali;Friedhelm Meyer auf der Heide	2016	2016 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)	10.1109/IPDPS.2016.91	algorithm design;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;approximation;distributed computing;tracking;cluster analysis;upper and lower bounds;computational model;approximation algorithm;algorithm;server	Theory	7.518536887708096	30.495660770440757	120521

In this paper, we significantly extend their resdts in two ways. First, we show how their approach can be applied to deal with more general expectation constraints. More importantly, we provide the first parallel (Ne) algorithm for constructing a compact distribution that satisfies the constraints up to a small relative error. This algorithm deals with constraints over any event that can be verified by finite automata, including all independence constraints as well as constraints over events relating to the parity OT sum of a certain set of variables. OUT construction relies on a new and independently interesting parallel algorithm for converting a solution to a linear system into an almost basic approximate solution to the same system. We use these techniques in the first AfC derandomization of an algorithm for constructing large independent sets in duniform hypergraphs for arbitrary d. We also show how the linear programming perspective suggests new proof techniques which might be useful in general probabilistic analysis.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;automata theory;finite-state machine;linear programming;linear system;parallel algorithm;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;programming paradigm;randomized algorithm;spaces	David R.

The traditional way of manual meter reading is furthermore inconvenient and time consuming, and it wastes resources. This method is also unable to manage the sustainable water resources effectively since it requires efficient, accurate and reliable monitoring techniques that enable the utilities sector and consumers to know the level of water consumption in real-time. Real-time smart water meters that can be monitored by the user are essential and constitute a key component of the water management system. A smart water-monitoring system will make users mindful of their water consumption and help them to reduce their water usage. At the same time, users will be alerted to abnormal water usage to reduce water loss. This paper introduces the water management system based on wireless sensor networks (WSN). The system uses the IEEE 802.15.4 standard embedded in ContikiOS LibCoAP as an open-source application to create a robust and intelligent system. Visualisation and monitoring of the system is achieved following the development of a web-based system and through Pandora FMS.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;battery charger;embedded system;information leakage;language localisation;mesh networking;microcontroller;network topology;open-source software;pandora fms;real-time clock;real-time web;smartwater;spectral leakage;web application	Mduduzi John Mudumbe;Adnan M.

The same cannot be said for the nondeterministic Turing machine as a model of parallel computing. We introduce several abstract machines with fine-grained parallelism--the and-parallel Turing machine, the stronger parallel rewriting machine, and extensions of both with an interrupt capability. These machines are very powerful: the parallel rewriting machine can compute the permanent in polynomial time and the and-parallel machine with interrupt can simulate nondeterministic and alternating Turing machines of polynomial time complexity in polynomial time. All the same, they may be viewed as realistic models if time and space are suitably restricted. A n d P a r a l l e l T~arlng Mach ine s . One way of viewing the nondeterministic Turing machine is to say that at each stage, when confronted with k choices, it splits into k replicas of itself, each of which makes one of the choices. The input string is accepted if one of these machines enters an accepting state. This kind of parallelism can be termed """"or-parallelism"""". However, the nondeterministic Turing machine does not model real parallel machines in which different processors communicate with each other. Also, when faced with an input of size n that must be read, it will need at least n units of time. But by then the machine may have arrived at an exponential number of possibilities, an unrealistic scenario. Our and-parallel machine works with an unbounded binary tree. (We take a binary tree for simplici ty--any bounded arity will do.) Instead of the square scanned by the """"head"""" (representing the memory cell dealt with at the moment by a sequential computer), the tree has a """"frontier"""" of nodes, representing the memory cells dealt with at the moment by the processors comprising the parallel computer. (By """"frontier"""" we mean a subset of the binary tree such that none of its nodes is an ancestor of another, while every node in the binary tree is either an offspring or an ancestor of a node in the frontier.) In the beginning the frontier consists of the root node. The input is a finite binary tree. Each node in the frontier is in one of a finite number of states, and can be thought of as being taken care of by a different processor. Given a binary tree with frontier, the transition function ~ acts on its frontier nodes and transforms it into another binary tree with frontier. It may change the content of the nodes of the frontier in the following way: if N is a frontier node in state q with symbol t, (f can change the symbol at N. According to q and t, N may remain a frontier node, although its state may change. It can also be replaced in the frontier by its two children, who get states determined by g. If q and t are suitable, and N's sibling N ' also has suitable symbol and state, then both N * The full version of this extended abstract can be found on the World Wide Web at http ://www. cs. huj i . ac. i l /~naomil ."""	abstract machine;alternating turing machine;binary tree;care-of address;central processing unit;computer science;finite-state machine;hypertext transfer protocol;list of sega arcade system boards;memory cell (binary);non-deterministic turing machine;nondeterministic algorithm;parallel computing;polynomial;rewriting;simulation;state (computer science);time complexity;tree (data structure);world wide web	Nachum Dershowitz;Naomi Lindenstrauss	1997		10.1007/BFb0002876	computer science;theoretical computer science;symbolic-numeric computation;algorithm	Theory	-0.3742352381555618	24.414343375407967	121441

It is proved, that these families form a strict and linear hierarchy of semi-AFLs within the the family BLIND = M∩(C1) of blind multicounter languages with generator C1 = {w ∈ {a1, b1}* | |w|a1= |w|b1}. This thereby combines the families BLIND and RBC from [13] to one strict hierarchy and generalizes and sharpens Greibachs results. The strict inclusions between the k-counter families (k, r)-RBC are proved using linear algebra techniques. We also study the language theoretic monadic operation twist [18,20], in connection with the semi-AFLs of languages accepted by multicounter and multipushdown acceptors, all restricted to reversal-bounded behavior. It is verified, that the family (k, r)-RBC is twist-closed if and only if r = 0, in which case (k, 0)-RBC = M(Ck), Ck being the k-fold shuffle of disjoint copies of C1. We characterize the family M∩(PAL) of languages accepted in quasi-realtime by nondeterministic one-way reversal-bounded multipushdown acceptors as the least twist-closed trio Mtwist(PAL) generated by the set of palindromes PAL = {w ∈ {a, b}* | w = wrev}.	cone (formal languages)	Matthias Jantzen;Oleksiy Kurganskyy	2003	Inf.

Grädel characterised the polynomial class P of decision problems. In this paper, we attempt to characterise the optimisation versions of P via expressions in second order logic, many of them using universal Horn formulae with successor relations.

73c649490ac5a414092f85092578b6aa8025a781	a fast exact quantum algorithm for solitude verification		Solitude verification is arguably one of the simplest fundamental problems in distributed computing, where the goal is to verify that there is a unique contender in a network. This paper devises a quantum algorithm that exactly solves the problem on an anonymous network, which is known as a network model with minimal assumptions [Angluin, STOC’80]. The algorithm runs in O(N) rounds if every party initially has the common knowledge of an upper boundN on the number of parties. This implies that all solvable problems can be solved in O(N) rounds on average without error (i.e., with zero-sided error) on the network. As a generalization, a quantum algorithm that works in O(N log2(max{k, 2})) rounds is obtained for the problem of exactly computing any symmetric Boolean function, over n distributed input bits, which is constant over all the n bits whose sum is larger than k for k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}. All these algorithms work with the bit complexities bounded by a polynomial in N .	decision problem;distributed computing;existential quantification;network model;polynomial;quantum algorithm;symmetric boolean function	Seiichiro Tani	2017	Quantum Information & Computation		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Theory	9.404720120978615	24.153485287089648	122222

Currently, the machine learning-based technique has attracted much attention, since it can address the issues that the usage of the dynamic port numbers and the encryption technique at the transport layer in traffic. As we have known, feature selection is one of the key problems in machine learning. In this paper, in order to improve the efficiency of feature selection in dealing with large scale traffic data problem, especially to imbalance classification problem that occur in traffic classification, a Min-Max Ensemble Feature Selection (M2-EFS) is proposed to deal with traffic data, which based on balanced data partition and min-max ensemble strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that the M2-EFS can obtain higher performance in most cases, and it could efficiently deal with imbalanced problems.	artificial neural network;cloud computing;complex system;encryption;experiment;feature selection;fisher information;fisher–yates shuffle;internet;machine learning;maxima and minima;neural networks;parallel computing;selection algorithm;traffic classification	Yinxiang Huang;Yun Li;Baohua Qiang	2016	2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727646	computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining	Metrics	-3.6047950500040273	30.745175851257436	122482

However, one often needs to face the high complexities caused by the lack of logical time order information in practice. In this paper, we utilize the global clock to infuse the so-called pending period to each operation in a multiprocessor system, where the pending period is a time interval that contains the performed time of the operation. Further, we define the physical time order for any two operations with disjoint pending periods. The physical time order is obeyed by any real execution in multiprocessor systems due to that it is part of the truly happened operation orders restricted by global clock, and it is then proven to be independent and consistent with traditional logical time orders. The above novel yet fundamental concepts enables new effective approaches for analyzing multiprocessor systems, which are named pending period analysis as a whole. As a consequence of pending period analysis, many important problems of multiprocessor systems can be tackled effectively. As a significant application example, complete memory consistency verification, which was known as an NP-hard problem, can be solved with the complexity of O(n) (where n is the number of operations). Moreover, the two event ordering problems, which were proven to be Co-NP-Hard and NP-hard respectively, can both be solved with the time complexity of O(n) if restricted by pending period information.	co-np;consistency model;formal verification;internationalization and localization;linear programming relaxation;logical clock;multiprocessing;np-hardness;resultant;synchronous programming language;time complexity	Yunji Chen;Tianshi Chen;Weiwu Hu	2009	CoRR		time complexity;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;np-hard;distributed computing;algorithm	Embedded	3.3209547005304367	28.113315383865228	122756

More precisely, we show that deciding whether two modules are $1$-interleaved is NP-complete, already for bigraded, interval decomposable modules. Our proof is based on previous work showing that a constrained matrix invertibility problem can be reduced to the interleaving distance computation of a special type of persistence modules. We show that this matrix invertibility problem is NP-complete. We also give a slight improvement of the above reduction, showing that also the approximation of the interleaving distance is NP-hard for any approximation factor smaller than $3$. Additionally, we obtain corresponding hardness results for the case that the modules are indecomposable, and in the setting of one-sided stability. Furthermore, we show that checking for injections (resp. surjections) between persistence modules is NP-hard. In conjunction with earlier results from computational algebra this gives a complete characterization of the computational complexity of one-sided stability.	approximation;computation;computational complexity theory;computer algebra system;forward error correction;karp's 21 np-complete problems;np-completeness;np-hardness;persistence (computer science)	Håvard Bakke Bjerkevik;Magnus Bakke Botnan;Michael Kerber	2018	CoRR			Theory	7.227489929874519	19.468062507106634	122885

We address both questions, by reducing two well-studied models of tile assembly to models of distributed shared memory (DSM), in order to obtain results from the memory consistency conditions induced by tile assembly systems when simulated in the DSM setting. The Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) can be simulated by a DSM system that obeys causal consistency, and the locally deterministic tile assembly systems in the aTAM correspond exactly to the concurrent-write free programs that simulate tile assembly in such a model. Thus, the detection of the failure of local determinism (which had formerly been an open problem) reduces to the detection of data races in simulating programs. Further, the Kinetic Tile Assembly Model can be simulated by a DSM system that obeys GWO, a memory consistency condition defined by Steinke and Nutt. (To our knowledge, this is the first natural example of a DSM system that obeys GWO, but no stronger consistency condition.) We combine these results with the observation that self-assembly algorithms are local algorithms, and there exists a fast conversion of deterministic local algorithms into deterministic self-stabilizing algorithms. This provides an “immediate” generalization of a theorem by Soloveichik et al. about the existence of tile assembly systems that simultaneously perform two forms of self-stabilization: proofreading and self-healing. Our reductions and proof techniques can be extended to the programming of self-assembling agents in a variety of media, not just DNA tiles, and not just two-dimensional surfaces.	algorithm;causal consistency;causal filter;consistency model;distributed shared memory;error detection and correction;fault tolerance;integrated circuit;parallel computing;processor register;self-assembly;self-organization;self-stabilization;simulation;weak consistency	Aaron Sterling	2010			distributed shared memory;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;consistency model;distributed computing;self-assembly;algorithm;kinetics	Theory	2.5866795076440616	26.2826489218447	123370

[V. Auletta, R. De Prisco, P. Penna, P. Persiano, The power of verification for one-parameter agents, in: Proceedings of the 31st International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming, ICALP, in: LNCS, vol. 3142, 2004, pp. 171–182]. Our goal is to allocate load among the agents, provided that the secret data of each agent is a single positive real number: the cost they incur per unit load. In such a setting the payment is given after the load completion, therefore if a positive load is assigned to an agent, we are able to verify if the agent declared to be faster than she actually is. We design truthful mechanisms when the agents’ type sets are upper-bounded by a finite value. We provide a truthful mechanism that is c · (1 + )-approximate if the underlying algorithm is c-approximate and weakly-monotone. Moreover, if type sets are also discrete, we provide a truthful mechanism preserving the approximation ratio of its algorithmic part. Our results improve the existing ones which provide truthful mechanisms dealing only with finite type sets and do not preserve the approximation ratio of the underlying algorithm. Finally, we give applications for our payment schemes. Firstly, we give a full characterization of the Q‖Cmax problem by using our techniques. Even if our payment schemes need upper-bounded type sets, every instance ofQ‖Cmax can be ‘‘mapped’’ into an instance with upper-bounded type sets preserving the approximation ratio. In conclusion, we turn our attention to binary demand games. In particular, we show that the Minimum Radius Spanning Tree admits an exact truthful mechanismwith verification achieving time (and space) complexity of the fastest centralized algorithm for it. This contrasts with a recent truthful mechanism for the same problem [G. Proietti, P. Widmayer, A truthful mechanism for the non-utilitarianminimum radius spanning tree problem, in: Proceedings of the 17th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures, SPAA, ACM Press, 2005, pp. 195–202] which pays a linear factor with respect to the complexity of the fastest centralized algorithm. Such a result is extended to several binary demand games studied in literature. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We also report results of a numerical experiment using random test problems and our implementation. These performance results, to the best of our knowledge, are the first available for the Van Slyke and Wets algorithm on a parallel processor. They indicate that the benchmark implementation parallelizes well, and that even with the use of parallel processing, problems with random variables having large numbers of realizations can take prohibitively large amounts of computation for solution. Thus, they demonstrate the need for exploiting both parallelization and approximation for the solution of stochastic programs. 15 refs., 18 tabs.	algorithm;benchmark (computing)	K. A. Ariyawansa;D.

We show that there exists a function which has at most logarithmic communication complexity for randomized protocols with one-sided falsepositives error probability of 1/3, but which has linear communication complexity for deterministic protocols and, in fact, even for the more powerful nondeterministic protocols. The result holds for every ε > 0 and every k ≤ 2(1−ε)n players, where n is the number of bits on each player’s forehead. As a consequence, we obtain the NOF communication class separation coRP 6⊂ NP. This in particular implies that P 6= RP and NP 6= coNP. We also show that for every ε > 0 and every k ≤ n1−ε , there exists a function which has constant randomized complexity for public coin protocols but at least logarithmic complexity for private coin protocols. No larger gap between private and public coin protocols is possible. Our lower bounds are existential; no explicit function is known to satisfy nontrivial lower bounds for k ≥ logn players. However, for every ε > 0 and every k ≤ (1− ε) · logn players, the NP 6= coNP separation (and even the coNP 6⊂MA separation) was obtained independently by Gavinsky and Sherstov (2010) using an explicit construction.

f35d240252d769d87653879fc248e11d067b4e8f	brief announcement: probabilistic stabilization under probabilistic schedulers	theoretical computer science;computer science all	"""Motivation. Roughly speaking, a weakly stabilizing system $\cal S$ executed under a probabilistic scheduler ρ is probabilistically self-stabilizing, in the sense that any execution eventually reaches a legitimate execution with probability 1 [1-3]. Here ρ is a set of Markov chains, one of which is selected for $\cal S$ by an adversary to generate as its evolution an infinite activation sequence to execute $\cal S$. The performance measure is the worst case expected convergence time $\tau_{{\cal S},M}$ when $\cal S$ is executed under a Markov chain M∈ρ. Let $\tau_{{\cal S},\rho} = \sup_{M \in \rho} \tau_{{\cal S},M}$. Then $\cal S$ can be """"comfortably"""" used as a probabilistically self-stabilizing system under ρ only if $\tau_{{\cal S},\rho} < \infty$. There are $\cal S$ and ρ such that $\tau_{{\cal S},\rho} = \infty$, despite that $\tau_{{\cal S},M} < \infty$ for any M∈ρ. Somewhat interesting is that, for some $\cal S$, there is a randomised version ${\cal S}^*$ of $\cal S$ such that $\tau_{{\cal S}^*,\rho} < \infty$, despite that $\tau_{{\cal S},\rho} = \infty$, i.e., randomization helps. This motivates a characterization of $\cal S$ that satisfies $\tau_{{\cal S}^*,\rho} < \infty$."""	probabilistic turing machine	Yukiko Yamauchi;Sébastien Tixeuil;Shuji Kijima;Masafumi Yamashita	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33651-5_34	computer science;artificial intelligence;calculus;mathematics	Vision	-2.680459694929214	25.190644597176828	125062

As it is shown, the sets P, NP and NPco-NP are the domains or ranges respectively of certain types of functions computable in this way. With the help of polynomial time-bounded oracle Turing machines different computability concepts are introduced which turn out to be stronger and/or weaker than deterministic and single-valued nondeterministic polynomial-time computability. Whether they are properly stronger or weaker depends on the solution of NP=?co-NP, P=?NPco-NP and P=?NP, respectively.	computation;np (complexity);p (complexity)	Dieter Spreen;Hans Stahl	1987		10.1007/3-540-18170-9_182	p;discrete mathematics;np;exptime;pp;time hierarchy theorem;pspace;alternating turing machine;turing machine;theoretical computer science;universal turing machine;2-exptime;mathematics;up;np-easy;probabilistic turing machine;nondeterministic algorithm;algorithm	Theory	6.778615066569315	20.831676931314806	125496

The machines halt at some ordinal time or diverge. We construct tree representations for ordinal semidecidable sets of reals from ordinal computations. The aim is to generalize uniformization results to classes of sets which are semi-decidable by computations with input-dependent bounds on the halting time.

4b7c90a8097934e1838517294880d208f63769ab	complexity theory column 88: challenges in polynomial factorization1		Algebraic complexity theory studies the complexity of computing (multivariate) polynomials efficiently using algebraic circuits. This succinct representation leads to fundamental algorithmic challenges such as the polynomial identity testing (PIT) problem (decide nonzeroness of the computed polynomial) and the polynomial factorization problem (compute succinct representations of the factors of the circuit). While the Schwartz-Zippel-DeMillo-Lipton Lemma [Sch80,Zip79,DL78] gives an easy randomized algorithm for PIT, randomized algorithms for factorization require more ideas as given by Kaltofen [Kal89]. However, even derandomizing PIT remains a fundamental problem in understanding the power of randomness.  In this column, we survey the factorization problem, discussing the algorithmic ideas as well as the applications to other problems. We then discuss the challenges ahead, in particular focusing on the goal of obtaining deterministic factoring algorithms. While deterministic PIT algorithms have been developed for various restricted circuit classes, there are very few corresponding factoring algorithms. We discuss some recent progress on the divisibility testing problem (test if a given polynomial divides another given polynomial) which captures some of the difficulty of factoring. Along the way we attempt to highlight key challenges whose solutions we hope will drive progress in the area.	algebraic equation;computational complexity theory;factorization of polynomials;integer factorization;polynomial identity testing;randomized algorithm;randomness;trial division	Michael A.

We present a simple and practical algorithm (TDAG) for discrete sequence prediction. Based on a text-compression method, the TDAG algorithm limits the growth of storage by retaining the most likely prediction contexts and discarding (forgetting) less likely ones. The storage/speed tradeoffs are parameterized so that the algorithm can be used in a variety of applications. Our experiments verify its performance on data compression tasks and show how it applies to two problems: dynamically optimizing Prolog programs for good average-case behavior and maintaining a cache for a database on mass storage.	algorithm;attribute-based encryption;automatic computing engine;best, worst and average case;black box;cpu cache;data compression;directed acyclic graph;dynamic programming;experiment;extrapolation;machine learning;mass storage;mathematical optimization;prolog;prototype;regular expression;stream (computing);string (computer science);subroutine;topological data analysis	Philip D.

For each (possibly infinitary) signature Σ the terminal Σ-coalgebra is thus proved to be the coalgebra of all Σ-labelled trees; this is the completion of the set of all such trees of finite depth. A set functor is presented which has a fixed point but does not have a greatest fixed point. A sufficient condition for the existence of a greatest fixed point is proved: the existence of two fixed points of successor cardinalities.	least fixed point	Jirí Adámek;Václav Koubek	1995	Theor.

Focusing on discrete models of these networks, namely, Boolean automata networks, we propose to analyse the contribution of non-monotony to the diversity and complexity in their dynamical behaviours. More precisely, in this paper, we start by detailing some motivations, both mathematical and biological, for our interest in non-monotony, and we discuss how it may account for phenomena that cannot be produced by monotony only. Then, to build some understanding in this direction, we show some preliminary results on the dynamical behaviours of some specific non-monotone Boolean automata networks called xor circulant networks.	automata theory;automaton;boolean algebra;circulant matrix;dynamical system;exclusive or;interaction;prospective search;monotone	Mathilde Noual;Damien Regnault;Sylvain Sené	2013	Theor.

L-PDTAs accept an important class of tree languages since the class of their yield languages coincides with the class of yield languages generated by tree adjoining grammars (TAGs). The proposed algorithm is obtained by combining a bottom-up parsing procedure on trees with the CKY (Cocke-Kasami-Younger) algorithm. The running time of the algorithm is O(n4), where n is the number of nodes of an input tree.	stack (abstract data type);tree automaton	Akio Fujiyoshi;Ikuo Kawaharada	2005		10.1007/11605157_11	deterministic context-free language;deterministic pushdown automaton;segment tree;discrete mathematics;tree rotation;deterministic context-free grammar;nested word;trie;theoretical computer science;range tree;k-ary tree;interval tree;mathematics;context-free language;tree structure;search tree;tree;tree traversal;pushdown automaton;embedded pushdown automaton;algorithm	Logic	-2.1878181299689556	20.819562596620713	127447

On the negative side, we prove that checking QCSP satisfiability remains PSPACE-hard for all known structural properties more general than bounded treewidth and for the incomparable hypergraph acyclicity. Moreover, if the domain is not fixed, the problem is PSPACE-hard even for tree-shaped constraint scopes. On the positive side, we identify relevant tractable classes, including QCSPs with prefix ∃∀ having bounded hypertree width, and QCSPs with a bounded number of guards. The latter are solvable in polynomial time without any bound on domains or quantifier alternations.	cobham's thesis;constraint satisfaction problem;decision problem;pspace;quantifier (logic);time complexity;treewidth	Georg Gottlob;Gianluigi Greco;Francesco Scarcello	2005			time complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;algorithm;satisfiability	AI	7.92976734196331	18.57464325069442	128820

We extend this operation to entire languages and investigate, whether the classes of the Chomsky hierarchy are closed under duplication. Here we treat mainly bounded duplication, where the factors duplicated cannot exceed a given length. While over two letters the regular languages are closed under bounded duplication, over three or more letters they are not, if the length bound is 4 or greater. For 2 they are closed under duplication, the case of 3 remains open. Finally, the class of context-free languages is closed under duplication over alphabets of any size.	chomsky hierarchy;context-free language;iteration;regular language;rewriting;square-free word	Masami Ito;Peter Leupold;Kayoko Shikishima-Tsuji	2006		10.1007/11779148_22	arithmetic;regular language;letter;rewriting;computer science;closure;mathematics;context-free language;programming language;algorithm;gene duplication	NLP	-2.3503632801202845	19.845857153622273	128898

We prove that for any c-balanced Parry word u, the values of the abelian complexity function can be computed by a finite-state automaton. The proof is based on the notion of relative Parikh vectors. The approach works for any function F (n) that can be expressed in terms of the set of relative Parikh vectors corresponding to the length n. For example, we show that the balance function of a c-balanced Parry word is computable by a finitestate automaton as well.	complexity function;computable function;deterministic finite automaton;finite-state machine;parry	Ondrej Turek	2015	Theor.

We propose a variant of sophistication that depends on the coarse graining (level of detail) at which the string is described. Then, we use the idea behind the self-dissimilarity complexity measure of Wolpert and Macready to propose new ways for computing the maximal sophistication of a string and identifying absolutely nonstochastic strings. Also, we propose new measures for approximating the maximal sophistication of a finite string and the smallest amount of time required by a program to uncover all regularities in a string.	kolmogorov complexity;level of detail;logical depth;maximal set;self-dissimilarity;string (computer science)	Fouad B.

Kratochv́ıl, Savický and Tuza [6] show that there exists a function f(k) such that for all s ≤ f(k), all (k, s)-SAT instances are satisfiable whereas for k ≥ 3 and s > f(k), (k, s)-SAT is NP-complete. We define a new function u(k) as the minimum s such that uniquely satisfiable (k, s)-SAT formulas exist. We show that for k ≥ 3, unique solutions and NP-hardness occur at almost the same value of s: f(k) ≤ u(k) ≤ f(k) + 2. We also give a parsimonious reduction from SAT to (k, s)-SAT for any k ≥ 3 and s ≥ f(k) + 2. When combined with the Valiant–Vazirani Theorem [8], this gives a randomized polynomial time reduction from SAT to UNIQUE-(k, s)-SAT.	boolean satisfiability problem;conjunctive normal form;np-completeness;np-hardness;occam's razor;polynomial;polynomial-time reduction;rp (complexity);randomized algorithm;valiant–vazirani theorem	William Matthews;Ramamohan Paturi	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14186-7_34	arithmetic;computer science;mathematics;linguistics;algorithm;satisfiability	Theory	8.164718713924524	19.31984594731422	129273

The word under consideration can be interpreted as a description of certain screen image in the following way: the i-th letter of the word encodes the color of the i-th screen cell. In this case a decision tree which recognizes some words may be interpreted as an algorithm for the recognition of images which are defined by considered words. The classification of all regular languages depending on the growth of minimal depth of decision trees for language word recognition with the growth of the word length is obtained.

Substitutability in context-free languages can be thought of as the analogue of reversibility in regular languages. While reversible languages admit a hierarchy, namely  k -reversible regular languages for each nonnegative integer  k , Clark and Eyraud targeted the subclass of context-free languages that corresponds to zero-reversible regular languages only. Following Clark and Eyraud's proposal, this paper introduces a hierarchy of substitutable context-free languages as the analogue of that of  k -reversible regular languages and shows that each class in the hierarchy is also polynomial-time identifiable in the limit from positive data.	context-free grammar	Ryo Yoshinaka	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88009-7_21	time complexity;combinatorics;formal language;discrete mathematics;pumping lemma for regular languages;regular language;pumping lemma for context-free languages;computer science;mathematics;context-free language;cone;abstract family of languages;programming language;generalized star height problem;algorithm	NLP	-2.447059527987168	18.930967829912905	129932

Unfortunately, it has been shown that most interesting functions are not privately computable [Kushilevitz 1989, Brandt and Sandholm 2008]. The unattainability of perfect privacy for many functions motivated the study of approximate privacy. Feigenbaum et al. [2010a, 2010b] define notions of worst-case as well as average-case approximate privacy and present several interesting upper bounds as well as some open problems for further study. In this article, we obtain asymptotically tight bounds on the trade-offs between both the worst-case and average-case approximate privacy of protocols and their communication cost for Vickrey auctions.  Further, we relate the notion of average-case approximate privacy to other measures based on information cost of protocols. This enables us to prove exponential lower bounds on the subjective approximate privacy of protocols for computing the Intersection function, independent of its communication cost. This proves a conjecture of Feigenbaum et al.

For monitoring and managing the environments, this paper proposes a Ubiquitous Field Server  System (UFSS) on wireless sensor networks. Also this system uses solar energy. The UFSS can monitor and collect the information  of field environments and the system’s location using the environment and soil sensors, CCTV camera, GPS (Global Positioning  System) module, and solar cell module without restriction of the power supply and the system’s location. This system composes  of three layers. The devices layer includes sensors, GPS, CCTV camera, and solar cell. The middle layer consists of the soil  manager, the location manager, the motion manager, the information storage, and the web server. The application layer provides  with the soil and environments monitoring service, the location monitoring service, the motion monitoring service, and statistics  service. Finally, we apply the each layer’s modules to the UFSS, and show the executing results of our system using GUIs.

In this article we present two new algorithms for trace reduction: Safely Allowed Drop (SAD) and Optimal LRU Reduction (OLR). Both achieve high reduction factors and guarantee exact simulations for common replacement policies and for memories larger than a user-defined threshold. In particular, simulation on OLR-reduced traces is accurate for the LRU replacement algorithm, while simulation on SAD-reduced traces is accurate for the LRU and OPT algorithms. Both policies can easily be modified and extended to maintain timing information, thus allowing for exact simulation of the Working Set and VMIN policies. OLR also satisfies an optimality property: for a given original trace and chosen memory size, it produces the shortest possible reduced trace that has the same LRU behavior as the original for a memory of at least the chosen size. We present a proof of this optimality of OLR, and show that SAD, while not optimal, yields nearly optimal performance in practice.Our approach has multiple applications, especially in simulating virtual memory systems; many page replacement algorithms are similar to LRU in that more recently referenced pages are likely to be resident. For several replacement algorithms in the literature, SAD- and OLR-reduced traces yield exact simulations. For many other algorithms, our trace reduction eliminates information that matters little: we present extensive measurements to show that the error for simulations of the clock and segq (segmented queue) replacement policies (the most common LRU approximations) is under 3% for the vast majority of memory sizes. In nearly all cases, the error is much smaller than that incurred by the well-known stack deletion technique.SAD and OLR have many desirable properties. In practice, they achieve reduction factors up to several orders of magnitude. The reduction translates to both storage savings and simulation speedups. Both techniques require little memory and perform a single forward traversal of the original trace, making them suitable for online trace reduction. Neither requires that the simulator be modified to accept the reduced trace.	approximation;information;page replacement algorithm;requirement;simulation;tracing (software);tree traversal;whole earth 'lectronic link;working set	Scott F.

In one such model, jobs arrive according to a rateαN Poisson process, with α < 1, in a system of N rate-1 exponential server queues. In Vvedenskaya et al. (Probl. Inf. Transm. 32:15–29, 1996), it was shown that when each arriving job is assigned to the shortest of D, D ≥ 2, randomly chosen queues, the equilibrium queue sizes decay doubly exponentially in the limit as N → ∞. This is a substantial improvement over the case D = 1, where queue sizes decay exponentially. The reasoning in Vvedenskaya et al. (Probl. Inf. Transm. 32:15–29, 1996) does not easily generalize to jobs with nonexponential service time distributions. A modularized program for treating randomized load balancing problems with general service time distributions was introduced in Bramson et al. (Proc. ACM SIGMETRICS, pp. 275–286, 2010). The program relies on an ansatz that asserts that, for a randomized load balancing scheme in equilibrium, any fixed number of queues become independent of one another as N → ∞. This allows computation of queue size distributions and other performance measures of interest. In this article, we demonstrate the ansatz in several settings. We consider the least loaded balancing problem, where an arriving job is assigned to the queue with the smallest workload. We also consider the more difficult problem, where an arriving M.

(Such a verifier can only query polylogarithmically many bits of the input instance and the proof. Thus it needs oracle access to the input as well as the proof, and cannot guarantee that the input is in the language - only that it is close to some string in the language.) If the verifier is restricted further in its query complexity and only allowed q queries, then the proof size blows up by a factor of 2/sup (log n)c/q/ where the constant c depends only on the language (and is independent of q). Our results thus give efficient (in the sense of running time) versions of the shortest known PCPs, due to Ben-Sasson et al. (STOC '04) and Ben-Sasson and Sudan (STOC '05), respectively. The time complexity of the verifier and the size of the proof were the original emphases in the definition of holographic proofs, due to Babai et al. (STOC '91), and our work is the first to return to these emphases since their work.

Such systems with membrane division (corresponding to the mitosis behavior of living cells) can theoretically generate exponential working space in linear time, therefore providing a possible way to solve computational hard problems in feasible time by a space-time trade-off. In this work, we construct a family of P system with membrane division to solve Partition problems, and achieve a polynomial time solution (with respect to the size of the problems). Furthermore, we prove that the systems are constructed in a uniform manner and work in a confluent way.	p system;partition problem	Ying Jiang;Zhiqiang Chen	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-45049-9_33	chromatography;mathematical optimization;combinatorics	Logic	1.7361547464937597	24.704056890057302	132726

e8a16f3528cf7a1a48d755bcab2a985ca86eebab	time-free solution to hamilton path problems using p systems with d-division		P systems with d-division are a particular class of distributed and parallel computing models investigated in membrane computing, which are inspired from the budding behavior of Baker’s yeast (a cell can generate several cells in one reproducing cycle). In previous works, such systems can theoretically generate exponential working space in linear time and thus provide a way to solve computational hard problems in polynomial time by a space-time tradeoff, where the precise execution time of each evolution rule, one time unit, plays a crucial role. However, the restriction that each rule has a precise same execution time does not coincide with the biological fact, since the execution time of biochemical reactions can vary because of external uncontrollable conditions. In this work, we consider timed P systems with d-division by adding a time mapping to the rules to specify the execution time for each rule, as well as the efficiency of the systems. As a result, a time-free solution to Hamiltonian path problem (HPP) is obtained by a family of such systems (constructed in a uniformway), that is, the execution time of the rules (specified by different timemappings) has no influence on the correctness of the solution.	computation;correctness (computer science);hamiltonian path problem;membrane computing;p system;parallel computing;polynomial;run time (program lifecycle phase);space–time tradeoff;time complexity;workspace	Tao Song;Xun Wang;Hongjiang Zheng	2013	J.

Roughly, a language L in NP is commitable if given any instance x and any string y , a string z can be found in polynomial time such that z is in L iff y is a prefix of a witness of x in the context of a PTIME relation that defines L . It is shown that all NP sets complete under polynomial-time many-one reductions are commitable. Commitability can be seen as a genralization of d-self-reducibility. Every d-self-reducible set is commited and yet, commitability retains an important aspect of d-self-reducibility: the tree search method of Berman is shown to be extendible to commitable sets. Therefore, certain known results about reductions to co-sparse sets and p-selective sets generalize from d-self-reductible sets to commitable sets. The connection with paddability is as follows: Every paddable and commitable set is shown to be d-self-reducible. It is also shown that paddability in NP implies kernel constructibility, which was introduced elsewhere to capture a notion of self-reducibility more general than d-self-reducibility.	padding (cryptography)	Sanjeev N.

The organization, called digital B-tree (DB-tree), is similar in many aspects to B-trees. Its advantage is that it permits much larger fanout per node, thus reducing the height of the tree for a given file size. The effect of this is to reduce the cost of a random access to the file. The fanout of DB-tree nodes is increased substantially by permitting multiple page nodes. The unique advantage of DB-trees is that only one page of the node need ever be examined for each data access. This is accomplished by using the bits of the key to ‘compute which page of the node is desired, in a way similar to the technique used in extendible hashing, but without performing a hashing operation. The DB-tree organization is described and analyzed. Particular algorithms are suggested for searching, building, and maintaining DB-trees. mize this cost requires that the fanout of each node be maximized since tree height (h) is given by:	algorithm;b-tree;binary tree;data access;extendible hashing;extensibility;fan-out;random access;sequential access;tree (data structure)	David B.

The reformulated problem can be solved via polynomial multiplication. If the CSP has n variables whose domain size is m, and if the equivalent programming problem involves M equations, then the number of solutions can be determined in time O(nm2M−n). This surprising link between search problems and algebraic techniques allows us to show improved bounds for several constraint satisfaction problems, including new simply exponential bounds for determining the number of solutions to the n-queens problem. We also address the problem of minimizing M for a particular CSP.	anshel–anshel–goldfeld key exchange;approximation algorithm;coefficient;constraint graph;constraint satisfaction problem;dynamic programming;integer programming;linear algebra;linear programming;np-hardness;planar graph;polynomial ring;time complexity	Igor Rivin;Ramin Zabih	1989			constraint logic programming;mathematical optimization;constraint programming;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;decomposition method;constraint satisfaction;computer science;constraint graph;cutting stock problem;constraint satisfaction dual problem;mathematics;complexity of constraint satisfaction;constraint satisfaction problem;hybrid algorithm;local consistency;backtracking	AI	7.488596593886839	18.40539698291692	134099

This gives another example of a Thue system with a decidable word problem, but solving it using a canonical string rewriting system is possible only by introducing new additional symbols. In contrast to the example obtained recently by Kapur and Narendran (1984) this system presents a monoid which is in fact a group.	semi-thue system;semiconductor industry	Matthias Jantzen	1985	Inf.

The system is designed to enable significant reduction of energy consumption and carbon footprint by increasing the energy efficiency of the building under control. The system consists of a Linux-based remotely accessible main embedded control unit, a custom designed programmable logic controller named littlePLC, and a propriatery low-power Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The energy flow is optimized by using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that runs on the main control unit. The main control unit communicates with littlePLC, which serves as an interface that controls the parameters and state of HVAC systems in the building. The feedback information for MPC is gathered by means of the WSN, which consists of various sensor node types, such as temperature, air pressure, humidity, VOC and CO2. The WSN nodes are connected in a star type network topology, with a communication HUB connected to the main control unit. The information gathered by WSN are used in the MPC algorithm in order to calculate and estimate the requirements for heat corrections, with respect to ventilation and weather predictions.	a* search algorithm;control system;control unit;embedded system;home automation;linux;low-power broadcasting;network topology;programmable logic device;requirement;sensor node;smart card;stellar classification	Niksa Skeledzija;Josip Cesic;Edin Koco;Vladimir Bachler;Hrvoje Nikola Vucemilo;Hrvoje Dzapo	2014	2014 37th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859554	embedded system;real-time computing;operating system;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Embedded	1.4241997098609642	31.501583465716	134304

If the acceptance condition can be performed by a tree automaton, we obtain the concept of locally definable acceptance types (U. Hertrampf, 1992). This concept can be varied in different ways: if the acceptance condition depends only on the leaves of the computation tree, we obtain the concept of leaf languages (D. Bovet et al., 1991); if moreover the leaf language has to be a regular set, we obtain associative acceptance types. A special case appears, if we just count the number /spl alpha/ of accepting paths up to a fixed maximal value c (i.e. /spl alpha/=max(# accepting paths, c)) and then check, whether /spl alpha/ belongs to a given subset A/spl sube/{0,...,c-1}. This concept leads to complexity classes with finite acceptance types. We survey all these concepts and compare their power. >	complexity class	Ulrich Hertrampf	1994		10.1109/SCT.1994.315801	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;time hierarchy theorem;structural complexity theory;mathematics;algorithm	Crypto	1.8980591729423786	20.4234917257358	134431

Over the Boolean domain {0, 1}, it is known that if the learner is allowed unlimited computational resources then any concept class learnable in one model is also learnable in the other. In addition, any polynomial-time learning algorithm for a concept class in the mistake-bound model can be transformed into one that learns the class in the distribution-free model. This paper shows that if one-way functions exist, then the mistake-bound model is strictly harder than the distribution-free model for polynomial-time learning. Specifically, given a one-way function, we show how to create a concept class over {0, 1} that is learnable in polynomial time in the distribution-free model, but not in the absolute mistake-bound model. In addition, the concept class remains hard to learn in the mistake-bound model even if the learner is allowed a polynomial number of membership queries. The concepts considered are based upon the Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali random function construction [9] and involve creating the following new cryptographic object: an exponentially long sequence of strings σ1, σ2, . . . , σr over {0, 1} that is hard to compute in one direction (given σi one cannot compute σj for j < i) but is easy to compute and even make random-access jumps in the other direction (given σi and j > i one can compute σj , even if j is exponentially larger than i). Similar sequences considered previously [6, 7] did not allow random-access jumps forward without knowledge of a seed allowing one to compute backwards as well.	algorithm;computation;computational learning theory;computational resource;concept class;cryptography;decision list;deterministic finite automaton;one-way function;polynomial;random access;time complexity;turing completeness;vieta's formulas	Avrim Blum	1990		10.1109/FSCS.1990.89540	boolean circuit;combinatorics;boolean model;discrete mathematics;boolean network;boolean domain;boolean expression;standard boolean model;computer science;maximum satisfiability problem;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;concept class;computational learning theory;one-way function;algorithm;statistics;algebra	Theory	9.580828523511459	19.66529669493216	134548

Two discrete timed automata W (the “writer”) andR (“the reader”). 2. One unrestricted queue that can be used to send messages fr omW toR. There is no bound on the length of the queue. W andR do not share a global clock and operate in a loosely synchrono us way. That is, the absolute value of the difference between the local time of W and the local time of R is always bounded by a positive constant. We show that the binary reach ability for these systems is effectively computable, and this result is generalized to the case when there are two queues (one from W to R and the other fromR to W ) that operate in half-duplex. We then present some properties (e.g., safety, invariance, etc.) that can be ver ified for loosely synchronous queueconnected discrete timed automata and give an example of a sy stem composed of a sensor and a controller that is verifiable using our results.	analysis of algorithms;automata theory;computable function;data structure;discrete mathematics;duplex (telecommunications);finite-state machine;formal verification;one-way function;portable collision avoidance system;reachability;recursion;stack (abstract data type);timed automaton;ver (command)	Oscar H.

Hence it is advisable to study randomization for restricted models of computation.We followthis approach by investigating the power of randomization for pushdown automata.Our main results are as follows. First we show that deterministic pushdown automata are weaker than Las Vegas pushdown automata, which in turn are weaker than one-sided-error pushdown automata. Finally one-sided-error pushdown automata are weaker than (nondeterministic) pushdown automata.In contrast to many other fundamental models of computing there are no known methods of decreasing error probabilities.We show that such methods do not exist by constructing languages which are recognizable by one-sided-error pushdown automata with error probability 1/2, but not by one-sided-error pushdown automata with error probability p < 1/2. On the other hand we construct languages which are not deterministic context-free (resp. not context-free) but are recognizable with arbitrarily small error by one-sided-error (resp. bounded-error) pushdown automata.	deterministic pushdown automaton;randomized algorithm;stack (abstract data type)	Juraj Hromkovic;Georg Schnitger	2001		10.1007/3-540-46011-X_22	deterministic context-free language;deterministic pushdown automaton;discrete mathematics;deterministic context-free grammar;computer science;nested word;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;mathematics;context-free language;distributed computing;automaton;pushdown automaton;embedded pushdown automaton;algorithm;statistics	Theory	0.6121194175821962	21.871549103475978	134992

Today, if many thermal transmittance measurements in a short time are needed, the current devices, based on the measurement of the heat flow through the wall, cannot carry out them, except if a great amount of devices are used at once along with intensive and tedious post-processing and analysis work. In this paper, from well-known physical laws, authors develop a methodology based on three temperatures measurements, which is implemented by a novel thermal transmittance metre. The paper shows its development step by step. As a result the developed device is modular, scalable, and fully wireless; it is capable of taking as many measurements at once as user needs. The developed system is compared working together on a same test to the currently used one based on heat flow. The results show that the developed metre allows carrying out thermal transmittance measurements in buildings in a cheap, quick, reliable and simple way.	bidirectional scattering distribution function;carrying;conflict (psychology);mandatory - hl7definedroseproperty;manuscripts;scalability;video post-processing	José Manuel Andújar Márquez;Miguel Ángel Martínez Bohórquez;Sergio Gómez Melgar	2017		10.3390/s17092017	thermal transmittance;electronic engineering;engineering;scalability;modular design;retrofitting;r-value (insulation)	Mobile	4.299062328001973	30.81965755727289	135297

bb7d6e248b0dbfb39c0ded387b2ff5c9608356a2	bio-inspired routing strategies for wireless sensor networks		Successful behavioural and communication strategies of biotic communities can serve as an inspiration for algorithms used to design, manage, and control real-world networks. Many natural systems exhibit complex yet efficient behaviours. Some animal communities display sophisticated behavioural patterns arising from fairly simple activities of their members. The behaviours of ant colonies, swarms of bees, schools of fish, and even some human communities, can be seen as properties of distributed systems consisting of individual agents performing straightforward actions and communicating using simple strategies. Formally, the behaviour of such communities can be modelled as a massive yet intuitive multiagent system. The ensuingmodels can be applied to a variety of networking problems. This chapter looks at routing in wireless sensor networks andmobile ad-hoc networks as tasks that bear similarities to communication in biotic societies and swarms, and underlines the role of propagation phenomena in routing. It summarizes the basic principles of swarm intelligence and evolutionary computing and reviews recent advances in biologically-inspired network routing.	agent-based model;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;ant colony;autonomous robot;behavioral pattern;british informatics olympiad;computer;continuous optimization;data mining and knowledge discovery;discrete optimization;distributed computing;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation;global optimization;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;next-generation network;routing;routing table;scalability;software propagation;swarm intelligence;throughput	Pavel Krömer;Petr Musílek	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-15916-4_7	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;geographic routing	AI	0.048898685571049934	28.245935500424867	135545

We recall the notion of synchronization by grammars, and for any given grammar we consider the class of languages recognized by automata generated by all its synchronized grammars. The synchronization is an automaton-related notion: all grammars generating the same automaton synchronize the same languages. When the synchronizing automaton is unambiguous, the class of its synchronized languages forms an effective boolean algebra lying between the classes of regular languages and unambiguous context-free languages. We additionally provide sufficient conditions for such classes to be closed under concatenation and its iteration.	automaton;boolean algebra;concatenation;context-free grammar;context-free language;finite-state machine;iteration;pseudoforest;pushdown automaton;regular language;stack (abstract data type)	Didier Caucal	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03816-7_2	deterministic context-free language;indexed language;context-sensitive grammar;boolean algebra;tree-adjoining grammar;nondeterministic finite automaton with ε-moves;formal language;discrete mathematics;deterministic context-free grammar;nondeterministic finite automaton;regular language;regular grammar;computer science;nested word;theoretical computer science;probabilistic automaton;regular tree grammar;syntax;mathematics;context-free language;abstract family of languages;context-free grammar;programming language;ambiguous grammar;stochastic context-free grammar;embedded pushdown automaton;algorithm;context-sensitive language	Logic	-2.3416235652174806	20.991338416396104	136007

The area covered by one base station can be seen as a cell in the network. Regardless of the location of a user the network should be able to provide the services. Therefore each cell should have enough resources to succeed in meeting the demand. Arising from this the analysis of the network can to a certain extent be divided into the analysis of separate cells. In this paper, methods for finding outlying base stations are examined by applying them on the analysis of real data from GSM network. As little as possible prior knowledge of the network is used in the analysis. This way the methods stay more portable into use with data from other networks. The results of the methods are analyzed by comparing them to each other.	algorithm;anomaly detection;artificial neural network;broadcast television systems inc.;geographic coordinate system;kernel density estimation;microsoft windows;mixture model;randomness;sensor;unsupervised learning	Mikko Multanen;Kimmo Raivio;Pasi Lehtimäki	2008	22nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Workshops (aina workshops 2008)	10.1109/WAINA.2008.266	gsm;telecommunications;information science;computer science;dynamic network analysis;base station;operating system;machine learning;data mining;network simulation;network delay	HPC	-1.7525520292150454	28.7689881808551	136602

Mathematically, the structure of a star event is that of a monoid. First it is shown that every regular event contains a finite number of maximal star events, which are shown to be regular and can be effectively computed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a regular event to be the union of its maximal star events are found. Next, star events are factored out from arbitrary events, yielding the form <italic>W</italic> - <italic>V</italic>*<italic>T</italic>. For each <italic>W</italic> there exists a unique largest <italic>V</italic>* and a unique smallest <italic>T</italic>; an algorithm for finding suitable regular expressions for <italic>V</italic> and <italic>T</italic> is developed. Finally, an open problem of Paz and Peleg is answered: Every regular event is decomposable as a finite product of star events and prime events.	a* search algorithm;maximal set;regular expression;star trek:;star height	Janusz A.

Besides being itself an interesting topic in formal language theory, they have been naturally applied to modelling noisy channels. We introduce the concept of substitution on trajectories which generalizes a class of substitution operations. Within this framework, we study their closure properties and decision questions related to language equations. We also discuss applications of substitution on trajectories in modelling complex channels and a cryptanalysis problem.	cryptanalysis;formal language;language equation;microsoft word for mac	Lila Kari;Stavros Konstantinidis;Petr Sosík	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-27812-2_14	cryptanalysis;formal language;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;philosophy of language;trajectory;closure;word;mathematics;programming language;algorithm;statistics	DB	-1.6705655165158932	19.027657644005107	136677

It is well known that the deterministic tree automatonwith smallest total number of states, that is, number of vertical states and number of states used to define the horizontal languages, is not unique and it is hard to establish lower bounds for the total number of states. By relying on existing bounds for the size of unambiguous finite automata, we give a lower bound for the size blow-up of determinizing a nondeterministic unranked tree automaton. The lower bound improves the earlier known lower bound that was based on an ad hoc construction. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

2b02e856c14cafa68315fc18bf4b276f3de5f07a	immunity (extended abstract)	extended abstract	"""There are a number of results about the separation of relativized complexity classes specified by deterministic or nondeterministic machines [1,4,11,12]. In the case of time-bounded machines, some individuals have taken the view that such results say little about the difference between determinism and nondeterminism in ordinary computation but rather illustrate the power of nondeterministic oracle machines to generate a large set of strings to be aueried. Recently, Xu, Doner, and Book [19] provided strong evidence for this thesis by establishing a general separating theorem in the context of """"degrees of non. 9 i, determ• (that is, refined nondeterminism in the sense of Kintala [11,12]). The result of Xu, Doner, and Book is proved for classes specified by oracle machines where both the number of nondeterministic steps and also the number of oracle queries allowed in computations are bounded by functions of the length of the input. (See [4,6,7,18] for other results about classes specified by machines with these parameters bounded. ) In the present paper we consider """"strong separation"""" theorems: to witness E1 ~ ~2' exhibit L @ ~2 such that L is infinite but no infinite subset of L is in ~i"""" The first context in which this is done is that of polynomial time-bounded oracle machines: for any A, a set L is P(A)-immune if L is infinite but has no infinite subset in P(A). Our first result shows the existence of a recursive set A such that NP(A) has a P(A)-immune set. (This was first established by Homer and Maass [9] .) Our proof does not depend on polynomial timebounds as such, but rather on polynomial bounds on the number of nondeterministic steps and the number of oracle queries in computations."""	complexity class;computation;nondeterministic algorithm;oracle machine;recursion;recursive set;time complexity;tutte polynomial;unbounded nondeterminism	Uwe Schöning;Ronald V.

We prove that if the control language is linear and non-regular, then the power of pushdown automata regulated in this way is increased to the power of Turing machines. From a practical point of view, however, it is inefficient to check the form of the pushdown content in each computational step. Therefore, we prove that only two checks of the pushdown content are of interest for these machines to be computationally complete. Based on this observation, we introduce and discuss a new model of regulated pushdown automata.	academy;automata theory;bottom-up parsing;computation;deterministic context-free language;deterministic pushdown automaton;linear grammar;personal digital assistant;recursion;stack (abstract data type);time complexity;top-down and bottom-up design;turing machine;unbounded nondeterminism	Tomás Masopust	2010	Fundam.

We briefly describe some non-trivial connections to (seemingly) different topics in learning theory, complexity theory, and cryptography. A connection to the so-called Hidden Number Problem, which plays an important role for proving bit-security of cryptographic functions, will be discussed in somewhat more detail.

The approach is illustrated by the derivation of a grammar for a certain set of bit strings. The approach is used to give an elegant derivation of the grammar for a language accepted by a pushdown automaton.	context-free grammar;correctness (computer science);fits;formal language;parse tree;pushdown automaton;stack (abstract data type)	Wim H.

If we play an audible sound, both humans and microphones will be able to hear it. We design sound that appears just as any other sound to microphones, but remains inaudible to humans. This sound can be regulated to carry data bits, thereby enabling an acoustic (but inaudible) communication channel to hundreds of smart devices that already have built-in microphones. Other applications include jamming spy microphones in the environment, live watermarking of music in a concert, and even threats like acoustic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on phone calls or inaudible command attacks on voice-enabled devices.	acoustic cryptanalysis;backdoor (computing);built-in self-test;channel (communications);denial-of-service attack;humans;microphone;radio jamming;smart device	Nirupam Roy;Haitham Hassanieh;Romit Roy Choudhury	2017	GetMobile	10.1145/3191789.3191799	phone;acoustics;digital watermarking;backdoor;microphone;communication channel;computer science	Mobile	-2.2675281344951155	30.720750737315758	137805

Examples of data with such dual linear-hierarchical structure include executions of structured programs, annotated linguistic data, and HTML/XML documents. Nested words generalize both words and ordered trees, and allow both word and tree operations. We define nested word automata—finite-state acceptors for nested words, and show that the resulting class of regular languages of nested words has all the appealing theoretical properties that the classical regular word languages enjoys: deterministic nested word automata are as expressive as their nondeterministic counterparts; the class is closed under union, intersection, complementation, concatenation, Kleene-*, prefixes, and language homomorphisms; membership, emptiness, language inclusion, and language equivalence are all decidable; and definability in monadic second order logic corresponds exactly to finite-state recognizability. We also consider regular languages of infinite nested words and show that the closure properties, MSO-characterization, and decidability of decision problems carry over.  The linear encodings of nested words give the class of visibly pushdown languages of words, and this class lies between balanced languages and deterministic context-free languages. We argue that for algorithmic verification of structured programs, instead of viewing the program as a context-free language over words, one should view it as a regular language of nested words (or equivalently, a visibly pushdown language), and this would allow model checking of many properties (such as stack inspection, pre-post conditions) that are not expressible in existing specification logics.  We also study the relationship between ordered trees and nested words, and the corresponding automata: while the analysis complexity of nested word automata is the same as that of classical tree automata, they combine both bottom-up and top-down traversals, and enjoy expressiveness and succinctness benefits over tree automata.	automata theory;bottom-up parsing;compiler;concatenation;database;decision problem;deterministic context-free language;html;model checking;nested word;ordered pair;program analysis;pushdown automaton;query language;regular language;stack (abstract data type);streaming algorithm;streaming media;top-down and bottom-up design;tree (data structure);tree automaton;tree traversal;turing completeness;xml	Rajeev Alur;P.

fa15a3c6bfdef134da8d13c29cd6523f199f1cff	lightweight display-to-device communication using electromagnetic radiation and fm radio		This paper presents Shadow, a novel display-to-device communication system working in radio frequency. It leverages the Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) emanated from display to transmit information. We modulate the signal transmitted to display to make the corresponding EMR signal fall into the FM band. In this way. when users' devices with FM ability are approaching to the display, it can automatically receive information from the display. Since Shadow does not rely on camera, wearable devices can also obtain information from display. In addition to the lightweight communication ability, Shadow keeps the communication truly invisible by only transmitting in the period that will not be shown on the display panel. Our system requires no modification on hardware, and we implement it with commodity display system and mobile devices. Results show it can achieve 1.5 kbps at distances of up to 20cm from the display panel.	data rate units;excalibur: morgana's revenge;fm broadcasting;mobile device;radio frequency;transmitter;wearable technology	Zhice Yang;Jiansong Zhang;Zeyu Wang;Qian Zhang	2017		10.1145/3084041.3098921	electromagnetic radiation;mobile device;computer science;electronic engineering	HCI	-2.0502173132605033	30.653801808327685	138853

As of today, it remains the algorithm with the best asymptotic complexity for this purpose. In this paper, we present an algebraic specification, implementation, and proof of correctness of a generalisation of Valiant’s algorithm. The generalisation can be used for recognition, parsing or generic calculation of the transitive closure of upper triangular matrices. The proof is certified by the Agda proof assistant. The certification is representative of state-of-the-art methods for specification and proofs in proof assistants based on type-theory. As such, this paper can be read as a tutorial for the Agda system.	agda;algebraic specification;algorithm;computational complexity theory;context-free language;correctness (computer science);linear algebra;parsing;proof assistant;transitive closure;triangular matrix;type theory	J Bernardy;Patrik Jansson	2014	Logical Methods in Computer Science		computer science;theoretical computer science;proof;mathematics;programming language;algorithm	PL	-1.0708195670499001	19.72120863368979	139272
2068fc658fe9d0aca97ad6de8ca7de75d5683ea9	efficient classical simulation of the deutsch-jozsa and simon's algorithms		A long-standing aim of quantum information research is to understand what gives quantum computers their advantage. This requires separating problems that need genuinely quantum resources from those for which classical resources are enough. Two examples of quantum speed-up are the Deutsch–Jozsa and Simon’s problem, both efficiently solvable on a quantum Turing machine, and both believed to lack efficient classical solutions. Here we present a framework that can simulate both quantum algorithms efficiently, solving the Deutsch–Jozsa problem with probability 1 using only one oracle query, and Simon’s problem using linearly many oracle queries, just as expected of an ideal quantum computer. The presented simulation framework is in turn efficiently simulatable in a classical probabilistic Turing machine. This shows that the Deutsch–Jozsa and Simon’s problem do not require any genuinely quantum resources, and that the quantum algorithms show no speed-up when compared with their corresponding classical simulation. Finally, this gives insight into what properties are needed in the two algorithms and calls for further study of oracle separation between quantum and classical computation.	computation;computer;decision problem;deutsch–jozsa algorithm;probabilistic turing machine;quantum turing machine;quantum algorithm;quantum computing;quantum information;simulation	Niklas Johansson;Jan-Åke Larsson	2017	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-017-1679-7	quantum information;quantum information science;quantum complexity theory;theoretical computer science;quantum capacity;mathematics;quantum computer;quantum process;quantum algorithm;algorithm;quantum turing machine;quantum mechanics;quantum phase estimation algorithm;quantum sort;simon's problem	Theory	7.6865064930351545	23.818897351209493	139400

Our results show that malware installed on unmodified commodity hardware can leak data from an air-gapped system using the ultrasonic frequency range from 20 kHz to 20.5 kHz at a rate of 140 bps and at a rate of 6.7 kbps using the audible spectrum from 500 Hz to 18 kHz. Additionally, we show that data can be communicated using ultrasonic communication at distances up to 11 m with bit rates over 230 bps and a bit error rate of 2 %. Given our results, our attacks are able to leak captured keystrokes in real-time using ultrasonic signals and, using audible signals when nobody is present in the environment - the overnight attack, both keystrokes and recorded audio.	acoustic cryptanalysis;covert channel	Brent Carrara;Carlisle M.

Traditionally, an oceanographic research vessel is used to monitor marine environments, which is very expensive and time-consuming and has a low resolution both in time and space. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have recently been considered as a promising solution for this purpose since they have a number of advantages such as easy deployment, unmanned operation, real-time monitoring, and relatively low cost. This paper first describes a common architecture of WSN-based oceanographic monitoring systems and a general architecture of an oceanographic sensor node. Then, it presents a detailed review of some related projects, systems, and technologies. It also highlights major challenges and research opportunities on the development and deployment of wireless sensor networks for marine environment monitoring.	image resolution;real-time clock;sensor node;software deployment;systematic review;unmanned aerial vehicle	Guobao Xu;Weiming Shen;Xianbin Wang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2014.6973877	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;energy harvesting	Embedded	3.520396510323899	31.778056228856876	139665

3c8d9c1f059efe403d39b40bdf46b9d881db7ff1	high parallel complexity graphs and memory-hard functions	pebbling;memory hard functions;parallelism;cryptography;graph complexity	We develop new theoretical tools for proving lower-bounds on the (amortized) complexity of certain functions in models of parallel computation. We apply the tools to construct a class of functions with high amortized memory complexity in the *parallel* Random Oracle Model (pROM); a variant of the standard ROM allowing for batches of *simultaneous* queries. In particular we obtain a new, more robust, type of Memory-Hard Functions (MHF); a security primitive which has recently been gaining acceptance in practice as an effective means of countering brute-force attacks on security relevant functions. Along the way we also demonstrate an important shortcoming of previous definitions of MHFs and give a new definition addressing the problem. The tools we develop represent an adaptation of the powerful pebbling paradigm (initially introduced by Hewitt and Paterson [HP70] and Cook [Coo73]) to a simple and intuitive parallel setting. We define a simple pebbling game Gp over graphs which aims to abstract parallel computation in an intuitive way. As a conceptual contribution we define a measure of pebbling complexity for graphs called *cumulative complexity* (CC) and show how it overcomes a crucial shortcoming (in the parallel setting) exhibited by more traditional complexity measures used in the past. As a main technical contribution we give an explicit construction of a constant in-degree family of graphs whose CC in Gp approaches maximality to within a polylogarithmic factor for any graph of equal size (analogous to the graphs of Tarjan et. al. [PTC76, LT82] for sequential pebbling games). Finally, for a given graph G and related function fG, we derive a lower-bound on the amortized memory complexity of fG in the pROM in terms of the CC of G in the game Gp.	algorithmic efficiency;amortized analysis;brute-force attack;computation;directed graph;graph (discrete mathematics);parallel computing;polylogarithmic function;programming paradigm;random oracle;read-only memory	Joël Alwen;Vladimir Serbinenko	2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1145/2746539.2746622	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;cryptography;mathematics;programming language;algorithm;statistics	Theory	8.980491219027016	24.93532582847293	139684

We define a notion of cancellation in Boolean circuits and define Boolean circuits that do not use cancellation to be  non-cancellative . Non-cancellative Boolean circuits are a natural generalization of monotone Boolean circuits. We show that in the absence of cancellation, Boolean circuits require super-polynomial size to compute the determinant interpreted over   GF(2)  . This non-monotone Boolean function is known to be in   P  . In the spirit of monotone complexity classes, we define complexity classes based on non-cancellative Boolean circuits. We show that when the Boolean circuit model is restricted by withholding cancellation,   P   and popular classes within   P   are restricted as well, but   NP   and circuit definable classes above it remain unchanged.	boolean circuit;monotone	Rimli Sengupta;H.

Shu and Lin designed a polynomial-time algorithm to check strong (periodic) detectability and an exponential-time (polynomialspace) algorithm to check weak (periodic) detectability. Zhang showed that checking weak (periodic) detectability is PSpace-complete. This intractable complexity opens a question whether there are structurally simpler DESs for which the problem is tractable. In this paper, we show that it is not the case by considering DESs represented as deterministic finite automata without non-trivial cycles, which are structurally the simplest deadlock-free DESs. We show that even for such very simple DESs, checking weak (periodic) detectability remains intractable. On the contrary, we show that strong (periodic) detectability of DESs can be efficiently verified on a parallel computer.	algorithm;automata theory;cobham's thesis;deadlock;deterministic finite automaton;finite-state machine;pspace-complete;parallel computing;polynomial;time complexity	Tomás Masopust	2018	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2018.03.077	discrete mathematics;combinatorics;deterministic finite automaton;periodic graph (geometry);mathematics	Theory	-1.8880638805856056	23.758738724588152	140067

Their results show that lower bounds on the size of resolution refutations can be proved in a uniform manner by demonstrating lower bounds on the width of refutations, and that there is a simple dynamic programming procedure for automated theorem proving based on the search for small width proofs. In addition, if a practical algorithm for calculating width existed, then researchers working with SAT-solvers would be able to use it to predict whether or not to even attempt solving a given formula. Therefore there are both theoretical as well as practical motivations for better understanding resolution width. Given a set of clauses Σ and an integer k, the resolution width problem is that of determining whether Σ has a refutation of width k. This problem was conjectured to be EXPT IME-complete by Moshe Vardi; the present paper confirms Vardi’s conjecture. The proof is by a reduction from the (∃, k)-pebble game, which was shown to be EXPT IME-complete by Kolaitis and Panttaja.	algorithm;automated theorem proving;dynamic programming;exptime;input method;resolution (logic)	Alexander Hertel;Alasdair Urquhart	2006	Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC)		mathematics;discrete mathematics;conjecture;combinatorics;dpll algorithm;mathematical proof;exptime;boolean satisfiability problem;automated theorem proving;upper and lower bounds;unit propagation	AI	8.687183780578863	18.664708850795115	140351

The main innovative aspect of the proof is a simple combinatorial argument showing that the rectangle covering number of the unique-disjointness matrix is at least 1.5, and thus the nondeterministic communication complexity of the unique-disjointness predicate is at least .58n. We thereby slightly improve on the previously best known lower bounds 1.24 and .31n, respectively.	communication complexity;polyhedron	Volker Kaibel;Stefan Weltge	2015	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-014-9655-9	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;birkhoff polytope;communication complexity;mathematics;geometry	Theory	8.384296266236781	20.148301278733623	140643

An even linear grammar is a linear grammar whose productions are of the form A + UBV such that 1 u I= 1 v 1 (where I x I denotes the length of a string X, and A and B are variables). An even linear language is a language generated by an even linear grammar. The class of even linear languages properly contains the class of regular sets and is properly contained in the class of linear languages. Recently, Radhakrishnan and Nagaraja [5] have presented a grammatical inference algorithm for even linear grammars and its application to picture description languages. They have solved the problem in rather specific settings and have not shown the correctness and time complexity of their algorithm. In t!ie paper we show that the grammatical inference problem for ever linear languages is reduced to the problem for regular sets. We first show that there exists a fixed even linear grammar over an alphabet which generates any even linear language over the alphabet with a regular control set. Next, it is s&own that for any linear language there exists a unique regular control set. From these, the problehn of identifying an unknown even linear language is reduced to the problem of identifying an unknown regular control set for the fixed even linear grammar. We give an algorithm which reduces the inference problem for even linear languages to thbic ;rir -+ f-r regular sets. With it, any algorithm for regular sets is available for inferring even linear languages. Further, the corret~~~s immediately obtained. Finally, as an application of our results, the inference problem for finite automata with output is and time complexity of the algorithm are	algorithm;automata theory;correctness (computer science);finite-state machine;grammar induction;linear grammar;regular expression;time complexity	Yuji Takada	1988	Inf.

976d78aff6b343bd6574cf5b2bf77f1b5914e304	on the query complexity of black-peg ab-mastermind		Mastermind is a two players zero sum game of imperfect information. Starting with Erdős and Rényi (1963), its combinatorics have been studied to date by several authors, e.g., Knuth (1977), Chvátal (1983), Goodrich (2009). The first player, called “codemaker”, chooses a secret code and the second player, called “codebreaker”, tries to break the secret code by making as few guesses as possible, exploiting information that is given by the codemaker after each guess. For variants that allow color repetition, Doerr et al. (2016) showed optimal results. In this paper, we consider the so called Black-Peg variant of Mastermind, where the only information concerning a guess is the number of positions in which the guess coincides with the secret code. More precisely, we deal with a special version of the Black-Peg game with n holes and k ≥ n colors where no repetition of colors is allowed. We present upper and lower bounds on the number of guesses necessary to break the secret code. For the case k = n, the secret code can be algorithmically identified within less than (n− 3)dlog2 ne+ 5 2 n− 1 queries. This result improves the result of Ker-I Ko and Shia-Chung Teng (1985) by almost a factor of 2. For the case k > n, we prove an upper bound of (n− 2)dlog2 ne+ k + 1. Furthermore, we prove a new lower bound of n for the case k = n, which improves the recent n− log log(n) bound of Berger et al. (2016). We then generalize this lower bound to k queries for the case k ≥ n.	algorithm;color;cryptanalysis;cryptography;decision tree model;erdős number;mastermind;the codebreakers – the story of secret writing	Mourad El Ouali;Christian Glazik;Volkmar Sauerland;Anand Srivastav	2018	Games	10.3390/g9010002	combinatorics;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Crypto	9.890816530218485	24.76853729413986	141589

To accomplish this we used XBee Pro S2B transceivers utilising the ZigBee standard. Combined with high gain omnidirectional antennae we were able to establish reliable multi-hop links with inter-node distances spanning up to 10 km during testing in Antarctica in January 2013.

1578fe11612079008f0600980573d4c3dad76be6	differences of halting probabilities		The halting probabilities of universal prefix-free machines are universal for the class of reals with computably enumerable left cut (also known as left-c.e. reals), and coincide with the Martin-Löf random elements of this class. We study the differences of Martin-Löf random left-c.e. reals and show that for each pair of such reals α, β there exists a unique number r > 0 such that qα − β is a Martin-Löf random left-c.e. real for each positive rational q > r and a Martin-Löf random right-c.e. real for each positive rational q < r. Based on this result we develop a theory of differences of halting probabilities, which answers a number of questions about Martin-Löf random left-c.e. reals, including one of the few remaining open problems from the list of open questions in algorithmic randomness [MN06]. The halting probability of a prefix-free machine M restricted to a set X is the probability that the machine halts and outputs an element of X. These numbers Ω M (X) were studied in [BG05, BFGM06, BG07, BG09] as a way to obtain concrete highly random numbers. When X is a Π 0 1 set, the number Ω M (X) is the difference of two halting probabilities. Becher, Figueira, Grigorieff, and Miller asked whether Ω U (X) is Martin-Löf random when U is universal and X is a Π 0 1 set. This problem has resisted numerous attempts [BG05, BFGM06, FSW06]. We apply our theory of differences of halting probabilities to give a positive answer, and show that Ω U (X) is a Martin-Löf random left-c.e. real whenever X is a nonempty Π 0 1 set.	algorithmically random sequence;chaitin's constant;emoticon;open-source hardware;random graph;randomness;recursively enumerable set;theory	George Barmpalias;Andy Lewis-Pye	2017	J.

Each automaton has its own read head that moves independently of the other heads, but the automata cooperate in making state transitions. Computational power of such devices depends on the number of states of automata, the number of automata, and the way they cooperate. We concentrate our attention on the last issue. The first situation that we consider is that each automaton has a full knowledge on the states of all automata (multihead automata). The other extreme is that each automaton (called also a processor) has no knowledge of the states of other automata; merely, there is a central processing unit that may “freeze” any automaton or let it proceed its work (so called multiprocessor automata). The second model seems to be severely restricted, but we show that multihead and multiprocessor automata have similar computational power. Nevertheless, we show a separation result.	automaton;central processing unit;computation;finite-state machine;multiprocessing	Pavol Duris;Tomasz Jurdzinski;Miroslaw Kutylowski;Krzysztof Lorys	1998		10.1007/BFb0055111	nondeterministic finite automaton with ε-moves;nested stack automaton;discrete mathematics;büchi automaton;nondeterministic finite automaton;continuous spatial automaton;quantum finite automata;computer science;nested word;theoretical computer science;asynchronous cellular automaton;two-way deterministic finite automaton;deterministic finite automaton;continuous automaton;deterministic automaton;automata theory;ω-automaton;finite-state machine;dfa minimization;mobile automaton;timed automaton;algorithm	Logic	-0.8349159302578396	25.332418734226486	142766

a2eab5d01d03b00326fc9b61119f35e0c306d4fc	poster: is active electromagnetic side-channel attack practical?		Radio-frequency (RF) retroreflector attack (RFRA) is an {\em active} electromagnetic side-channel attack that aims to leak the target's internal signals by irradiating the targeted device with a radio wave, where an attacker has embedded a malicious circuit (RF retroreflector) in the device in advance. As the retroreflector consists of small and cheap electrical elements such as a field-effect transistor (FET) chip and a wire that can work as a dipole antenna, the reflector can be embedded into various kinds of electric devices that carry unencrypted, sensitive information; e.g., keyboard, display monitor, microphone, speaker, USB, and so on. Only a few studies have addressed the basic mechanism of RFRA and demonstrated the success of the attack. The conditions for a successful attack have not been adequately explored before, and therefore, assessing the feasibility of the attack remains an open issue. In the present study, we aim to investigate empirically the conditions for a successful RFRA through field experiments. Understanding attack limitations should help to develop effective countermeasures against it. In particular, with regard to the conditions for a successful attack, we studied the distance between the attacker and the target, and the target signal frequencies. Through the extensive experiments using off-the-shelf hardware including software-defined radio (SDR) equipment, we revealed that the required conditions for a successful attack are (1) up to a 10-Mbps of target signal and (2) up to a distance of 10 meters. These results demonstrate the importance of the RFRA threat in the real world.	computer keyboard;computer monitor;dipole antenna;etsi satellite digital radio;embedded system;experiment;information sensitivity;microphone;plaintext;radio frequency;radio wave;side-channel attack;transistor;usb	Satohiro Wakabayashi;Seita Maruyama;Tatsuya Mori;Shigeki Goto;Masahiro Kinugawa;Yu-ichi Hayashi	2017		10.1145/3133956.3138830	computer security;chip;retroreflector;side channel attack;microphone;radio wave;computer science;usb;dipole antenna;countermeasure	Security	-2.3280626165938982	30.74938989200594	142950

Two algorithms for translating REs into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) are widely known, that is, Thompson construction and Glushkov construction. A trivial way for translating SEREs into NFAs is to use Thompson construction because it can easily be applied to SEREs. It seems to be difficult to directly apply Glushkov construction to SEREs. In this paper, we present a new translation from SEREs into NFAs using Glushkov construction and the modular decomposition technique by Yamamoto. Then, given an SERE r with m r  intersection operators, we can generate an NFA with at most N r  + 1 states and N 2 r transitions in O((m r  +1)N 2 r) time and space. Here N r  is a number obtained from the decomposition of r, and is less than the number of states of an NFA obtained by the trivial translation (that is, the translation using Thompson construction). In addition, we will show an application to an approximate SERE matching problem.	regular expression;semiconductor industry	Hiroaki Yamamoto	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-24587-2_18	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;nondeterministic finite automaton;numero sign;image processing;computer science;space time;intersection;speech processing;mathematics;transition state;modular decomposition;programming language;grammatical number;regular expression;algorithm	DB	0.6775481149058749	19.340784404707986	143057

In quantum refereed games, the provers and verifier may perform quantum computations and exchange quantum messages. One may consider games with a bounded or unbounded number of rounds of messages between the verifier and provers. In this paper, we prove classical upper bounds on the power of both one-round and many-round quantum refereed games. In particular, we use semidefinite programming to show that many-round quantum refereed games are contained in NEXP. It then follows from the symmetric nature of these games that they are also contained in coNEXP. We also show that one-round quantum refereed games are contained in EXP by supplying a separation oracle for use with the ellipsoid method for convex feasibility.	complexity class;computation;exptime;ellipsoid method;interactive proof system;nexptime;polynomial;qip (complexity);quantum refereed game;recursion;residential gateway;semidefinite programming;time complexity	Gus Gutoski	2005	20th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'05)	10.1109/CCC.2005.37	game theory;discrete mathematics;quantum information;quantum complexity theory;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;quantum computer;quantum algorithm;algorithm;quantum mechanics	Theory	8.291006319755281	23.685940681371893	143069
0b94403a9d31154765d4911cf4417e046ae98c1b	controller area network node reliability assessment based on observable node information		Controller area network (CAN) based fieldbus technologies have been widely used in networked manufacturing systems. As the information channel of the system, the reliability of the network is crucial to the system throughput, product quality, and work crew safety. However, due to the inaccessibility of the nodes’ internal states, direct assessment of the reliability of CAN nodes using the nodes’ internal error counters is infeasible. In this paper, a novel CAN node reliability assessment method, which uses node’s time to bus-off as the reliability measure, is proposed. The method estimates the transmit error counter (TEC) of any node in the network based on the network error log and the information provided by the observable nodes whose error counters are accessible. First, a node TEC estimation model is established based on segmented Markov chains. It considers the sparseness of the distribution of the CAN network errors. Second, by learning the differences between the model estimates and the actual values from the observable node, a Bayesian network is developed for the estimation updating mechanism of the observable nodes. Then, this estimation updating mechanism is transferred to general CAN nodes with no TEC value accessibility to update the TEC estimation. Finally, a node reliability assessment method is developed to predict the time to reach bus-off state of the nodes. Case studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Experimental results show that the estimates using the proposed model agree well with actual observations.	accessibility;bayesian network;can bus;data logger;error message;fieldbus;markov chain;neural coding;observable;throughput	Leiming Zhang;Longhao Tang;Yong Lei	2017	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1601029	ring network;real-time computing;node;computer network	EDA	-3.3657093958049358	29.0010477814287	143075

Horn clause program is a subclass of the formulas of first order logic and has close relation to PROLOG language. The computational power of Horn clauses was discussed in (T ̈ arnland, 1977) and it was shown that a finite set of Horn clauses is computationally equivalent to Turing Machine. Furthermore, it should be noted that Horn programs are adequate for representing nondeterministic computation. Thus, its parallel implementation with huge number of molecules might have possibility to overcome the computational power of conventional computers. It should also be noted that the clear logical semantics of Horn programs might enable us to accept it as a higher-level programming language of DNA computer. The aim of this paper is to propose an experimental method for implementing deduction with a subclass of Horn programs, called simpleHorn programs. The computational power of this model is theoretically investigated and demonstrated with some applications to NP-complete problems.	computation;computer;dna computing;experiment;first-order logic;high-level programming language;horn clause;karp's 21 np-complete problems;natural deduction;non-deterministic turing machine;prolog	Satoshi Kobayashi	1999	J.

It involves S(m), the satisfaction set of the conjunction of m clauses, each clause a disjunction of k literals. The problem has many theoretical, algorithmic and practical aspects. When the clauses are chosen at random it is anticipated (but not fully proven) that, as the density parameter m/n (n the number of variables) grows, the transition of S(m) to being empty, is abrupt: It has a “sharp threshold”, with probability 1 − o(1). In this article we replace the random ensemble analysis by a pseudo-random one: Derive the decay rule for individual sequences of clauses, subject to combinatorial conditions, which in turn hold with probability 1 − o(1). This is carried out under the big relaxation that k is not constant but k = γ log n, or even r log log n. Then the decay of S is slow, “near-perfect” (like a radioactive decay), which entails sharp thresholds for the transition-time of S below any given level, down to S = ∅.	algorithm;boolean satisfiability problem;constraint satisfaction problem;linear programming relaxation;pseudorandomness	Eli Shamir	2006	Logic Journal of the IGPL	10.1093/jigpal/jzl011	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;constraint satisfaction;computer science;mathematics;constraint satisfaction problem;algorithm;satisfiability	Theory	9.691492471069004	20.08649582334783	143670

We show that the first two problems can be efficiently parallelized, allowing logarithmic time Parallel RAM algorithms and even constant time unbounded fan-in circuits with threshold gates. However, lower bounds imply that they cannot be solved in constant time by a PRAM algorithm. On the other hand, strong bisimilarity in finite labelled transition systems can be classified as P-complete; as a consequence, algorithms for automated analysis of finite state systems based on bisimulation seem to be inherently sequential in the following sense: the design of an efficient parallel algorithm to solve any of these problems will require an exceedingly hard algorithmic breakthrough.

Internet eXchange Points have been targets since they represent a microcosm of Internet diversity. The contribution of this paper is the first empirical analysis of the IXP ecosystem in Brazil, compiling information that comprehend the characterization of members participating of these environments, including the build of AS-level connectivity graphs. By analysing the topologies we found the average adjacency of IXP's members (vertices degree), the isolated and accumulated depth of paths in advertised routes (AS-PATH), the density of peers to highlight the peering potential within IXPs, the accounting of traffic engineering policies related to AS-Prepend and k-clique communities. Another contribution is that our dataset with more than 2.5 GB is shared with the academic community.	clique (graph theory);compiler;ecosystem;gigabyte;internet;peering	Samuel Henrique Bucke Brito;Mateus A.

In this paper, we implement Bead–Sort, a natural sorting algorithm we introduced in [1], with the new, biochemically inspired P systems. In Bead–Sort, positive integers are represented by a set of beads (like those used in an Abacus). The beads representing integers to be sorted are allowed to slide through the rods of the Abacus. In this process, the smaller “numbers” always emerge above the larger ones and this creates a natural comparison and thus a natural sorting action. This natural sorting phenomenon is “implemented” with a special type of P system — a tissue P system that computes by means of communication (using symport/antiport rules) only. Beads are represented by objects placed within membranes of a tissue P system; a rod is represented by a ‘group’ of membranes that can communicate with one another by means of symport/antiport rules. The “flow” of objects between the group of membranes representing a rod (using communication rules) reflects the actual flow of beads in the physical system.	bead sort;british informatics olympiad;emergentism;insertion sort;p system;point of view (computer hardware company);production (computer science);sorting algorithm	Joshua J.

NP-complete decision problems are pervasive in all areas of computing, with literally thousands of well-known examples. Nevertheless, SAT solvers routinely challenge the problem’s intractability by solving propositional formulas with millions of variables, many representing the translation from some other NP-complete or NP-hard problem. The practical effectiveness of SAT solvers has motivated their use as oracles for NP, enabling new algorithms that solve an ever-increasing range of hard computational problems. This paper provides a brief overview of this ongoing effort, summarizing some of the recent past and present main successes, and highlighting directions for future research.

Such a system has several components and each component has some insertion–deletion rules. The transition is performed by any applicable rule in the current component on a string and the resultant string is then moved to the target component specified in the rule. The language of the system is the set of all terminal strings collected in the final component. The parameters in the size (k;n,i′,i″;m,j′,j″)(k;n,i′,i″;m,j′,j″) of a GCID system denote (from left to right) the maximum number of components, the maximal length of the insertion string, the maximal length of the left context for insertion, the maximal length of the right context for insertion; the last three parameters follow a similar representation with respect to deletion.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we discuss the computational completeness of the families of GCID systems of size (k;1,i′,i″;1,j′,j″)(k;1,i′,i″;1,j′,j″) with k∈{3,5}k∈{3,5} and for (nearly) all values of i′,i″j′,j″∈{0,1}i′,i″j′,j″∈{0,1}. All proofs are based on the simulation of type-0 grammars given in Special Geffert Normal Form (SGNF). The novelty in our proof presentation is that the context-free and the non-context-free rules of the given SGNF grammar are simulated by GCID systems of different sizes and finally we combine them by stitching and overlaying to characterize the recursive enumerable languages. This proof presentation greatly simplifies and unifies the proof of such characterization results. We also connect some of the obtained GCID simulations to the domain of insertion–deletion P systems.		Henning Fernau;Lakshmanan Kuppusamy;Indhumathi Raman	2017	Theor. Comput.

a4370f4e79465fb621cab614acc7dfc1ac9bdae9	an integrated chassis manager card platform featuring multiple sensor modules		The gradually growing demand for experimentation of protocols designed for wireless networks in real environments has resulted in the development of experimental network facilities (testbeds). Most currently deployed testbeds have been designed so as to offer services to experimenters that lie within the testbed’s premises, thus limiting the accessibility to external users. The requirement for multi-user access of network resources has led several large-scale testbeds to provide remote access services to certified experimenters. However, management and maintenance of large-scale remotely accessible testbeds is a rather challenging task that requires proper hardware, as well as software custombuilt tools. In order to provide for remote switching of testbed nodes, NITOS has developed a new chassis manager (CM) card and also a custom framework that allows for monitoring and controlling of the nodes’ operational mode. In addition, NITOS CM card provides for gathering of various types of sensor measurements, through the attached temperature, humidity and light intensity sensor modules. Another innovative characteristic of the proposed card is that it provides the experimenters with the ability to monitor the energy consumption of each testbed node, which is rather important for experimentation with power optimization schemes. In this demo, we will present the various functionalities of the NITOS CM card and the developed control framework that accompanies it.

We first present the key aspects in modeling forest fires. We do this by analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, and show how its different components can be used in designing efficient fire detection systems. The FWI System is one of the most comprehensive forest fire danger rating systems in North America, and it is backed by several decades of forestry research. The analysis of the FWI System could be of interest in its own right to researchers working in the sensor network area and to sensor manufacturers who can optimize the communication and sensing modules of their products to better fit forest fire detection systems. Then, we model the forest fire detection problem as a k-coverage problem in wireless sensor networks. In addition, we present a simple data aggregation scheme based on the FWI System. This data aggregation scheme significantly prolongs the network lifetime, because it only delivers the data that is of interest to the application. We validate several aspects of our design using simulation.	algorithm;data aggregation;real life;simulation;software deployment;the forest	Mohamed Hefeeda;Majid Bagheri	2007	2007 IEEE Internatonal Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428702	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	3.4077264781180863	31.076862769918296	147494

It is shown that a set L of strings is in this class if and only if there is a formula of the form ∃f1· · ∃fk∃R1· · ∃Rm∀xφ that is true exactly for all strings in L. In this formula the fi are unary function symbols, the Ri are unary relation symbols and φ is a quantifierfree formula. Furthermore, the quantification of functions is restricted to non-crossing, decreasing functions and in φ no equations in which different functions occur are allowed.

(Phys Rev A 75:022313, 2007) to be applicable to qubits. While this scheme requires more gates than standard schemes for creating large controlled gates, we show that with simple adaptations, it is directly equivalent to the standard scheme in the literature. This scheme is the most gateefficient way of creating large controlled unitaries currently known; however, it is expensive in terms of the number of ancilla qubits used. We go on to show that using a combination of these standard techniques presented by Barenco et al. (Phys Rev A 52(5):3457, 1995), we can create an n-qubit version of the Toffoli using less gates and the same number of ancilla qubits as recent work using computer optimization. This would be useful in any architecture of quantum computing where gates are cheap but qubit initialization is expensive.	ancilla bit;gate count;mathematical optimization;program optimization;quantum computing;qubit;rev	Katherine L.

Suppose that a Boolean function f can be computed by a threshold circuit C of energy complexity e and hence at most e threshold gates in C output “1” for any input to C. We then prove that the function f can be computed also by a threshold circuit C′ of depth 2e+1 and hence the parallel computation time of C′ is 2e+1. If the size of C is s, that is, there are s threshold gates in C, then the size s′ of C′ is s′ = 2es + 1. Thus, if the size s of C is polynomial in the number n of input variables, then the size s′ of C′ is polynomial in n, too.	computation;parallel computing;polynomial;time complexity	Kei Uchizawa;Takao Nishizeki;Eiji Takimoto	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03409-1_30	circuit complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;boolean function;algorithm;parity function;tc0	Theory	8.733705300983576	22.94347577395078	149157
110d7c81f346dd16a7f55472c3baa7c605d6d843	on the complexity of minimizing probabilistic and quantum automata	minimization;probabilistic automata;journal;quantum automata;decidability	Several types of automata, such as probabilistic and quantum automata, require to work with real and complex numbers. For such automata the acceptance of an input is quantified with a probability. There are plenty of results in the literature addressing the complexity of checking the equivalence of these automata, that is, checking whether two automata accept all inputs with the same probability. On the other hand, the critical problem of finding the minimal automata equivalent to a given one has been left open (C. Moore, J.P. Crutchfield, Theoretical Computer Science 237 (2000) 275-306, p. 304, Problem 5). In this work, we reduce the minimization problem of probabilistic and quantum automata to finding a solution of a system of algebraic polynomial (in)equations. An EXPSPACE upper bound on the complexity of the minimization problem is derived by applying Renegar’s algorithm. More specifically, we show that the state minimization of probabilistic automata, measure-once quantum automata, measure-many quantum automata, measure-once generalized quantum automata, and measure-many generalized quantum automata is decidable and in EXPSPACE. Finally, we also solve an open problem concerning minimal covering of stochastic sequential machines (A. Paz, Introduction to Probabilistic Automata, Academic Press, 1971, Page 43).	algebraic equation;algorithm;automata theory;expspace;finite-state machine;polynomial;probabilistic turing machine;probabilistic automaton;quantum finite automata;stochastic process;theoretical computer science;time complexity;turing completeness	Paulo Mateus;Daowen Qiu;Lvzhou Li	2012	Inf.

Boolean circuits embody the notion of massively parallel signal processing and are frequently encountered in many parallel algorithms. Many important problems such as sorting, integer arithmetic, and matrix multiplication are known to be computable by small size Boolean circuits much faster than by ordinary sequential digital computers. This paper shows that DNA chemistry allows one to simulate large semi-unbounded fan-in Boolean circuits with a logarithmic slowdown in computation time. Also, for the class NC 1 , the slowdown can be reduced to a constant. In this algorithm we have encoded the inputs, the Boolean AND gates, and the OR gates to DNA oligonucleotide sequences. We operate on the gates and the inputs by standard molecular techniques of sequence-specific annealing, ligation, separation by size, amplification, sequence-specific cleavage, and detection by size. Additional steps of amplification are not necessary for NC 1 circuits. The feasibility of the DNA algorithm has been successfully tested on a small circuit by actual biochemical experiments.	boolean circuit;computable function;computation;computer;dna computing;experiment;fan-in;matrix multiplication;overhead (computing);parallel algorithm;semiconductor industry;signal processing;simulated annealing;simulation;sorting;time complexity	Mitsunori Ogihara;Animesh Ray	1999	Algorithmica	10.1007/PL00008276	boolean circuit;parallel computing;matrix multiplication;computer science;theoretical computer science;signal processing;parallel algorithm;combinational logic;dna;dna computing;algorithm	Comp.	4.021492855967593	25.612030857165305	149628

For modeling this standard situation, we introduce a Classically-controlled Quantum Turing Machine (CQTM) which is a Turing machine with a quantum tape for acting on quantum data, and a classical transition function for a formalized classical control. In CQTM, unitary transformations and quantum measurements are allowed. We show that any classical Turing machine is simulated by a CQTM without loss of efficiency. Furthermore, we show that any k-tape CQTM is simulated by a 2-tape CQTM with a quadratic loss of efficiency. The gap between classical and quantum computations which was already pointed out in the framework of measurement-based quantum computation (see []) is confirmed in the general case of classically-controlled quantum computation. In order to appreciate the similarity between programming classical Turing machines and programming CQTM, some examples of CQTM are given.	computation;interaction;quantum turing machine;quantum computing;random access;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Simon Perdrix;Philippe Jorrand	2006	Mathematical Structures in Computer Science	10.1017/S096012950600538X	quantum operation;quantum complexity theory;computer science;theoretical computer science;quantum capacity;universal turing machine;mathematics;probabilistic turing machine;quantum computer;quantum process;quantum algorithm;algorithm;quantum turing machine;quantum sort;super-recursive algorithm	Theory	5.764830688287167	26.86811624038686	150048

Moreover, any depth-d quasipolynomial size non-monotone circuit computing the Sipser function has a depth(d 1) gate computing a function with exponentially many both prime implicants and (monotone) prime clauses.

c461d185db2638e0921faca73f7487ad43068595	solving parity games through fictitious play	thesis or dissertation	The thesis aims to find an efficient algorithm for solving parity games. Parity games are graph-based, 0-sum, 2-person games with infinite plays. It is known that these games are determined: all nodes in these games are won by exactly one player. Solving parity games is equivalent to the model checking problem of modal mu-calculus; an efficient solution has important implications to program verification and controller synthesis. Although the decision problem of which player wins a given node is generally believed to be in PTIME, all known algorithms so far have been shown to run in (sub)exponential time. The design of existing algorithms either derives from the determinacy proof of parity games or from a purely graph theoretical perspective, using certain rank functions to iteratively search for an optimal solution. Since parity games are 2-person, 0-sum games, in this thesis I borrow ideas of game theory and investigate the viability of using fictitious play to solve them. Fictitious play is a method where two players choose strategies in strict alternation, and where these choices are “best responses” against the last k (so called bounded recall length) or against all strategies (unbounded recall length) of the other player chosen so far. I use this method to design an algorithm that can solve partity games and study its theoretical and experimental properties. For example, I prove that the basic algorithm solves fully connected games in polynomial time through a number of iterations that is bounded by a small constant. Although the proof is not extended to the general cases in the thesis, the basic algorithm performs demonstrably well against existing solvers in experiments over a large number and variety of games. In particular, the empirically obtained number of iterations that our basic algorithm requires appears to increase polynomially against the game sizes for all the games tested. Furthermore, the algorithm is conjectured to have a run time complexity bounded by O(n4 log(n)) and I provide a discussion of strategy graphs and their emperically observed	algorithm;decision problem;experiment;formal verification;game theory;iteration;matroid rank;microsoft lumia;modal logic;modal μ-calculus;model checking;p (complexity);polynomial;run time (program lifecycle phase);time complexity	Huaxin Wang	2013			calculus;mathematics;mathematical economics	Logic	9.328146538386381	18.59091381148057	150866

We have integrated a GPRS modem with our sensing unit for remote data collection to a server. A cell of 5.5 mm path length is used to contain soil solutions. The resolution of 0.1-20 mg/100g has been used as standard solution. The test samples are taken from different farmlands and the results are compared with those obtained by a color chart judgement after laboratory analysis.

In our research, we found that although a great number of packet classification algorithms have been proposed in recent years, unfortunately most of them stagnate in mathematical analysis or software simulation stages and few of them have been implemented in commercial products as a generic solution. To fill the gap between theory and practice, in this paper, we propose a novel packet classification algorithm named HyperSplit. Compared to the well-known HiCuts and HSM algorithms, HyperSplit achieves superior performance in terms of classification speed, memory usage and preprocessing time. The practicability of the proposed algorithm is manifested by two facts in our test: HyperSplit is the only algorithm that can successfully handle all the rule sets; HyperSplit is also the only algorithm that reaches more than 6Gbps throughput on the Octeon3860 multi-core platform when tested with 64-byte Ethernet packets against 10K ACL rules.

7b1bd041937638a6f268e6cc52bbe1067d72acd9	construction, évaluation et amélioration systématiques de structures de données		— A very simple formalism, viz. abstract data types, using équations and preconditions, is proposedfor describing the proper tie s oj the object s and the opérations ofa data structure. Two cases studies are detailed: sets, and dictionaries (viz. binary search trees). A small number of rules and heuristics are then developed in order to systematically construct the classical algorithms of search and insertion in a dictionary. The more original contribution of the paper is to extend this construction by additional phases: the complexity ofthe algorithms is evalued and then their efficiency is improved. We are thus led to transform the trivial insertion algorithm so that the height ofthe trees is kept constant as much as possible. Some opérations for rebalancing trees (viz. simple and double rotations) and a property of quasi-balanced (AVL) trees are thereby reinvented almost automatically. Oj course, a number of « eurekas » remain necessary; each of them is carefully pinpointed during construction. The algorithm obtainedfinally is not new; butit is sujficiently intricated so as tojustify the validity of this type of research, which is at the cross-roads of two concerns: the abstract spécifications of data structures, and the complexity analysis of algorithms.

So, in conjunction with communication complexity, instead of the degree, the L 1 norm can be an important measure of hardness. We conjecture that the randomized communication complexity of any Boolean function is bounded by the polylogarithm of its L 1 norm. We can prove only a weaker statement: we present a two-party, randomized, common-coin communication protocol for computing functions with O(L 2 1) bits of communication, with error-probability of exp(?cc), (even with large degree or exponential number of terms). Then we present several applications of this theorem for circuit lower bounds (both for bounded-and unbounded depth), and a decision-tree lower bound.	circuit complexity;communication complexity;communications protocol;decision tree;degree of a polynomial;randomized algorithm;taxicab geometry;time complexity	Vince Grolmusz	1995	Theor.

By dividing the two-dimensional space into tiles, a system can allow users to specify regions of interest using a query rectangle and then retrieving information related to tiles covered by the query. Suppose that there are m I/O devices. A tile is labeled by i if the data corresponding to this area is stored in the ith I/O device. A labeling is efficient if the difference of the numbers of occurrences of distinct labels in any given rectangle is small. Except for some simple cases this discrepancy exceeds 1. In the present paper constructions are given to make this discrepancy small relative to m. The constructions use latin squares and a lower bound is given, which shows that the constructions are best possible under certain conditions.	discrepancy function;low-discrepancy sequence	Richard P.

24771e299e4e27d4f12eb5daa923c17f18200ae5	note on analogue memory automata		Abstract   A hybrid automaton that has an analogue memory, that is, an analogue memory automaton (AMA), is proposed. Further, a multiplicative AMA (MAMA) that has only analogue multiplication function is presented. As a special case of MAMA, a counter machine and counter language are considered. Furthermore, a MAMA event is defined as a final value of the analogue memory of MAMA, and it is shown that the MAMA event is a subclass of the probabilistic event.	automata theory;automaton	Shinichi Tamura;Kokichi Tanaka	1974	Inf.

We give a topological characterization of the transductions τ from a monoid M into a monoid N , such that if R is a recognizable subset of N , τ(R) is a recognizable subset of M . We impose two conditions on the monoids, which are fullfilled in all cases of practical interest: the monoids must be residually finite and, for every positive integer n, must have only finitely many congruences of index n. Our solution proceeds in two steps. First we show that such a monoid, equipped with the so-called Hall distance, is a metric space whose completion is compact. Next we prove that τ can be lifted to a map b τ from M into the set of compact subsets of the completion of N . This latter set, equipped with the Hausdorff metric, is again a compact monoid. Finally, our main result states that τ preserves recognizable sets if and only if b τ is continuous.	automata theory;fixed point (mathematics);hausdorff dimension;recognizable set	Jean-Éric Pin;Pedro V.

Counting classes, probabilistic classes, and intersection classes often lack such enumerations. Concentrating on the counting class UP, we show that there are relativizations for which UPA has no complete languages and other relativizations for which PB≠UPB≠NPB and UPB has complete languages. Among other results we show that #R##N#1.#TAB##R##N#(1) UP has complete languages if and only if there exists a set R in P of Boolean formulas, each having at most one satisfying assignment so that SAT∩R is complete for UP.#R##N##R##N#2.#TAB##R##N#(2) P ≠ UP if and only if there exists a set S in P of Boolean formulas, each having at most one satisfying assignment, such that S ∩ SAT is not in P.#R##N##R##N#3.#TAB##R##N#(3) P ≠ UP ∩ coUP if and only if there exists a set S in P of uniquely satisfiable Boolean formulas such that no polynomial-time machine can compute the solutions for the formulas in S.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#We suggest the wide applicability of our techniques to counting and probabilistic classes by using them to examine the probabilistic class BPP. There is a relativized word where BPPA has no complete languages. If BPP has complete languages, then it has a complete language of the form B ∩ Majority, where B ϵ P and Majority = {f¦f is true for at least half of all assignments} is the canonical PP-complete set.	complexity class	Juris Hartmanis;Lane A.

It should be conceptually clear to let him or her concentrate at the algorithmic ideas for solving the problem. At the same time it should be concrete enough to give a realistic estimate on the use resources, when the algorithm is executed on a real computer. In this paper we analyze some weaknesses of existing models of computation, namely sequential access machine and random access machine, and propose a new cost model, called relative cost random access machine, which solves some contradictions between these models. The new model actually only generalizes the way of counting the complexity, and includes sequential access machines and random access machines as special cases. At the same time, it is flexible enough to characterize the cost of memory access in current computers.	random access	Martti Penttonen	1999	Fundam.

With the evolution of technology, we can improve the management of water quality by the IoT(Internet of Things) system. Therefore, this paper provides a real-time water quality monitoring system by the Internet of Things system. We selected Dong Lake in National Dong Hwa University as a test field to monitor water temperature, turbidity, conductivity, and pH. After that, the various water quality data will be transmitted to the database via wireless transmission. Finally, these data will be displayed on the web page immediately. And, it is very important to select what kind of wireless communication technique. For the long-range application in the field, we used Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN)-Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) for data transmission. To extend the system life, a solar panel is adapted to recharge battery.	global variable;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;real-time clock;rechargeable battery;web page	Yan-Ting Liu;Bo-Yi Lin;Xiao-Feng Yue;Zhongfei Cai;Zi-Xian Yang;Wei Liu;Song-Yi Huang;Jun-Lin Lu;Jing-Wen Peng;Jen-Yeu Chen	2018	2018 27th Wireless and Optical Communication Conference (WOCC)	10.1109/WOCC.2018.8373792	lpwan;computer network;computer science;turbidity;data transmission;global environmental analysis;groundwater recharge;water quality;wide area network;water resources	Robotics	2.1096010180322446	30.76413182966767	153586

This can either be specified by the simulation or interaction, or it can help to assess the result of the collision detection in a time-critical system.Conceptually, we consider sets of polygons during traversal and estimate probabilities that there is an intersection among these sets. This can be done efficiently by storing characteristics about the average distribution of the set of polygons with each node in a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). Consequently, we neither need any polygon intersection tests nor access to any polygons during the collision detection process.Our approach can be applied to virtually any BVH. Therefore, we call a BVH that has been augmented in this way an average-distribution tree or ADB-tree.We have implemented our new approach with two basic BVHs and present performance measurements and comparisons with a very fast previous algorithm, namely the DOP-tree. The results show a speedup of about a factor 3 to 6 with only approximately 4% error.	algorithm;apple desktop bus;best, worst and average case;bounding volume hierarchy;collision detection;critical system;numerical analysis;simulation;speedup;tree traversal;window of opportunity	Jan Klein;Gabriel Zachmann	2003		10.1145/1008653.1008660	mathematical optimization;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;computer science;theoretical computer science;bounding volume hierarchy;collision detection	Visualization	8.361816850767207	30.256289004431054	153878

Quantum computing promises to revolutionize how and what we compute. Over the course of three decades, quantum algorithms have been developed that offer fast solutions to problems in a variety of fields including number theory, optimization, chemistry, physics, and materials science. Quantum devices have also significantly advanced such that components of a scalable quantum computer have been demonstrated; the promise of implementing quantum algorithms is in our near future. I will attempt to explain some of the mysteries of this disruptive, revolutionary computational paradigm and how it will transform our digital age.	computation;quantum computing;quantum mechanics	Krysta Marie Svore	2017		10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203750	computer science;number theory;scalability;quantum computer;computation;quantum algorithm;quantum;feynman diagram;quantum mechanics	Theory	5.144348194298228	27.494916079473686	153947

However, the high scalability of these new systems leads to two main challenges: (i) the effortless installation of the system itself, and (ii) the control strategy of the networked lighting system. In this context, this paper presents an innovative approach to networked lighting control systems that allows overcoming these challenges in both distributed and centralized systems while optimizing energy consumption. Distributed approaches deserve our special attention due to their inherent simplicity for system deployment. Our analysis shows the feasibility of our underlying model for automatic learning of system parameters and autonomous system control.	autonomous system (internet);central processing unit;centralized computing;control theory;daylight;distributed algorithm;lighting control system;sap netweaver business warehouse;scalability;simulation;software deployment;system deployment	Alexander Schaeper;Camilo Palazuelos;Dee Denteneer;Óscar García-Morchón	2013	2013 10th IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING, SENSING AND CONTROL (ICNSC)	10.1109/ICNSC.2013.6548731	control engineering;embedded system;simulation;daylighting;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;smart lighting;intelligent control	Robotics	1.4330812017453467	28.655187591037777	154187

Relative to formal notions of array scheme and (extendible) array realization, a formal way of gauging efficiency of storage utilization by extendible array realizations is proposed; a lower bound of $O(p \cdot (\log p)^{d - 1} )$, where p is the array size and d the dimensionality, is derived for this measure; and an extendible allocation scheme which achieves this lower bound is exhibited. Certain seminorms on Euclidean spaces can be used to construct extendible array realizations. It is shown that for realizations so constructed, the lower bound on storage utilization efficiency is $O(p^d )$. In the opposite direction, certain restrictions on the patterns of expansions of arrays can be used to circumvent the lower bound: When arrays are constrained to expand according to some fixed finite set of patterns, then one can devise extendible realizations which (a) utilize storag...	extensibility	Arnold L.

We consider several classes of P systems and study their generative power. Particularly interesting, P systems with only evolution rules used sequentially and changing labels compute exactly the Parikh sets of matrix languages; the universality is reached by P systems with evolution rules and communication rules used sequentially. By direct constructions, we also prove that SAT can be solved in linear time by systems with evolution rules changing labels, communication, and membrane division.

Given a Petri net with an initial and a target markings, a so called complemented Petri net is created first that consists of the given Petri net and an additional, complementary transition. Thereby, the reachability task is reduced to calculation and investigation of transition invariants (T-invariants) of the complemented Petri net. The algorithm finds all minimal-support T-invariants of the complemented Petri net and then calculates a finite set of linear combinations of minimal-support T-invariants, in which the complementary transition fires only once. Finally, for each T-invariant with a single firing of the complementary transition, the algorithm tries to create a reachability path from initial to target marking or determines that there is no such path.	algorithm;item unique identification;petri net;reachability	Alexander E.

d3aa5bf2f276dec7595ee84175705914dd3956ac	kleene theorems for free choice nets labelled with distributed alphabets		We provided [15] expressions for free choice nets having “distributed choice property” which makes the nets “direct product” representable. In a recent work [14], we gave equivalent syntax for a larger class of free choice nets obtained by dropping “distributed choice property”. In both these works, the classes of free choice nets were restricted by a “product condition” on the set of final markings. In this paper we do away with this restriction and give expressions for the resultant classes of nets which correspond to free choice “synchronous products” and “Zielonka automata”. For free choice nets with distributed choice property, we give an alternative characterization which uses properties checkable in polynomial time. Free choice nets we consider are 1-bounded, S-coverable, and are labelled with distributed alphabets, where S-components of the associated S-cover respect the given alphabet distribution.	automata theory;automaton;kleene star;resultant;time complexity	Ramchandra Phawade	2018				Logic	-4.42126978397444	18.31532535861061	155475
bada3dc5b8cdefdf2f21ec7b264f8a453f22a457	pushdown systems with stack manipulation		Pushdown systems are a model of computation equipped with one stack where only the top of the stack is inspected and modified in each step of transitions. Although this is a natural restriction, some extensions of pushdown systems require more general operations on stack: conditional pushdown systems inspect the whole stack contents and discrete timed pushdown systems increment the ages of the whole stack contents. In this paper, we present a general framework called pushdown systems with transductions (TrPDS) for extending pushdown systems with transitions that modify the whole stack contents with a transducer. Although TrPDS is Turing complete, it is shown that if the closure of transductions appearing in the transitions of a TrPDS is finite, it can be simulated by an ordinary pushdown system and thus the reachability problem is decidable. Both of conditional and discrete timed pushdown systems can be considered as such subclasses of TrPDS.	halting problem;model of computation;reachability problem;stack (abstract data type);transducer;transduction (machine learning);turing completeness;undecidable problem	Yuya Uezato;Yasuhiko Minamide	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-02444-8_29	deterministic context-free language;deterministic pushdown automaton;combinatorics;nested stack automaton;discrete mathematics;mathematics;pushdown automaton;embedded pushdown automaton;algorithm	Logic	-3.2023849270926807	21.672546873403473	156072

It is similar in spirit to MAX-k-SAT, which is NPcomplete for k ≥ 2. It was known that the problem is QMA-complete for any k ≥ 3. On the other hand 1-LOCAL HAMILTONIAN is in P, and hence not believed to be QMA-complete. The complexity of the 2-LOCAL HAMILTONIAN problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and show that it is QMA-complete. We provide two independent proofs; our first proof uses only elementary linear algebra. Our second proof uses a powerful technique for analyzing the sum of two Hamiltonians; this technique is based on perturbation theory and we believe that it might prove useful elsewhere. Using our techniques we also show that adiabatic computation with two-local interactions on qubits is equivalent to standard quantum computation.	boolean satisfiability problem;complete (complexity);complexity class;computation;elementary;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);interaction;linear algebra;max;np (complexity);perturbation theory;qma;quantum computing;qubit	Julia Kempe;Alexei Y.

In algorithmic information theory [5, 7, 2] one needs an extension of Kraft’s condition from finite sets to (infinite) recursively enumerable sets. This extension, known as Kraft-Chaitin Theorem, was obtained by Chaitin in his seminal paper [4] (see also, [3, 2], [10]). The aim of this note is to offer a simpler proof of Kraft-Chaitin Theorem based on a new construction of the prefix-free code.	algorithmic information theory;computer programming;prefix code;recursion;recursively enumerable set;social inequality	Cristian S.

However, the impact of an aircraft composite structure is a random transient event that needs to be monitored on-line continuously. Therefore, the sensor network of an ASCS and the corresponding impact monitoring system which needs to be installed on the aircraft as an on-board device must meet the requirements of light weight, low power consumption and high reliability. To achieve this point, an Impact Region Monitor (IRM) based on piezoelectric sensors and guided wave has been proposed and developed. It converts the impact response signals output from piezoelectric sensors into Characteristic Digital Sequences (CDSs), and then uses a simple but efficient impact region localization algorithm to achieve impact monitoring with light weight and low power consumption. However, due to the large number of sensors of ASCS, the realization of lightweight sensor network is still a key problem to realize an applicable ASCS for on-line and continuous impact monitoring. In this paper, three kinds of lightweight piezoelectric sensor networks including continuous series sensor network, continuous parallel sensor network and continuous heterogeneous sensor network are proposed. They can greatly reduce the lead wires of the piezoelectric sensors of ASCS and they can also greatly reduce the monitoring channels of the IRM. Furthermore, the impact region localization methods, which are based on the CDSs and the lightweight sensor networks, are proposed as well so that the lightweight sensor networks can be applied to on-line and continuous impact monitoring of ASCS with a large number of piezoelectric sensors. The lightweight piezoelectric sensor networks and the corresponding impact region localization methods are validated on the composite wing box of an unmanned aerial vehicle. The accuracy rate of impact region localization is higher than 92%.	aerial photography;algorithm;information rights management;on-board data handling;online and offline;piezoelectricity;requirement;skin;unmanned aerial vehicle;sensor (device)	Lei Qiu;Xiaolei Deng;Shenfang Yuan;Yong An Huang;Yuanqiang Ren	2018		10.3390/s18072218	engineering;wireless sensor network;electronic engineering;composite number	Mobile	2.141828983171375	31.407904492809557	156959

This problem relates to the inherent maximal error-detecting capability of the language in question. We present an efficient algorithm for solving this problem which executes in time O(rnd), where r is the cardinality of the alphabet involved, n is the number of transitions in the given NFA, and d is the computed edit distance. We have implemented the algorithm and present here performance tests. The correctness of the algorithm is based on the result (also presented here) that the particular error-detection property related to our problem can be defined via an input-altering transducer.	algorithm;correctness (computer science);edit distance;maximal set;nondeterministic finite automaton;regular language;sensor;time complexity;transducer	Lila Kari;Stavros Konstantinidis;Steffen Kopecki;Meng Meng Yang	2013	CoRR		discrete mathematics;edit distance;wagner–fischer algorithm;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	-0.7771708852878165	20.746446463464466	157178

First, a recent conjecture is confirmed: any recursively enumerable language is obtained from a language recognized by a P automaton, to which an initial (arbitrarily large) string is added. Then, we discuss possibilities of extending P automata, following suggestions from string finite automata. For instance, automata with a memory (corresponding to push-down automata) are considered and their power is briefly investigated, as well as some closure properties of the family of languages recognized by P automata. In the context, a brief survey of results about P and dP automata (a distributed version of P automata) is provided, and several further research topics are formulated.	automata theory;automaton	Gheorghe Paun;Mario J.

Shared technology is a common usage model for technology adoption in developing countries. WSNs have great potential to be utilized as a shared resource due to their on-board processing and ad-hoc networking capabilities, however their deployment as a shared resource requires that the technical community first address several challenges. The main challenges include enabling sensor portability: (1) the frequent movement of sensors within and between deployments, and rapidly deployable systems; (2) systems that are quick and simple to deploy. We first discuss the feasibility of using sensor networks as a shared resource, and then describe our research in addressing the various technical challenges that arise in enabling such sensor portability and rapid deployment.

0378bb8e68a57402baa2620842ffdf91be2c4442	circuit complexity, proof complexity, and polynomial identity testing: the ideal proof system		We introduce a new and natural algebraic proof system, whose complexity measure is essentially the algebraic circuit size of Nullstellensatz certificates. This enables us to exhibit close connections between effective Nullstellensatzë, proof complexity, and (algebraic) circuit complexity. In particular, we show that any super-polynomial lower bound on any Boolean tautology in our proof system implies that the permanent does not have polynomial-size algebraic circuits (VNP ≠ VP). We also show that super-polynomial lower bounds on the number of lines in Polynomial Calculus proofs imply the Permanent versus Determinant Conjecture. Note that there was no proof system prior to ours for which lower bounds on an arbitrary tautology implied any complexity class lower bound.  Our proof system helps clarify the relationships between previous algebraic proof systems. In doing so, we highlight the importance of polynomial identity testing (PIT) in proof complexity. In particular, we use PIT to illuminate AC0[p]-Frege lower bounds, which have been open for nearly 30 years, with no satisfactory explanation as to their apparent difficulty.  Finally, we explain the obstacles that must be overcome in any attempt to extend techniques from algebraic circuit complexity to prove lower bounds in proof complexity. Using the algebraic structure of our proof system, we propose a novel route to such lower bounds. Although such lower bounds remain elusive, this proposal should be contrasted with the difficulty of extending AC0[p] circuit lower bounds to AC0[p]-Frege lower bounds.		Joshua A.

b8a6083eb24440b64429dcc6db8ac5a7cd1b6433	smart led street light systems: a bruneian case study		Smart LED Street Light System (SLSLS) could offer a more systematic and efficient approach that would be beneficial to the government, road users and community. This could reduce energy consumption by intelligently switching on and off and dimming of lights according to real-time data from sensors and control request from end-users. SLSLS could also minimise human intervention by incorporating dynamic faulty light detection through wireless communication. This paper presents the design of a low cost SLSLS using off-the-shelf Arduino based controller using wireless and sensor networks. This requires wireless data transmission between street light and storing data in the system database. The system includes an interactive interface that monitors and provides data visualisation of vital and up-to-date information to end-users. The SLSLS prototype units are developed to test the feasibility of these goals: to demonstrate the smart functionality of the wireless data transmission; a back-end database server to provide storage unit; and the monitoring control and display interface (MCDI).	arduino;artificial intelligence;data mining;data visualization;database server;machine learning;microcontroller;prototype;real-time data;sensor;server (computing);the wall street journal;user interface	Dk Nur Siti Khadhijah Pg Ali Kumar;Thien Wan Au;Wida Susanty Suhaili	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-69456-6_31	embedded system;wireless sensor network;control theory;arduino;database server;fault detection and isolation;data transmission;wireless;government;computer science	Mobile	0.9759003092436689	30.913292331191734	158598

By modulating the vibration motors available in all mobile phones, and decoding them through accelerometers, we aim to communicate small packets of information. Of course, this will not match the bit rates available through RF modalities, such as NFC or Bluetooth, which utilize a much larger bandwidth. However, where security is vital, vibratory communication may offer advantages. We develop Ripple, a system that achieves up to 200 bits/s of secure transmission using off-the-shelf vibration motor chips, and 80 bits/s on Android smartphones. This is an outcome of designing and integrating a range of techniques, including multicarrier modulation, orthogonal vibration division, vibration braking, side-channel jamming, etc. Not all these techniques are novel; some are borrowed and suitably modified for our purposes, while others are unique to this relatively new platform of vibratory communication.	android;bluetooth;delta modulation;mobile phone;near field communication;radio frequency;radio jamming;ripple;secure transmission;side-channel attack;smartphone	Nirupam Roy;Mahanth Gowda;Romit Roy Choudhury	2015			embedded system;telecommunications;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-2.086503827788932	30.65103738288175	158991

Distinguishing sequences (State Identification): (1) We show that it is PSPACE-complete to determine whether an FSM has a preset distinguishing sequence. There are machines that have distinguishing sequences, but only of exponential length. (2) We give a polynomial time algorithm that determines whether an FSM has an adupfive distinguishing sequence. (The previous classical algorithms take exponential time.) Furthermore, if there is an adaptive distinguishing sequence, then we give an efficient algorithm that constructs such a sequence of length O (n2 ) (which is the best possible), where n is the number of states. Unique Input Output sequences (State Verification): It is PSPACE-complete to determine whether a state of an FSM has a Unique Input Output (UIO) sequence. There am machines whose states have UIO sequences, but only of exponential length. Checking sequences (Fault Detection): We present a simple randomized polynomial time algorithm that constructs with high probability a checking sequence of length 0(pn4 logn), where p is the size of the input alphaket. (There is a lower bound of pn3 on the length of checking sequences; again, the classical algorithms for this problem are exponential in general or work only for special cases.)

549ab20accce8aa6b4b2da289e6dc1f24ad0a834	dual weak pigeonhole principle, pseudo-surjective functions, and provability of circuit lower bounds		This article is a continuation of our search for tautologies that are hard even for strong propositional proof systems like EF, cf. [14, 15]. The particular tautologies we study, the v-formulas, are obtained from any ./poly map g; they express that a string is outside of the range of g. Maps g considered here are particular pseudorandom generators. The ultimate goal is to deduce the hardness of the r-formulas for at least EF from some general, plausible computational hardness hypothesis. In this paper we introduce the notions of pseudo-surjective and iterable functions (related to free functions of[15]). These two properties imply the hardness of the r-formulas from the function but unlike the hardness they are preserved under composition and iteration. We link the existence of maps with these two properties to the provability of circuit lower bounds, and we characterize maps g yielding hard r-formulas in terms of a hitting set type property (all relative to a propositional proof system). We show that a proof system containing EF admits a pseudo-surjective function unless it simulates a proof system WF introduced by Jefibek [11]. an extension of EF. We propose a concrete map g as a candidate function possibly pseudo-surjective or free for strong proof systems. The map is defined as a Nisan-Wigderson generator based on a random function and on a random sparse matrix. We prove that it is iterable in a particular way in resolution, yielding the output/input ratio n3(that improves upon a direct construction of Alekhnovich et al. [2]). Propositional proof complexity studies the lengths of proofs of tautologies in various proof systems. The ultimate goal is to show that no proof system can prove all tautologies by proofs of size polynomial in the size of the tautology. With a general definition of proof systems as non-deterministic algorithms accepting exactly the set of tautologies (cf. [7]) the problem is equivalent to the u0027/coJA problem. Non-trivial lower bounds to the lengths of proofs have been proved for various particular proof systems and already these partial results have deep implications.u0027 All these proof systems are demonstrably weaker than the usual text-book calculus based on modus ponens and a finite number of axiom schemes, a Frege system F in the terminology of [7]. It is generally thought that a pivotal case in this research is Extended Frege system EF. EF extends F by allowing to abbreviate (possibly large) formulas by new atoms. Equivalently, one may think of EF as a Frege system operating with circuits rather than with formulas.2 Received February 11, 2003.

The amount of page reaccesses, the page access sequence, and the amount of buffer needed are represented in terms of graph parameters. By using the graph model formed from the index on the join attributes, we determine the relationships between these parameters. Two types of buffer allocation strategies are studied, and the upper bound on the buffer size with no page reaccess is given. This bound is shown to be the maximum cut value of a graph. Hence, the problem of computing this upper bound is NP-hard. We also give algorithms to determine a page access sequence requiring a near optimal buffer size with no page reaccess. The optimal page access sequence for a fixed buffer size has also been considered.	algorithm;buffer overflow;home page;maximum cut;np-hardness;relational algebra;relational database	Sakti Pramanik;David Ittner	1985	ACM Trans.

94aef74ec099de9bfa64c08b1b9a9f2c1bd8ea1c	safe recursion over an arbitrary structure: par, ph and dph	computer model;polynomial time	Considering the Blum, Shub, and Smale computational model for real numbers, extended by Poizat to general structures, classical complexity can be considered as the restriction to finite structures of a more general notion of computability and complexity working over arbitrary structures. In a previous paper, we showed that the machine-independent characterization of Bellantoni and Cook of sequential polynomial time for classical complexity is actually the restriction to finite structures of a characterization of sequential polynomial time over arbitrary structures. In this paper, we prove that the same phenomenon happens for several other complexity classes: over arbitrary structures, parallel polynomial time corresponds to safe recursion with substitutions, and the polynomial hierarchy corresponds to safe recursion with predicative minimization. Our results yield machine-independent characterizations of several complexity classes subsuming previous ones when restricted to finite structures. 1 Partially supported by City University of Hong Kong SRG grant 7001290.

ae292f5df54da19eeaf77c5e23f77148edc50cd9	alternating turing machines and the analytical hierarchy	arithmetical hierarchy	We use notions originating in Computational Complexity to provide insight into the analogies between Computational Complexity and Higher Recursion Theory. We consider alternating Turing machines, but with a modified, global, definition of acceptance. We show that a language is accepted by such a machine iff it is inductive (Π1). Moreover, total alternating machines, which either accept or reject each input, accept precisely the hyper-arithmetical (∆1) languages. Also, bounding the permissible number of alternations we obtain a characterization of the levels of the arithmetical hierarchy. The novelty of these characterizations lies primarily in the use of finite computing devices, with finitary, discrete, computation steps. We thereby elucidate the analogy between the polynomial-time and the arithmetical hierarchies, as well as between their respective limits, namely the classes of the polynomial-space and Π1 languages.	alternating turing machine;analytical hierarchy;arithmetical hierarchy;complex adaptive system;computability theory;computation;computational complexity theory;definition;model of computation;p (complexity);polynomial;programming language;recursion;rejection sampling;semiconductor industry;time complexity;undecidable problem	Daniel Leivant	2012			nspace;description number;alternating turing machine;combinatorics;dtime;discrete mathematics;exptime;time hierarchy theorem;super-recursive algorithm;hyperarithmetical theory;mathematics	Theory	2.8957063638416107	20.469534482184415	161295

We prove under a precise version of this assumption that <i>BPL</i> â â©<sub>Î± > 0</sub> <i>DSPACE</i>(log<sup>1 + Î±</sup> <i>n</i>). We strengthen the theorem to an equivalence by considering two generalizations of the concept of a pseudorandom generator against logspace. A targeted pseudorandom generator against logspace takes as input a short uniform random seed and a finite automaton; it outputs a long bitstring that looks random to that particular automaton. A simulation advice generator for logspace stretches a small uniform random seed into a long advice string; the requirement is that there is some logspace algorithm that, given a finite automaton and this advice string, simulates the automaton reading a long uniform random input. We prove that â©<sub>Î± > 0</sub> <i>prBPSPACE</i>(log<sup>1 + Î±</sup> <i>n</i>) = â©<sub>Î± > 0</sub> <i>prDSPACE</i>(log<sup>1 + Î±</sup> <i>n</i>) if and only if for every targeted pseudorandom generator against logspace, there is a simulation advice generator for logspace with similar parameters. Finally, we observe that in a certain uniform setting (namely, if we only worry about sequences of automata that can be generated in logspace), targeted pseudorandom generators against logspace can be transformed into simulation advice generators with similar parameters.	advice (complexity);automaton;bit array;finite-state machine;l (complexity);pseudorandom generator;pseudorandomness;random seed;randomized algorithm;simulation;turing completeness	William M.

This paper answers a question of Ben-Or and Linial by proving that for every $c < 1$ there are such games on n players in which no coalition of $cn$ players can influence the outcome with probability greater than some universal constant times c. (Note that this paper actually proves this statement only for all $c < \frac{1}{3}$, but since its universal constant is bigger than 3 the above is trivial for $c \geqslant \frac{1}{3}$.)

We study the universality problem for ptNFAs, a class of partially ordered NFAs recognizing piecewise testable languages. The universality problem asks if an automaton accepts all words over its alphabet. Deciding universality for both NFAs and partially ordered NFAs is PSpace-complete. For ptNFAs, the complexity drops to coNP-complete if the alphabet is fixed but is open if the alphabet may grow. We show, using a novel and nontrivial construction, that the problem is PSpace-complete if the alphabet may grow polynomially.	co-np;diagram;loop (graph theory);nondeterministic finite automaton;pspace-complete;universal turing machine;universality probability	Tomás Masopust;Markus Krötzsch	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-73117-9_29	discrete mathematics;diagram;combinatorics;piecewise;computer science;universality (philosophy);pspace-complete;alphabet	Logic	-0.8078709314994147	21.111252322664505	162239

With this motivation, it is natural to impose a bound on the time interval when an enabled spiking rule in a s piking neural P system (SN P system, for short) remains unused. In this work, a new working mode of SN P systems is defined, which is called limited asynchronous mode. In an SN P system workin g in limited asynchronous mode, if a rule is enabled at some step, this rule is not obligatoril y used. From this step on, if the unused rule may be used later, it should be used in the given time inte rval. If further spikes make the rule non-applicable, then the computation continues in the new c ircumstances. The computation result of a computation in an SN P system working in limited asynchro nous mode is defined as the total number of spikes sent into the environment by the system. It i s proved that limited asynchronous SN P systems with standard spiking rules are universal. If the n umber of spikes present in each neuron of a limited asynchronous SN P system with standard spiking r ules is bounded during a computation, then the power of a limited asynchronous SN P system with stan dard spiking rules falls drastically, and we get a characterization of semilinear sets of numbers. also affiliated to LIACS, Leiden University Address for correspondence: Leiden Institute of Advanced C omputer Science, Leiden University, Niels Bohrweg 1, 2333 C A Leiden, The Netherlands 272 L.

AVTMR system is designed in a triplicated voter technique and dual–duplex system in a comparator, and two systems are based on MC68000. To evaluate system characteristic, Markov modeling method is designed for reliability, availability, safety and MTTF (Mean Time To Failure), and RELEX6.0 tool is used for the calculation of failure rate of electrical components that is based on MILSPEC-217F. In this paper, we can see two systems are more high dependability than a single system, and AVTMR or dual–duplex system can be selected for a specific application system. Especially, because AVTMR and dual–duplex system have high RAMS better than a single system, they can be applied to life critical system such as an airplane and a high-speed railway system. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

These networks often utilize local constraint propagation techniques to achieve local consistency (consistent labeling in vision). Such methods have been used extensively in the context of image understanding and interpretation, as well as planning, natural language analysis and truth maintenance systems. In this paper we study the parallel complexity of discrete relaxation, one of the most commonly used constraint propagation techniques. Since the constraint propagation procedures such as discrete relaxation appear to operate locally, it has been previously believed that the relaxation approach for achieving local consistency has a natural parallel solution. Our analysis suggests that a parallel solution is unlikely to improve the known sequential solutions by much. Specifically, we prove that the problem solved by discrete relaxation (arc consistency) is log-space complete for P (the class of polynomial-time deterministic sequential algorithms). Intuitively, this implies that discrete relaxation is inherently sequential and it is unlikely that we can solve the polynomial-time version of the consistent labeling problem in logarithmic time by using only a polynomial number of processors. Some practical implications of our result are discussed. We also provide a two-way transformation between AND/OR graphs, propositional Horn satisfiability and local consistency in constraint networks that allows us to develop optimal linear-time algorithms for local consistency in constraint networks.	constraint satisfaction;linear programming relaxation	Simon Kasif	1990	Artif.

Since their appeareance, they have been used to solve computationally difficult problems (usually in the classes NP and PSPACE), due to their ability to generate an exponential size workspace in a polynomial number of time steps. Several computational complexity techniques have thus been applied to study their computing power and efficiency.

Based on the structure and properties of these automata, formal definitions of attained validity and certainty and also required complexity are defined as metrics of identification efficiency. The main contribution of the paper relies on organizing the identification and search procedure in a way that maximizes its validity for bounded complexity budgets and reversely minimizes computational complexity for a given required validity threshold. The associated optimization problem is solved by using dynamic programming. Finally, a set of experiments provides insight to the introduced theoretical framework.	automata theory;computational complexity theory;dynamic programming;entity;experiment;finite-state machine;mathematical optimization;norm (social);optimization problem;organizing (structure)	Manolis Falelakis;Christos Diou;Anastasios Delopoulos	2006	EURASIP J.

Our algorithm works in the setting of black-box groups, wherein none of these problems have polynomial-time classical algorithms. As an important byproduct, our algorithm is able to produce a pure quantum state that is uniform over the elements in any chosen subgroup of a solvable group, which yields a natural way to apply existing quantum algorithms to factor groups of solvable groups.	black box;decision problem;quantum algorithm;quantum state;time complexity	John Watrous	2001		10.1145/380752.380759	time complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;solvable group;mathematics;quantum algorithm;physics;algorithm;algebra	Theory	9.223591994300108	21.41617164795848	165024

0ff57da301e65637322792734fe078ac09690628	core maintenance in dynamic graphs: a parallel approach based on matching		The core number of vertices is a basic index depicting cohesiveness of a graph, and has been widely used in large-scale graph analytics. In this paper, we study the update of core numbers of vertices in dynamic graphs with edge insertions/deletions, which is known as the core maintenance problem. Different from previous approaches that just focus on the case of single-edge insertion/deletion and sequentially handle the edges when multiple edges are inserted/deleted, we investigate the parallelism in the core maintenance procedure. Specifically, we show that if the inserted/deleted edges constitute a matching, the core number update with respect to each inserted/deleted edge can be handled in parallel. Based on this key observation, we propose parallel algorithms for core maintenance in both cases of edge insertions and deletions. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency, stability, parallelism and scalability of our algorithms on different types of real-world, synthetic graphs and temporal networks. Comparing with former approaches, our algorithms can improve the core maintenance efficiency significantly.	apollonian network;dynamic problem (algorithms);experiment;fits;group cohesiveness;multiple edges;parallel algorithm;parallel computing;scalability;synthetic intelligence;vertex (geometry)	Hai Jin;Na Wang;Dongxiao Yu;Qiang-Sheng Hua;Xuanhua Shi;Xia Xie	2018	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2018.2835441	computer science;combinatorics;multiple edges;maintenance problem;maintenance engineering;distributed computing;parallel algorithm;theoretical computer science;scalability;vertex (geometry);graph;analytics	DB	7.756033742156227	31.917815210759677	165097

2e5d621ce37c683f144b8d2858e187f9868c1d57	on ip = pspace and theorems with narrow proofs		It has been shown that the class of languages with interactive proofs, IP, is exactly the class PSPACE. This surprising result elegantly places IP in the standard classification of feasible computations. Furthermore, the IP = PSPACE result reveals some very interesting and unsuspected properties of mathematical proofs. In this column we define the width of a proof in a formal system F and show that it is an intuitively satisfying and robust definition. Then, using the IP = PSPACE result, it is seen that the width of a proof (as opposed to the length) determines how quickly one can give overwhelming evidence that a theorem is provable without showing the full proof. 1 On Proofs and Interactive Proofs A mathematician has the most confidence in the truth of a theorem when he/she is given a complete proof of the theorem in a trusted formal system. Let F be such a formal system in which the correctness of a proof can be checked by a verifier in polynomial time. The class NP clearly captures all the theorems which have polynomially long proofs. The NP =? P question is the question about the quantitative computational difference between finding a proof of a theorem and checking the correctness of a given proof. Some years ago, theoretical computer scientists asked whether it is possible to give convincing evidence that a theorem is provable in F without showing a complete This research was supported in part by NSF Research Grant CCR 88-23053.

Clearly, if we do not give a complete proof to a verifier (that does not have the power or time to generate and check the proof), then we cannot expect the verifier to be completely convinced that the theorem is provable. This led to a very fascinating problem: how can a verifier be convinced with high probability that a given theorem is provable without seeing the whole proof? and how rapidly can this be done? This problem has been formulated and extensively studied in terms of interactive protocols [Gol89]. Informally, an interactive protocol consists of a Prover and a Verifier. The Prover is an all powerful Turing Machine (TM) and the Verifier is a TM which operates in time polynomial in the length of the input. In addition, the Verifier has a random source (e.g., a fair coin) not visible to the Prover. In the beginning of the interactive protocol the Prover and the Verifier receive the same input string. Then, the Prover tries to convince the Verifier, through a series of queries and answers, that the input string belongs to a given language. The Prover succeeds if the Verifier accepts with probability greater than 2/3. The probability is computed over all possible coin tosses made by the Verifier. However, the Verifier must guard against imposters masquerading as the real Prover. That is, the Verifier must not be convinced to accept a string not in the language with probability greater than 1/3—even if the Prover lies. Definition Let V be a probabilistic polynomial time TM and let P be an arbitrary TM. P and V share the same input tape and communicate via a communication tape. P and V form an interactive protocol for a language L if 1. x ∈ L =⇒ Prob[ P -V accepts x ] > 2/3. 2. x 6∈ L =⇒ ∀P , Prob[ P -V accepts x ] < 1/3. A language L is in IP if there exist P and V which form an interactive protocol for L. Clearly, IP contains all NP languages, because in polynomial time the Prover can give the Verifier the entire proof. In such a protocol, the Verifier cannot be fooled and never accepts a string not in the language. To illustrate how randomness can generalize the concept of a proof, we look at an interactive protocol for a language not known to be in NP. Consider GNI, the set of pairs of graphs that are not isomorphic. GNI is known to be in co-NP and believed not to be in NP. However, GNI does have an interactive protocol [GMW86]. For small graphs, the Verifier can easily determine if the two graphs are not isomorphic. For sufficiently large graphs, the Verifier solicits help from the Prover to show that Gi and Gj are not isomorphic, as follows: 1. The Verifier randomly selects Gi or Gj and a random permutation of the selected graph. This process is independently repeated n times, where n is the number of vertices in Gj. If the graphs do not have the same number of vertices, they are clearly not isomorphic. This sequence of n randomly chosen, randomly permuted graphs is sent to the Prover. Recall that the Prover has not seen the Verifier’s random bits. This assumption is not necessary, but simplifies the exposition. 2. The Verifier asks the Prover to determine, for each graph in the sequence, which graph, Gi or Gj , was the one selected. If the Prover answers all the queries correctly, then the Verifier accepts. Suppose the two original graphs are not isomorphic. Then, only one of the original graphs is isomorphic to the permuted graph. The Prover simply answers by picking that graph. If the graphs are isomorphic, then the Prover has at best a 2 chance of answering all n questions correctly. Thus, the Verifier cannot be fooled with high probability. Therefore, GNI ∈ IP. Note that GNI is believed to be incomplete for co-NP. So, the preceding discussion does not show that co-NP ⊆ IP. For a while, it was believed that co-NP is not contained in IP, because there are oracle worlds where co-NP 6⊆ IP [FS88]. In fact, the computational power of interactive protocols was not fully appreciated until Lund, Fortnow, Karloff and Nisan [LFKN90] showed that IP actually contains the entire Polynomial Hierarchy. This result then led Shamir [Sha90] to completely characterize IP by showing that IP = PSPACE. Babai, Fortnow and Lund [BFL90] characterized the computational power of multiprover interactive protocols MIP = NEXP. In both cases, it is interesting to see that interactive proof systems provide alternative definitions of classic complexity classes. Thus, they fit very nicely in the overall classification of feasible computations. Furthermore, both of these problems have contradictory relativizations [FS88]. That is, there exist oracles A and B such that IP = PSPACE and IP 6= PSPACE, and similarly for the multi-prover case. Thus, these results provide the first natural counterexamples to the belief that problems with contradictory relativizations are beyond our proof techniques. The IP = PSPACE result also provides a very dramatic counterexample to the already battered Random Oracle Hypothesis.

Feder and Vardi (1998) identified three families of constraint satisfaction problems containing all known polynomially solvable problems. We introduce a new class of problems called para-primal problems, incomparable with the families identified by Feder and Vardi (1998) and we prove that any constraint problem in this class is decidable in polynomial time. As an application of this result we prove a complete classification for the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems under the assumption that the basis contains all the permutation relations. In the proofs, we make an intensive use of algebraic results from clone theory about the structure of para-primal and homogeneous algebras.	cobham's thesis;complexity of constraint satisfaction;constraint satisfaction problem;decision problem;linear algebra;olami–feder–christensen model;polynomial;time complexity	Víctor Dalmau	2000	Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence	10.1007/s10472-005-1810-9	constraint logic programming;time complexity;mathematical optimization;constraint programming;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;complexity;binary constraint;decomposition method;ac-3 algorithm;constraint satisfaction;constraint learning;computer science;constraint graph;constraint satisfaction dual problem;mathematics;complexity of constraint satisfaction;constraint;constraint satisfaction problem;algorithm;hybrid algorithm;local consistency;backtracking	AI	6.8082919737715955	19.226729193515716	165829

This work studies how to partition a big graph with respect to arbitrary proportions in a streaming manner. To meet diverse requirements of big graph partitioning scenarios, we first devise 3 measurement schemes for measuring the graph vertex count, graph workload, and graph processing time, respectively. These schemes are the bases and prerequisites for big graph partitioning. Due to the difficulty in acquiring full big graph information, we then design 8 streaming heuristics to partitioning a big graph during the process of loading its data from external disks into memory. Each of these heuristics decides where to assign every vertex in the stream based on the information calculated by one of the above 3 schemes. At last, we demonstrate the performance and flexibility of our heuristics in partitioning real and synthetic graph datasets on a medium-sized cluster. The characteristics of arbitrary proportions of our approach makes it have a wide range of applications.		Ke-Kun Hu;Guosun Zeng;Huo-wen Jiang;Wei Wang	2018	Future Generation Comp.

f6d8b2f8460f1603fc9c6f27ba7a88fbdfe63714	regulated pushdown automata	pushdown automata	The present paper suggests a new investigation area of the formal language theory—regulated automata. Specifically, it investigates pushdown automata that regulate the use of their rules by control languages. It proves that this regulation has no effect on the power of pushdown automata if the control languages are regular. However, the pushdown automata regulated by linear control languages characterize the family of recursively enumerable languages. All these results are established in terms of (A) acceptance by final state, (B) acceptance by empty pushdown, and (C) acceptance by final state and empty pushdown. In its conclusion, this paper formulates several open problems.	automata theory;control system;control theory;deterministic pushdown automaton;formal language;graph coloring;recursion;recursively enumerable language;stack (abstract data type)	Alexander Meduna;Dusan Kolár	2000	Acta Cybern.		computer science;programming language;pushdown automaton;algorithm	Logic	-2.3921094332811106	21.23609073535107	165985
c3d1c50dbe15912608a6d5efb127bb62f7e18cd0	restructuring expression dags for efficient parallelization		In the field of robust geometric computation it is often necessary to make exact decisions based on inexact floating-point arithmetic. One common approach is to store the computation history in an arithmetic expression dag and to re-evaluate the expression with increasing precision until an exact decision can be made. We show that exact-decisions number types based on expression dags can be evaluated faster in practice through parallelization on multiple cores. We compare the impact of several restructuring methods for the expression dag on its running time in a parallel environment. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation → Data structures design and analysis, Theory of computation → Computational geometry, Computing methodologies → Parallel algorithms	algorithm;automatic parallelization;computation history;computational geometry;directed acyclic graph;parallel computing;theory of computation;time complexity	Martin Wilhelm	2018		10.4230/LIPIcs.SEA.2018.20	parallel computing;discrete mathematics;computation history;computation;restructuring;computer science;expression (mathematics)	PL	9.805376289910534	31.944678366764048	166190

Though the problem is not known to be NP-hard, neither efficient, algorithmic solution nor technologically practicable, quantum-computer solution has been found. This apparent complexity, which renders infeasible the factorization of sufficiently large values, makes secure the RSA cryptographic system. Given the lack of a practicable factorization system from algorithmic or quantum-computing models, we ask whether efficient solution exists elsewhere; this motivates the analogue system presented here. The system’s complexity is prohibitive of its factorizing arbitrary, natural numbers, though the problem is mitigated when factorizing n = pq for primes p and q of similar size, and, hence, when factorizing RSA keys. Ultimately, though, we argue that the system’s polynomial time and space complexities are testament not to its power, but to the inadequacy of traditional, Turing-machine-based complexity theory; we propose precision complexity (defined in our previous paper4)) as a more relevant measure, and advocate, more generally, non-standard complexity analyses for non-standard computers.	analog computer;computation;computational complexity theory;computational model;cryptography;cryptosystem;dspace;input/output;np-hardness;natural computing;polynomial;rendering (computer graphics);testament;time complexity;turing machine	Ed Blakey	2008	New Generation Computing	10.1007/s00354-008-0059-3	co-np;time complexity;analog computer;average-case complexity;ph;quantum complexity theory;computer science;turing machine;integer factorization;theoretical computer science;structural complexity theory;2-exptime;worst-case complexity;up;dspace;quantum computer;computational complexity theory;factorization;algorithm	Crypto	7.622932407216334	23.549850660414492	166277

A predominant reason for the occurrence of such crashes is that current vehicles (including those equipped with an automatic cruise control system) do not provide drivers with advance information of events occurring far ahead of them. The use of intervehicular communication to provide advance warnings to enhance automotive safety is therefore being actively discussed in the research community. In this paper, we investigate scenarios wherein only a subset of the vehicles in a multivehicle stream is equipped with such advance-warning capabilities. These vehicles (which are equipped with the capability to receive far-ahead information) are arbitrarily distributed among other unequipped vehicles that are capable of receiving only local near-neighbor information. It is seen that there are conditions wherein even a partial equipage of the system can be beneficial to both equipped and unequipped vehicles in a mixed-vehicle stream. We demonstrate this through both simulations and a theoretical analysis. We also developed a prototype of an advance-warning system and conducted road tests to test the concept. These road tests have demonstrated the system's performance to be satisfactory, subject to good communication links, for the class of scenarios tested.	control system;crash (computing);prototype;simulation	Animesh Chakravarthy;KyungYeol Song;Eric Feron	2009	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2009.2018323	simulation;global positioning system;engineering;control system;human factors and ergonomics;automotive engineering;control theory;forensic engineering	Robotics	1.7261380671864996	27.862751225587935	166470

Write-once memory has the property that bits may be set but not reset. Our model consists of a RAM with a small amount of regular memory (such as logarithmic orn α for α<1, wheren is the size of the problem) and a polynomial amount of write-once memory. Bounds are given on the time required to simulate on write-once memory algorithms which originally run on a RAM with a polynomial amount of regular memory. We attempt to characterize algorithms that can be simulated on our write-once memory model with very little slow-down. A persistent computation is one in which, at all times, the memory state of the computation at any previous point in time can be reconstructed. We show that any data structure or computation implemented on this write-once memory model can be made persistent without sacrificing much in the way of running time or space. The space requirements of algorithms running on the write-once model are studied. We show that general simulations of algorithms originally running on a RAM with regular memory by algorithms running on our write-once memory model require space proportional to the number of steps simulated. In order to study the space complexity further, we define an analogue of the pebbling game, called the pebble-sticker game. A sticker is different from a pebble in that it cannot be removed once placed on a node of the computation graph. As placing pebbles correspond to writes to regular memory, placing stickers correspond to writes to the write-once memory. Bounds are shown on pebble-sticker tradeoffs required to evaluate trees and planar graphs. Finally, we define the complexity class WO-PSPACE as the class of problems which can be solved with a polynomial amount of write-once memory, and show that it is equal toP.	binary decision diagram;complexity class;dspace;hard disk drive performance characteristics;maximum flow problem;model of computation;pspace;parallel computing;pebble smartwatch;persistent data structure;planar graph;polynomial;random-access memory;randomized algorithm;requirement;simulation;sorting;space–time tradeoff;time complexity	Sandy Irani;Moni Naor;Ronitt Rubinfeld	1992	Mathematical systems theory	10.1007/BF02835833	model of computation;time complexity;complexity class;memory model;combinatorics;parallel computing;distributed memory;data structure;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;flat memory model;dspace;algorithm;planar graph;computing with memory	Theory	9.772705399692546	26.604208578642925	166599

The key idea is to suspect the workers that are potentially malicious, and use a rankingbased preference mechanism. This allows us to generalize beyond past work–in our case, the number of malicious workers can be arbitrarily large, and we use only the weakest assumption on honest workers (at least one honest worker). We prove the convergence of SGD under these scenarios. Empirical results show that Zeno outperforms existing approaches under various attacks.	byzantine fault tolerance;malware;stochastic gradient descent	Cong Xie;Oluwasanmi O Koyejo;Indranil Gupta	2018	CoRR		machine learning;mathematical optimization;arbitrarily large;artificial intelligence;suspect;stochastic gradient descent;zeno's paradoxes;byzantine fault tolerance;mathematics;convergence (routing);ranking	ML	3.5468956102388995	27.78597693719581	166718

It follows from a theorem of Markov (JACM 1958) that the minimum number of negation gates in a circuit necessary and sufficient to compute any Boolean function f is ⌈log(d(f) + 1)⌉. A recent result due to Morizumi (ICALP 2009) proves that d(f) negations are necessary and sufficient when the computation is done by formulas. We explore the situation in between formulas (directed trees) and general circuits (DAGs), and related models. We obtain the following results: 1. We argue that for any Boolean function f, there is a circuit computing f, that uses ⌈log(d(f) + 1)⌉ negations and has treewidth at most ⌈log(d(f)+1)⌉ + 1. For 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌈log(d(f)+1)⌉, we prove that d(f). 8k/2k negations are sufficient to compute any Boolean function f by circuits of treewidth at most k. Moreover, if there is a circuit family of size s = s(n) and treewidth k = k(n) computing {fn}, then there exists a circuit family of size sċnO(1)ċ2O(min{k, log n}) and treewidth at most 2k which computes {fn} and contains O(max{nk/22k, log n}) negation gates. 2. We obtain tight bounds on the number of negation gates required to compute specific functions such as PARITYn, PARITYn and INVERTERn by one-input-face upward planar circuits. We extend these lower bounds to a larger class of functions (which also includes natural functions like ADD and SUBTRACT) and we show a direct sum theorem for this class with respect to the number of negations. 3. We demonstrate the limitations of the one-input-face constraint in the upward planar circuits by showing the explicit function which can be computed by a monotone upward planar circuit, but cannot be computed by any montone one-input-face upward planar circuit. 4. We prove that for every Boolean function f, there exists a multi-lective upward planar circuit which uses at most ⌈d(f)+1/2⌉ negation gates for computing f.	treewidth	Jing He;Hongyu Liang;Jayalal Sarma	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15155-2_37	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	EDA	9.02850466998356	21.913163615552772	166814

This prefix property is then used to prove that Higher-order Rewriting Systems enjoy Finite Family Developments. This property states, that reductions in which the creation depth of the redexes is bounded are finite, and is a useful tool to prove various properties of HRSs.	explicit substitution;lambda calculus;prefix code;reduction (complexity);rewriting	H.

It is known that everyn-argument functionf defined over finite domains can be computed b n−1 2 c-privately. The classes of 1-private two-argument functions and of t-privateBooleanfunctions admit relatively simple characterizations. In contrast, the general question of characterizing the class of t-private functions ofn arguments is still open. The only technique that appears in the literature for proving nont-privacy of a function f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) over a finite domain, wheren ≥ 3 and d 2e ≤ t ≤ n − 1, uses a reduction to the two-party case via a partition argument. A necessary condition for f beingt-private is that for every partition ( S; S̄) of the parties{1, 2, . . . , n} such that both |S| ≤ t and|S̄| ≤ t , the two-argument function obtained by viewing f as a function of{xi }i∈S and{xi }i∈S̄ is 1-private. The question whether the use of such partition reductions together with the two-party characterization is powerful enough to characterize privacy in the multiparty case was raised as an open problem in previous works. These works also exhibit an affirmative answer for specific classes of functions. We answer this question negatively. We show that even if more general partition reductions are used, in which the n parties are partitioned into k sets (2≤ k ≤ n − 1) rather than just two, those reductions are still too weak to characterize privacy. On the other hand, we show that increasing the number of sets k does give some extra characterization power.

This paper considers UFAs over a one-letter alphabet, and determines the exact number of states in DFAs needed to represent unary languages recognized by n-state UFAs in terms of a new number-theoretic function g@?. The growth rate of g@?(n), and therefore of the UFA-DFA tradeoff, is estimated as e^@Q^(^n^l^n^^^2^n^3^). The conversion of an n-state unary NFA to a UFA requires UFAs with g(n)+O(n^2)=e^(^1^+^o^(^1^)^)^n^l^n^n states, where g(n) is the greatest order of a permutation of n elements, known as Landau@?s function. In addition, it is shown that representing the complement of n-state unary UFAs requires UFAs with at least n^2^-^o^(^1^) states in the worst case, while the Kleene star requires up to exactly (n-1)^2+1 states.	automata theory;finite-state machine;unambiguous finite automaton;unary operation	Alexander Okhotin	2012	Inf.

28d595d480f786a7e7c9806b07569e9e6e379d31	decidability of right one-way jumping finite automata		We continue our investigation [S. Beier, M. Holzer: Properties of right one-way jumping finite automata. In Proc. 20th DCFS, number 10952 in LNCS, 2018] on (right) one-way jumping finite automata (ROWJFA), a variant of jumping automata, which is an automaton model for discontinuous information processing. Here we focus on decision problems for ROWJFAs. It turns out that most problems such as, e.g., emptiness, finiteness, universality, the word problem and variants thereof, closure under permutation, etc., are decidable. Moreover, we show that the containment of a language within the strict hierarchy of ROWJFA permutation closed languages induced by the number of accepting states as well as whether permutation closed regular or jumping finite automata languages can be accepted by ROWJFAs is decidable, too. On the other hand, we prove that for (linear) context-free languages the corresponding ROWJFA acceptance problem becomes undecidable. Moreover, we also discuss some complexity results for the considered decision problems.	automata theory;finite-state machine	Simon Beier;Markus Holzer	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-98654-8_9	discrete mathematics;permutation;jumping;combinatorics;finite-state machine;undecidable problem;decision problem;information processing;word problem (mathematics education);decidability;computer science	Theory	-0.6477942237930415	21.64168955998812	168022

DTAs are usually sparser than string automata, as most transitions are undefined and therefore, special care must be taken in order to minimize them efficiently. However, it is difficult to find simple and detailed descriptions of the minimization procedure in the published literature. Here, we fully describe a simple implementation of the standard minimization algorithm that needs a time in O(|A|), with |A| being the size of the DTA.	algorithm;data structure;digital television adapter;tree automaton;undefined behavior	Rafael C.

While the theoretical complexities of these alg orithms are known, there has not been a systematic empirical comparison betwee n th m. In this work we propose a probabilistic framework for testing the perfor mance of automatatheoretic algorithms. We conduct a direct experimental com parison between Hopcroft’s and Brzozowski’s algorithms. We show that while Hop croft’s algorithm has better overall performance, Brzozowski’s algorithm pe rforms better for “highdensity” NFA. We also consider the universality problem, wh ich is traditionally solved explicitly via the subset construction. We propose a n ncoding that allows this problem to be solved symbolically via a model-checker. We compare the performance of this approach to that of the standard explicit al gorithm, and show that the explicit approach performs significantly better.	dijkstra's algorithm;direction finding;explicit parallelism;hop;i/o controller hub;model checking;nondeterministic finite automaton;powerset construction;universal turing machine	Deian Tabakov;Moshe Y.

However, these climate control systems consume a significant amount of energy due to an inefficient control algorithm. Improving energy efficiency is critical to reducing energy consumption, costs, and the emissions of greenhouse gases. In this paper, we present INPRESS: Indoor Climate Prediction and Evaluation System for Energy Efficiency using Sensor Networks. INPRESS uses meteorological weather data and the indoor climate conditions collected by sensor nodes to evaluate and improve the energy efficient climate control of an indoor space.	algorithm;climate model;control system	Jae Yoon Chong;Jinwook Baek;Sukun Kim	2011		10.1145/2070942.2070980	embedded system;control system;efficient energy use	Mobile	2.670422522106571	29.809994400570314	168838

Moreover, the component grammars of the system have a limited number of productions. The result demonstrates that context-free returning parallel communicating grammar systems are economical tools for language generation.	context-free language;grammar systems theory	Erzsébet Csuhaj-Varjú	2001			computer science;theoretical computer science;programming language;communication	Theory	-1.3190861629357673	20.054445136493733	169112

This paper examines the generating power of a simple extension of the well studied node-label controlled graph grammars. We show that the extension, called  handle NLC grammars , gives the ability to generate any recursively enumerable graph language. The proof proceeds in three steps. First we show how a handle NLC grammar can simulate a phrase-structure string grammar, where the strings that the phrase-structure grammar works on are considered to be graphs of a special form. Then we demonstrate a way of encoding graphs as strings. The final step shows how a handle NLC grammar can convert a string encoding of a graph into the graph itself.	natural language processing	Michael G. Main;Grzegorz Rozenberg	1987	J. Comput. Syst.

For deterministic jump pushdown store acceptors operating with finite delay, $n + 1$ types of pushdown store symbols are more powerful than n types of pushdown store symbols. As a consequence, it can be shown that the family of deterministic context-free languages does not form a principal AFDL.	deterministic context-free language;personal digital assistant	Sheila A.

9fb402e714f43e275fce2f772439ff8b39942a93	primitive words and roots of words	coding theory;computational complexity;automata theory;difference set;formal language	In the algebraic theory of codes and formal languages, the set Q of all primitive words over some alphabet Σ has received special interest. With this survey article we give an overview about relevant research to this topic during the last twenty years including own investigations and some new results. In Section 1 after recalling the most important notions from formal language theory we illustrate the connection between coding theory and primitive words by some facts. We define primitive words as words having only a trivial representation as the power of another word. Nonprimitive words (without the empty word) are exactly the periodic words. Every nonempty word is a power of an uniquely determined primitive word which is called the root of the former one. The set of all roots of nonempty words of a language is called the root of the language. The primitive words have interesting combinatorial properties which we consider in Section 2. In Section 3 we investigate the relationship between the set Q of all primitive words over some fixed alphabet and the language classes of the Chomsky Hierarchy and the contextual languages over the same alphabet. The computational complexity of the set Q and of the roots of languages are considered in Section 4. The set of all powers of the same degree of all words from a language is the power of this language. We examine the powers of languages for different sets of exponents, and especially their regularity and context-freeness, in Section 5, and the decidability of appropriate questions in Section 6. Section 7 is dedicated to several generalizations of the notions of periodicity and primitivity of words.

Many DNA computation models use operations based on annealing and magnetic-beads separation which sometimes produce undesirable results. Some models use reliable operations only but their computational power is too weak. The purpose of this paper is to find a good trade-off between the robustness of DNA operations and their computational power. We present a robust DNA computation model that can solve computationally hard problems. We prove that (i) this model can solve PSPACE-complete problems, and (ii) any computational problem that can be solved with this model is in PSPACE.	model of computation	Evgeny Dantsin;Alexander Wolpert	2003	Int.

The research on this problem is motivated by the growing interest to methods of estimation of quality of software systems - a user language is a part of such system, and its reliability towards syntactic errors is a feature of its quality. We analyse the computational complexity of recognizing one type of such fault tolerance towards a fixed number of errors: a language is fault-tolerant iff any set of replacements of characters within the fixed number in any string in the language produces a string not in the language; a grammar defining the language produces a string not in the language; a grammar defining the language (the syntax) is supposed to be given as input	fault tolerance	Anatol Slissenko	1993	Theor.

The present article provides a practical efficient way to compute this intersection by converting the grammar into a special finite-state automaton (the GLR(0)-automaton) which is subsequently intersected with the given finite-state automaton. As a byproduct, we present a generalisation of Tomita’s algorithm to recognize several inputs simultaneously.	algorithm;automata theory;automaton;context-free grammar;context-free language;cubic function;finite-state machine;language model;parsing;powerset construction;regular language	Thomas Hanneforth	2011			powerset construction;block cellular automaton;nested stack automaton;büchi automaton;nondeterministic finite automaton;theoretical computer science;two-way deterministic finite automaton;probabilistic automaton;continuous automaton;deterministic automaton;context-free language;mobile automaton;timed automaton;pushdown automaton;embedded pushdown automaton;algorithm	NLP	-1.7220111327830103	20.578575143387667	171123

The algorithm can be used, for example, to compile Shor's algorithm, which uses rotations of π/2 k , into an efficient fault-tolerant form using only Hadamard, controlled-not, and π/8 gates. The algorithm runs in O(log 2.71 (1/ǫ)) time, and produces as output a sequence of O(log 3.97 (1/ǫ)) quantum gates which is guaranteed to approximate the desired quantum gate to an accuracy within ǫ > 0. We also explain how the algorithm can be generalized to apply to multi-qubit gates and to gates from SU (d).	approximation algorithm;compiler;computation;computer;fault tolerance;quantum algorithm;quantum computing;quantum gate;qubit;shor's algorithm;solovay–strassen primality test	Christopher M.

58195a8ce1b49731bf947967d082fa9bd3531b5f	efficient, concurrent bayesian analysis of full waveform ladar data	thesis	Bayesian analysis of full waveform laser detection and ranging (LaDAR) signals using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithms have shown higher estimation accuracy, resolution and sensitivity to detect weak signatures for 3D surface profiling, and construct multiple layer images with varying number of surface returns. However, it is computational expensive. Although parallel computing has the potential to reduce both the processing time and the requirement for persistent memory storage, parallelizing the serial sampling procedure in RJMCMC is a significant challenge in both statistical and computing domains. While several strategies have been developed for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parallelization, these are usually restricted to fixed dimensional parameter estimates, and not obviously applicable to RJMCMC for varying dimensional signal analysis. In the statistical domain, we propose an effective, concurrent RJMCMC algorithm, state space decomposition RJMCMC (SSD-RJMCMC), which divides the entire state space into groups and assign to each an independent RJMCMC chain with restricted variation of model dimensions. It intrinsically has a parallel structure, a form of model-level parallelization. Applying the convergence diagnostic, we can adaptively assess the convergence of the Markov chain on-the-fly and so dynamically terminate the chain generation. Evaluations on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the concurrent chains have shorter convergence length and hence improved sampling efficiency. Parallel exploration of the candidate models, in conjunction with an error detection and correction scheme, improves the reliability of surface detection. By adaptively generating a complimentary MCMC sequence for the determined model, it enhances the accuracy for surface profiling. In the computing domain, we develop a data parallel SSD-RJMCMC (DP SSD-RJMCMC) to achieve efficient parallel implementation on a distributed computer cluster. Adding data-level parallelization on top of the model-level parallelization, it formalizes a task queue and introduces an automatic scheduler for dynamic task allocation. These two strategies successfully diminish the load imbalance that occurred in SSD-RJMCMC. Thanks to the coarse granularity, the processors communicate at a very low frequency. The MPIbased implementation on a Beowulf cluster demonstrates that compared with RJMCMC, DP SSD-RJMCMC has further reduced problem size and computation complexity. Therefore, it can achieve a super linear speedup if the number of data segments and processors are chosen wisely.

88c294cfbd80405c8a1872d793b3bcd0be5ce193	new bounds for energy complexity of boolean functions		For a Boolean function f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} computed by a circuit C over a finite basis B, the energy complexity of C (denoted by ECB(C)) is the maximum over all inputs {0, 1}n the numbers of gates of the circuit C (excluding the inputs) that output a one. Energy Complexity of a Boolean function over a finite basis B denoted by ECB( f ) def = minC ECB(C) where C is a circuit over B computing f . We study the case when B = {∧2,∨2,¬}, the standard Boolean basis. It is known that any Boolean function can be computed by a circuit (with potentially large size) with an energy of at most 3n(1+ e(n)) for a small e(n)(which we observe is improvable to 3n− 1). We show several new results and connections between energy complexity and other well-studied parameters of Boolean functions. • For all Boolean functions f , EC( f ) ≤ O(DT( f )3) where DT( f ) is the optimal decision tree depth of f . • We define a parameter positive sensitivity (denoted by psens), a quantity that is smaller than sensitivity [4] and defined in a similar way, and show that for any Boolean circuit C computing a Boolean function f , EC(C) ≥ psens( f )/3. • For a monotone function f , we show that EC( f ) = Ω(KW( f )) where KW( f ) is the cost of monotone Karchmer-Wigderson game of f . • Restricting the above notion of energy complexity to Boolean formulas, we show EC(F) = Ω (√ L(F)−Depth(F) ) where L(F) is the size and Depth(F) is the depth of a formula F.	boolean circuit;decision tree;monotone	Krishnamoorthy Dinesh;Samir Otiv;Jayalal Sarma	2018	Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC)	10.1007/978-3-319-94776-1_61	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;boolean function;mathematics;boolean circuit	Theory	8.895954007261953	22.73968491180956	171908

Compression can reduce disk and transfer costs, and, in the case of external sorts, cut merge costs by reducing the number of runs. It is therefore plausible that overall costs of external sorting could be reduced through use of compression. In this paper, we propose new compression techniques for data consisting of sets of records. The best of these techniques, based on building a trie of variable-length common strings, provides fast compression and decompression and allows random access to individual records. We show experimentally that our trie-based compression leads to significant reduction in sorting costs; that is, it is faster to compress the data, sort it, and then decompress it than to sort the uncompressed data. While the degree of compression is not quite as great as can be obtained with adaptive techniques such as Lempel-Ziv methods, these cannot be applied to sorting. Our experiments show that, in comparison to approaches such as Huffman coding of fixed-length substrings, our novel trie-based method is faster and provides greater size reductions.	best, worst and average case;cpu cache;central processing unit;code;data compression;disk space;experiment;external sorting;general-purpose modeling;huffman coding;in-memory database;lempel–ziv–welch;merge sort;random access;read-only memory;requirement;semiconductor industry;sorting algorithm;substring;ternary search tree;the australian;trie	John Yiannis;Justin Zobel	2006	The VLDB Journal	10.1007/s00778-006-0005-2	adaptive sort;synchronization;parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;external sorting;sorting algorithm;database;algorithm;huffman coding	DB	9.202719576735912	29.092573331355673	172235

Because the R-way branching program is such a powerful model, these time-space product tradeoffs also apply to all models of sequential computation that have a fair measure of space such as off-line multitape Turing machines and off-line log-cost random access machines (RAMs).	space–time tradeoff	Paul Beame	1991	SIAM J.

We show that, starting from a function f : {0, 1} → {0, 1} that is mildly hard on average, i.e. every circuit of size 2 fails to compute f on at least a 1/poly(l) fraction of inputs, we can build a PRG : {0, 1} n) → {0, 1} computable in ATIME (O(1), log n) = alternating time O(log n) with O(1) alternations. Such a PRG implies BP · AC0 = AC0 under DLOGTIME -uniformity. On the negative side, we prove a tight lower bound on black-box PRG constructions that are based on worst-case hard functions. We also prove a tight lower bound on blackbox worst-case hardness amplification, which is the problem of producing an average-case hard function starting from a worst-case hard one. These lower bounds are obtained by showing that constant depth circuits cannot compute extractors and list-decodable codes.	ac0;best, worst and average case;black box;boolean algebra;code;computable function;computational hardness assumption;dlogtime;post/redirect/get;programming research group;pseudorandom generator;pseudorandomness;randomness	Emanuele Viola	2003		10.1109/CCC.2003.1214410	list decoding;circuit complexity;analog computer;electronic circuit;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;voting;computer science;probability;mathematics;pseudorandom generator;computability;upper and lower bounds;computational complexity theory;computable function;algorithm;polynomial;set theory	Theory	9.503327147772987	22.261503305693545	172572

This paper is a step forward in this direction analysing a number of key issues related to bit model design and implementation of search problems. Building efficient search algorithms optimized at bit level is a difficult task It requires not only a good implementation but also an adequate model so as to make bitwise operations meaningful, and only by addressing design and implementation globally an improvement in efficiency can be obtained. On the other hand, we have proved in this paper that the improvement can conceivably be exponential on the size of the CPU register for problems in NP. This global approach has been used to implement the fastest complete algorithm, to the best of our knowledge, for the maximum clique problem, an important NP-hard combinatorial problem from the graph domain. Our solver clearly outperforms other existing algorithms for hard instances, in some cases by nearly an order of magnitude.	bit-level parallelism;bitwise operation;central processing unit;clique (graph theory);clique problem;fastest;mathematical optimization;np (complexity);np-hardness;processor register;search algorithm;solver;time complexity	Pablo San Segundo;Diego Rodríguez-Losada;Ramón Galán;Fernando Matía;Agustín Jiménez	2007	19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence(ICTAI 2007)	10.1109/ICTAI.2007.40	phase transition;computer science;theoretical computer science;answer set programming;machine learning;mathematics;computability;algorithm;local consistency	Robotics	6.8122235255828825	27.909521335377413	172992

Both are studied here regarding their computational complexity of linear CNF formulas. We prove that both variants remain NP-complete for (monotone) linear formulas yielding the conclusion that also bicolorability of linear hypergraphs is NP-complete. The reduction used gives rise to the complexity investigation of both variants for several monotone linear subclasses that are parameterized by the size of clauses or by the number of occurrences of variables. In particular cases of these parameter values we are able to verify the NP-completeness of XSAT respectively NAE-SAT; though we cannot provide a complete treatment. Finally we focus on exact linear formulas where clauses intersect pairwise, and for which SAT is known to be polynomial-time solvable [1]. We verify the same assertion for NAE-SAT relying on a result in [2]; whereas we obtain NP-completeness for XSAT of exact linear formulas. The case of uniform clause size k remains open for the latter problem. However, we can provide its polynomial-time behavior for k at most 6.	assertion (software development);boolean satisfiability problem;computational complexity theory;conjunctive normal form;decision problem;np-completeness;time complexity;monotone	Stefan Porschen;Tatjana Schmidt;Ewald Speckenmeyer;Andreas Wotzlaw	2014	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2013.10.030	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;counting problem;mathematics;algorithm	AI	8.443768433447598	18.659135641923353	173201
bc8a2b5a53ddeb06518dbb2e30e181e52cabba64	spiking neural p systems with a generalized use of rules		Spiking neural P systems (SN P systems) are a class of distributed parallel computing devices inspired by spiking neurons, where the spiking rules are usually used in a sequential way (an applicable rule is applied one time at a step) or an exhaustive way (an applicable rule is applied as many times as possible at a step). In this letter, we consider a generalized way of using spiking rules by “combining” the sequential way and the exhaustive way: if a rule is used at some step, then at that step, it can be applied any possible number of times, nondeterministically chosen. The computational power of SN P systems with a generalized use of rules is investigated. Specifically, we prove that SN P systems with a generalized use of rules consisting of one neuron can characterize finite sets of numbers. If the systems consist of two neurons, then the computational power of such systems can be greatly improved, but not beyond generating semilinear sets of numbers. SN P systems with a generalized use of rules consisting of three neurons are proved to generate at least a non-semilinear set of numbers. In the case of allowing enough neurons, SN P systems with a generalized use of rules are computationally complete. These results show that the number of neurons is crucial for SN P systems with a generalized use of rules to achieve a desired computational power.	commutation theorem;computation (action);inspiration function;neuron;neurons;p system;parallel computing;rule (guideline);one time	Xingyi Zhang;Bangju Wang;Linqiang Pan	2014	Neural Computation	10.1162/NECO_a_00665	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm	ML	1.856808975675538	24.784294957969475	173206

We use this template to construct pseudorandom generators for combinatorial rectangles and read-once CNFs and a hitting set generator for width-3 branching programs, all of which achieve near-optimal seed-length even in the low-error regime: We get seed-length Õ(log (n/ε)) for error ε. Previously, only constructions with seed-length O(log3/2 n) or O(log2 n) were known for these classes with error ε = 1/poly(n). The (pseudo)random restrictions we use are milder than those typically used for proving circuit lower bounds in that we only set a constant fraction of the bits at a time. While such restrictions do not simplify the functions drastically, we show that they can be derandomized using small-bias spaces.	circuit complexity;iterative method;pseudorandom generator;pseudorandomness;randomized algorithm;set cover problem;small-bias sample space	Parikshit Gopalan;Raghu Meka;Omer Reingold;Luca Trevisan;Salil P.

Recently, Pǎtraşcu proposed an exciting new approach for breaking this barrier via a two player communication model in which one player gets private advice at the beginning of the protocol. He gave reductions from the problem of solving an asymmetric version of set-disjointness in his model to a diverse collection of natural dynamic data structure problems in the cell probe model. He also conjectured that, for any hard problem in the standard two-party communication model, the asymmetric version of the problem is hard in his model, provided not too much advice is given. In this paper, we prove several surprising results about his model. We show that there exist Boolean functions requiring linear randomized communication complexity in the two-party model, for which the asymmetric versions in his model have deterministic protocols with exponentially smaller complexity. For setdisjointness, which also requires linear randomized communication complexity in the two-party model, we give a deterministic protocol for the asymmetric version in his model with a quadratic improvement in complexity. These results demonstrate that Pǎtraşcu’s conjecture, as stated, is false. In addition, we show that the randomized and deterministic communication complexities of problems in his model differ by no more than a logarithmic multiplicative factor. We also prove lower bounds in some restricted versions of this model for natural functions such as setdisjointness and inner product.

In our first approximation, we simulate biological processes related with cellular signaling and their implications in the metabolism, by using an architecture based on NEP (NEP architecture) and their specializations: Networks of Polarized Evolutionary Processors (NPEP) [1] and NEP Transducers (NEPT) [3]. In particular, we use this architecture to simulate the interplay between cellular processes related with the metabolism as the Krebs cycle and the malate-aspartate shuttle pathway (MAS) both being altered by signaling by calcium. NEP is complete and efficient from the computational point of view (i.e. is able to solve hard problems NP complete given linear time solutions). This model consists of several processors, each of one is placed in a node of a virtual graph. Each processor acts on local data in accordance with some predefined rules (evolutionary operations simulating point mutations of nucleotides over DNA sequences) and communicates the results using a filtering strategy. This strategy may require satisfy some conditions that are imposed by processors, when sending, receiving or both. The processors can communicate the resulting data with the rest of the processors connected with it. A processor node can be viewed as a cell that carries out only one specific evolutionary operation (substitution, elimination or insertion). NEPT uses these operations in order to generate recursively enumerable languages recognized by other NEP (without filtering strategy). On the other hand, NPEP uses these operations together with a valuation mapping (from strings to integers) to generate strings labeled with an electrical polarization. Each node has their own polarization, then the filtering strategy consists in let pass those strings with their same polarization.	copasi;cell signaling;central processing unit;computation;computational model;gene regulatory network;np-completeness;noise-equivalent power;order of approximation;point of view (computer hardware company);polarization (waves);recursively enumerable language;recursively enumerable set;simulation;string generation;time complexity;transducer;value (ethics)	Sandra Gómez Canaval;José-Ramón Sánchez-Couso;Fernando Arroyo	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39074-6_28	simulation;bioinformatics;engineering;artificial intelligence	Theory	1.7038096566914576	24.74783694214857	173552

By using boolean functions called switch settings, these switches can be put in a fixed direction to obtain an ordinary graph. For many problems, switching graphs are a remarkable straightforward and natural model, but they have hardly been studied. We study the complexity of several natural questions in switching graphs of which some are polynomial, and others are NP-complete. We started investigating switching graphs because they turned out to be a natural framework for studying the problem of solving Boolean equation systems, which is equivalent to model checking of the modal μ-calculus and deciding the winner in parity games. We give direct, polynomial encodings of Boolean equation systems in switching graphs and vice versa, and prove correctness of the encodings.	algorithm;backtracking;boolean algebra;co-np;connected component (graph theory);correctness (computer science);decision problem;directed graph;emoticon;euler;eulerian path;flow network;graph (discrete mathematics);karp's 21 np-complete problems;modal logic;modal μ-calculus;model checking;np-completeness;network switch;planar (computer graphics);polynomial;random graph;strongly connected component;topological sorting;turing completeness;vertex (graph theory)	Jan Friso Groote;Bas Ploeger	2008	Electr.

A huge number of community extraction methods have been proposed in the literature. In this paper we apply the k-dense algorithm as it represents a very interesting compromise between computational efficiency and precision. The paper provides two innovative contributions. The first is the application of the k-dense method to the Internet AS-level topology graph - obtained from the CAIDA, DIMES and IRL datasets - to identify well-connected communities and to analyze how these are connected to the rest of the graph. The second contribution relates to the study of the most well-connected communities with the support of two additional datasets: a geographical dataset (which lists, for each AS, the countries in which it has at least one geographical location) and the Internet eXchange Point dataset (which maintains, for each IXP, its geographical position and the list of its participants). We found that the k-max-dense community holds a central position in the Internet AS-level topology graph structure since its 101 ASes (less than the 0.3% of Internet ASes) are involved in more than 39% of all Internet connections. We also found that those ASes are connected to at least one IXP and have at least one geographical location in Europe (only 70.3% of them have at least one additional geographical location outside Europe).	algorithm;autonomous system (internet);computation;dimes;internet;location (geography);san diego supercomputer center	Enrico Gregori;Luciano Lenzini;Chiara Orsini	2011	2011 Third International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS 2011)	10.1016/j.comnet.2012.09.011	the internet;telecommunications;computer science;world wide web;internet exchange point;social network	Metrics	-0.7966521694757479	28.40999604643566	174429
9ce23241e12b92c7efc61504b6331d521695c1bb	relations between communication complexity classes	communication complexity	Abstract   We study the complexity of communication between two processors in terms of complexity classes as introduced by Babai, Frankl, and Simon ( in  “Proceedings, 27th Annu. IEEE Sympos. on Found. of Comput. Sci., 1986,” pp. 337–347). They showed some analogies between Turing machine (TM) classes like   P, NP  ,  Σ   k   etc. and the corresponding communication complexity classes which we denote by C-  P  , C-  NP  , C- Σ   k   etc. This paper continues these investigations, in particular, the Boolean hierarchy C-  BH   and probabilistic classes are considered. We enlarge this correspondence by showing that C- Σ   k +1  can also be characterized by a C-  NP  -protocol that uses only one question to a C- Σ   k  -oracle. For the probabilistic class C-  PP   it suffices to consider probabilistic protocols with moderately bounded error, this solves an open problem suggested in op. cit. In contrast to the case of TM complexity, we are able to show some proper inclusions like C-  BH   ∪ C-  BPP   ⊂ C- Σ  2  ∩ C- π  2  ν C-  PP   and C-  PP   ⊂ C-  P   c-#   P   . The nonuniformity of communication protocols allows us to show that the Boolean communication hierarchy does not collapse.	communication complexity;complexity class	Bernd Halstenberg;Rüdiger Reischuk	1990	J.

db66c6a297d6969179717d5ba1891ada15a73eef	matthan: drone presence detection by identifying physical signatures in the drone's rf communication		Drones are increasingly flying in sensitive airspace where their presence may cause harm, such as near airports, forest fires, large crowded events, secure buildings, and even jails. This problem is likely to expand given the rapid proliferation of drones for commerce, monitoring, recreation, and other applications. A cost-effective detection system is needed to warn of the presence of drones in such cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of inexpensive RF-based detection of the presence of drones. We examine whether physical characteristics of the drone, such as body vibration and body shifting, can be detected in the wireless signal transmitted by drones during communication. We consider whether the received drone signals are uniquely differentiated from other mobile wireless phenomena such as cars equipped with Wi- Fi or humans carrying a mobile phone. The sensitivity of detection at distances of hundreds of meters as well as the accuracy of the overall detection system are evaluated using software defined radio (SDR) implementation.	etsi satellite digital radio;mobile phone;radio frequency;signature;unmanned aerial vehicle	Phuc Nguyen;Anh-Hoang Truong;Mahesh Ravindranathan;Anh Tuan Le Nguyen;Richard Han;Tam Vu	2017		10.1145/3081333.3081354	airspace class;embedded system;mobile phone;wireless;computer science;software-defined radio;computer security;drone	Mobile	-2.029845039143957	29.89905671510224	175394

The subexponential-time solvability of any of these problems implies the failure of the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). In this paper, we extend the framework of Impagliazzo et al., and identify a larger set of problems that are equivalent to kCNF-Sat modulo serf-reducibility. We propose a complexity class, referred to as Linear Monadic NP, that consists of all problems expressible in existential monadic second order logic whose expressions have a linear measure in terms of a complexity parameter, which is usually the universe size of the problem. This research direction can be traced back to Fagin’s celebrated theorem stating that NP coincides with the class of problems expressible in existential second order logic. Monadic NP, a well-studied class in the literature, is the restriction of the aforementioned logic fragment to existential monadic second order logic. The proposed class Linear Monadic NP is then the restriction of Monadic NP to problems whose expressions have linear measure in the complexity parameter. We show that Linear Monadic NP includes many natural complete problems such as the satisfiability of linear-size circuits, dominating set, independent dominating set, and perfect code. Therefore, for any of these problems, its subexponential-time solvability is equivalent to the failure of ETH. We prove, using logic games, that the aforementioned problems are inexpressible in the monadic fragment of SNP, and hence, are not captured by the framework of Impagliazzo et al. Finally, we show that Feedback Vertex Set is inexpressible in existential monadic second order logic, and hence is not in Linear Monadic NP, and investigate the existence of certain reductions between Feedback Vertex Set (and variants of it) and 3-CNF-Sat. 1998 ACM Subject Classification F.2.0 Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complexity, F.1.3 Complexity Measures and Classes, F.4.1 Mathematical Logic	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;complexity class;conjunctive normal form;dominating set;exptime;existential quantification;exponential time hypothesis;feedback vertex set;hamming bound;independent set (graph theory);modulo operation;time complexity	Robert Ganian;Ronald de Haan;Iyad A.

SkipMard provides a prefix matching resource routing algorithm to resolve multi-attribute queries, and introduces the concepts of """"layer"""" and """"crossing layer nearest neighbor"""" into the data structure. To decrease message passing numbers, an approximate closest-point method is addressed that can help routing a searching key to a node with a key value that has the minimum distance between two keys. Each node has O(m*l) neighbors for total m layers and I levels in SkipMard.

Coupled biological oscillators may synchronise, as emerging behaviour, after a period of time in which they interact through physical or chemical means. We introduce a parametric semantics for their interaction that is general enough to capture the behaviour of different types of oscillators. We instantiate it both to the Kuramoto model, a model of synchronisation based on smooth interaction, and to the Peskin model of pacemaker cells in the heart, a model of synchronisation based on pulse interaction. We also introduce a logic, Biological Oscillators Synchronisation Logic (BOSL), that is able to describe collective synchronisation properties of a population of coupled oscillators. A model checking algorithm is proposed for the defined logic and it is implemented in a model checker. The model checker can be used to detect synchronisation properties of a given population of oscillators. This tool might be the basic step towards the generation of suitable techniques to control and regulate the behaviour of coupled oscillators in order to ensure the reachability of synchronisation.	algorithm;artificial cardiac pacemaker;automata theory;kuramoto model;model checking;reachability;sensor;timed automaton	Ezio Bartocci;Flavio Corradini;Emanuela Merelli;Luca Tesei	2010	Theor.

c2ab217eeba7b5099a7728cf11b69aed7dda7ca7	lattice-based zero-knowledge arguments for integer relations		We provide lattice-based protocols allowing to prove relations among committed integers. While the most general zero-knowledge proof techniques can handle arithmetic circuits in the lattice setting, adapting them to prove statements over the integers is non-trivial, at least if we want to handle exponentially large integers while working with a polynomialsize modulus q. For a polynomial L, we provide zero-knowledge arguments allowing a prover to convince a verifier that committed L-bit bitstrings x, y and z are the binary representations of integers X, Y and Z satisfying Z = X + Y over Z. The complexity of our arguments is only linear in L. Using them, we construct arguments allowing to prove inequalities X < Z among committed integers, as well as arguments showing that a committed X belongs to a public interval [α, β], where α and β can be arbitrarily large. Our range arguments have logarithmic cost (i.e., linear in L) in the maximal range magnitude. Using these tools, we obtain zero-knowledge arguments showing that a committed element X does not belong to a public set S using Õ(n · log |S|) bits of communication, where n is the security parameter. We finally give a protocol allowing to argue that committed L-bit integers X, Y and Z satisfy multiplicative relations Z = XY over the integers, with communication cost subquadratic in L. To this end, we use our protocol for integer addition to prove the correct recursive execution of Karatsuba’s multiplication algorithm. The security of our protocols relies on standard lattice assumptions with polynomial modulus and polynomial approximation factor.	approximation;classical xy model;maximal set;modulus of continuity;multiplication algorithm;polynomial;recursion;security parameter;zero-knowledge proof	Benoît Libert;San Ling;Khoa Nguyen;Huaxiong Wang	2018	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-319-96881-0_24	discrete mathematics;inequality;modulus;computer science;multiplicative function;security parameter;lattice (order);polynomial;integer;karatsuba algorithm	Crypto	8.04369890776416	25.753688570789997	176699

Engelfriet and Hoogeboom (2001) studied two-way finite state string-to-string transducers and showed that their expressiveness matches MSO-definable transformations (MSOT). Alur and 'ern' (2011) presented streaming transducers-one-way transducers equipped with multiple registers that can store output strings, as an equi-expressive model. Natural generalizations of streaming transducers to string-to-tree (Alur and D'Antoni, 2012) and infinite-string-to-string (Alur, Filiot, and Trivedi, 2012) cases preserve MSO-expressiveness. While earlier reductions from MSOT to streaming transducers used two-way transducers as the intermediate model, we revisit the earlier reductions in a more general, and previously unexplored, setting of infinite-string-to-tree transformations, and provide a direct reduction. Proof techniques used for this new reduction exploit the conceptual tools (composition theorem and finite additive coloring theorem) presented by Shelah (1975) in his alternative proof of Büchi's theorem. Using such streaming string-to-tree transducers we show the decidability of functional equivalence for MSO-definable infinite-string-to-tree transducers.	executable;graph coloring;graph rewriting;multispectral optoacoustic tomography;one-way function;streaming media;transducer;turing completeness;utility functions on indivisible goods	Rajeev Alur;Antoine Durand-Gasselin;Ashutosh Trivedi	2013	2013 28th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science	10.1109/LICS.2013.52	decidability;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;transducer;food additive;computer science;mathematics;automaton;automated theorem proving;processor register;finite-state machine;computational model;algorithm;cost accounting;string searching algorithm	Logic	-4.390840721466324	21.660511421682052	176937
09f449d41632b2aa1d77acf18dfa3a0a6a3d2c8d	a note on uniform circuit lower bounds for the counting hierarchy (extended abstract)	lower bound	A very recent paper by Caussinus, McKenzie, Thérien, and Vollmer [CMTV95] shows that ACC0 is properly contained in ModPH, and TC0 is properly contained in the counting hierarchy. Thus, [CMTV95] shows that there are problems in ModPH that require superpolynomialsize uniform ACC0 circuits, and problems in the counting hierarchy that require superpolynomial-size uniform TC0 circuits. The proof in [CMTV95] uses leaf languages as a tool in obtaining their separations, and their proof does not immediately yield larger lower bounds for the complexity of these problems. In this paper, we give a simple direct proof of these same separations, and use it to provide sub-subexponential size lower bounds on the size of uniform circuits for these problems.	circuit complexity	Eric Allender	1996		10.1007/3-540-61332-3_145	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;upper and lower bounds	Theory	9.123141597581373	21.323407146528204	176955
33ad799fedfcbd7f311ca13421f8e46cb6bba405	a wireless spectrum analyzer in your pocket	spectrum sensing;smartphone;crowdsourcing;tv whitespaces	We propose Snoopy, a system that can translate one's mobile phone or tablet into a low-cost, yet effective RF spectrum analyzer. Since typical spectrum analyzers are specialized hardware that is both expensive to acquire and cumbersome to carry around, they are rarely available for quick-and-easy spectrum sensing while on the go. To address this challenge, Snoopy augments popular mobile devices with a small attachable hardware unit (RF frequency translator) that can provide a reasonable view of the wireless spectrum across different frequency bands. It achieves this by leveraging the spectral scan functionality available in certain 802.11 NICs (e.g., the Atheros 9280 family of chipsets), which provides an unique lens towards the WiFi spectrum (2.4 GHz). Through the use of suitable frequency translators, such a view can be flexibly shifted to other spectrum bands. Although such a construction might not match the precision of the most sophisticated but expensive spectrum analyzers, we show that by leveraging some carefully designed spectral features, Snoopy can achieve decent accuracy in determining TV whitespaces (512 -- 698 MHz) -- it can detect primary signals at up to - 90dBm with an error rate of <15%, while achieving a median error of < 4dB in estimating the power of these signals. These promising results suggest that Snoopy is an intriguing option in bringing the ability of spectrum sensing to the masses, thereby truly enabling crowdsourcing options in this domain.	chipset;crowdsourcing;frequency band;mobile device;mobile phone;rf modulator;radio frequency;spectrum analyzer;tablet computer;usb on-the-go	Tan Zhang;Ashish Patro;Ning Leng;Suman Banerjee	2015		10.1145/2699343.2699353	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	-1.9235478888723083	29.795898354103915	177137

The paradigmatic example is the median filter. An elaborated rank order processor admits constants as operands and preliminary operations on input variables (e.g., negation) such that the processor is also implementable in bitserial, most significant bit leading, terms. Here the theory for the special elaborated case, where the constant 0 and the operation negation are admitted, and a realization in k i t e autoregressive form exists, is motivated, and developed. Input/output relations are expressible with a finite state sequential machine with ternary inputs and outputs; that machine is only a mathematical construct and need not represent an actual device. The question of root signals is examined theoretically and by example. An example showing a bandpass effect is presented, and computer programs for doing the relevant calculations pertaining to finite automata and simulaticm are offered. A part of a theory for general elaboration is also presented.	automata theory;autoregressive model;central processing unit;computer program;finite-state machine;input/output;maxima and minima;median filter;most significant bit;operand;serial communication	Arthur R.

05f66a4459903b08209bfa0e3250795baf298a84	on almost cylindrical languages and the decidability of the d0l and pwd0l primitivity problems	formal language	Primitive words and their properties have always been of fundamental importance in the study of formal language theory. Head and Lando in Periodic DOL Languages proposed the idea of deciding whether or not a given DOL language has the property that every word in it is a primitive word. After reducing the general problem to the case in which h is injective, it will be shown that primitivity is decidable when ((A)h)* is an almost cylindrical set. Moreover, in this case, it is shown that the set of words which generate primitive sequences (given a particular DOL scheme) is an algorithmically constructible context-sensitive language. An undecidability result for the PWDOL primitivity problem and decidability results for cases of the RWDOL primitivity problem are also given.	a* search algorithm;code;context-sensitive language;formal language	John Harrison	1996	Theor.

An algorithm is given to decide whether the monoid presented by a confluent monadic finite rewriting system is `ror r`-automatic. Should such a monoid be `ror r`-automatic, the rewriting system’s language of normal form words forms part of such an automatic structure.

836f1fdc8706916965be779d6cae288097ca93dd	parallel algorithm for core maintenance in dynamic graphs		This paper initiates the studies of parallel algorithm for core maintenance in dynamic graphs. The core number is a fundamental index reflecting the cohesiveness of a graph, which is widely used in large-scale graph analytics. We investigate the parallelism in the core update process when multiple edges and vertices are inserted. Specifically, we discover a structure called superior edge set, the insertion of edges in which can be processed in parallel. Based on the structure of superior edge set, an efficient parallel algorithm is then devised. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first parallel one for the fundamental core maintenance problem. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on different types of real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results illustrate the efficiency, stability and scalability of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm shows a significant speedup in the processing time compared with previous results that sequentially handle edge and vertex insertions.	experiment;group cohesiveness;iteration;multiple edges;parallel algorithm;parallel computing;scalability;speedup;synthetic intelligence	Na Wang;Dongxiao Yu;Hai Jin;Chen Qian;Xia Xie;Qiang-Sheng Hua	2017	2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	10.1109/ICDCS.2017.288	distributed computing;multiple edges;parallel computing;hopcroft–karp algorithm;combinatorics;cost efficiency;vertex (geometry);speedup;parallel algorithm;multi-core processor;computer science;algorithm;algorithm design	DB	7.771576613612609	31.91554472352501	178407

They showed that the L 1 polynomial regression algorithm yields agnostic (tolerant to arbitrary noise) learning algorithms with respect to the class of threshold functions—under certain restricted instance distributions, including uniform on {0,1} n and Gaussian on ℝ n . In this work we show how all learning results based on the Low-Degree Algorithm can be generalized to give almost identical agnostic guarantees under arbitrary product distributions on instance spaces X 1×⋅⋅⋅×X n . We also extend these results to learning under mixtures of product distributions. The main technical innovation is the use of (Hoeffding) orthogonal decomposition and the extension of the “noise sensitivity method” to arbitrary product spaces. In particular, we give a very simple proof that threshold functions over arbitrary product spaces have δ-noise sensitivity $O(\sqrt{\delta})$ , resolving an open problem suggested by Peres (2004).	algorithm;machine learning;peres–horodecki criterion;polynomial;time complexity	Eric Blais;Ryan M O'Donnell;Karl Wimmer	2008	Machine Learning	10.1007/s10994-010-5179-6	probability distribution;time complexity;innovation;combinatorics;product distribution;product topology;calculus;polynomial regression;gaussian process;mathematics;orthogonal polynomials;uniform distribution;open system;regression analysis;statistics	Theory	9.710012778648471	18.267656336623585	178542
e15f403e69c1c7c70bc54c6b37f024eec111efe2	inaudible voice commands		Voice assistants like Siri enable us to control IoT devices conveniently with voice commands, however, they also provide new attack opportunities for adversaries. Previous papers attack voice assistants with obfuscated voice commands by leveraging the gap between speech recognition system and human voice perception. The limitation is that these obfuscated commands are audible and thus conspicuous to device owners. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to directly attack the microphone used for sensing voice datawith inaudible voice commands. We show that the adversary can exploit the microphone’s non-linearity and play welldesigned inaudible ultrasounds to cause the microphone to record normal voice commands, and thus control the victim device inconspicuously. We demonstrate via end-to-end real-world experiments that our inaudible voice commands can attack an Android phone and an Amazon Echo device with high success rates at a range of 2-3 meters.	adversary (cryptography);amazon kindle;android;distortion;end-to-end principle;experiment;google now;intermodulation;microphone;modulation;nonlinear system;siri;speech recognition;transmitter	Liwei Song;Prateek Mittal	2017	CoRR		phone;voice command device;computer science;android (operating system);exploit;microphone;obfuscation;speech recognition;internet of things;human voice	Security	-2.320686891627009	30.68847375686817	178579
f83be38aaa01d0fe1837652a15034df51602951a	some subclasses of linear languages based on nondeterministic linear automata		In this paper we consider the class of λ-nondeterministic linear automata as a model of the class of linear languages. As usual in other automata models, λ-moves do not increase the acceptance power. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce the deterministic linear automata and even linear automata, i.e. the natural restriction of nondeterministic linear automata for the deterministic and even linear language classes, respectively. In particular, there are different, but not equivalents, proposals for the class of “deterministic” linear languages. We proved here that the class of languages accepted by the deterministic linear automata are not contained in any of the these classes and in fact they properly contain these classes. Another, contribution is the generation of an infinite hierarchy of formal languages, going from the class of languages accepted by deterministic linear automata and achieved, in the limit, the class of linear languages.	automata theory;deterministic finite automaton;formal language;linear algebra;linear grammar	Benjamín R.

In particular, the sensing task in urban environments requires hundreds and even thousands of sensors to be spread over the monitored area. Moreover, in environmental monitoring applications, sensors that are closely located usually provide similar readings. That is, spatial proximity is related to data similarity. In this paper we propose SIDS (Spatial Indexing Based on Data Similarity for Sensor Networks), a data model that explores this characteristic in order to provide scalability and efficient query processing on urban WSNs. Scalability is achieved by grouping sensors with similar readings, while efficiency for processing queries relies on two strategies: the concept of repositories, which consist of sensors that act as datacenters, and an indexing structure designed for speeding up both spatial and value-based queries. We have implemented the proposed model and results from simulations on a variety of scenarios show that SIDS provides scalability and it outperforms CAG and Peer-tree, which are models that have been proposed for processing data and spatial queries, respectively.	chassis air guide;data acquisition;data center;data model;experiment;qualitative comparative analysis;scalability;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;simulation;snapshot (computer storage);software repository;spatial database	Sergio S.

(1994). We give a poly(n//spl epsi/) time algorithm for learning a mixture of k arbitrary product distributions over the n-dimensional Boolean cube {0, 1}/sup n/ to accuracy /spl epsi/, for any constant k. Previous poly(n)-time algorithms could only achieve this for k = 2 product distributions; our result answers an open question stated independently in M. Cryan (1999) and Y. Freund and Y. Mansour (1999). We further give evidence that no polynomial time algorithm can succeed when k is superconstant, by reduction from a notorious open problem in PAC learning. Finally, we generalize our poly(n//spl epsi/) time algorithm to learn any mixture of k = O(1) product distributions over {0, 1,... , b }/sup n/,for any b = O(1).	algorithm;apache axis;boolean algebra;cluster analysis;expect;kullback–leibler divergence;machine learning;mixture model;p (complexity);polynomial;probably approximately correct learning;time complexity	Jon Feldman;Ryan M O'Donnell;Rocco A.

b5abbc0db3d86b0c6300eeb6387bb8cfd903c68f	behavior classification for turing machines		A classification for Turing machines is described. Quantitative descriptors for Turing machine behavior are used for measuring repetitiveness, periodicity, complexity and entropy. These descriptors allowed identifying several kinds of behavior for Turing machines, using an approach based on machine learning. The classification was tested and generality was probed over different configurations of Turing machines.

1970b1eb9dcc24e7efe47033f7a753d958912cc3	amplitude-aware lossy compression for quantum circuit simulation		Classical simulation of quantum circuits is crucial for evaluating and validating the design of new quantum algorithms. However, the number of quantum state amplitudes increases exponentially with the number of qubits, leading to the exponential growth of the memory requirement for the simulations. In this paper, we present a new data reduction technique to reduce the memory requirement of quantum circuit simulations. We apply our amplitude-aware lossy compression technique to the quantum state amplitude vector to trade the computation time and fidelity for memory space. The experimental results show that our simulator only needs 1/16 of the original memory requirement to simulate Quantum Fourier Transform circuits with 99.95% fidelity. The reduction amount of memory requirement suggests that we could increase 4 qubits in the quantum circuit simulation comparing to the simulation without our technique. Additionally, for some specific circuits, like Grover’s search, we could increase the simulation size by 18 qubits.	computation;dspace;electronic circuit simulation;lossy compression;quantum fourier transform;quantum algorithm;quantum circuit;quantum state;qubit;time complexity	Xin-Chuan Wu;Sheng Di;Franck Cappello;Hal Finkel;Yuri Alexeev;Frederic T.

6644cbb4d3bc0ff58c2d4c212f374e1457ee9cee	ann-based estimation of groundwater quality using a wireless water quality network		Water is essential for life. Considering its importance for humans, it must be periodically analyzed to ensure its quality. In this study, a wireless water quality network is deployed to collect water quality parameters periodically and an artificial neural network-based estimation method is proposed to estimate groundwater quality. Estimating groundwater quality enables the authorities to take immediate actions for ensuring water quality. Compared to traditional water quality analysis methods, the proposed method has the advantage of letting the authorities know the quality of their water resources beforehand. A set of simulation studies given in this paper proves the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.		Yilmaz Kiliçaslan;Gurkan Tuna;Gülsüm Gezer;Kayhan Gulez;Orhan Arkoc;Stelios M.

41830af9b3ffc287cc3e0812a86c44a66aed9dc9	circuit fpga for active rules selection in a transition p system region	system performance;p system;membrane computing	P systems or Membrane Computing are a type of a distributed, massively parallel and non deterministic system based on biological membranes. These systems perform a computation through transition between two consecutive configurations. As it is well known in membrane computing, a configuration consists in a m-tuple of multisets present at any moment in the existing m regions of the system at that moment time. Transitions between two configurations are performed by using evolution rules which are in each region of the system in a non-deterministic maximally parallel manner. This article shows the development of a hardware circuit of selection of active rules in a membrane of a transition P-system. This development has been researched by using the Quartus II tool of Altera Semiconductors. In the first place, the initial specifications are defined in orfer to outline the synthesis of the circuit of active rules selection. Later on the design and synthesis of the circuit will be shown, as well as, the operation tests required to present the obtained results.	event condition action;field-programmable gate array;p system	Victor J.

We briefly describe some non-trivial connections to (seemingly) different topics in learning theory, complexity theory, and cryptography. A connection to the so-called Hidden Number Problem, which plays an important role for proving bit-security of cryptographic functions, will be discussed in somewhat more detail.

A national research project, supported by the prestigious National 973 Program of China, was launched in September 2006. The project adopts an application-driven methodology and aims to address the real-world critical problems facing Chinese society. This project will follow a systematic approach, integrating technologies as a system solution to critical problems. Although this is a basic research project, the project has an ambitious goal of solving practical problems with the potential of commercialization. The success of this project will bring significant benefits to China's sustainable economic and social development.	data mining;distributed computing;network congestion;sensor	Lionel M.

We generalize Spira’s theorem and show that any Boolean circuit of size s with segregators of size f(s) can be simulated in depth O(f(s) log s). If the segregator size is at least s for some constant ε > 0, then we can obtain a simulation of depth O(f(s)). This improves and generalizes a simulation of polynomial-size Boolean circuits of constant treewidth k in depth O(k log n) by Jansen and Sarma [17]. Since the existence of small balanced separators in a directed acyclic graph implies that the graph also has small segregators, our results also apply to circuits with small separators. Our results imply that the class of languages computed by non-uniform families of polynomial-size circuits that have constant size segregators equals non-uniform NC. Considering space bounded Turing machines to generate the circuits, for f(s) log s-space uniform families of Boolean circuits our small-depth simulations are also f(s) log s-space uniform. As a corollary, we show that the Boolean Circuit Value problem for circuits with constant size segregators (or separators) is in deterministic SPACE(log n). Our results also imply that the Planar Circuit Value problem, which is known to be P -Complete [16], can be solved in deterministic SPACE( √ n log n).	automated theorem proving;boolean circuit;circuit value problem;directed acyclic graph;planar separator theorem;polynomial;simulation;treewidth;turing machine	Anna Gál;Jing-Tang Jang	2013	Inf.

When there is no creation of defects, all defects have the same direction after some time. In this article, we propose to formalise this phenomenon. Starting from the notion of propagation of defect by a cellular automaton formalized in [Piv07b,Piv07a], we show that, when iterating the automaton on a random configuration, defects in one direction only remain asymptotically.	automata theory;cellular automaton;diagram;emergence;iteration;strips;self-organization;semantics (computer science);simulation;software bug;software propagation	Benjamin Hellouin de Menibus;Mathieu Sablik	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22321-1_22	stochastic cellular automaton;reversible cellular automaton;block cellular automaton;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;continuous spatial automaton;continuous automaton;deterministic automaton;mathematics;mobile automaton;timed automaton;algorithm	Logic	0.276657334917526	24.22000186606642	183595

In particular, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate within an inverse polynomial the value of a one-round game with (i) quantum referee and two entangled players or (ii) classical referee and three entangled players. Previously it was not even known if computing the value exactly is NP-hard. We also describe a mathematical conjecture, which, if true, would imply hardness of approximation to within a constant.We start our proof by describing two ways to modify classical multi-player games to make them resistant to entangled players. We then show that a strategy for the modified game that uses entanglement can be """"rounded'' to one that does not. The results then follow from classical inapproximability bounds. Our work implies that, unless P = NP, the values of entangled-player games cannot be computed by semidefinite programs that are polynomial in the size of the referee's system, a method that has been successful for more restricted quantum games."""	approximation algorithm;decision problem;exclusive or;hardness of approximation;kempe chain;linear programming relaxation;np-hardness;p versus np problem;parallel computing;polynomial;quantum entanglement;quantum game theory;recursion;semidefinite programming	Julia Kempe;Hirotada Kobayashi;Keiji Matsumoto;Ben Toner;Thomas Vidick	2008	2008 49th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science	10.1109/FOCS.2008.8	game theory;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;quantum pseudo-telepathy;mathematics;quantum entanglement;approximation algorithm;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	8.480378466558108	23.36428235117404	183938

As a result, it is pointed out that the composite justification requires significantly less computational step than the D-algorithm. From this fact it has been conjectured that possibly no other algorithm is available in this field with fewer computational steps. If the claim holds, then it follows directly that the test-generation problem is of exponential time, and so are all the other NP-complete problems in the field of computation theory.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;computational complexity theory;digital electronics;np-completeness;theory of computation;time complexity	József Sziray	2011	2011 IEEE 17th Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing	10.1109/PRDC.2011.40	complete;np-complete;logic gate;computer science;theoretical computer science;computational resource;computational learning theory;asymptotic computational complexity;algorithm	Theory	9.503492994866157	20.662374236043167	184051

Indeed, SRS are expressive enough to define, in a uniform way, a noteworthy and non trivial class of languages that contains all the regular languages, {ab : n ≥ 0}, {w ∈ {a, b} : |w|a = |w|b}, the parenthesis languages of Dyck, the language of Lukasewitz, and many others. Moreover, SRS constitute an efficient (often linear) parsing device for strings, and are thus promising and challenging candidates in forthcoming applications of Grammatical Inference. In this paper, we pioneer the problem of their learnability. We propose a novel and sound algorithm which allows to identify them in polynomial time. We illustrate the execution of our algorithm throughout a large amount of examples and finally raise some open questions and research directions.	algorithm;context-free language;context-sensitive grammar;context-sensitive language;delimiter;dyck language;grammar induction;learnability;parsing;regular language;rewriting;time complexity	Rémi Eyraud;Colin de la Higuera;Jean-Christophe Janodet	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30195-0_13	natural language processing;time complexity;regular language;power iteration;string;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;parsing;grammar;database;mathematics;context-free language;cone;abstract family of languages;programming language;algorithm	PL	-1.3101822454086955	19.702162877758234	184462

Specifically, this interplay is pivotal to several intriguing notions of probabilistic proof systems (e.g., interactive proofs, zero-knowledge proofs, and probabilistically checkable proofs), is the focal of the computational approach to randomness, and is essential for various types of sub-linear time algorithms. This essay provides a brief outline of these connections.	algorithm;computation;cryptography;focal (programming language);probabilistically checkable proof;randomness;time complexity;zero-knowledge proof	Oded Goldreich	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22670-0_33	randomness tests;randomness	Crypto	5.784696886982488	20.167632947170254	184576

The article discusses and refines a number of concepts relevant to this problem. For instance, it gives the first combinatorial complete owf, i.e., a function which is one-way if any function is. There are surprisingly many subtleties in basic definitions. Some of these subtleties are discussed or hinted at in the literature and some are overlooked.

The Rete algorithm has been used as the condition match in the production system. The Rete algorithm features in that the condition match can executed efficiently by retaining the intermediate result of matching using the data-flow graph (called Rete network). Efficiency is deteriorated, however, when most of the intermediate results are updated by a single recognition-action cycle. Moreover, execution time for the condition match increases rapidly with an increase in the working memory elements. From such a viewpoint, this paper proposes a condition match algorithm wherein the intermediate result of matching is not retained, and the number of working memory tuples to be examined is reduced by connecting the common variables among the condition element. The proposed algorithm directly tries the condition match without using the Rete algorithm. The execution time does not increase so rapidly as in the Rete algorithm, but increases only slowly with the increase of the working memory elements. Consequently, the efficiency of the Rete algorithm is better when there are fewer working memory elements, and the efficiency of the proposed method is better when both the number of working memory elements and the computation cost for the condition match are increased. In other words, the proposed algorithm can handle high-cost rules.	algorithm	Haruhiko Kimura;Shin-ya Kobayashi;Tsuyoshi Takebe;Kazuyuki Sumiyoshi	1995	Systems and Computers in Japan	10.1002/scj.4690260105	data flow diagram;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;working memory;production system;expert system;algorithm;matching	OS	8.657670573568513	29.235474792115212	185453

We introduce several kinds of non-uniform complexity classes. One kind includes a counterpart of the well-known non-uniform complexity class P/poly and another kind includes a counterpart of the well-known non-uniform complexity class NP/poly. Moreover, we introduce a general notion of completeness for the non-uniform complexity classes of the latter kind. We also formulate a counterpart of the well-known complexity theoretic conjecture that NP 6⊆ P/poly. We think that the presented approach opens up an additional way of investigating issues concerning non-uniform complexity.	complexity class;p (complexity);p/poly;theory;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jan A.

In order for devices to cooperate to smart metering applications' execution, they need to make their information available. In this paper we propose a framework that aims at managing energy consumption of controllable appliances in groups of Smart Homes belonging to the same neighbourhood or condominium. We consider not only electric power distribution, but also alternative energy sources such as solar panels. We define a communication paradigm based on M-Bus for the acquisition of relevant data by managing nodes. We also provide a lightweight algorithm for the distribution of the available alternative power among houses. Performance evaluation of experiments in simulation mode prove that the proposed framework does not jeopardise the lifetime of Smart Meters, particularly in typical situations where managed devices do not continuously turn on and off.

We extend point (b) of Ko's Theorem by showing that P 1-help (UP ∩ co-UP) = UP ∩ co-UP. As a corollary, we get the equality P help (UP ∩ co-UP) = P 1-help (UP ∩ co-UP), which is, to our knowledge, a unique result of type P 1-help (  B  ) = P help (  B  ), for a class   B   that would not be equal to P. With regard to point (a) of Ko's Theorem, we observe that it also holds for the classes UP  k   and for FewP. In spite of this, we prove that point (b) of Theorem 3.4 fails for such classes in a relativized world. This is obtained by showing the relativized separation of UP 2  ∩ co-UP 2  from P 1-help (NP ∩ co-NP). Finally, we suggest a natural line of research arising from these facts.

Traditionally, this is carried out row by row, with the computation of one row depending (potentially) on all the others. We present a technique for carrying out the lookahead computation of SLR (1) and LALR (1) parsers in a completely parallel fashion. Our technique performs the computation by column, rather than by row. We show that the computation is totally independent for each column, making it ideal for parallelization. The speedup factor of the technique is min (N, T), whereN is the number of processors andT is the number of terminal symbols in the user's grammar.		Manuel E. Bermudez;Richard E.

To our knowledge however no actual relationship between PCGS and practical computing systems was ever investigated. We believe that PGCS with context-free components (CF-PCGS) have high practical potential, especially in the area of formal methods, so we started to bring CF-PCGS to a more practical level by studying a construct that has proven useful elsewhere: the parse tree (and forest). We show first that the original definition we introduced earlier falls short of all the desired properties: While each derivation has a corresponding parse forest, there are parse forests that do not correspond to any derivation, this applies to all the CF-PCGS variants. Because of this limitation we introduce a tighter version of parse trees (and forests) for CF-PCGS. Unfortunately we find that the new version does not bring any advantage over the original definition except for one, very restrictive variant of CF-PCGS. Overall beside providing a convenient tool to be used in conjunction with CF-PCGS, this work strongly suggests the aforementioned PCGS variant as the most promising model for practical applications in general and for grammatical approaches to formal verification of concurrent, recursive systems in particular.	concurrency (computer science);context-free language;formal methods;formal verification;parse tree;parsing;recursion;theory;while	Stefan D.

The relationship of ${\bf P}^A $-immunity to p-sparseness and ${\bf NP}^A $-completeness is briefly discussed: ${\bf P}^A $-immune sets in ${\bf NP}^A $ can be sparse or moderately dense, but not co-sparse.

The basic troubleshooting approach is outlined, concluding with a set of assumptions ensuring that a greedy approach will yield an optimal sequence of actions. The assumptions are weaker than the assumptions proposed by Heckerman, Breese & Rommelse (1995). The printing system domain does not meet the requirements for the greedy approach, and a heuristic method is used. The method takes value of identiica-tion of the fault into account and it also performs a partial two-step-look-ahead analysis. The validation process for the troubleshooter is reported.	greedy algorithm;heuristic;printing;requirement	Finn Verner Jensen;Claus Skaanning;Uffe Kjærulff	2001			computer science	SE	4.5827963761540955	28.49748540051805	187507

In particular we show that any random formula over n variables, with a clauses-to-variables ratio of at least 4.4898 is, as n grows large, asymptotically almost surely unsatisfiable. The previous best such bound, due to Dubois in 1999, was 4.506. The first such bound, independently discovered by many groups of researchers since 1983, was 5.19. Several decreasing values between 5.19 and 4.506were published in the years between.Webelieve that the probabilistic techniques we use for the proof are of independent interest. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A necessary and sufficient condition for a regular set to represent an ROP is given. Examples are given to illustrate the advantages of such a specification in terms of a primary focus on root signals and input-output relations. One result is a practical equivalent of the recursive median smoother that is easier to compute. Another is a demonstration that some ROPs, although not implementable as finite autoregressive algorithms involving only the input-output signal values, are implementable as finite state sequential machines, e.g. those with a modified stack filter structure. The demonstration is constructive and coincidentally shows how the idea of a nondeterministic automaton relates to the subject matter. >	central processing unit	Arthur R. Butz	1990	IEEE Trans.

2b06d1fa71ac3684551d5bb2dae736d6ea527b4d	classical and quantum algorithms for testing equivalence of group extensions	quantum computing algorithms computational group theory;004	While efficient algorithms are known for solving many important problems related to groups, no efficient algorithm is known for determining whether two arbitrary groups are isomorphic. The particular case of 2-nilpotent groups, a special type of central extension, is widely believed to contain the essential hard cases. However, looking specifically at central extensions, the natural formulation of being “the same” is not isomorphism but rather “equivalence,” which requires an isomorphism to preserves the structure of the extension. In this paper, we show that equivalence of central extensions can be computed efficiently on a classical computer when the groups are small enough to be given by their multiplication tables. However, in the model of black box groups, which allows the groups to be much larger, we show that equivalence can be computed efficiently on a quantum computer but not a classical one (under common complexity assumptions). Our quantum algorithm demonstrates a new application of the hidden subgroup problem for general abelian groups.	black box;black box group;computation;computational complexity theory;computer science;exponentiation by squaring;feedback;graph isomorphism problem;harrow;hidden subgroup problem;ibm notes;matrix multiplication;monte carlo algorithm;monte carlo method;numerical integration;polynomial remainder theorem;preprocessor;quadratic residue;quantum algorithm;quantum computing;shor's algorithm;subroutine;time complexity;turing completeness;video post-processing	Kevin C.

The syntactic complexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its syntactic semigroup. The syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular languages is the worst-case syntactic complexity taken as a function of the state complexity n of languages in that class. We prove that n n−1, n n−1 + n − 1, and n n−2 + (n − 2)2 n−2 + 1 are tight upper bounds on the syntactic complexities of right ideals and prefix-closed languages, left ideals and suffix-closed languages, and two-sided ideals and factor-closed languages, respectively. Moreover, we show that the transition semigroups meeting the upper bounds for all three types of ideals are unique, and the numbers of generators (4, 5, and 6, respectively) cannot be reduced.	best, worst and average case;computer science;dfa minimization;deterministic finite automaton;finite-state machine;maximal set;regular language;string operations;syntactic monoid;the witness	Janusz A.

Although this paper is not the first to provide a counterexample to the Random Oracle Hypothesis, it does provide a most compelling counterexample by showing that for almost all oracles A, IP 6= PSPACE. If the Random Oracle Hypothesis were true, it would contradict Shamir’s result that IP = PSPACE. In fact, it is shown that for almost all oracles A, co-NP 6⊆ IP. These results extend to the multi-prover proof systems of Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Kilian and Wigderson. In addition, this paper shows that the Random Oracle Hypothesis is sensitive to small changes in the definition. A class IPP, similar to IP, is defined. Surprisingly, the IPP = PSPACE result holds for all oracle worlds. Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, U.S.A. Supported in part by NSF Research Grant CCR-88-23053.

Our model incorporates both probabilistic and nondeterministic features and is strictly more powerful than a purely probabilistic model. Using this model, a collection of tools are developed that facilitate studying lower bounds on the expected communication complexity of Monte Carlo algorithms for language recognition problems on anonymous asynchronous unidirectional rings. The tools are used to establish tight lower bounds on the expected bit complexity of the Solitude Verification problem that asymptotically match upper bounds for this problem. The bounds demonstrate that, for this problem, the expected bit complexity depends subtly on the processors' knowledge of the size of the ring and on whether or not processor-detectable termination is required.	central processing unit;communication complexity;context of computational complexity;monte carlo method;nondeterministic algorithm;probabilistic turing machine;statistical model	Karl R.

Here we want to understand the exact boundary that separates the undecidable from the decidable cases of such problems by considering the time complexity of very simple devices that include NFAs (1-way and 2-way), PDAs and PDAs augmented with counters - and their unambiguous restrictions. We consider several variations - based on whether the bound holds exactly or as an upper-bound and show decidability as well as undecidability results. In the case of decidable problems, we also attempt to determine more precisely the complexity class to which the problem belongs.	time complexity	Oscar H.

In this note, we give a polynomial propagation algorithm for a special case of this constraint, which in fact is the only case which was not known to be intractable. The cardinality path constraint [BC01], cardpath(N, [X1, . . . , Xm], C), where C is a constraint of arity k < m and N is an integer variable, ensures that N = ∑m−k+1 i=1 C(Xi, . . . , Xi+k−1). (C() returns 1 when satisfied, 0 otherwise.) In other words, we slide C down the sequence X1, . . . , Xm and ensure it holds N times. In [BHHW04a] and [BHHW04b], we proved that enforcing arc consistency on the constraint cardpath(N, [X1, . . . , Xm], C) is NP-hard if C has unbounded arity (even if arc consistency is polynomial on it) or if we allow repetition of variables in the sequence X1, . . . , Xm. The only remaining open question was therefore about the complexity of cardpath when C has bounded arity and we don’t allow repetitions in X1, . . . , Xm. We show that it is in fact polynomial to achieve arc consistency on such a constraint. We present an algorithm for C being binary, which is simpler to present. But the technique can be extended to any arity as long as it remains bounded. The idea of the algorithm is the following. It first makes a double traversal of the sequence [X1, . . . , Xm], one from X1 to Xm (lines 1 to 7) and the other from Xm downto X1 (lines 8 to 14). This step computes two sets of integers, w(Xi, v) and dw(Xi, v) for each value (Xi, v). The set w(Xi, v) contains all possible number of times C is satisfied by a tuple on [X1, . . . , Xi] belonging to D(X1) × · · · × D(Xi), while dw(Xi, v) contains all possible number of times C is satisfied by a tuple on [Xi, . . . , Xm] in D(Xi) × · · · × D(Xm). The second step (lines 15 to 18) makes the join of those two sets of integers, putting in the set T (Xi, v) all possible number of times C is satisfied by a complete tuple in D(X1)× · · ·×D(Xm). All values such that T (Xi, v) does not intersect D(N) are removed since there does not exist any tuple in D(X1) × · · · × D(Xm), using v for Xi that satisfies C a number of times allowed by N .	algorithm;emoticon;local consistency;np-hardness;polynomial;software propagation;tree traversal	Nicolas Beldiceanu;Mats Carlsson	2001		10.1007/3-540-45635-X_12	constraint logic programming;cardinality;mathematical optimization;constraint programming;cardinality;discrete mathematics;constraint satisfaction;relational database;computer science;artificial intelligence;database;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	6.533744773879123	18.541088622918426	189217

Moreover, the relations between real-time ACAs and deterministic (CA) and nondeterministic (NCA) cellular automata are investigated.

Efficient implementation of the top-k queries is the key for information searching. With the new frontier such as the cyber-physical systems, where there can be a large number of users searching information directly into the physical world, many new challenges arise for top-k query processing. From the client's perspective, different users may request different set of information, with different priorities and at different times. Thus, the top-k search not only should be multi-dimensional, but also across time domain. From the system's perspective, the data collection is usually carried out by small sensing devices. Unlike the data centers used for searching in the cyber-space, these devices are often extremely resource-constrained and system efficiency is of paramount importance. In this paper, we develop a framework that can effectively satisfy the two ends. The sensor network maintains an efficient dominant graph data structure for data readings. A simple top-k extraction algorithm is used for the user query processing and two schemes are proposed to further reduce communication cost. Our proposed methods can be used for top-k query with any linear convex query function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for continuous multi-dimensional top-k query processing in sensor networks; and our simulation results show that our schemes can reduce the total communication cost by up to 90%, compared with the centralized scheme or a straightforward extension from previous top-k algorithm on one-dimensional sensor data.	algorithm;centralized computing;computer science;cyber-physical system;data center;data structure;database;graph (abstract data type);microsoft research;overhead (computing);query optimization;simulation	Hongbo Jiang;Jie Cheng;Dan Wang;Chonggang Wang;Guang Tan	2011	2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935301	algorithm design;sargable;query optimization;query expansion;web query classification;wireless sensor network;data structure;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;database;range query	DB	-4.03990091213656	31.4981695155434	189919

We prove a complexity dichotomy theorem for Holant*(F), where F is a set of constraint functions on Boolean variables and output complex values. The constraint functions need not be symmetric functions. We identify four classes of problems which are polynomial time computable; all other problems are proved to be #P-hard. The main proof technique and indeed the formulation of the theorem use holographic algorithms and reductions. By considering these counting problems over the complex domain, we discover surprising new tractable classes, which are associated with isotropic vectors, i.e., a (non-zero) vector whose inner product with itself is zero.	cobham's thesis;computable function;constraint satisfaction;counting problem (complexity);graph homomorphism;holographic algorithm;holography;p (complexity);reduction (complexity);sharp-p-complete;time complexity	Jin-Yi Cai;Pinyan Lu;Mingji Xia	2011				Theory	7.118608592663872	18.959926022186153	190188

We collected the information by looking through the homepages of the world famous IoT appliances brands on the internet. And we combined the collected information in the literature investigating how to combine to particle filters for monitoring base communication station remotely. The developed system collects environmental data of wireless communication base station using several sensors, analyzes the collected data using particle filters, and controls the remotely base station. As a wireless remote control method, we implemented Bluetooth, Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Finally, it is designed for users to enable remote control and monitoring when the user is not in the base station.	bluetooth;particle filter;remote control;sensor	Yang-Weon Lee	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-95933-7_17	wireless sensor network;machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;the internet;computer network;base station;particle filter;internet of things	Mobile	-0.13347043684176083	32.30007907059471	190713

We show that we can check in polynomial time if a language generated by a simple contextfree grammar is a prime. Our algorithm computes a canonical representation of a simple language, converting its arbitrary simple grammar into Prime Normal Form (PNF); a simple grammar is in PNF if all its nonterminals define primes. We also improve the complexity of testing the equivalence of simple grammars. The best previously known algorithm for this problem worked in O(n) time. We improve it to O(n log n) and O(n polylog v) deterministic time, and O(n polylog n) randomized time, where n is the total size of the grammars involved, and v is the length of a shortest string derivable from a nonterminal, maximized over all nonterminals.

The semantics of a graph transformation unit is a binary relation on an underlying type of graphs. In order to get a flexible typing mechanism for transformation units and a high degree of parallelism this paper introduces typed graph transformation units that transform k-tuples of typed input graphs into l-tuples of typed output graphs in a controlled and structured way. The transformation of the typed graph tuples is performed with actions that apply graph transformation rules and imported typed units simultaneously to the graphs of a tuple. The transformation process is controlled with control conditions and with graph tuple class expressions. The new concept of typed graph transformation units is illustrated with examples from the area of string parsing with finite automata.	abstract data type;automata theory;degree of parallelism;directed acyclic graph;empty string;finite-state machine;forward error correction;graph rewriting;logic programming;parallel computing;parsing;type system;typing	Renate Klempien-Hinrichs;Hans-Jörg Kreowski;Sabine Kuske	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30203-2_10	lattice graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;universal graph;graph product;null graph;string;graph property;computer science;clique-width;artificial intelligence;comparability graph;parsing;binary relation;database;mathematics;voltage graph;distance-hereditary graph;distributed computing;graph;finite-state machine;programming language;type theory;complement graph;graph operations;algorithm;string graph;graph rewriting	PL	-4.049478944416748	20.911918600985647	191054

Performing maintenance tasks in a complex environment is quite challenging and difficult due to complex, and possibly, underground facilities, uneasy access, human factors, heavy machineries, etc. Current technology is not acceptable because of significant delays in communication and data transmission, missing multi-input interfaces, and simultaneous supervision of multiple workers who are working in the extreme environment. The aim is to technically advance and combine several technologies and integrate them as integral part of a personnel safety system to improve safety, maintain availability, reduce errors and decrease the time needed for scheduled or ad hoc interventions. We emphasize on the aspects that were made feasible on the workeru0027s side due to the equipment used (mobile computing equipment). We present that the demanding tasks that previously were simply undertaken on the fixed infrastructure are now possible on the mobile end. The research challenges lie in the development of real-time data-transmission, instantaneous analysis of data coming from different inputs, local intelligence in low power embedded systems, interaction with multiple on-site users, complex user interfaces, portability and wearability.

a6d41de327692bbcd37d0d0d16c9a228f0bbbee9	linear pattern matching of repeated substrings	pattern matching	In 1970, Knuth, Morris, and Pratt proposed their famous linear-time pattern matching algorithm for two strings. Their algorithm was derived from a result of Cook that 2-way deterministic pushdown languages are recognizable on a RAM in linear time [Co71]. In 1973, Weiner [PeWe73] presented a very original algorithm that performs linear time recognition of repeated instances of a substring in a string. Weiner’s approach to this problem was as important as the solution to the problem itself. The relevance of his work was immediately appreciated. The result was announced in October, 1973 at what was then SWAT (now FOCS) and some selected ideas made their way to Section 9.5 of the first edition of Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman’s textbook [AHU74], published half a year later. Unfortunately, Weiner’s paper may be difficult for modern readers. Familiar objects such as trees and other data structures are described using notation drawn from automata theory. Typographical errors and overloading of terms contribute to the difficulty. This paper attempts to explain Weiner’s result in a more accessible manner.	data structure;function overloading;knuth–morris–pratt algorithm;pattern matching;random-access memory;relevance;swat;sethi–ullman algorithm;stack (abstract data type);substring;symposium on foundations of computer science;time complexity	Alejandro López-Ortiz	1994	SIGACT News	10.1145/193820.193842	computer science;pattern matching;programming language	Theory	3.383418821239335	25.746024519610508	191328

As in the classical version of decision trees, different kinds of quantum query algorithms are possible: exact, zeroerror, bounded-error and even nondeterministic. In this paper, we study the latter class of algorithms. We introduce a fresh notion in addition to already studied nondeterministic algorithms and introduce dual nondeterministic quantum query algorithms. We examine properties of such algorithms and prove relations with exact and nondeterministic quantum query algorithm complexity. As a result and as an example of the application of discovered properties, we demonstrate a gap of n vs. 2 between classical deterministic and dual nondeterministic quantum query complexity for a specific Boolean function.	black box;decision tree model;nondeterministic algorithm;quantum algorithm	Alina Dubrovska	2007			nondeterministic finite automaton with ε-moves;discrete mathematics;quantum information;theoretical computer science;quantum capacity;mathematics;quantum computer;nondeterministic algorithm;quantum algorithm;physics;algorithm;quantum mechanics;quantum phase estimation algorithm;quantum sort	Theory	7.1010047283290145	22.074127870875078	191724

In contrast, Turing machines and other common models of computation operate on strings. While graphs may be encoded as strings (via an adjacency matrix), the encoding imposes a linear order on vertices. This enables a Turing machine operating on encodings of graphs to choose an arbitrary element from any nonempty set of vertices at low cost (the Augmenting Paths algorithm for Bipartite Matching being an example of the power of choice). However, the outcome of a computation is liable to depend on the external linear order (i.e., the choice of encoding). Moreover, isomorphism-invariance/encoding-independence is an undecidable property of Turing machines. This trouble with encodings led Blass, Gurevich and Shelah [3] to propose a model of computation known as BGS machines that operate directly on structures. BGS machines preserve symmetry at every step in a computation, sacrificing the ability to make arbitrary choices between indistinguishable elements of the input structure (hence “choiceless computation”). Blass et al. also introduced a complexity class CPT+C (Choiceless Polynomial Time with Counting) defined in terms of polynomially bounded BGS machines. While every property finite structures in CPT+C is polynomial-time computable in the usual sense, it is open whether conversely every isomorphism-invariant property in P belongs to CPT+C. In this paper we give evidence that CPT+C = P by proving the separation of the corresponding classes of function problems. Specifically, we show that there is an isomorphism-invariant polynomial-time computable function problem on finite vector spaces (“given a finite vector space V , output the set of hyperplanes in V ”) that is not computable by any CPT+C program. In addition, we give a new simplified proof of the Support Theorem, which is a key step in the result of [3] that a weak version of CPT+C absent counting cannot decide the parity of sets.	adjacency matrix;algorithm;complexity class;computable function;computer science;function problem;graph (discrete mathematics);invariant polynomial;matching (graph theory);model of computation;p (complexity);string (computer science);time complexity;turing machine;undecidable problem;vertex (geometry)	Benjamin Rossman	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15025-8_28	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	7.176117583986887	18.898140460078803	191985

Next, WC examine the problem of optimal placement for striped data, WC show that for fixed probabilities of accessing the delay-sensitive objects, partitioning the set of disks is always bcttcr than striping in all of the disks. Then, given a number it of disks and T distinct delay-sensitive objects with probubilitics of access p~,pz,. . . ,pr, that must be striped across T different disk partitions (i.e., non-overlapping subsets of the n disks), WC use the Majorization theory and the theory of Schur functions in order to find what is the optimal number of disks that must be allocated to each partition. WC analyze the problem of grouping the more and less popular deluy-sensitive objects together in partitions when the partitions arc less than the objects, so that the number of supported USCPS is maximized. Finally, we present the tradeoff of striping on all the disks versus partitioning the set of the dislm when the access probabilities of the delay-sensitive objects change with time.	data striping;disk partitioning;disk storage;floppy disk;performance tuning;write combining;writing commons	Stavros Christodoulakis;Fenia Zioga	1998		10.1145/275487.275496	computer science;theoretical computer science;database	DB	6.742717890016564	28.974183724890818	192489

A fuzzy inference system has been developed to perform the approximate reasoning process performed by a human being, based on the perception of the environment conditions. The decision algorithm is based on a performance criterion, the one that forces the emergence of the pollution level with minimum communication and maximum environment safety. The processes running at the local unit have been modularly designed within the frame of a Client/Server architecture to ease its gradual growing and maintenance. The local unit bi-directionally communicates with several central units that record and visualize stationary data and acts at the reception of an emergency message.

These devices and their accepted languages are called k-reversible automata and k-reversible languages, respectively. The existence of k-reversible languages which are not (k−1)-reversible is known, for each k > 1. This gives an infinite hierarchy of weakly irreversible languages, i.e., languages which are k-reversible for some k. Conditions characterizing the class of k-reversible languages, for each fixed k, and the class of weakly irreversible languages are obtained. From these conditions, a procedure that given a finite automaton decides if the accepted language is weakly or strongly (i.e., not weakly) irreversible is described. Furthermore, a construction which allows to transform any finite automaton which is not k-reversible, but which accepts a k-reversible language, into an equivalent k-reversible finite automaton, is presented.	alphabet (formal languages);automaton;computation;finite-state machine;regular language;the witness;unary language;unary operation	Giovanna J.

These problems naturally build on problems for integer expressions and integer circuits studied by Stockmeyer and Meyer (1973), McKenzie and Wagner (2007), and Glaßer et al. (2010). Our work shows that the balance problem for {−, ·}-circuits is undecidable which is the first natural problem for integer circuits or related constraint satisfaction problems that admits only one arithmetic operation and is proven to be undecidable. Starting from this result we precisely characterize the complexity of balance problems for proper subsets of {−, ·}.

Semaphore codes provide an approximation theory for resets. In this paper we generalize the set-up of our previous paper “Random walks on semaphore codes and delay de Bruijn semigroups” to the infinite case by taking the profinite limit of k-resets to obtain (−ω)-resets. We mention how this opens new avenues to attack the P versus NP problem.		John L. Rhodes;Anne Schilling;Pedro V.

We show that to accept a nonregular language, an SAFA needs to generate at least Ω(log logn) communication symbols infinitely often; furthermore, a synchronized alternating finite automaton without nondeterminism (SUFA) needs to generate at leastΩ(log logn) communication symbols infinitely often for some constantk≥1. We also show that these bounds are tight. Next, we establish dense hierarchies of these machines on the function bounding the number of communication symbols. Finally, we give a characterization of NP in terms of communication-bounded multihead synchronized alternating finite automata, namely, NP = ⋃ k≥1 L(SAFA(k-heads,n k -com)). This result recasts the relationships between P, NP, and PSPACE in terms of multihead synchronized alternating finite automata.	alternating finite automaton;automata theory;finite-state machine;kendall square research;np (complexity);p (complexity);pspace	Oscar H.

728cf6981527ad9bee3ffddb5363ee5ff6e2c8f7	note on needle in a haystack	emerging technology;quantum physics;binary data;grover s algorithm	Introduced below is a quantum database method, not only for retrieval but also for creation. It uses a particular structure of true's and false's in a state vector of n qubits, permitting up to 2**2**n words, vastly more than for classical bits. Several copies are produced so that later they can be destructively observed and a word determined with high probability. Grover's algorithm is proposed below to read out, nondestructively the unknown contents of a given stored state vector using only one state vector. Data Storage in a State Vector of Qubits Holding data in a quantum system is clearly problematic, since such systems quickly become incoherent, although systems of the future might be designed to be more stable. This paper assumes a quantum system with m identical sets of n qubits, where each set is assumed to form a state vector. Then each state vector is loaded with 1's and 0's with an appropriate normalization factor. For n qubits a state vector has dimension 2 n which theoretically holds n 2 2 binary codes. An interesting and practical subset of a general state vector is to initialize qubits to combinations of H |0> = (1 1)'/√2, |1> = (0 1)', and |0> = (1 0)'. Each state vector will then have a particular structure termed here the H10 structure: For 2 n entries, either the pattern repeats in the other half (2 n-1) entries, or one of the halves is filled with 0s. For example, one may have 0011, 0000/√2 for n = 3, this being |0> |1> H |0>. Note that anything similar to 0111, 0000 is impossible under H10 symmetry, since this rule also applies to each quarter (block of 2 n-2) and so on down to blocks of 2 1 states. If any one state is true and all others false, the result is just a binary count of n items, a given combination of n computational basis qubits. Readout is probabilistic. For example, if copies of 0011, 0000 are read a few times, there is a very good chance that entries |0>, |1>, |0> and |1), |1>, |1> will result, permitting reconstruction of the stored word 0011, 0000. (Simply note that the entries corresponding to combinations of computational basis qubits count up in binary from the left). The H10 structure has the advantage that it can be produced without complex quantum gates. It should be …	binary code;computation;grover's algorithm;quantum gate;quantum state;quantum system;qubit;with high probability;year 10,000 problem	John Robert Burger	2003	CoRR		grover's algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;emerging technologies;algorithm;quantum mechanics	Theory	9.714729299236879	28.114931629194064	193522

However, in living cells, the execution time of different biological processes is difficult to know precisely and very sensitive to environmental factors that might be hard to control. Inspired from this biological motivation, in this work, timed polarization P systems with membrane creation are introduced and their computational efficiency and universality are investigated. Specifically, we give a time-free semi-uniform solution to the SAT problem by a family of P systems with membrane creation in the sense that the correctness of the solution is irrelevant to the times associated with the involved rules. We also prove that time-free P systems with membrane creation are computationally universal.	computation;p system;universality probability	Bosheng Song;Mario J.

In spite of widespread discussion about connections between biology and computation, one question seems notable by its absence: Where are the programs? We introduce a model of computation that is evidently programmable, by programs reminiscent of low-level computer machine code; and at the same time biologically plausible: its functioning is defined by a single and relatively small set of chemical-like reaction rules. Further properties: the model is stored-program: programs are the same as data, so programs are not only executable, but are also compilable and interpretable. It is universal: all computable functions can be computed (in natural ways and without arcane encodings of data and algorithm); it is also uniform: new “hardware” is not needed to solve new problems; and (last but not least) it is Turing complete in a strong sense: a universal algorithm exists, that is able to execute any program, and is not asymptotically inefficient. A prototype model has been implemented (for now in silico on a conventional computer). This work opens new perspectives on just how computation may be specified at the biological level.	algorithm;computable function;executable;high- and low-level;machine code;model of computation;prototype;stored-program computer;top-down and bottom-up design;turing completeness	Lars Hartmann;Neil D.

As a consequence it proves a long standing conjecture in formal language theory: All regular languages are Church-Rosser congruential. The class of Church-Rosser congruential languages was introduced by McNaughton, Narendran, and Otto in 1988. A language L is Church-Rosser congruential if there exists a finite, confluent, and length-reducing semi-Thue system S such that L is a finite union of congruence classes modulo S. It was known that there are deterministic linear context-free languages which are not Church-Rosser congruential, but the conjecture was that all regular languages are of this form. The article offers a stronger statement: A language is regular if and only if it is strongly Church-Rosser congruential. It is the journal version of the conference abstract which was presented at ICALP 2012.	church–rosser theorem;confluence (abstract rewriting);congruence of squares;context-free grammar;context-free language;expressive power (computer science);formal language;graph coloring;icalp;linear algebra;mathematical induction;modulo operation;regular language;rewriting;semi-thue system;semiconductor industry;substring	Volker Diekert;Manfred Kufleitner;Klaus Reinhardt;Tobias Walter	2015	J.

A saturated language is a language which contains all encoding of elements belonging to a set of d-vectors of reals. A Real Vector Automaton is an automaton which recognizes a saturated language. It is explained how to decide in quasi-linear time whether a minimal weak deterministic Büchi automaton is a Real Vector Automaton. The problem is solved both for the two standard encodings of vectors of numbers: the sequential encoding and the parallel encoding. This algorithm runs in linear time for minimal weak Büchi automata accepting set of reals. Finally, the same problem is also solved for parallel encoding of automata reading vectors of relative reals.	büchi automaton;church encoding;encode;parallel algorithm;time complexity	Arthur Milchior	2017	CoRR		time complexity;two-way deterministic finite automaton;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;ω-automaton;büchi automaton;deterministic automaton;mathematics;timed automaton;algorithm;mobile automaton	Logic	-0.39014173446960054	21.642420379586877	195839

Hartmanis, Li and Yesha [HLY86] proved that no set which is hard for NP under many-one (Karp) reductions is NP-simple unless NP ∩ coNP ⊆ SUBEXP. However, we can exhibit a relativized world in which there is an NP-simple set that is complete under Turing (Cook) reductions, even conjunctive reductions. This raises the questions whether the result by Hartmanis, Li and Yesha generalizes to reductions of intermediate strength. We show that NP-simple sets are not complete for NP under positive bounded truth-table reductions unless UP ⊆ SUBEXP. In fact, NP-simple sets cannot be complete for NP under bounded truth-table reductions under the stronger assumption that UP ∩ coUP 6⊆ SUBEXP (while there is an oracle relative to which there is an NP-simple set conjunctively complete for NP). We present several other results for different types of reductions, and show how to prove a similar result for NEXP which does not require any assumptions. We also prove that all NEXP-complete sets are P-levelable, extending work by Tran [Tra95]. Most of the results are derived by the use of inseparable sets. This technique turns out to be very powerful in the study of truth-table and even (honest) Turing reductions.	co-np;complement (complexity);many-one reduction;nexptime;np (complexity);separable polynomial;simple set;time complexity;truth-table reduction;turing reduction	Marcus Schaefer;Stephen A.

e75e0008b18dcba157f4e6ea4b388108dc991097	preface to the special issue unconventional computing 2008		This special issue contains five articles selected from the papers presented at the 7th International Conference on Unconventional Computing, UC 2008, held in Vienna, Austria on 25–28 August 2008. ‘‘Unconventional Computing’’, http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/ research/groups/CDMTCS/conferences/uc/uc.html, is the primary international conference dedicated to all aspects of unconventional computing, theory as well as experiments and applications. Giorgio Delzanno and Laurent Van Begin study computational properties of extended P systems that model creation, dissolution, fusion, and cloning of membranes in their paper ‘‘On the verification of membrane systems with dynamic structure’’. The paper ‘‘Quantum security in wireless sensor networks’’, by Naya Nagy, Marius Nagy and Selim Akl, proposes a new security solution based on quantum cryptography. Turlough Neary proves, in the paper ‘‘On the computational complexity of spiking neural P systems’’, that no spiking neural P system (with a constant number of neurons) is capable of simulating Turing machines with less than exponential time and space overheads. He also constructs a universal extended spiking neural P system with exhaustive use of rules and 10 neurons that simulates Turing machines in linear time. In the paper ‘‘Output concepts for accelerated Turing machines’’ Petrus Potgieter and Elemér Rosinger study the problem of rigorously defining the output of the infinite computation performed by an accelerated Turing machine. Linmin Yang, Yong Wang and Zhe Dang study a new computation paradigm, inspired by P systems, defined over a multiset of communicating objects in their paper ‘‘Automata and processes of multisets of communicating objects’’.

8245b2655a1be55b9fcc373df026f01b4efdf542	on the hardness against constant-depth linear-size circuits	constant depth circuits;parity function;average case hardness	The notion of average-case hardness is a fundamental one in complexity theory. In particular, it plays an important role in the research on derandomization, as there are general derandomization results which are based on the assumption that average-case hard functions exist. However, to achieve a complete derandomization, one usually needs a function which is extremely hard against a complexity class, in the sense that any algorithm in the class fails to compute the function on 1/2 - 2-Ω(n) fraction of its n-bit inputs. Unfortunately, lower bound results are very rare and they are only known for very restricted complexity classes, and achieving such extreme hardness seems even more difficult. Motivated by this, we study the hardness against linear-size circuits of constant depth in this paper. We show that the parity function is extremely hard for them: any such circuit must fail to compute the parity function on at least 1/2 - 2-Ω(n) fraction of inputs.

f7ee824766b121e3a5e6f69cee9cd281278716a0	the grand challenge of quantum computing: bridging the capacity gap	quantum engineering;testing limits of applicability of quantum mechanics;quantum metamaterials;quantum computing;quantum simulation	The fabrication and control of macroscopic artificial quantum structures, such as qubits (Mooij et al., 1999; Nakamura et al., 1999; Friedman et al., 2000), qubit arrays (Johnson et al., 2011; Barends et al., 2014), quantum annealers (Boixo et al., 2013) and, recently, quantum metamaterials (Macha et al., 2014), have witnessed significant progress over the last 15 years. This was a surprisingly quick evolution from theoretical musings to what can now be called quantum engineering [the observation of such phenomena even in a single superconducting device was considered a truly challenging task in 1980 (Leggett, 1980)]. And today, we stand at the point where existing theoretical and computational tools become inadequate for predicting, analyzing, and simulating the behavior of such structures, in which quantum superposition and entanglement play the key role (Zagoskin et al., 2014). The long-known fundamental impossibility of simulating large enough quantum systems by classical means (Feynman, 1982), unfortunately, manifests itself already at the level of systems containing as few as several hundreds of qubits. Such a system is still too small to be used as an efficient quantum simulator of comparable systems, but already too large for us to tell with certainty, using the existing classical tools, whether it behaves as a quantum system should (Smolin and Smith, 2014). Furthermore, the complexity of already existing quantum processor prototypes confronts us with an engineering problem designing a reliable quantum device and testing its reliability. What is even worse, if there are fundamental corrections to the laws of quantum mechanics for large enough systems, we will be unable to discover them because of our inability to tell what exactly quantum mechanics would predict. Let us take the optimistic view that quantum computing is not fundamentally restricted by, for example, the size of a system capable of demonstrating quantum behavior (Penrose, 1999). In this scenario, it would be possible to create quantum computing devices that will allow us to design and fabricate ever bigger and better quantum computers, as well as other macroscopic quantum devices, of a character and use of which we cannot even imagine at the moment. Alternatively, we may find fundamental limits to the applicability of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, this can happen only if the gap between our current ability to characterize large quantum systems and the capacities of the smallest workable quantum computers is bridged. Bridging this capacity gap is thus the immediate grand challenge for the field: a challenge that must be met if we hope to make further progress in quantum computing and quantum engineering or if we hope to discover fundamentally new physics, or both. While it is impossible to efficiently simulate a large quantum system by classical means by directly solving the appropriate equations of motion, it is feasible that essential quantum properties of an ensemble of such systems will be reflected in certain higher-level, global characteristics. These properties should be insensitive to details of a particular instance, computable by classical tools and accessible to experimental investigation. This view of a system of qubits as a quantum many-body system should be amenable to the approaches that have proven to work very well in numerous applications in condensed matter physics and quantum statistical mechanics.

Perfect language classes are the basis for the automata-theoretic approach to model checking: a system is correct if the language generated by the system is disjoint from the language of bad traces. Regular languages are perfect, but because the disjointness problem for CFLs is undecidable, no class containing the CFLs can be perfect. In practice, verification problems for language classes that are not perfect are often under-approximated by checking if the property holds for all behaviors of the system belonging to a fixed subset. A general way to specify a subset of behaviors is by using bounded languages (languages of the form w1* ... wk* for fixed words w1,...,wk). A class of languages C is perfect modulo bounded languages if it is closed under Boolean operations relative to every bounded language, and if the emptiness problem is decidable relative to every bounded language. We consider finding perfect classes of languages modulo bounded languages. We show that the class of languages accepted by multi-head pushdown automata are perfect modulo bounded languages, and characterize the complexities of decision problems. We also show that bounded languages form a maximal class for which perfection is obtained. We show that computations of several known models of systems, such as recursive multi-threaded programs, recursive counter machines, and communicating finite-state machines can be encoded as multi-head pushdown automata, giving uniform and optimal under approximation algorithms modulo bounded languages.	approximation algorithm;automata theory;boolean algebra;boolean operations on polygons;compiler;computation;computational model;decision problem;finite-state machine;maximal set;model m keyboard;model checking;modulo operation;pushdown automaton;recursion;stack (abstract data type);thread (computing);tracing (software);undecidable problem	Javier Esparza;Pierre Ganty;Rupak Majumdar	2012	2012 27th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science	10.1109/LICS.2012.39	decidability;boolean algebra;formal language;discrete mathematics;complexity;verification;formal verification;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;context-free language;cone;abstract family of languages;bounded function;programming language;computational complexity theory;perfect power;pushdown automaton;algorithm;approximation theory	Logic	-2.440584310061596	23.323244319999205	197159

However, it is difficult to compute these signatures for systems with complex reliability structure functions and large numbers of components. This paper presents a new algorithm that is able to compute exact signatures for systems that are far more complex than is feasible using existing approaches. This is based on the use of reduced order binary decision diagrams (ROBDDs), multidimensional arrays and the dynamic programming paradigm. Results comparing the computational efficiency of deriving signatures for some example systems (including complex benchmark systems from the literature) using the new algorithm and a comparison enumerative algorithm are presented and demonstrate a significant reduction in computation time and improvement in scalability with increasing system complexity.	algorithm;antivirus software;benchmark (computing);binary decision diagram;computation;dynamic programming;electronic signature;programming paradigm;scalability;time complexity;type signature	Sean Reed	2017	Rel.

Blum [2] showed that there are computable languages that have almost-everywhere speedup. These languages were unnatural in that they were constructed for the sole purpose of having such speedup. We identify a condition apparently only slightly stronger than P 6= NP which implies that accepting any coNP -complete language has an infinitely-often (i.o.) superpolynomial speedup and NP 6= coNP . We also exhibit a natural problem which unconditionally has a weaker type of i.o. speedup based upon whether the full input is read. Neither speedup pertains to the worst case.	best, worst and average case;blum axioms;co-np;computable function;speedup;time complexity;turing machine	Hunter Monroe	2009	CoRR			Theory	9.111742577535562	20.33023840932673	197279

A large indoor tank has been used in underwater acoustics experiments such as measurements of the target strength pattern of fish. It was equipped with an electric flatcar for the purpose of loading and positioning an ultrasonic transducer. A TS measurement system loaded with a fish-suspension and rotating mechanism has been developed for a tank. Furthermore, a water level meter was constructed for the efficient operation of water supply or draining. A model for Web direct-access monitoring was newly designed on the basis of the concept that an operator could control a mechanical device using a Web browser via LAN. It was used in three systems, an electric flatcar, TS measurement system and a water level meter, to control and monitor remotely via a network. Applications of a Web direct-access model to these systems is introduced and described in detail. For 34 hours during water supply, water depth was measured successfully. Then monitoring operations by multiple PCs were evaluated widely via the Intranet or Internet. A calculation method of the residual needed time was suggested for the perspective of a finish time for water supply. Then, installation of a remote control terminal was required for efficient operation of an electric flatcar. A remote control system using a notebook personal computer has been developed with good cost performance.	access control;acoustic cryptanalysis;control system;experiment;internet;intranet;microsequencer;nonlinear acoustics;personal computer;random access;remote control;server (computing);system of measurement;transducer;web page	Ken Ishii;Kouichi Sawada;Yoshimi Takao	2008	2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision	10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795566	local area network;aquaculture;underwater acoustics;electronic engineering;the internet;water level;transducer;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;system of measurement;water supply;web server;server;remote control	Robotics	-0.08123864716249676	30.786535066352705	197319

We consider two standard variants of this problem. The first one is  two-level logic minimization or finding a minimal DNF formula consistent with a given complete truth table (TT-MinDNF. This problem was formulated by Quine in 1952 and has been since one of the key problems in logic design. It was proved NP-complete by Masek in 1979. The best known polynomial approximation algorithm is based on a reduction to the SET-COVER problem and produces a DNF formula of size O(d ∙ OPT), where d is the number of variables. We prove that TT-MinDNF is NP-hard to approximate within dγ for some constant γ > 0, establishing the first inapproximability result for the problem.The other DNF minimization problem we consider is PAC learning of DNF expressions when the learning algorithm must output a DNF expression as its hypothesis (referred to as proper learning). We prove that DNF expressions are NP-hard to PAC learn properly even when the learner has access to membership queries, thereby answering a long-standing open question due to Valiant [40]. Finally, we show that inapproximability of TT-MinDNF implies hardness results for restricted proper learning of DNF expressions with membership queries even when learning with respect to the uniform distribution only.	approximation algorithm;circuit minimization for boolean functions;computer science;hardness of approximation;np-completeness;polynomial;probably approximately correct learning;quine (computing);regular expression;set cover problem;truth-table reduction	Vitaly Feldman	1993		10.1145/1132516.1132569	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;logic synthesis;computer science;truth table;machine learning;mathematics;set cover problem;uniform distribution;hardness of approximation;probably approximately correct learning;algorithm	Theory	9.201823362368085	19.409441508836156	197923
2cb2fd081a68cd557558261dffcbce576f66fbbe	tree projections and structural decomposition methods: minimality and game-theoretic characterization	structural decomposition methods;computational complexity;generalized hypertree width;games on hypergraphs;treewidth	Tree projections provide a mathematical framework that enc ompasses all the various (purely) structural decomposition methods that have been proposed i n the literature to single out classes of nearly-acyclic (hyper)graphs, such as the ree decomposition method , which is the most powerful decomposition method on graphs, and the (g neralized) hypertree decomposition method , which is its natural counterpart on arbitrary hypergraphs. The paper analyzes this framework, by focusing in particula r on “minimal” tree projections, that is, on tree projections without useless redundancies. Firs t, it i shown that minimal tree projections enjoy a number of properties that are usually required for no rmal form decompositions in various structural decomposition methods. In particular, they enj oy the same kind of connection properties as (minimal) tree decompositions of graphs, with the result being tight in the light of the negative answer that is provided to the open question about whether th ey enjoy a slightly stronger notion of connection property, defined to speed-up the computation of hypertree decompositions. Second, it is shown that tree projections admit a natural game-theoretic characterization in terms of the Captain and Robber game. In this game, as for the Robber and Cops game char acterizingtree decompositions , the existence of winning strategies implies the existence of mo notone ones. As a special case, the Captain and Robber game can be used to characterize the generalized h yp rtree decomposition method, where such a game-theoretic characterization was missing and ask ed for. Besides their theoretical interest, these results have immediate algorithmic applications bot h for the general setting and for structural decomposition methods that can be recast in terms of tree pro j ctions.	computation;decomposition method (constraint satisfaction);directed acyclic graph;game theory;r-tree;tree decomposition;useless rules	Gianluigi Greco;Francesco Scarcello	2014	Theor.

The breakthrough idea for handling road networks with tens of millions of nodes was the concept of shortcuts, i.e., additional arcs that represent long paths in the input. Very recently, this concept has been transferred to time-dependent road networks where travel times on arcs are given by functions. Unfortunately, the concept of shortcuts is very space-consuming in time-dependent road networks since the travel time functions assigned to the shortcuts may become quite complex. In this work, we present how the space overhead induced by time-dependent SHARC, a technique relying on shortcuts as well, can be reduced significantly. We are able to reduce the overhead stemming from SHARC by a factor of up to 11.5 for the price of a loss in query performance of a factor of 4. The methods we present allow a trade-off between space consumption and query performance.	computation;correctness (computer science);mobile device;overhead (computing);preprocessor;routing;stemming;super harvard architecture single-chip computer	Edith Brunel;Daniel Delling;Andreas Gemsa;Dorothea Wagner	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13193-6_5	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;transport engineering	DB	-3.2010107615850423	32.08803620863764	198765

However, for the sake of their operational safety, the question of deadlock must be addressed. For this contribution we used the well-known Roscoe-Dathi method to demonstrate the deadlock-freeness of a systolic array with hexagonal connectivity. Our result implies that it is theoretically safe to deploy such arrays on various platforms. Our proof is valid for all cases in which the computational pattern (input-output-behaviour) of the array does not depend on the particular values (contents) of the communicated data.	computation;deadlock;emergence;parallel computing;systolic array;whole earth 'lectronic link	Stefan Gruner;Theunis J.

This is a logical form that has been identified recently and shown to support a number of operations in polynomial time, including clausal entailment; model counting, minimization and enumeration; and probabilistic equivalence testing, d-DNNFs are also known to be a superset of, and more succinct than, OBDDs. The polytime logical operations supported by d-DNNFs are a subset of those supported by OBDDs, yet are sufficient for model-based diagnosis and planning applications. We present experimental results on compiling a variety of CNF formulas, some generated randomly and others corresponding to digital circuits. A number of the formulas we were able to compile efficiently could not be similarly handled by some state-of-the-art model counters, nor by some state-of-the-art OBDD compilers.	binary decision diagram;compiler;conjunctive normal form;digital electronics;logical connective;negation normal form;polynomial;preferential entailment;randomness;time complexity;turing completeness	Adnan Darwiche	2002			time complexity;logical form;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;bayesian network;negation normal form;digital electronics;algorithm	AI	2.97735540020261	18.528481929696376	199314
