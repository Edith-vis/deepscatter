In this paper, we make contributions towards improving the efficiency of self-organization in wireless sensor networks. We first present a novel approach for message-efficient clustering, in which nodes allocate local “growth budgets” to neighbors. We introduce two algorithms that make use of this approach. We analyze the message complexity of these algorithms and provide performance results from simulations. The algorithms produce clusters of bounded size and low diameter, using significantly fewer messages than the earlier, commonly used, Expanding Ring approach. Next, we present a new randomized methodology for designing the timers of cluster initiators. This methodology provides a probabilistic guarantee that initiators will not interfere with each other. We derive an upper bound on the expected time for network decomposition that is logarithmic in the number of nodes in the network. We also present a variant that optimistically allows more concurrency among initiators and significantly reduces the network decomposition time. However, it produces slightly more clusters than the first method. Extensive simulations over different topologies confirm the analytical results and demonstrate that our proposed methodology scales to large networks. ∗This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under CAREER grant ANI-0132802 and grant ANI-0240333.	average-case complexity;cluster analysis;computer cluster;concurrency (computer science);organizing (structure);randomized algorithm;self-organization;simulation;timer	Rajesh Krishnan;David Starobinski	2006	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2004.04.002	embedded system;distributed algorithm;real-time computing;self-organization;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;upper and lower bounds;computer network	AI	7.982007677978124	79.10142554071363	58127

Many of the applications built for VANETs will depend on the data push communication model, where information is disseminated to a group of vehicles. In this paper, we present a formal model of data dissemination in VANETs and study how VANET characteristics, specifically the bidirectional mobility on well defined paths, affects the performance of data dissemination. We study the data push model in the context of TrafficView, a system we have implemented to disseminate information about the vehicles on the road. Traffic data could be disseminated using vehicles moving on the same direction, vehicles moving in the opposite direction, or vehicles moving in both directions. Our analysis as well as simulation results show that dissemination using only vehicles in the opposite direction increases the data dissemination performance significantly	formal language;hoc (programming language);push technology;simulation	Tamer Nadeem;Pravin Shankar;Liviu Iftode	2006	2006 Third Annual International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking & Services	10.1109/MOBIQ.2006.340402	vehicular ad hoc network;intelligent transportation system;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Robotics	4.081541565833598	87.27760179846182	58133

In this paper, we focus on traffic monitoring (TM) and roadside message transfer (RMT) applications. The TM application (TMA) allows drivers to query traffic conditions at some distance ahead of themselves so that they can make decisions on route changes. The RMT application (RMTA) allows data messages to be delivered between roadside entities e.g. emergency messages, via the moving vehicles. We design a robust data transfer protocol (RDTP), and evaluate its effectiveness on the two applications with various vehicular density and vehicular speed. Our study shows that our protocol achieves comparably accurate speed estimate and higher query success rate with lower control overhead than VITP, an existing protocol designed for TMA. It also achieves higher data throughput and lower delivery latency than another existing approach for RMTA.	entity;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);prototype;response time (technology);speaker recognition;throughput;tower mounted amplifier;virtual economy;website monitoring	Mooi Choo Chuah;Fen Fu	2006		10.1007/11943952_32	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;mobile computing;computer security;data transmission	Mobile	-1.4951653487150847	77.19946235697	58294

However, despite the diversified correlation-aware designs proposed up to date, they commonly suffer from a shortcoming where link correlation is inaccurately measured, which leads them to sub-optimal performance. In this work we propose a general framework for accurate capturing of link correlation, enabling better utilization of the phenomenon for protocols lying on top of it. Our framework uses SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) to detect correlations, followed by modeling the correlations for in-network use. We show that our design is light-weight, both computation and storage-wise. We apply our model to opportunistic routing and network coding on a physical 802.15.4 test-bed for energy savings of 25% and 15%.	computation;interference (communication);linear network coding;network performance;routing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;testbed	Song Min Kim;Shuai Wang;Tian He	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)	10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218403	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	10.010921534236918	88.32633419903509	58346
d73d73783940253c90f7664589ffc5b6cd3c2d77	congestion control technique using intelligent traffic and vanet		Road traffic jams is a most important problem in nearly all cities around the world, especially in developing regions resulting in enormous delays, increased fuel wastage and monetary losses. In this paper, we have obtained an in-sight idea of simulating real world scenario of a critical region where traffic congestion is very high. As it is not easy to set up and implement such a complicated system in real world before knowing the impact of all parameters used in Vehicle Ad hoc Network (VANET), a small real world area i.e. Jamshedpur Regal area was taken into consideration, for studying the impact of mobility in the VANET. Traffic movement has been deployed across the area under consideration using one of the realistic vehicular mobility models. The behavior of this network was simulated using SUMO and NS2 to study the impact of traffic and traffic lights at the intersection on packet transmission over Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication using Ad hoc On Demand Vector (AODV) routing protocol and IEEE 802.11 standard. From the traffic simulation results, it is proved that congestion problem for the given sample map with traffic lights and predefined flow can be solved. There was negligible congestion at lanes when traffic logic was changed in accordance with allowing flow with high traffic overload to have high priority than those with low load.	hoc (programming language);network congestion;network packet;routing;simulation;vehicle-to-vehicle;web traffic	Sunil Kumar Singh;Rajesh Duvvuru;Saurabh Singh Thakur	2013	CoRR		traffic generation model;network traffic control;simulation;floating car data;vehicle information and communication system;traffic congestion reconstruction with kerner's three-phase theory;traffic flow;traffic bottleneck;traffic wave;traffic shaping;computer security;computer network;traffic optimization	Mobile	4.127336225266705	87.93213144224518	58361

The proposed infrastructure is composed of distributed lightweight low-cost devices called roadside buffers (RSBs), where each RSB has the limited buffer storage and is able to transmit wirelessly the cached contents to fast-moving vehicles. To enable the distributed RSBs working toward the global optimal performance (e.g., minimal average file download delays), we propose a fully distributed algorithm to determine optimally the content replication strategy at RSBs. Specifically, we first develop a generic analytical model to evaluate the download delay of files, given the probability density of file distribution at RSBs. Then, we formulate the RSB content replication process as an optimization problem and devise a fully distributed content replication scheme accordingly to enable vehicles to recommend intelligently the desirable content files to RSBs. The proposed infrastructure is designed to optimize the global network utility, which accounts for the integrated download experience of users and the download demands of files. Using extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed infrastructure and show that the proposed distributed protocol can approach to the optimal performance and can significantly outperform the traditional heuristics.	distributed algorithm;download;global network;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;network utility;optimization problem;protocol buffers;simulation	Tom H.

The existing approaches mainly focus on collecting diagnosis metrics, which bring heavy communication overhead to the network. We present a new model called DSD for network diagnosis which deduce the root causes for failures using the sensing data traces. We discover that the characteristics of the sensing data reflect the network status in some way, according to considerable experiments in the GreenOrbs project. We mine the relationships between the sensing data and the failures in the sensor networks, and record them in a failure knowledge library. Through this diagnosis mechanism, we deduce the root cause of the failures without adding any additional network burden. Moreover, the failure knowledge library can be used to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. We analyze the three months sensing data from the GreenOrbs project, and experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the diagnosis performance with low energy cost.	digital footprint;document structure description;experiment;hoc (programming language);like button;overhead (computing);testbed;tracing (software)	Jiangwu Nie;Huadong Ma;Lufeng Mo	2012	2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems	10.1109/DCOSS.2012.63	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	8.90250790632002	76.22996720344955	58654
3a36a6d4bcd2652143f529d8d183e7a510614203	hybrid multi-technology routing in heterogeneous vehicular networks	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Recent developments of wireless communication systems have resulted in the availability of heterogeneous access networks at any geographic area. To make use of this heterogeneous environment for vehicular users to access the Internet, in this article we propose a hybrid multi-technology routing (HMTR) protocol for multihop vehicular networks. HMTR takes into account different combinations of wireless technologies in intermediate hops and is generally formed of a combination of topology-based and position-based routing schemes for packet forwarding. For a given packet, HMTR uses the position-based routing approach over highly variable links whose lifetimes are shorter than the packet expiry time. On the other hand, it employs the topology-based routing approach over more stable links that are expected to stay valid before the expiry time of the packet. Among the candidate routes, any route which does not meet the user requirements in terms of budget or quality of service metrics such as delay and bandwidth is ruled out first. Then, among the remained candidates those with adequate levels of connectivity are assessed for their appropriateness in terms of network utilizations, which are of the network’s concern and connection costs, which are of users’ concern. Simulation results show that HMTR enables us to achieve the best possible performance in terms of delivery ratio and delivery delay for a given budget, whereas in pure position-based or pure topology-based routing schemes sacrificing the performance or budget may be inevitable in many scenarios.	access network;geographic routing;network packet;norm (social);quality of service;requirement;simulation;user requirements document	Kaveh Shafiee;Victor C.

The DSR protocol was used and four levels of competence based on strategies to improve the cache were implemented: sort routes, prefer fresher routes, selection, and disperse traffic. A conflict solver was implemented to solve counter level commands. Three different activation criteria for the conflict solver were developed, generating instances of the architecture. Two metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the ad-hoc network: end-to-end delay and dropped packet average for the voice and data services, respectively. Six scenarios were analyzed showing the increase of the network performance with respect to the original DSR protocol.	ansi escape code;hoc (programming language)	Horacio Martinez-Alfaro;Griselda P.

In DFS-based delivery tree building approaches, the newcomer need not know the information of other members except the root, and positioning can be easily implemented. However, the DFS approach cannot effectively position a host in some cases because it usually selects a branch of active candidate parent to continue the searching procedure. This paper proposes a closest-first-searching (CFS) positioning means, and a CFS-based tree building approach name CFTB. In CFTB, the new active candidate parent is selected among all the candidate parents in terms of the known distance information. The simulation results show that CFTB can position a newcomer accurately, and build a multicast tree with good delivery performance.	climate forecast system;depth-first search;filesystem-level encryption;multicast;simulation;tree (data structure)	Xinchang Zhang;Xiaodong Li;Zheng Wang;Baoping Yan	2008	2008 International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology	10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.175	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Arch	1.0697067191660379	82.60960922074845	58978

Being continuously recharged, the battery does not need to be replaced regularly and the sensor node is maintenance-free. A key module in such sensor network solutions is the data link automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol, which must be designed to reliably deliver sensor nodes data at the minimum energy cost. With this objective in mind, two ARQ protocol classes are compared. In one class, each sensor node operates individually. In the other, the concept of cooperative communications is adopted, whereby neighboring sensor nodes help each other during the retransmission process. It is shown that the use of cooperative ARQ protocols in energy harvesting sensor networks enables sensor nodes to balance their energy consumption to match their own battery recharge rate. In turn, a balanced energy consumption-to-recharge rate ratio has the potential to improve the network throughput. Both classes of ARQ protocols are analyzed and compared. Estimated throughput gains are discussed under various network scenarios.	automatic repeat request;frame (networking);network performance;rechargeable battery;relay;retransmission (data networks);sensor node;throughput	Marco Tacca;Paolo Monti;Andrea Fumagalli	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.05878	sliding window protocol;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	0.50741527168642	75.42909847349846	59219

These systems consist of powerful computing nodes connected through high-performance communication networks. Due to recent advances in mobile computing and communication technologies, it has become feasible to use mobile nodes as a contributing entity to Grid. Recently several approaches have been proposed to integrate mobile nodes with Grid computing systems, but in these approaches mobile nodes are mostly used as terminals either to submit jobs or access services. The approaches in which mobile nodes can share computing resources are restricted to infrastructure-based communication systems such as cellular network, and therefore cannot be used in mobile ad hoc environments. In this paper we propose a distributed computing infrastructure named mobile ad hoc computational Grid which allows mobile nodes to share computing resources in mobile ad hoc environment. Compared to traditional parallel and distributed computing systems such as Grid and Cluster mobile ad hoc computational Grid is characterized by shared and unreliable communication medium, low bandwidth, high latency, node mobility, and infrastructure-less network environment, so it introduces numerous opportunities as well as challenges. This paper describes the applications and architecture of mobile ad hoc computational Grid, and discusses the potential research issues and future research directions.	computation;computer cluster;distributed computing;grid computing;hoc (programming language);job stream;mobile computing;telecommunications network	Sayed Chhattan Shah	2013	MILCOM 2013 - 2013 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2013.149	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile search;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;theoretical computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;utility computing;mobility model;mobile computing;grid computing;computer network;autonomic computing	HPC	2.450367550842918	79.209178911299	59424

We focus on sparse vehicular sensor networks (VSNs), where timely message delivery and reliable transmission are of significant importance. We present a mathematical framework for the message delivery delay distribution for a two-lane road, where vehicles in one direction act as message carriers for the ones in the other direction and have the freedom to leave the road from randomly distributed road junctions with a certain probability. Packet generator vehicles store the original packets till meeting an RSU while sending multiple copies of each packet to packet carrier vehicles. Our analysis offers an analytical tool for an intelligent transportation system (ITS) service provider to determine the minimum RSU density required to cover a road for meeting a probabilistic requirement of the message delay. Extensive computer simulation results show the accuracy of our analysis and clearly indicate the relation of packet delay and the number of packet replicas.	computer simulation;network packet;packet generator;randomness;sparse matrix	Atef Amin Abdrabou;Ben Liang;Weihua Zhuang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TW.2013.072313.121397	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.566582448920475	87.62242469407653	59580

We describe in detail a new MAC protocol, called 2P, that is suited for such networks in terms of efficiency. A significant challenge here is the implementation of this protocol on top of off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware, to preserve the cost benefits. We show how this can be achieved, by exploiting the flexibilities available within Prism2-based chipsets. We then present the dependence of 2P on the network topology, and show that it is indeed possible to design in practice, network topologies compatible with 2P. We describe experimental as well as simulation-based evaluations of 2P, and show that 2P achieves significant performance improvement (as much as 20 times more throughput) over 802.11 CSMA/CA in long-distance mesh networks.	chipset;mesh networking;network topology;prototype;simulation;throughput	Bhaskaran Raman;Kameswari Chebrolu	2005		10.1145/1080829.1080847	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;switched mesh;signal-to-interference ratio;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;network topology;computer network	Mobile	-0.6805229063720661	87.16727585297532	59638

In the HHA, gateway terminals implementing both cellular and infrastructure-less air interfaces, allow integration of the two separate paradigms characterising the wireless sensor network (WSN) and the cellular network. In this paper, in particular we study a hierarchical network where an IEEE 802.15.4 WSN is connected, through a mobile gateway, to an infrastructure network using a cellular air interface like UMTS. In such scenario, the mobile gateway receives data from sensors with an inter-arrival time distribution which depends on the WSN topology, the sensor node density, and the parameters set in the 802.15.4 MAC protocol, such as the superframe order, the number of guaranteed time slots, etc. Such distribution is analysed in this paper through simulation. The outcome of this work provides useful hints to the characterisation of the traffic generated by the mobile gateway and provided to the infrastructure network. The design of the scheduling techniques implemented at the infrastructure side requires suitable knowledge of the characteristics of such traffic.	hop;scheduling (computing);sensor node;simulation;time of arrival;tree network	Chiara Buratti;Roberto Verdone	2007	2007 IEEE Internatonal Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428709	embedded system;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	6.856687982504722	84.93831600482943	59736

WSN suffers from formation of hole in the network due to its asymmetric deployment, unbalanced energy consumption and intentional destruction of nodes in the network. The dynamic increase in Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters such as coverage and connectivity also may lead to formation of holes which in turn degrades the performance of the network. Therefore, in order to maintain a desired QoS, a sensor redeployment scheme is important in WSN. During its lifecycle, a sensor node experiences active, sleep, diagnose, vulnerable, repair, and fail states. We analyze the Markov process and obtain the steady state probabilities for all the states. The availability of the nodes is presented with the help of SHARPE tool. Our work utilizes Discrete-Time Markov Chain and a Semi-Markov Process to illustrate the probabilities of WSN node in various states. The required redeployment nodes are then computed based on a stochastic analysis of the system and subject to the QoS requirements of the network.	elegant degradation;markov chain;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;quality of service;radio jamming;requirement;sensor node;simulation;software deployment;steady state;stochastic process;symmetric multiprocessing;unbalanced circuit;vulnerability (computing)	Ravindara Bhatt;Raja Datta	2013	2013 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2013.176	stochastic process;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;quality of service;computer science;probability;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;markov process;computer security;statistics;computer network	Embedded	7.613479969102171	84.77052000059201	59972

However, IEEE 802.16 standard does not provide any scheduling mechanism for a wireless mesh network. In this paper, a multi-path routing supported scheduling algorithm for multi-channel single-transceiver IEEE 802.16 mesh networks is proposed. Instead of using a fixed routing tree, the proposed scheduling algorithm gives subscriber station (SS) freedom to choose a neighboring SS in an elastic way such that parallel link transmission can be maximized. In order to raise the number of, the Multi-Channel Single-Transceiver model is adopted to maximize the data through and resolve the problems caused by secondary interference. To mitigate the traffic bottleneck near BS, it is assumed that BS equips with multi-transceiver to avoid problems with the low neighboring BS transmissions. According to the experiment results, the proposed scheduling algorithm has higher amount of parallel transmission links, lower packet delay, and is more efficient than fixed routing tree scheduling algorithm.	algorithm;mesh networking;routing;scheduling (computing);transceiver;wireless mesh network	Mei-Jhen Chen;Gwo-Jong Yu	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02617-1_52	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;fair-share scheduling;switched mesh;routing;real-time computing;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;dynamic source routing;rate-monotonic scheduling;mesh networking;shared mesh;optical mesh network;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;order one network protocol;link-state routing protocol;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;proportionally fair;computer network	EDA	-1.989427258026659	84.15760694192265	59974

Most of the existing transmission schemes are taking a class of store-carry-forward schemes to improve the delivery. However, they don't take the social selfish nodes into consideration. To deal with the unpredictability in connections and uncooperative behaviors in the nodes, this paper proposes a transmission scheme to make the social selfish nodes cooperate in forwarding messages for other nodes. In the proposed scheme, a priority is given to a message according to the cooperation degree, a cache management scheme is applied, and a delivery probability is calculated to guide nodes to select the better nodes as its relay. Simulation experiments show that the proposed routing protocol is effective and outperforms the existing routing solutions.	experiment;relay;reliability (computer networking);routing;simulation;transmission (bittorrent client)	Daru Pan;WeiJing Chen;Zhaohua Ruan;Ke Lu	2012		10.1145/2382336.2382341	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	4.243583606808565	83.6959080022212	60250
1c0de76d369bc7a66eabb7d1253a7eac4ffe8db9	delay and delay variation constrained algorithm based on vns algorithm for rp management in mobile ipv6	qos;multicast ip	On account the progress of network multimedia technology, more and more real-time multimedia applications arrive with the need to transmit information using multicast communication. These applications are more important with arrival of mobile IPv6 protocol with mobile receivers and sources. These applications require a multicast routing protocol which has packets arriving at the multicast receptors within a specified QoS guaranteed and a quick recovery mechanism. In multicasting with mobile IPv6, the mobility of a receivers and senders may lead to serious problems. When the receiver or sender moves, the quality of full multicast tree may degrade so that multicast datagrams cannot be forwarded efficiently. D2V-RPM (delay and delay variation RP Manager) problem consist of choosing an optimal multicast router in the network as the root of the shared multicast tree (ST) within a specified delay and delay variation bound for all multicast session, and recovering this RP if it's off optimal or failed. This NP hard problem needs to be solved through a heuristic algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new RP Management algorithm based on Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm, based on a systematic neighborhood changing. D2VVNS-RPM algorithm selects and recovers the RP router by considering tree cost, delay and delay variation. Simulation results show that good performance is achieved.	core router;datagram;heuristic (computer science);mobile ip;multicast;np-hardness;network congestion;performance;rp (complexity);real-time transcription;router (computing);routing;search algorithm;selection algorithm;session-based testing;simulation;variable neighborhood search	Youssef Baddi;Mohamed Dâfir Ech-Cherif El Kettani	2012	CoRR		real-time computing;multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	EDA	-2.818019450680878	82.72653348111118	60273
83e25a18629cfcc7fd8610d389b19fed27d9c801	autonomous online expansion technology for wireless sensor network based manufacturing system	autonomous decentralized system;sensor switching;online expansion;wireless sensor networks	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is an attractive data collection paradigm for indoor and outdoor monitoring environment. In WSN based manufacturing system environment sensor addition, relocation and reorganization are necessary with the addition or modification of production lines. This sensor addition or relocation sometime increases the sensor density in some areas of the network. In high sensor density area new sensors cannot connect the network due to the capacity constraints of the network. For the environment this paper proposes a two layers autonomous decentralized heterogeneous wireless sensor network architecture. The first layer consists of sensors and the second layer consists of routers. Each sensor is connected with a router and each router is connected with sensors and routers. This paper proposes a technology to make a group of local routers (which is called as community) for switching connected sensors by the routers of the high density areas of the network. A router of a high sensor density area initiates the community construction for switching a connected sensor to another router in the community, if new sensor wants to join the router. The switching is possible if the connected sensor is under the communication range of the other router of low density area. Sometime the community is necessary to expand or shrink based on situation. This paper introduces the community technology to achieve online expansion of the network. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed technology.		Md.

In these scenarios, group-based communication is central, and hence a natural and useful routing paradigm is anycast, where a node attempts to communicate with at least one member of a particular group. Unfortunately, most existing anycast solutions assume connectivity, and the few specifically for DTNs are single-copy in nature and have only been evaluated in highly limited mobility models. In this paper, we propose a protocol-independent method of enhancing a large number of existing DTN unicast protocols, giving them the ability to perform anycast communication. This method requires no change to the unicast protocols themselves and instead changes their world view by adding a thin layer beneath the routing layer. Through a thorough set of simulations, we also evaluate how different parameters and network conditions affect the performance of these newly transformed anycast protocols.	anycast;delay-tolerant networking;programming paradigm;routing;simulation;unicast	Samuel C.

MMVE applications require delivery of updates among various locations in the virtual environment. The proposed architecture here exploits the location addressing of geometrical routing in order to alleviate the need for IP-specific queries. However, the use of geometrical routing requires careful choice of overlay to achieve high performance in terms of minimizing the delay. At the same time, the MMVE is dynamic, in sense that users are constantly moving in the 3D virtual space. As such, our architecture uses a distributed topology control scheme that aims at maintaining the requires QoS to best support the greedy geometrical routing, despite user mobility or churn. We will further prove the functionality and performance of the proposed scheme through both theory and simulations.	delaunay triangulation;distributed computing;greedy algorithm;multi-user;routing;simulation;topology control;virtual reality	Mohsen Ghaffari;Behnoosh Hariri;Shervin Shirmohammadi	2009		10.1145/1542245.1542260	real-time computing;simulation;delaunay triangulation;voronoi diagram;computer science;virtual machine;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Networks	-0.6030907733396838	80.01701984086584	60375
d841ebb4c2d9fe7d527b2f618ad5920113ad3791	establishing a cooperation-based and void node avoiding energy-efficient underwater wsn for a cloud		For energy-efficient resource management, void node avoidance is one of the key objectives in the energy constrained underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). In this paper, we propose two new routing protocols for the UWSN which is one of the end parts of a cloud. The first protocol is avoiding void node with adaptive hop-by-hop vector based forwarding (AVN-AHH-VBF), and the second is cooperation-based AVN-AHH-VBF (CoAVN-AHH-VBF). In both schemes, sensor nodes forward data packets in multi-hop fashion within a virtual pipeline. The nodes outside the pipeline do not forward data packets to avoid flooding in the network. At each hop, forwarding toward void region of the network is avoided by utilizing two hop information. Results of extensive simulations show that our proposed schemes significantly improve the network performance in terms of delivery ratio, energy expenditure and delay as compared with the selected existing scheme (AHH-VBF).	cloud computing;hop-by-hop transport;network packet;network performance;routing;simulation	Nadeem Javaid;Taimur Hafeez;Zahid Wadud;Nabil Ali Alrajeh;Mohamad Souheil Alabed;Nadra Guizani	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2707531	telecommunications;distributed computing;computer security	Mobile	6.183124682008586	83.32694356247106	60692

MANET nodes cooperate in an autonomous way by forwarding packets to each-other. Considering mobility of the terminals, routes change dynamically so routing algorithms are very important for operation of MANETs. These protocols and other algorithms are tested by simulations, emulations and experiments. In simulations, by using random mobility models, all nodes move randomly and the distance between the nodes changes in an uncontrollable pattern. In this paper, we consider a case study when the source and destination nodes are static and we analyse the performance of a MANET simulation system, considering the proactive OLSR routing protocol. We evaluate the performance of MANET by evaluating packet delivery rate, number of hops and throughput of one-flow traffic.	algorithm;autonomous robot;experiment;link-state routing protocol;network packet;node (computer science);optimized link state routing protocol;randomness;simulation;throughput	Elis Kulla;Makoto Ikeda;Leonard Barolli;Muhammad Younas;Kazunori Uchida;Rozeta Miho	2012	2012 Third International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies	10.1109/EIDWT.2012.15	geography;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.032000863242741	85.23402041434854	60694

Without end-to-end connections due to sparse network density and sensor node mobility, routing in DFT-MSN becomes localized and ties closely to medium access control, which naturally calls for merging Layer 3 and Layer 2 protocols in order to reduce overhead and improve network efficiency. DFT-MSN is fundamentally an opportunistic network, where the communication links exist only with certain probabilities and become the scarcest resource. At the same time, the sensor nodes in DFT-MSN have very limited battery power like those in other sensor networks. Clearly, there is a tradeoff between link utilization and energy efficiency. To address this tradeoff, we develop a cross-layer data delivery protocol for DFT-MSN, which includes two phases, i.e., the asynchronous phase and the synchronous phase. In the first phase, the sender contacts its neighbors to identify a set of appropriate receivers. Since no central control exists, the communication in the first phase is contention-based. In the second phase, the sender gains channel control and multicasts its data message to the receivers. Furthermore, several optimization issues in these two phases are identified, with solutions provided to reduce the collision probability and to balance between link utilization and energy efficiency. Our results show that the proposed cross-layer data delivery protocol for DFT-MSN achieves a high message delivery ratio with low energy consumption and an acceptable delay.	access control;end-to-end principle;fault tolerance;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;routing;sensor node;simulation;sparse matrix	Yu Wang;Hongyi Wu;Feng Lin;Nian-Feng Tzeng	2007	27th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS '07)	10.1109/ICDCS.2007.129	fault tolerance;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	7.432097881233441	80.28599042014761	60711

The key idea of VFHS is to utilize oncoming side vehicles (OSVs) to collect physical and MAC layers information of passing through RVs and broadcast the information to vehicles that are temporarily disconnected, referred to as broken vehicles (BVs). A BV can thus perform a rapid handover when it enters the transmission range of the approaching RVs. The effectiveness of VFHS is verified using ns2 simulations. Simulation results indicate that VFHS significantly decreases handover latency and packet loss.	network packet;queueing theory;simulation	Kuan-Lin Chiu;Ren-Hung Hwang;Yuh-Shyan Chen	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5198587	vehicular ad hoc network;wimax;wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;packet loss;computer security;broadcasting;network topology;physical layer;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	4.960681550509384	88.14033022448972	60920

The severe resource constraints of sensor nodes and the broadcast nature of the wireless links as well as the challenging deployment environments of wireless sensor networks pose challenges for the quality and security of data transmission for these networks. In order to ensure data security and quality of service required by an application in an energy efficient way, we propose a mechanism for QoS routing with coding and selective encryption scheme for WSNs. Our approach provides reliable and secure data transmission and can adapt to the resource constraints of WSNs. The original message is split into packets that are coded and selectively encrypted before being transmitted along different disjoint paths.	data security;encryption;quality of service;routing;sensor;software deployment	Hind Alwan;Anjali Agarwal	2012	2012 25th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2012.6335039	routing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;cryptography;information security;reliability;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;coding;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;encryption;encoding;statistics;computer network	Mobile	0.6691775127788521	76.85526768486272	61146

The static determination of the FEC code size, however, degrades their performance since the evaluation of the underlying channel state is hardly accurate and even widely varied. Our measurements over a wireless sensor network, for example, show that the average bit error rate (BER) per second or per minute continuously changes from 0 up to 10−3. Under this environment, wireless networks waste their bandwidth since they can't deterministically select the appropriate size of FEC code matching to the fluctuating channel BER. This paper proposes an adaptive FEC technique called adaptive FEC code control (AFECCC), which dynamically tunes the amount of FEC code per packet based on the arrival of acknowledgement packets without any specific information such as signal to noise ratio (SNR) or BER from receivers. Our simulation experiments indicate that AFECCC performs better than any static FEC algorithm and some conventional dynamic hybrid FEC/ARQ algorithms when wireless channels are modeled with two-state Markov chain, chaotic map, and traces collected from real sensor networks. Finally, AFECCC implemented in sensor motes achieves better performance than any static FEC algorithm.	algorithm;bit error rate;chaos theory;error detection and correction;experiment;forward error correction;low-power broadcasting;markov chain;mobile phone;network packet;network performance;noisy-channel coding theorem;packet switching;retransmission (data networks);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;smoothing;tracing (software);x.690	Jong-Suk Ahn;Seung-Wook Hong;John S.

To construct flexible and robust home networks HNs for smart home systems, this paper proposes a novel wireless home networks structure using IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. The proposed approach solves the network address confusion problems which may occur in adjacent HNs in a residential building. In the proposed wireless home network structure, newly arrived network nodes can be correctly configured with unique network addresses. The proposed approach also improves the network robustness by handling unexpected events, caused by migration or departure of nodes within HNs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively restore home networks after destructions of sub-networks; and it achieves nearly 80% network address utilisation ratio.

While both distributed and centralized solutions for proximity detection have been proposed, the cost metrics for evaluating these proposals are always based on counting the number of message (e.g., query or update) exchanges. However, as mobile users often rely on wireless networks to maintain their connectivity, the cost incurred by any message passing is strongly affected by the distance between the sender and receiver. In this paper, we propose TRack Others if You can (TROY) as a novel distributed solution for proximity detection. Extending the principle of spatial tessellations, TROY incurs only localized message exchanges and is thus superior to existing proposals in terms of more realistic cost metrics that take into account the actual energy consumption of message passing. Moreover, our spatial tessellations inspired analytical framework allows for a meaningful comparison with an existing work. Finally, we use extensive experiments to validate the efficiency of TROY.	centralized computing;experiment;message passing;mobile social network;peer-to-peer;randomized algorithm;randomness;read-write memory;strips;simulation;social graph;stationary process;steady state;transient state	Chi Zhang;Jun Luo	2014	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-014-0690-5	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;efficient energy use;computer security;computer network	Mobile	0.619798514411975	78.34860506743341	61976

These demands are hard to satisfy in the presence of unpredictable behavior in the environment such as interference, traffic congestion, etc. Algorithms based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) offer an effective approach to meet such challenges since they are well suited to the dynamic routing optimization and dynamic resource reassignment required by these applications. In this paper, the author presents a survey of Ant Colony Optimization variants applied to ad-hoc and optical networks. The ACO variant called AntHocNet in particular will be reviewed, analyzed, and criticized from the point of view of emergent applications for environment management such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

Important research contributions have been made on metaheuristics based on different techniques such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms and tabu search (Dréo, Pétrowski, Siarry, & Taillard, 2003). A number of studies have attempted to compare selected metaheuristics, such as ACO and genetic algorithms, in terms of their success in solving the same problem. Performance comparisons are not meaningless due to the instantiations of metaheuristics parameters, but comparisons based on their use in different application domains are more significant since the behavior and operation of a metaheuristic are often mapped naturally to the operations of specific applications. In this paper, we survey different alternatives of the ACO algorithms applied especially in the context of telecommunication networks such as ad-hoc and optical networks. In Hartenstein and Laberteaux (2010) many technologies are considerd for Ad-hoc networks for vehicles called vehicular networks to support ITS applications. Among existing ITS applications, we focus in this paper on improving road safety based on vehicular inter-communications for collision avoidance. More specifically, we study here the sophisticated ACO alternative called AntHocNet and compare it to other routing protocols for ad-hoc networks (Amita & Mayank, 2007). This paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we review the specific problems that arise in the complex applications we have in mind, and that metaheuristics should solve. In Section 3 we present the operation principles of the basic ACO algorithm, together with some of its extensions. Section 4 presents the AntHocNet algorithm and explains its behavior. Section 5 goes deeper into the analysis of AntHocNet according to complex applications requirements. A conclusion and future directions are presented in Section 6. 2. METAHEURISTICS FOR EMERGENT COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES Optimization problems are among the greatest challenges for emergent communication technologies, especially under conditions of multiple constraints and multicriteria optimization objectives. Metaheuristics are recognized as a powerful approach capable of optimizing the QoS of complex communication networks with challenging environments. Metaheuristic algorithms have been applied for this purpose in wireless networks, in ad-hoc and mobile networks, and in optical networks. We study specifically in this paper the AntHocNet metaheuristic dedicated to ad-hoc networks. 2.1. Metaheuristics for Wireless Networks Evolutionary computing approaches such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and ACO algorithms have been proposed to solve numerous optimization problems in the field of wireless networks including mobile ad-hoc networks (Montana & Redi, 2005), cognitive radio (Zhang, Xie, & Guiyang, 2008) and cellular networks (Meunier, Bachelet, Talbi, & Caminada, 2001). GAs can be extremely useful for automated selection of parameters for network optimization to meet multiple criteria (Guliashki, Toshey, & Korsemov, 2009), such as minimal transmission delay and energy saving. Within the area of wireless networks, the ACO algorithm has been studied particularly for dynamic routing. This algorithm is based on the perception of the quantities of what are called “pheromones” represented by a variable to be adapted in order to guide the search for the optimal path. Different variants of ACO have been defined for wireless and ad-hoc networks including ARA (Ant-based 13 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/survey-ant-colony-optimizationalgorithms/67331?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology.

Innovative techniques that improve energy efficiency to prolong the network lifetime are highly required. Clustering is an effective topology control approach in wireless sensor networks, which can increase scalability and lifetime. These networks require robust wireless communication protocols that are energy efficient and provide low latency. In this paper, we develop and analyze an efficient cooperative transmission protocol with robust clustering (RCCT) for sensor networks that considers a fault-tolerant and energy-efficient distributed clustering with minimum overhead. RCCT distributes energy load by energy-aware member selection for cooperative data transmission. Simulation results show a better performance of RCCT as compared to the conventional protocols.	cluster analysis;fault tolerance;overhead (computing);scalability;simulation;topology control	Mahbod Ghelichi;Seied Kazem Jahanbakhsh;Esmaeil Sanaei	2008	Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)	10.1109/ITNG.2008.204	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	8.413910703436287	79.46990671375924	62607

In node scheduling, only a minimum set of nodes needed for routing purposes (usually determined by a minimum connected dominating set, MCDS) are kept active. However, a very low density resulting from switching off nodes can adversely affect the performance of data delivery due to three factors. First, our analysis shows that at low density, the average path length increases by a factor more than previously thought. Second, protocols such as the Hop-By-Hop Broadcast (HHB) reliability scheme (which relies on high network degree for optimum performance) suffer. Third, with limited buffers at nodes, the overhead is more pronounced to the extent of making the network unstable. Using probabilistic models, we derive the relationship between network density and overhead based on the above factors and find the density conditions for minimum power consumption. We also propose a, fully distributed and message-optimal node scheduling algorithm with a constant approximation bound based on the concept of Virtual Connected Dominating Sets. The scheme can asymptotically achieve optimal density conditions while adapting to different network parameters.	algorithm;approximation;average path length;connected dominating set;control theory;hoc (programming language);hop;network packet;overhead (computing);routing;scheduling (computing);topology control	Budhaditya Deb;B.

This article addresses two key challenges in wireless sensor networks: in-network storage and distributed search. The need for these techniques arises from the inability to provide persistent, centralized storage and querying in many sensor networks. Centralized storage requires multihop transmission of sensor data to Internet gateways which can quickly drain battery-operated nodes.Constructing a storage and search system that satisfies the requirements of data-rich scientific applications is a daunting task for many reasons: (a) the data requirements may be large compared to available storage and communication capacity of resource-constrained nodes, (b) user requirements are diverse and range from identification and collection of interesting event signatures to obtaining a deeper understanding of long-term trends and anomalies in the sensor events, and (c) many applications are in new domains where a priori information may not be available to reduce these requirements.This article describes a lossy, gracefully degrading storage model. We believe that such a model is necessary and sufficient for many scientific applications since it supports both progressive data collection for interesting events as well as long-term in-network storage for in-network querying and processing. Our system demonstrates the use of in-network wavelet-based summarization and progressive aging of summaries in support of long-term querying in storage and communication-constrained networks. We evaluate the performance of our linux implementation and show that it achieves: (a) low communication overhead for multiresolution summarization, (b) highly efficient drill-down search over such summaries, and (c) efficient use of network storage capacity through load-balancing and progressive aging of summaries.	antivirus software;automatic summarization;centralized computing;computer data storage;data drilling;distributed web crawling;emoticon;fractal dimension;graceful exit;greedy algorithm;linux;load balancing (computing);lossy compression;multiresolution analysis;overhead (computing);persistence (computer science);polynomial-time approximation scheme;progressive scan;requirement;sensor;software deployment;storage model;user requirements document;wavelet;wavelet transform	Deepak Ganesan;Ben Greenstein;Deborah Estrin;John S.

In order to achieve such factors, challenges especially in a large city environment due to signal attenuation and a typically poor transmission coverage issues are investigated. Both issues are caused by the existence of obstacles (i.e., overpass constructions and buildings) and road level topology (i.e., a three-dimensional case). Thus, this paper investigates explicitly the horizontal and vertical transmission distances that apply in a three-dimensional case. These distances are covered by existing propagation models of a large city by modeling them as a log-distance path loss with obstacle fading. The scenario of the dedicated three-dimensional case is simulated through the introduction of Vertical Relative Angles (VRA) and Horizontal Relative Angles (HRA) as supporting factors for the forwarding decision. The evaluation shows that applying HRA and VRA reach higher delivery ratio and reduces relatively lower delay in a large city scenario.	algorithm;heidelberg research architecture;network packet;software propagation;transmission (bittorrent client)	Lisa Kristiana;Corinna Schmitt;Burkhard Stiller	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794600	simulation;telecommunications	Embedded	4.436174408357474	86.94772891606	62930

In this paper, we evaluate a scalable neighborhood discovery protocol, called SNDP, which has been specifically designed to detect the presence and status of neighbor nodes in IWMNs. SNDP adopts a hybrid, collaborative signaling strategy, in which mesh routers and clients adopt distinct signaling approaches and work together to detect neighbor nodes. The performance evaluation is conducted based on simulation results. Performance is evaluated with respect to signaling load, power consumption and neighborhood discovery time. By contrasting SNDP and OSLR, it is observed that SNDP has the potential to become a better choice than the current work in progress proposed by the IETF MANET working group.	mesh networking;optimized link state routing protocol;performance evaluation;router (computing);scalability;simulation;stationary process;wireless mesh network	Glêdson Elias da Silveira;Mateus Novaes;Gustavo Cavalcanti;Daniel Charles Ferreira Porto	2010	2010 24th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2010.101	wireless mesh network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	0.5754809221394874	83.2721780449647	62939

However, it can cause a large number of message exchanges and consequently degrades network performance. In this article, we propose a novel epidemic routing strategy called the Epidemic Message with Message List Advertisement (EM-MA) that exploits broadcasting nature of wireless medium and slotted time communication to reduce network congestion and nodes’ energy consumption without affecting the message delivery time. Additionally, we conduct intensive simulations to demonstrate and compare the performance of EM-MA with other existing routing strategies. The results show that EM-MA outperforms the existing routing strategies and is suitable to be used in DTN.

This paper investigates the communication between a UAV and a final control center (CC), using static relays located on the ground, to overcome the intermittent connectivity between the two end points, due to the UAV flight. Backpressure and FlashLinQ routing and scheduling algorithms are jointly applied to this scenario. Backpressure has been shown to be able stabilize any input traffic within the network capacity region without requiring knowledge of traffic arrival rates and channel state probabilities. FlashLinQ is used in the scheduling phase to derive a maximal feasible subset of links which can coexist on a given slot without causing harmful interference to each other. Moreover, to overcome the limit on long end-to-end delays of backpressure, we propose a modified algorithm, where relays are selected depending on their proximity to the CC and on the UAV trajectory. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that, compared to the benchmark solution based on backpressure, the proposed algorithm is able to reduce delay significantly without any loss in throughput gain.

The protocol provides three types of real-time communication services, namely, real-time unicast, real-time area-multicast and real-time area-anycast. SPEED is specifically tailored to be a stateless, localized algorithm with minimal control overhead. End-to-end soft real-time communication is achieved by maintaining a desired delivery speed across the sensor network through a novel combination of feedback control and non-deterministic geographic forwarding. SPEED is a highly efficient and scalable protocol for sensor networks where the resources of each node are scarce.

0505adfec3875422adeff2c284d39c81d02e2490	a (truly) local broadcast layer for unreliable radio networks	abstract mac layer;local broadcast;unreliability;radio network;dual graph	"""In this paper, we implement an efficient local broadcast service for the dual graph model, which describes communication in a radio network with both reliable and unreliable links. Our local broadcast service offers probabilistic latency guarantees for: (1) message delivery to all reliable neighbors (i.e., neighbors connected by reliable links), and (2) receiving some message when one or more reliable neighbors are broadcasting. This service significantly simplifies the design and analysis of algorithms for the otherwise challenging dual graph model. To this end, we also note that our solution can be interpreted as an implementation of the abstract MAC layer specification---therefore translating the growing corpus of algorithmic results studied on top of this layer to the dual graph model. At the core of our service is a seed agreement routine which enables nodes in the network to achieve """"good enough"""" coordination to overcome the difficulties of unpredictable link behavior. Because this routine has potential application to other problems in this setting, we capture it with a formal specification---simplifying its reuse in other algorithms. Finally, we note that in a break from much work on distributed radio network algorithms, our problem definitions (including error bounds), implementation, and analysis do not depend on global network parameters such as the network size, a goal which required new analysis techniques. We argue that breaking the dependence of these algorithms on global parameters makes more sense and aligns better with the rise of ubiquitous computing, where devices will be increasingly working locally in an otherwise massive network. Our push for locality, in other words, is a contribution independent of the specific radio network model and problem studied here."""	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;dual graph;formal specification;global network;locality of reference;network model;principle of good enough;ubiquitous computing	Nancy A.

Wireless nodes are assumed to have transmission power control with m discrete levels, and a clustering scheme is used in the adaptation to be energy efficient. Clusters are formed among the nodes in a distributed selforganized manner so that each node is a member of some cluster and within a cluster, each node can reach any other node with appropriate power level. Each cluster has a designated head node which acts as forwarding agent for its members and these head nodes form a supernode topology. We adapt an ad hoc network multicast protocol by executing it on this supernode topology. Multicast data will move from the sender to its cluster head, then along the supernode topology according to the results of the chosen multicast protocol, and finally from cluster head to receivers within their clusters. At every step, nodes use appropriate power level, 1 j m, to reach all the intended recipients. For more balanced way of depleting energy in the network, nodes take turn to become cluster heads.

Firstly, a forwarder set selection mechanism is proposed to avoid potential flow contention, thus alleviating possible congestion from the increased number of flows. Secondly, a Round-Robin packet sending fashion combined with batch-by-batch acknowledgement is introduced to provide reliability and improve throughput. Evaluations show that our protocol significantly outperforms a seminal opportunistic routing protocol, MORE, under both single and multiple flow scenarios.	mesh networking;routing;wireless mesh network	Haisheng Wu;Guijin Wang;Xinggang Lin	2010	IEICE Transactions		wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;order one network protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.8668487915043537	84.10554876041654	63407

In an RGDD group, a sender needs to reliably deliver a copy of data to all the receivers. Existing solutions either do not scale due to the large number of RGDD groups (e.g., IP multicast) or cannot efficiently use network bandwidth (e.g., end-host overlays).  Motivated by recent advances on data center network topology designs (multiple edge-disjoint Steiner trees for RGDD) and innovations on network devices (practical in-network packet caching), we propose Datacast for RGDD. Datacast explores two design spaces: 1) Datacast uses multiple edge-disjoint Steiner trees for data delivery acceleration. 2) Datacast leverages in-network packet caching and introduces a simple soft-state based congestion control algorithm to address the scalability and efficiency issues of RGDD.  Our analysis reveals that Datacast congestion control works well with small cache sizes (e.g., 125KB) and causes few duplicate data transmissions (e.g., 1.19%). Both simulations and experiments confirm our theoretical analysis. We also use experiments to compare the performance of Datacast and BitTorrent. In a BCube(4, 1) with 1Gbps links, we use both Datacast and BitTorrent to transmit 4GB data. The link stress of Datacast is 1.01, while it is 1.39 for BitTorrent. By using two Steiner trees, Datacast finishes the transmission in 16.9s, while BitTorrent uses 52s.	algorithm;bittorrent;cache (computing);data center;datacasting;experiment;gigabit;microsoft windows 1.0;multicast;multiple edges;network congestion;network packet;network topology;pervasive informatics;scalability;simulation;soft state;steiner tree problem	Jiaxin Cao;Chuanxiong Guo;Guohan Lu;Yongqiang Xiong;Yixin Zheng;Yongguang Zhang;Yibo Zhu;Chen Chen	2012	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1145/2413176.2413182	data center;real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;bittorrent;steiner tree problem;computer science;distributed computing;grouped data;network congestion;network topology;computer network;data transmission	Networks	-1.3600552905738157	79.29528805559386	63539

This work evaluates and contrasts mesh core based multicasting protocols (DCMP, PUMA and ASHFIK). The metrics used in this work include packet delivery ratio and total overhead. In addition, the performance is determined based on number of senders, node mobility and multicast group size. In this paper we found many similarities between the features of critical MANETs and the core based routing protocols and we could conclude that the adaptive secure headship forward induction keeping (ASHFIK) protocol was suitable for most critical MANETs scenarios.	disaster recovery;multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);puma (microarchitecture);radio frequency;requirement;routing	Tarek S.

However, precise location information may be unavailable due to the constraint in energy, computation, or terrain. Additionally, several applications can tolerate the diverse level of inaccuracy in such geographic information. Thus, this paper presents a direction-based localization scheme, DLS, whose main goal is for each sensor to determine its direction rather than its absolute position. The direction we are concerned with is the one relative to the sink. Motivated by the proposed spatial locality property, DLS considers multiple messages received for a sensor to determine its direction. Furthermore, a novel scheme, anchor deployment strategy, is also proposed for the improvement of the estimated correctness in direction of the sensor within the communication range of the sink. With the aid of the virtual dual direction coordinate (VDDC) system, DLS is able to efficiently and precisely position sensors around the axes. We evaluate DLS via simulations in terms of various numbers of sensors and communication ranges for the scenarios with different numbers of directions. The average correct rates in DLS reach approximately 94%, 86%, and 81% for the networks with 4, 8, and 16 directions, respectively. DLS achieves outstanding performance for the high density networks as well. In addition, DLS also works well regardless of the sink placement. Overall, simulation results validate the practicality of DLS, and show that DLS can effectively achieve direction estimation. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Since sensor nodes have limited resources, providing the sink location service through low overhead is an important challenging issue. To address this issue, in this letter, we propose a simple sink location service scheme based on circle and line paths. In the proposed scheme, a sink constructs a circle path of a Sink Location Announcement (SLA) message while a source node constructs a line path of a Sink Location Query (SLQ) message. Then, the proposed scheme guarantee that the SLQ line path and SLA circle path can have at least one crossing point. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior to other schemes in terms of control overhead.	geographic routing;location-based service;overhead (computing);service-level agreement;simulation	Euisin Lee;Fucai Yu;Soochang Park;Sang Ha Kim	2010	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2010.08.100451	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	3.8962601100892553	80.6585800723662	63883

However, desired behavior is not yet guaranteed in much larger networks based on pure self-organization. In this article, we propose a controlled potential-based routing protocol implementing a novel controlled self-organization scheme that also allows for external control. The scheme obtains close-to-optimal network behavior by this external control which controls a part of nodes in the network. We show that global traffic flow can be controlled through simulation experiments with a multi-sink sensor network. For example, traffic loads can be equalized among heterogeneously distributed sink nodes, and load balancing among the relay nodes based on remaining energy can bring an approximate four times extension of network lifetime. The proposed method is furthermore robust to message loss and resilient to failure of the sink node.	approximation algorithm;experiment;load balancing (computing);relay;routing;scalability;self-organization;simulation	Daichi Kominami;Masashi Sugano;Masayuki Murata;Takaaki Hatauchi	2013	TOSN	10.1145/2529920	embedded system;real-time computing;scalability;self-organization;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;robustness;computer network	Mobile	6.191677952693942	79.18698199814813	63894
357057c46b97c0cb31c6f7912853cfc23f854e3e	mobility based routing overhead management in reconfigurable wireless ad hoc networks		OF THE DISSERTATION Mobility-Based Routing Overhead Management in Reconfigurable Wireless Ad Hoc Networks Dissertation topic by Gikaru Wilfred Githuka Main Advisor: Prof. Dr. rer. nat. habil. Dr. h. c. Alexander Schill Routing Overheads are the non-data message packets whose roles are establishment and maintenance of routes for data packets as well as neighbourhood discovery and maintenance. They have to be broadcasted in the network either through flooding or other techniques that can ensure that a path exists before data packets can be sent to various destinations. They can be sent reactively or periodically to neighbours so as to keep nodes updated on their neighbourhoods. While we cannot do without these overhead packets, they occupy much of the limited wireless bandwidth available in wireless networks. In a reconfigurable wireless ad hoc network scenario, these packets have more negative effects, as links need to be confirmed more frequently than in traditional networks mainly because of the unpredictable behaviour of the ad hoc networks. We therefore need suitable algorithms that will manage these overheads so as to allow data packet to have more access to the wireless medium, save node energy for longer life of the network, increased efficiency, and scalability. Various protocols have been suggested in the research area. They mostly address routing overheads for suitability of particular protocols leading to lack of standardisation and inapplicability to other protocol classes. In this dissertation ways of ensuring that the routing overheads are kept low are investigated. The issue is addressed both at node and network levels with a common goal of improving efficiency and performance of ad hoc networks without dedicating ourselves to a particular class of routing protocol. At node level, a method hereby referred to as “link availability forecast”, that minimises routing overheads used for maintenance of neighbourhood, is derived. The targeted packets are packets that are broadcasted periodically (e.g. hello messages). The basic idea in this method is collection of mobility parameters from the neighbours and predictions or forecasts of these parameters in future. Using these parameters in simple calculations helps in identifying link availabilities between nodes participating in maintenance of network’s backbone. At the network level, various approaches have been suggested. The first approach is the cone flooding method that broadcasts route request messages through a predetermined cone shaped region. This region is determined through computation using last known mobility parameters of the destination. Another approach is what is hereby referred as “destination search reverse zone method”. In this method, a node will keep routes to destinations for a long time and use these routes for tracing the destination. The destination will then initiate route search in a reverse manner, whereby the source selects the best route for next delivery. A modification to this method is for the source node to determine the zone of route search and define the boundaries within which the packet should be broadcasted. The later method has been used for simulation purposes.	algorithm;computation;default route;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;network address translation;network packet;node (computer science);overhead (computing);recession cone;routing;scalability;simulation	Wilfred Githuka Gikaru	2004				Mobile	3.4394973070204338	83.42999889615375	64136

The high frequency of link errors between mobile nodes requires rapid recovery in order to provide acceptable performance, especially for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose CIFLER, a cross-layer approach which uses enhanced channel reservation messages to allow alternate nodes to immediately elect themselves using only inferred neighbor information. This self-election avoids reliance on individual links and minimizes the impact frequent link errors have on delay, energy usage, and the function of upper layer protocols. We show via simulation that CIFLER provides better results in typical MANET scenarios. Unlike other local recovery schemes, CIFLER does not suffer from duplicated messages, allows new nodes to almost immediately learn the information needed to assist in the recovery of existing routes, and does not require additional hardware, delays, or control messages	backoff;design rule for camera file system;link rot;real-time clock;real-time computing;routing;simulation	Justin Yackoski;Chien-Chung Shen	2006	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

The backbone network has parallel links between node pairs and supports multiple classes of traffic. The aim is to find the best routes for the different priority classes such that the total cost of network design is minimized and the delay bounds on the parallel links for different message classes are satisfied. A mixed integer programming formulation is presented for the problem and the solution procedure is described. Heuristics are suggested for obtaining feasible solutions to this problem. The goal is to come up with an efficient frontier by changing the delay bounds in order to give designers various choices of cost and delay to choose from.

Smart Dust can be very useful in practice i.e. in the local detection of a remote crucial event and the propagation of data reporting its realization. In this work we continue (see [4]) our effort towards the research on smart dust from a basic algorithmic point of view. Under a simple but realistic model for smart dust we present an interesting problem, which is how to propagate efficiently information on an event detected locally. Then we present a new smart dust protocol, which we call the “Sleep-Awake” protocol, for information propagation that explicitly uses the energy saving features (i.e. the alteration of sleeping and awake time periods) of the smart dust particles. By using both some simple probabilistic analysis and extensive experiments, we provide some first concrete results for the success probability and the time and energy efficiency of the protocol, in terms of parameters of the smart dust network. We note that the study of the interplay of these parameters allows us to program the smart dust network characteristics accordingly.	autonomous robot;backtrack;communications protocol;experiment;fault tolerance;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;requirement;software propagation	Ioannis Chatzigiannakis;Sotiris E.

Development of energy efficient data collection protocols became the major concern in WSN. Clustering is one of the suitable techniques for energy efficiency. However, in clustering, the cluster are formed with uneven size. This unbalances the energy consumption among clusters which in turn reduce the lifetime of the network. In this paper, in order to balance the energy among clusters, a multi-hop concept is introduced for both intra and inter cluster communication. Firstly, the RFDMRP: River Formation Dynamics based Multi-hop Routing Protocol has been proposed. Later, this protocol is integrated with clustering and a new hybrid technique, named as hybrid clustering communication algorithm using RFDMRP (HCCRFD) is introduced. HCCRFD improves energy conservation by reducing overall packet transmission distance of intra and inter cluster communication, which results in increased network lifetime. Energy consumption of proposed algorithm has been analyzed mathematically. Also, the algorithms were simulated using MATLAB and outputs observed. The observed outputs were compared with existing protocols such as LEACH, DEEC, ERA, and \(ACH^2\) in three different scenarios namely homogenous, heterogeneous environment, and node density. The comparison reveals that the proposed algorithm perform better than the existing protocols with respect to energy conservation and network lifetime.	algorithm;cluster analysis	Koppala Guravaiah;R.

SNOMC supports three different caching strategies namely caching on each intermediate node, caching on branching nodes, or caching on the sender node only. SNOMC was evaluated in our in-house real-world testbed and compared to a number of common data dissemination protocols.

A fault-recovery mechanism based on the Chord algorithm is used to retrieve location information of vehicles when the corresponding location services go out of service. The simulation analysis compares the performance of the proposed scheme with other two location based algorithms (GLS, HLS). The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the ILS scheme in terms of increased success ratios under different network topologies. We also found the ILS algorithm not only remains robust at high car speeds but also demonstrates higher scalability than the other two with respect to network size.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);location-based service;simulation	Yao-Jen Chang;Tai-Cheng Liao	2008		10.1145/1416222.1416276	vehicular ad hoc network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	HCI	2.554596222169001	84.89335677700586	64604

In this paper, performance evaluation of two network topologies based on routing strategies for train monitoring has been conducted in a realistic mesh sensing system. Results conducted in NS2 using Mannasim extension show that Multi-tier multi-hop topology outperforms the classic multi-hop topology in terms of end-to-end delay, throughput and residual energy level.	central processing unit;end-to-end principle;energy level;mesh networking;multitier architecture;network topology;performance evaluation;routing;sensor;sensor node;throughput	Oussama Drissi;Adel Omar Dahmane;Tayeb Medjeldi	2014		10.5220/0004697200820086	wireless routing protocol;wireless sensor network;link-state routing protocol;computer network;dynamic source routing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer science;mobile wireless sensor network;distributed computing	Mobile	2.927001680624999	79.78944707647325	64625

The unbalanced power consumption among sensor nodes may cause network partition. This paper proposes efficient node placement, topology control, and MAC scheduling protocols to prolong the sensor network lifetime, balance the power consumption of sensor nodes, and avoid collision. Firstly, a virtual tree topology is constructed based on Grid-based WSNs. Then two node-placement techniques, namely Distance-based and Density-based deployment schemes, are proposed to balance the power consumption of sensor nodes. Finally, a collision-free MAC scheduling protocol is proposed to prevent the packet transmissions from collision. In addition, extension of the proposed protocols are made from a Grid-based WSN to a randomly deployed WSN, enabling the developed energy-balanced schemes to be generally applied to randomly deployed WSNs. Simulation results reveal that the developed protocols can efficiently balance each sensor node’s power consumption and prolong the network lifetime in both Grid-based and randomly deployed WSNs. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Group (i.e., many-to-many) multicasting is a demanding service since any member can become a sender independently from the others. We consider a shared tree as the backbone of a group multicasting session. Considering each multicast session in isolation and independently may cause congestion on some links and reduce network utilization. Thus, we define the multicast packing problem in which the network tries to accommodate simultaneously all the multicast groups while trying to avoid bottlenecks on the links for higher throughput (i.e., minimize the maximum link sharing among multicast groups). Minimization of maximum congestion is achieved at the expense of increasing the size of some multicast trees which in turn impacts the delay. This trade-off is addressed by adding a penalty term to the objective function of the optimal packing formulation. The penalty term is a function of the amount of dilation from the size of the optimal tree obtained for each group multicast independently from the others (i.e., in isolation). Since the mathematical programming formulation for the optimization problem is computationally intractable, we resort to suboptimal solutions with heuristics. Our heuristic method aims to reduce the sharing of a link while ensuring that the size of multicast trees will never exceed /spl alpha/OPT/sup k/ where OPT/sup k/ is the size of the optimum tree for multicast group k in isolation. Optimum multicast tree for each group (in isolation) is computed by using cutting-plane inequalities and the branch-and-cut algorithm. In order to evaluate the performance of our approximation, we derive lower bounds on the problem. Our first lower bound on the maximum congestion is a theoretical one and puts a cap on the following two constructive lower bounds. The lower bounds and the heuristic method are implemented and it is shown that the maximum congestion obtained by the heuristic method is quite close to the constructive lower bounds.	multicast;set packing	Shiwen Chen;Oktay Günlük;Bülent Yener	2000	IEEE/ACM Trans.

Because the sink's location as the destination in geographic routing is changed dynamically, sinks' location should be propagated continuously though the sensor field for sensor's future data report. However this frequent location updates can drain up the sensor's battery power and increase wireless channel contentions. As a support to the mobile sinks, we proposed locators for mobile sinks that track current sinks' location. If a sensor reports sensed data to sinks later, it can acquire sinks' location from the locators. The locators are uniformly distributed uniformly to the sensor fields by hash bashed structured replication. Sinks update own location only immediate locators and other locators are fed location information by locators self location propagation. We implemented our locator protocol with network simulator-2 and compared previous work TTDD, a two-tier data dissemination.

As the nodes are small components that suffer from very limited energy resources, several researches carried out at the MAC layer in order to minimize energy costs. The techniques based on periodic active/passive mode are energy efficient, but the node can not adapt the behavior of the transceiver according to the network traffic. Our approach aims to reduce the latency without increasing energy consumption. We propose to manage the radio in a dynamic way according to ON/OFF Markov model. The passage from passive to active mode is set according to the transition probability from OFF to ON state. Based on this probability, we give the period that the transceiver can stay in sleep mode. Through simulation we show that the proposed technique outperforms the well known MAC protocol for WSN.

Vehicles traveling can act as mobile sensors and collect a variety of information that can be used to enable various new services such as environment monitoring, traffic management, urban surveillance, and so on. In this paper, we present “adaptive Anycasting solution for Vehicular Environments” (AVE), which is a message delivery protocol that combines geographical and topological information to dynamically adapt its behavior to network conditions. We focus on vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity for cloud services, where the vehicles send the sensed information as individual and independent messages to a cloud service in the Internet. This scenario requires access to any available close-by roadside unit, thus making anycasting the ideal delivery mechanism. Simulations results show that the hybrid and adaptive approach of AVE is able to improve network performance. For example, regarding delivery ratio, AVE outperforms DYMO by 10% in sparse scenarios and outperforms delay-tolerant networking techniques by 10% in dense scenarios.	cloud computing;communications protocol;computer simulation;delay-tolerant networking;immutable object;network performance;networked society;openstreetmap;sensor;software propagation;sparse matrix	Miguel Baguena;Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate;Juan-Carlos Cano;Pietro Manzoni	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2447505	vehicular ad hoc network;routing;computer science;engineering;sensor;adaptive behavior;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.249530636465951	80.07814963929418	65046

Traditional routing algorithms are not adequate to handle the QoS requirements of these applications. Therefore, designing routing algorithms that optimizes multiple QoS requirements is one of the major issues in High-Speed Networks (HSN). QoS Routing is defined as finding paths satisfying multiple QoS constraints. It is a Multi-Constrained Path (MCP) Problem which is NP-complete and cannot be solved in polynomial time. Various heuristics and approximation algorithms have been proposed to solve multi-constrained QoS routing problem. In this paper we will discuss various QoS routing issues followed by review of some important heuristic algorithms developed to solve multi-constrained QoS routing problems.	approximation algorithm;heuristic (computer science);np-completeness;polynomial;quality of service;requirement;routing;time complexity	Monika Jena;Ajay Rana	2012		10.1145/2393216.2393245	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;mathematical optimization;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Theory	-3.430847832030471	82.7929163304817	65050

However, humans are socially selfish and tend to cooperate with whom they have a social relationship, fact that affects the overall performance. Memory space is a critical resource on mobile devices, and since the intermediate nodes have to store the messages, buffer management strategy becomes a crucial factor to achieve a satisfactory network performance. Very little attention has been directed towards applying the social characteristics of the users to mitigate the congestion in DTN. This paper presents a buffer management strategy for DTNs that takes into account a value associated with the social relationship strength among the users. We evaluated this policy in conjunction with the Epidemic and PRoPHET routing algorithms. By means of a thoroughly planned set of steady-state simulation experiments, we found that the proposed scheme can increase the delivery rate besides decreasing the average delay.	algorithm;computational resource;delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end principle;experiment;mobile device;network congestion;network performance;routing;simulation;social engineering (security);steady state	Camilo Batista Souza;Edjair de Souza Mota;Leandro Galvao;Pietro Manzoni;Juan-Carlos Cano	2014		10.1145/2684083.2684089	simulation;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	4.941008807910344	84.62360921688246	65363

We outline a comprehensive design of such an emergency vehicle warning system that makes full use of inter-vehicle communication, but also encompasses roadside infrastructure like traffic lights. In our system, other vehicles are not simply warned of an approaching emergency vehicle; they also receive detailed route information. Based on this information, timely and appropriate reaction of other drivers is possible. A prototype of our system has been tested in a traffic environment including emergency vehicles and traffic lights. To identify requirements and evaluate our system, we also conducted a detailed analysis of videos from emergency response trips and an expert survey among members of a local emergency response organization.	computer security;intelligent car initiative;inter-process communication;on-board data handling;privacy;prototype;relay;requirement;scalability;simulation;software deployment;video content analysis	Andreas Buchenscheit;Florian Schaub;Frank Kargl;Michael Weber	2009	2009 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2009.5416384	use case;wireless ad hoc network;simulation;network switch;computer science;traffic conflict;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.335022849284449	74.84072442227261	65460
df71a0f78d1109d7be5536cc1296e838c5255533	a priority rate-based routing protocol for wireless multimedia sensor networks		The development of sensor hardware have made it possible to transmit real time multimedia data over a wireless medium using tiny resource constrained sensors. However, in current wireless sensor networks, multimedia traffic which has stringent bandwidth and delay requirements is not distinctively differentiated from other data types during transmission which makes it difficult to meet its service requirements. Next generation wireless sensor networks are predicted to deploy a different model where service is allocated depending on the nature of data to be transmitted. Applying traditional wireless sensor routing algorithms to wireless multimedia sensor networks may lead to high delay and poor visual quality for multimedia applications. In this paper, we propose a priority based rate routing protocol that assigns priorities to traffic depending on their service requirements. We study, the performance of our proposed routing algorithm for real time traffic when mixed with three non real time traffic but with different priorities: high, medium and low priority. Initial results from the simulation show that the proposed algorithm performs better compared to two existing algorithms PCCP and CCF in terms of delay, loss and throughput.

In this context, adaptive routing is essential in order to ensure safe and timely data delivery in building evacuation and fire fighting resource applications. Existing routing mechanisms for wireless sensor networks are not well suited for building fires, especially as they do not consider critical and dynamic network scenarios. In this paper, an emergency-adaptive, real-time and robust routing protocol is presented for emergency situations such as building fire hazard applications. The protocol adapts to handle dynamic emergency scenarios and works well with the routing hole problem. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that our protocol provides a real-time routing mechanism that is well suited for dynamic emergency scenarios in building fires when compared with other related work.

Analytic hierarchy process is used in conjunction with fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to classifying nodes’ behavior according to their motion state, so that the design complexity of networking protocols can be simplified and different set of networking protocols that best fit the circumstances can be disigned correspondingly. The scheme is applied under an example network for rescue, where different routing policies are used by corresponding nodes classified by proposed node behavior classification scheme.

1c1d89d58a0ca2c2760d62d8e1ca606a10ab2baa	selective route based on snr with cross-layer scheme in wireless ad hoc network		In this study, we developed network and throughput formulation models and proposed new method of the routing protocol algorithm with a cross-layer scheme based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This method is an enhancement of routing protocol ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV). This proposed scheme uses selective route based on the SNR threshold in the reverse route mechanism. We developed AODV SNR-selective route (AODV SNR-SR) for a mechanism better than AODV SNR, that is, the routing protocol that used average or sum of path SNR, and also better than AODV which is hop-count-based. We also used selective reverse route based on SNR mechanism, replacing the earlier method to avoid routing overhead. The simulation results show that AODV SNR-SR outperforms AODV SNR and AODV in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, and routing overhead. This proposed method is expected to support Device-to-Device (D2D) communications that are concerned with the quality of the channel awareness in the development of the future Fifth Generation (5G).

Different types of service discovery architectures are distinguished by the extent that service coordinators (SCs) are implemented in the network. SCs are nodes that hold a central repository for the caching of service attributes and bindings of servers located in its neighborhood. This paper describes and investigates the performance of different architectures in terms of service availability, messaging overhead and latency. The architectures are analyzed and evaluated based on a large range of parameters. The paper also shows that in an on-demand MANET, where the service discovery mechanism will have a direct impact on the reactive routing protocol, the routing effects influence the evaluation result.

Relevant dutycycling (or sleep scheduling) algorithm has been actively studied at MAC, routing, and application levels. Low power listening (LPL) MAC is one of effective dutycycling techniques. This paper proposes a novel approach called dual wake-up LPL (DW-LPL). Existing LPL scheme uses a preamble detection method for both broadcast and unicast, thus suffers from severe overhearing problem at unicast transmission. DW-LPL uses a different wake-up method for unicast while using LPL-like method for broadcast; DW-LPL introduces a receiverinitiated method in which a sender waits a signal from receiver to start unicast transmission, which incurs some signaling overhead but supports flexible adaptive listening as well as overhearing removal effect. Through analysis and Mote (Telosb) experiment, we show that DW-LPL provides more energy saving than LPL and our adaptive listening scheme is effective for energy conservation in practical network topologies and traffic patterns.	algorithm;digimon world;dreamwidth;microwave;network topology;overhead (computing);routing;scheduling (computing);sensor node;unicast;waits	Jongkeun Na;Sangsoon Lim;Chong-kwon Kim	2008	EURASIP J.

In this paper, a novel intrusion detection architecture for energy-constrained mobile Ad-hoc networks is proposed, in which the network detection module is optional. Monitoring nodes are selected by activating the network detection model to work. A selection scheme of monitoring nodes called Event Triggering Based Adaptive Selection (ETBAS) is also proposed, which introduces the mechanism of monitoring states and the method of event triggering. Triggering events, for example, a node has been voted to be a monitoring node by its neighbors, the battery power of a monitoring node has consumed to a threshold, or the networks topology has changed, can activate a non-monitoring node, or make a monitoring node fall asleep. High connectivity and energy resource are balanced in ETBAS for adaptive selection scheme, which is adaptable to dynamically changing networks and enhances the network lifetime.	hoc (programming language);intrusion detection system;network topology	Chuan-xiang Ma;Ze-ming Fang	2009	2009 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology and Security Informatics	10.1109/IITSI.2009.54	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	8.14645903098437	78.64235191248298	65969
d68f9bd4930bcdcfa316555a81dd9448409e83dc	an energy efficient protocol to mitigate hot spot problem using unequal clustering in wsn	wireless sensor network;cluster head;grid;unequal clustering;data mule;hot spot	In multihop scenarios, the sensor nodes nearer to the base station (BS) are overloaded because they handle their own data as well as the information obtained from far away nodes. This induces a higher energy depletion rate in nodes near to the BS causing early death of these nodes resulting in hot spot/energy hole problem in wireless sensor network (WSN). This paper proposes a novel strategy using unequal fixed grid-based cluster along with a mobile data mule for data collection from the cluster head (CH). A CH is selected in such a manner that the cumulative transmission distance for member nodes within the cluster is minimum. The paper has attempted to optimize the values for CH change time or round number (f) and also established a relationship between different size clusters by using a factor (r), as they are playing an important role in the overall performance improvement of the WSN. Integrating a mobile data mule in the protocol enhances its efficiency of handling hot spot problem and makes it more energy effective. Two different WSN-scenarios have been considered based on the movement pattern of the data mule. The results obtained through simulation in both scenarios prove the success of our scheme in terms of energy efficiency, load balancing and network lifetime as compared to the existing protocols. The paper also providing a balance trade-off between delay and high overheads by using a single mule with simple predefined path. It also minimizes the hot spot problem as it sustains more than 3000 rounds, which is far better than the existing methods.

Furthermore, for the sake of route discovery or the acquisition of a target location, they usually need extra localization equipments or beacon exchanges to obtain the geographic location of each sensor node or construct a coordinate system for sensor nodes, which imports extra costs to routing algorithms. In this paper, firstly we propose a novel system model that can comprehensively depict the service requirements of multimedia applications, and on the basis of this system model, we design a new multi-constrained routing algorithm, MCRA, for multimedia communications in sensor networks. MCRA not only can provide end-to-end delay guarantee and packet loss ratio guarantee for multimedia communications, but also can balance and improve the energy consumption in sensor nodes. Besides, MCRA adopts several effective policies to suppress message flooding and lessen data redundancy. In MCRA, neither the acquisition of target location nor the route discovery process requires any extra measurement equipment or coordinate system based on location message exchange, however, the target location we concern can be easily figured out by a localization scheme without message exchange. In addition, we may optionally apply MAC multicast and differentiation service in MCRA so as to further lower its control message overhead and differentiate forwarding priority levels for real-time data and best-effort traffic in MAC layer. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments are provided to validate our claims.

This method can retain the merits of geographic routing at the absence of exact location knowledge. However, these solutions may present low energy-efficiency and unacceptable delays in real networks since they seldom consider the impacts of low duty-cycling and link unreliability on routing. Furthermore, geographic advancement of forwarding in hopcount based coordinates is very unreliable and even towards the reverse direction. In this work, average power cost to the sink of each node is considered together with hop-count to build a finegrained logical coordinates, which can help forward packets towards the direction of sink more accurately. Then we propose an energy-efficient integrated MAC/routing (EEMR) protocol for event-driven and time-critical applications based on new logical coordinates. The optimal relay is elected in each hop dynamically, where the objective is to optimize forwarding energy-efficiency on the premise that end-to-end delay is restricted under the predefined upper bound. Analysis and extensive simulations are given to demonstrate the superiority of EEMR by comparing its performance against existing solutions.

To this end, we propose to pipeline transmissions on multiple channels. Ripple uses a novel packet-based channel assignment to eliminate the time overhead occurring in traditional node-based channel assignment procedures. Moreover, if we apply the Reed-Solomon (RS) erasure code to Ripple, it pushes the reliability close to 100%, surpassing Glossy, being nonetheless computationally practical for TelosB motes. Still, the throughput after error coding doubles, or even triples that of the state-of-the-art reliable data dissemination protocol Splash. By tuning the transmission interval, Ripple balances between high throughput and high reliability, thus suiting an array of network broadcast applications with various QoS requirements.	cyclic redundancy check;data rate units;denial-of-service attack;duplex (telecommunications);erasure code;error detection and correction;high-throughput computing;interference (communication);network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;reed–solomon error correction;requirement;ripple;splash (conference);testbed;throughput	Dingwen Yuan;Matthias Hollick	2015	2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2015.7158133	communications protocol;throughput;telecommunications;computer science;reliability;pipeline transport;computer security;encoding;statistics;computer network	Mobile	9.266241022665527	88.23383026343309	66263

A pilot deployment is in progress in a coastal Indian village. This will improve the quality of life of the financially constrained marine fishermen who spend 5--7 days offshore on average for a single fishing trip; it will also help in their safety and security. The architecture employs multiple long range Wi-Fi (LR Wi-Fi) based infrastructure networks stitched together as backhaul. The access network consists of Ethernet and Wi-Fi mesh. The fishermen connect to the on board Wi-Fi access point cum router using their smart phones and are able to use all the apps and services on their smart phone. While the primary infrastructure network uses onshore base stations, the secondary infrastructure networks use boats as mobile base stations. Three field trials were conducted over the ocean using one onshore base station and two mid-sized boats known as trawlers. The performance of both primary and secondary infrastructure networks was assessed during these field trials. This paper describes the impressive results obtained in assessing the performance of the secondary infrastructure network.	access network;backhaul (telecommunications);deploy;internet;lr parser;mesh networking;network architecture;router (computing);smartphone;software deployment;the quality of life;wireless access point;research center	Dhanesh Raj;Vickram Parthasarathy;Sethuraman N.

It is expected that these small devices, referred to as sensors, will be mass-produced and deployed, making their production cost negligible. Due to their small form factor and modest non-renewable energy budget, individual sensors are not expected to be GPS-enabled. Moreover, in most applications, exact geographic location is not necessary, and all that the individual sensors need is a coarse-grain location awareness. The task of acquiring such a coarse-grain location awareness is referred to as training. In this paper, two scalable energy-efficient training protocols are proposed for massively-deployed sensor networks, where sensors are initially anonymous and unaware of their location. The training protocols are lightweight and simple to implement; they are based on an intuitive coordinate system imposed onto the deployment area which partitions the anonymous sensors into clusters where data can be gathered from the environment and synthesized under local control. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed solutions drastically improve energy efficiency and link layer delay for broadcast packets. Moreover, the proposed solutions are backward compatible with ContikiMAC and provide high reliability against frame reception errors.

Most of the existing schemes for the issue tend to construct a static detour path to bypass a hole. The static detour path may lead to uneven energy consumption of the nodes on the perimeter of the hole; thus it may enlarge the hole. At the same time, traffic would concentrate on the peripheral node of the hole; thus the nodes on the perimeter of the hole tend to be depleted quickly. In previous work, we have proposed a hole geometric model to reduce the energy consumption and packet collisions of the nodes on the hole boundary. This scheme, however, still has the static detour path problem. Therefore, we extend the previous work by constructing a dynamic detour path hole geometric model for wireless sensor networks in this paper. The location of hole detour anchor is dynamically shifted according to Gaussian function, just generating dynamic hole detour paths.	algorithm;download;emoticon;geographic routing;geometric modeling;network packet;overhead (computing);perimeter;peripheral	Ye Tian;Fucai Yu;Younghwan Choi;Soochang Park;Euisin Lee;Min-Sook Jin;Sang Ha Kim	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.442	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	5.747950094313133	80.60933392882436	66365

The determination of the coefficients in the connection weights is the most critical issue in the design and simulation of Hopfield NN models. In our studies, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers, which permits these coefficients to vary dynamically along with the evolution of the system state.

It becomes more effective due to the broadcast nature of wireless link, where a message transmitted from one source is inherently received by all one-hop receivers, and therefore, there is no need to transmit the message one by one. Reliable multicast in WSNs is desirable for critical tasks like code updation and query based data collection. The erroneous nature of wireless medium coupled with limited resource of sensor nodes, makes the design of reliable multicast protocol a challenging task. In this work, we propose a time division multiple access (TDMA) based energy aware media access and control (TEA-MAC) protocol for reliable multicast in WSNs. The TDMA eliminates collisions, overhearing and idle listening, which are the main sources of reliability degradation and energy consumption. Furthermore, the proposed protocol is parametric in the sense that it can be used to trade-off reliability with energy and delay as per the requirement of the underlying applications. The performance of TEA-MAC has been evaluated by simulating it using Castalia network simulator. Simulation results show that TEA-MAC is able to considerably improve the performance of multicast communication in WSNs.	elegant degradation;multicast;norm (social);retransmission (data networks);simulation;tea	Ashutosh Bhatia;R.

410de8e01de948f43952c0a768ffc843c3d0a0ad	energy-efficient transmission strategy with cluster organization phase to improve energy saving in wsns		Recently, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has drawn serious attention to the researchers. The most important challenge of WSN is how to extend its lifetime. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient multihop transmission strategy with organization cluster phase. During this phase, we try to choose the cluster head node which allows communicating with the other nodes with possible minimum energy and classify the remaining nodes into two groups. We consider a WSN organized into clusters, each cluster is composed of N sensor nodes classified as follows: source node, elected CH node as the destination, group of active nodes and group of sleeping nodes. When a source node detects relevant information in the network, it tries to transmit it to the cluster head via a cooperative or non-cooperative transmission. The transmission is supposed to be correct only if the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the receiver is above a threshold ãth. The main objective of our work is to define a new transmission technique minimizing the power consumption. It is a multihop transmission technique where the selected relays which cooperate in the transmission are those offering the least transmit power while maintaining SNR equal to the threshold ãth. Therefore the proposed transmission technique can reduce enormously the power consumption compared with direct transmission and the transmission where the CH node is chosen randomly within the cluster. Simulations results demonstrate that adding an organization cluster phase before transmitting data significantly increases the energy savings.	computer cluster;computer simulation;downtime;randomness;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Maha Abderrahim;Hela Hakim;Hatem Boujemaa	2018	2018 32nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (WAINA)	10.1109/WAINA.2018.00142	computer science;transmitter power output;distributed computing;wireless sensor network;computer network;cluster (physics);cluster analysis;energy consumption;efficient energy use;transmission (mechanics);signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	9.420344125541828	80.637671372883	66634

The characteristics of MANETs in general and sparse, delay-tolerant networks in particular, make the task of maintaining and disseminating metadata across all nodes difficult, particularly in the presence of scarce resources. We have designed and implemented three protocols which use different approaches to metadata dissemination: epidemic one-to-one routing, one-to-many broadcasting that utilises the characteristics of the shared radio medium of wireless networks, and the semantic protocol where a group consisting of e.g. rescue team leaders is given priority in the dissemination process and afterwards serves as multiple starting points for further dissemination. In the MIDAS project we produce middleware that speeds up MANET application development. By prototyping the metadata management component of MIDAS and testing the prototype with each of the three protocols in the network emulator environment NEMAN, we have measured bandwidth usage and performance. The implemented broadcast protocol is measured to use substantially less bandwidth than epidemic routing. The semantic protocol shows that the group indeed gets priority; it is comparable to the broadcast protocol in terms of bandwidth usage. The broadcast protocol has been used successfully in field tests of the middleware.	broadcast domain;dataspaces;emulator;hoc (programming language);middleware;one-to-many (data model);one-to-one (data model);prototype;routing;sparse matrix	Ellen Munthe-Kaas;Aslak Johannessen;Matija Puzar;Thomas Plagemann	2009	2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware	10.1109/MDM.2009.37	mobile ad hoc network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	2.604182758142216	81.0681312227577	66687

We review the routing strategies developed recently in the field of physics and show that the traffic can be significantly improved by the adaptive routing approaches. Comparing with the shortest path approach, the adaptive routing approaches can reduce the over-loading of hub nodes and thus increase the capacity of network. Especially, for the realistic situation with fluctuated traffic, the local self-adjusting traffic awareness protocol can efficiently reduce the traffic congestion. These results provide new insight in sustaining the normal function of Internet.	internet;network congestion;routing;shortest path problem;usb hub	Zonghua Liu;Ming Tang;Pak Ming Hui	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02469-6_27	policy-based routing;private network-to-network interface;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;combinatorics;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;adaptive routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;mathematics;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;shortest path problem;path vector protocol;algorithm;routing information protocol	Networks	-0.33868980749466576	81.46186046369803	66711

This paper targets at addressing two fundamental questions related to application-layer multi- source multicast: how many sources can be simultaneously served and how in reality can such a service be effectively provided. Considering the high bandwidth requirement and potential huge control overhead, in this paper we construct a single distribution tree shared by all the sources. Theoretically, we prove that the optimal single shared tree solution can serve at least m -1 sources, where m is the maximum number of sources that can be supported in the system with any number of trees. Practically, we propose a distributed protocol for tree construction and tree refinement so as to approach the theoretical optimal. The simulation results manifest that our proposed heuristic protocol significantly increases the number of sources that can be served in multi-source sessions and the result approaches to the optimal solution.	heuristic;internet access;multi-source;multicast;overhead (computing);refinement (computing);simulation	Juncheng Jia;Qian Zhang	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.199	communications protocol;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;communication in small groups;protocol independent multicast;computer science;theoretical computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;application layer;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Theory	-3.1392307713196965	86.04490084582228	66880

Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) is not appropriate for such WMNs, because flooding-based route discovery is both redundant and very expensive in terms of control message overhead. In this paper, we propose a directional AODV (D-AODV) routing protocol based on hop count to a gateway. In the route discovery to a gateway, D-AODV can reduce the number of broadcasting route request (RREQ) packets by using a restricted directional flooding technique. Simulation results showed that D-AODV could significantly reduce routing overhead by RREQ packets and enhance overall throughput performance.	hoc (programming language);mesh networking;network packet;overhead (computing);routing;simulation;stationary process;throughput;wireless mesh network	Anh-Ngoc Le;Dong-Won Kum;Sung-Hyup Lee;You Ze Cho;In-Soo Lee	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394647	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;supernetwork;border gateway protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;routing protocol;computer security;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.3368878267358233	83.82640976547185	67025

In this paper, we address the problem of group access in secure multicast communications for wireless ad hoc networks. We argue that energy expenditure is a scarce resource for the energy-limited ad hoc network devices and introduce a crosslayer approach for designing energy-efficient, balanced key distribution trees to perform key management. To conserve energy, we incorporate the network topology (node location), the “power proximity” between network nodes and the path loss characteristics of the medium in the key distribution tree design. We develop new algorithms for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous environments and derive their computational complexity. We present simulation studies showing the improvements achieved for three different but common environments of interest, thus illustrating the need for cross-layer design approaches for security in wireless networks.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;focal (programming language);hoc (programming language);key distribution;key management;maxima and minima;network topology;performance evaluation;secure multicast;simulation;software propagation	Loukas Lazos;Radha Poovendran	2007	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-006-6057-9	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;information security;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.571232980553431	80.97631136564293	67351
c88c9fa1ad99274ba3c79d5287731d9698485a7d	adaptive forwarding of mhealth data in challenged networks		With the advancements in mobile sensors and health-care technologies, mobile health (mHealth) services are growing in demand. However, the deployment of mHealth's applications in rural and underdeveloped areas remains a major challenge, despite the investments made, largely due to unreliable communication infrastructures. In this paper, we propose delivering mHealth data in a highly disruptive wireless network using resource-limited mobile devices. We build on state-of-the-art opportunistic/DTN solutions, and propose two dynamic schemes that adapt to the level of congestion in the network. Our adaptive forwarding schemes dynamically tune data replication at forwarder nodes by engaging the most appropriate forwarding strategy at any given state, while incurring minimal overhead. In order to achieve such a goal, we propose a reactive and proactive approach to detecting or predicting congestion in the network respectively. We perform a set of data-driven simulations to compare the performance of our proposed schemes with state-of-the-art DTN forwarding algorithms. Our results show that our schemes achieve better delivery ratio for realistic mHealth applications in challenged networking environments.	algorithm;delay-tolerant networking;mhealth;mobile device;network congestion;overhead (computing);proactive parallel suite;reactive planning;replication (computing);sensor;simulation;software deployment	Ahmed Emam;Abderrahmen Mtibaa;Khaled A.

Higher visibility usually implies more resource consumption. As sensor networks are resource-constrained and need to operate unattended for long periods, a balance between a sufficient level of visibility and a tolerable consumption of resources needs to be found so that enough evidence can be collected to analyze the causes of observed problems. We propose a mechanism called visibility levels (vLevels) to manage the trade-off between visibility and resource consumption. Preliminary experimental results show the feasibility of vLevels.	debugging	Junyan Ma;Kay Römer	2010		10.1145/1869983.1870061	embedded system;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security	AI	9.40778964419303	77.10115870449697	67744
80a673ab8d51837c9a442aa13f043b3d55c3c7fa	protocols for mitigating blackhole attacks in delay tolerant networks	black hole;tailgating node;malicious node;security	High node mobility and infrequent connectivity in delay tolerant networks (DTNs) makes it challenging to implement traditional security algorithms for detecting malicious nodes. In DTN, most of the routing algorithms are based on the announcement of routing metrics like probability of delivery, contact strength or social group strength by the nodes in contact. Blackhole in DTN exploits these characteristics of routing protocols and either announces a high value of these metrics or tries to attain a high value for them by following fast, repeated movement patterns. Dynamic social grouping (DSG) based routing algorithm shows that social behavior of nodes helps to make better forwarding decisions and to achieve highest message delivery ratio amongst other existing routing algorithms. We examine the impact of blackholes, intermittent blackholes and tailgating attack on DSG. We propose a suit of three solutions. Our first solution detects blackholes and tailgating malicious nodes in the network, however, is not suitable for intermittent blackholes. Second solution handles intermittent blackholes and performs well when the nodes are well connected. The third and final solution handles intermittent blackholes in sparsely connected as well as in well-connected networks. In all proposed solutions, blackholes are not able to degrade the performance of the protocols by changing their geographical locations. We demonstrate through simulation that our protocols improve upon the message delivery ratio over the existing solutions. An appropriate protocol from the suit may be used depending upon an application.	algorithm;docsis set-top gateway;delay-tolerant networking;overhead (computing);piggybacking (security);routing;sensor;simulation	Preeti Nagrath;Sandhya Aneja;Neelima Gupta;Sanjay Kumar Madria	2016	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-015-0959-3	black hole;telecommunications;computer science;information security;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.6723700180642846	83.54989287749112	67964

Most current congestion control algorithms try to alleviate the congestion by reducing the rate at which the source nodes inject packets into the network. However, this traffic control scheme always decreases the throughput so as to violate fidelity level required by the application. In this paper, we present a solution that sufficiently exert the idle or under-loaded nodes to alleviate congestion and improve the overall throughput. To achieve this goal, a traffic-aware dynamic routing(TADR) algorithm is proposed to route packets around the congestion areas and scatter the excessive packets along multiple paths consisting of idle and under-loaded nodes. Enlightened by the concept of potential in common physics, our TADR algorithm is designed through constructing a mixed potential field using depth and normalized queue length to force the packets to steer clear of obstacles created by congestion and eventually move towards the sink. The simulation results show that our solution achieves its objectives and improves the overall throughput by around 370% as compared to the benchmark routing protocol. Furthermore, our TADR has low overhead suitable for large scale dense sensor networks.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);end-to-end principle;experiment;internet backbone;network congestion;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;requirement;routing;scalability;shortest path problem;simulation;throughput	Tao He;Fengyuan Ren;Chuang Lin;Sajal K.

They also lack the ability to emulate the multi-radio environment.

We developed a prototype wireless sensor device that is capable of streaming video data through its wireless interface. Our experiments results showed that wireless sensor networks perform poorly with existing networking stack for such applications due to long delivery path and small transmission buffer sizes on the relaying nodes. The effect of a poor link often propagates backwards upstream and causes unnecessary data retransmission. To overcome these problems, we proposed a pipelined transmission scheme with a novel flow control method that monitors local buffer levels. A secondary buffer scheme is also used to reduce the retransmission overhead caused by node failure. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly increase the network efficiency. We also propose a novel stochastic route discovery algorithm for multiple video stream in wireless sensor networks. Our method uses a probing stage where possible routes are explored and their delivery performance recorded. The data collected during the probing stage are used to select the final routes.	algorithm;buffer overflow;control system;experiment;flow control (data);heuristic;network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);protocol stack;prototype;retransmission (data networks);routing;simulation;streaming media;testbed;throughput	Ju Wang;Mbonisi Masilela;Jonathan C.

999ac13c2194ad7c86516177bd6719c49132555a	enhanced clustering routing protocol for power-efficient gathering in wireless sensor network		Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a new and fast advancing technology, which is opening up many opportunities in the field of remote sensing and data monitoring. In spite of the numerous applications of WSN, issues related to determining a suitable and accurate radio model that will foster energy conservation in the network limit the performance of WSN routing protocols. A number of radio models have been proposed to address this issue. However, the underlying assumptions and inaccurate configuration of these radio models make them impractical and often lead to mismanagement of scarce energy and computational resources. This paper addresses this problem by proposing an enhanced radio model that adapts to the frequent changes in the location of the sensor nodes and is robust enough to report reliable data to the base station despite fluctuations due to interference. The impact of incorporating stepwise energy level and specialized data transmission schemes in the proposed radio model is also investigated in this paper. The performance of the proposed radio model is evaluated using OMNET++ and MATLAB and the results obtained is benchmarked against PEGASIS. It is shown by simulation that the novel LEACH-IMP performs better with respect to energy consumption, number of links faults, number of packets received, signal attenuation, and network lifetime.	cluster analysis;computation;computational resource;energy level;interference (communication);matlab;mathematical model;pegasus;real-time clock;routing;simulation;stepwise regression;testbed	M.

Facing same challenges as other applications, deployment of WPANs in medical domain exert many more stringent requirements, due to the nature of high accessibility and the privacy sensitive requirement of medical environment, the application of WPANs must be carefully examined before practical use. This paper considers the performance of WPANs deployed in the specific domains, particularly on the behavior of sensor nodes while accessing the shared channels during communicating each other, by theory of Markov chain.

This article explores the energy consumption in mobile devices participating in a human-based wireless sensor network. Specifically, the paper proposes the use of a message predictor to help detect and reduce the number of unnecessary control packets delivered by the nodes as a way to keep updated the network topology. In order to evaluate this proposal, the Optimized Link State Routing protocol was modified to add a message predictor between the routing and the network layers. Eleven simulations were performed using a particular setting. The preliminary results indicate the use of the message predictor can help reduce considerably the nodes energy consumption without affecting the routing capability of the protocol. Although these results are still preliminary, they are highly encouraging.	kerrison predictor;link-state routing protocol;mobile device;network topology;optimized link state routing protocol;sensor web;simulation	Roc Meseguer;Carlos Molina;Sergio F.

d0cac97511304415c1f54d807228c52b34641520	latency and lifetime optimization for k-anycast routing algorithm in wireless sensor networks		Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications frequently require different objectives, such as reliability, timely communication and longevity. To cope with that, a WSN can be conceived with multiple sinks and routing protocols designed over different communication schemes. In this paper, we address the communication latency and the network lifetime issues in Multi-Sink WSN deployment. We propose GeoK, a k-anycast geographic routing protocol that considers a linear combination of network metrics during the decision process of the next hop. Packets are forwarded over exactly k sinks, with targets and duplications being defined on the fly. Simulation results show a better performance for GeoK, with improvements of approximately 13% for the average latency, and 30% for the maximum energy consumption, compared to existing work.	algorithm;anycast;interrupt latency;routing	Lucas Leão;Violeta Felea	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-00247-3_4	computer network;latency (engineering);wireless sensor network;hop (networking);distributed computing;geographic routing;metrics;routing protocol;network packet;anycast;computer science	Mobile	7.532581926618402	82.93139148065076	68685

This idea could be realised in many possible ways and could interact differently with other elements of route choice, such as filtering: not all of these will have the property that a unique routing solution can always be found. We develop an algebraic model of route selection to aid in the analysis of neighbor-specific preferences in multipath routing. Using this model, we are able to identify a set of such routing schemes in which convergence is guaranteed.	border gateway protocol;content-control software;linear algebra;multipath routing	Alexander J.

There isn't stable end-to-end path in DTNs. The major objective is how to improve the possibility of finding a path from source to destination under limited conditions. In this paper, we proposed a novel three-dimensional (3D) location-based energy aware routing protocol that uses 3D location information to conduct routing of the real 3D DTNs. The key insight is that make use of the location information can reduce the overhead of DTNs. Then introduced an energy-awareness scheme to extend the network lifetime. We implemented 3DLEAR, Epidemic and PREP to compare their performance with different network environments. Simulation results show that 3DLEAR outperform other two protocols in delivery ratio and end-to-end delay. Additionally, we evaluated the improvement of the energy-awareness scheme on the network lifetime.	3d computer graphics;delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;network congestion;overhead (computing);path (graph theory);powerpc reference platform;routing;simulation;spatial variability	Chengping Tian;Linlin Ci;Bin Cheng;Xuanya Li	2014	2014 IEEE 12th International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing	10.1109/DASC.2014.93	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.130777483363571	84.32937015027213	69038

Flooding is a simple mechanism to realize broadcasting, but it has high redundancy of retransmissions, leading to low transmission efficiency. Many broadcast protocols have been proposed for pursuing optimized transmission efficiency for wireless networks hypothetically deployed on the 2-dimesional (2D) plane. In the real world, wireless networks are deployed in the 3D space. In this paper, we derive the upper bound of 3D transmission efficiency and propose a 3D broadcast protocol with optimized transmission efficiency by partitioning the 3D space into multi-layer hexagonal prisms of a hexagon ring pattern in each layer. As we will show, the transmission efficiency of the proposed protocol can reach 1/π, which is better than those of other polyhedron-filling approaches using cubes, hexagon prisms, rhombic dodecahedrons, and truncated octahedrons.	frustum;layer (electronics);olap cube;polyhedron	Yung-Liang Lai;Jehn-Ruey Jiang	2009	2009 15th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/ICPADS.2009.38	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	2.0989054398346734	82.39465321589795	69287

In this paper, we present distributed algorithms for new host configuration, address reclamation, MANET partition and MANETs merging.

To achieve this, we use clustering. We first identify through analytical models and simulations the cases where clustering is helpful. Building on these results, we propose two clustering schemes that take into consideration the mobility properties of users in order to improve the WMN performance. We prove that both schemes can achieve significant gains in terms of radio resource utilization, especially when the number of simultaneous connections in the network increases. Specifically, we show that the first scheme fits better low-connected wireless mesh networks, whereas the second scheme is more suitable for highly-connected networks.	algorithm;cluster analysis;fits;mesh networking;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link;wireless mesh network	Rami Langar;Salsabil Njima;Nizar Bouabdallah;Raouf Boutaba;Guy Pujolle	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683614	wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;switched mesh;in situ resource utilization;index term;mobile telephony;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;cluster analysis;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-1.7153955462202515	84.99247380468707	69377

The quality of surveillance will be directly related to the quantity and density of sensors that can be deployed, and that are actively participating in the monitoring at any given instant. In opposition to this is the requirement for judicious power management of the network in order to prolong its operational lifespan by minimizing node activity. In this paper we explore the effect on surveillance quality when using interpolation error as a mechanism for deciding node activations. More specifically we examine the effect of using this signal based hibernation technique on target localization error and node activity.	hibernation (computing);interpolation;power management;sensor	Richard Tynan;Gregory M.

'Multicast' reduces the number of multimedia traffics by delivering a single stream of information to thousands of recipients simultaneously. Since multicast routing protocols being used in a wired network were originally designed for stationary host, they do not consider the dynamic location changes of mobile hosts. Therefore, the naive deployment of existing multicast routing protocols is not suitable. In this paper, we present a new mobile multicast routing protocol. The proposed protocol uses Foreign Multicast Agent (FMA) to maintain the group membership. The service range defined by the timer of a mobile host may efficiently take advantage of the characteristics that mobile multicast has according to the speed of mobile hosts. Various performance evaluation results illustrate that the proposed protocol shows distinct performance enhancements over existing protocols.	multicast	Jin Park;Young-Joo Suh;Shin-Gak Kang	2002		10.1007/3-540-36166-9_23	cellular network;routing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;operating system;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;mobile computing;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Mobile	-3.0021562386651715	76.92484222254413	69442

In our proposed mechanism, Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks are utilized for collecting data from smart meters, eliminating the need for manpower. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proposing the utilization of public transportation vehicles for collecting data from smart meters. With this work, the use of the IEEE 802.11p protocol has been proposed for the first time for use in smart grid applications. In our scheme, data flows first from smart meters to a bus through infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication and then from the bus to a bus stop through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. The performance of our proposed mechanism has been investigated in detail in terms of end-to-end delay and delivery ratio by using Network Simulator-2 and with different routing protocols. The first study which uses public transportation for collecting data from SMOur study only needs the IEEE 802.11p communication protocol capability on WAMR.Unlike other VANET studies, our study uses both I2V & V2I communications.

Nodes interested in some content can share it on a multi-hop basis by relying on the collaboration of intermediate nodes. Organizing the communication overlay in such an environment is then a challenging task especially given the mobility of the nodes, the interference, and the scarcity of resources. In this work, we propose and implement a general, stand-alone and efficient P2P content sharing protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. We consider general and realistic scenarios ranging from a single overlay to multiple overlays coexisting in the same network, and for every single overlay, we consider different peer densities in the network. The main challenges are overlay disconnections, routing overhead, low sharing opportunities and instability of distant paths. Our protocol proposes efficient solutions for these problems leading to the best download times while guaranteeing the maximum sharing opportunities among the peers. We validate our protocol through extensive simulations and experimentations on the ORBIT platform.	algorithm;bittorrent;diversification (finance);download;hoc (programming language);instability;interference (communication);overhead (computing);overlay network;peer-to-peer;routing;simulation;sparse matrix;spontaneous order;synergy	Mohamed Karim Sbai;Emna Salhi;Chadi Barakat	2010	2010 Second International Conference on COMmunication Systems and NETworks (COMSNETS 2010)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2010.5432005	wireless ad hoc network;overlay network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	0.6749258489708967	82.11866716627709	69897

In order to lengthen the relatively short lifetime of sensor batteries, each sen sor in a network can be replaced by a group of n sensors, for somen 2. The group ofn sensors act as one sensor, whose lifetime is about n times that of a regular sensor as follows. For a time period, only one sensor in the gr oup, calledsentry, stays awake and performs all the tasks assigned to the group, while the remaining sensors , calledsleepers , go to sleep to save their batteries. At the beginning of the next time period, the sleepers wake up , then all the sensors in the group elect a new sentry for the next time period, and the cycle repeats. In thi s paper, we describe a practical protocol that can be used by a group of sensors to elect a new sentry at the beginn ing of each time period. Our protocol, unlike earlier protocols, is based on the assumption that the senso rs in a group are perfectly identical (e.g. they do not have unique identifiers; rather each of them has the same g roup identifier). This feature makes our protocol resilient against any attack by an adversary sensor in the gr oup that may lie about its own identity to be elected a sentry over and over, and keep the legitimate sensors in the group asleep for a long time.	adversary (cryptography);cosmo-rs;goto;radio frequency;sensor;sentry gun;unique identifier	Mohamed G.

Most of the existing routing schemes assign energy-related costs to network links and obtain shortest paths for the nodes in order to balance the flowing traffic within the network and increase the lifetime. However, the optimal link cost values and the maximum achievable lifetime are not known for this vast category of schemes. A framework is provided in this work to analytically derive the best achievable performance by any distributed routing algorithm based on the shortest-path approach. Given a network configuration and an energy consumption model, the presented framework provides the optimal link cost assignment which yields the maximum lifetime in a distributed shortest-path routing strategy. The results are extended to the case of variable link cost assignment as well. In particular, the proposed framework provides the optimal route selection as a benchmark to evaluate the energy efficiency of existing routing algorithms.	benchmark (computing);dijkstra's algorithm;routing;shortest path problem	Jalal Habibi;Amir G.

Finally, a diversity-based indicator is applied to prove that the Pareto frontier has a uniform distribution in the non-dominated solutions.	algorithm;global optimization;hoc (programming language);independent set (graph theory);internet backbone;loss function;mathematical optimization;maximal independent set;maximal set;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;particle swarm optimization;simulation	Joseph Guadalupe Olascuaga-Cabrera;Ernesto López-Mellado;Andres Mendez-Vazquez	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083994	wireless ad hoc network;mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	EDA	5.918249570820702	82.1872728998063	70106
642d8de34aa6bdb0b01a42f38fb10b659887100e	efficient and robust serial query processing approach for large-scale wireless sensor networks	query processing;robustness;localized algorithms;wireless sensor networks;serial algorithms	The goal of query processing in WSN is to get reliable information of interest from sensor nodes whilst preserving, as much as possible, the network resources, mainly energy. Among the various approaches proposed in the literature to tackle this issue, serial approaches, in which the query is carried out serially from node to node, have shown noticeable improvements in terms of query processing responsiveness and communication overhead reduction when compared to centralized and distributed ones. Nevertheless, they suffer two main drawbacks: (a) they are intrinsically very vulnerable and (b) they require the construction of a Hamiltonian path through the network, which is known to be a NP-Complete problem. In this paper, we investigate the issue of efficient and robust query processing by proposing a novel approach, which we refer to as GBT (Greedy & Boundary Traversal). GBT is of a serialized and localized nature (i.e., each node does not maintain any knowledge about the topology of the network). Furthermore, in GBT the selection of the next hop is totally independent from the previous hops (i.e., no path is defined in advance). This feature enforces the robustness of GBT as attested by the simulation results we obtained (a mean improvement of almost 50% reduction in terms of communication, energy and query responsiveness in large-scale network topologies). We also provide a complexity analysis (time, space and communication) of our query processing algorithm as well as formal proof of its correctness (i.e., termination and completeness).	analysis of algorithms;centralized computing;correctness (computer science);database;display resolution;emoticon;formal proof;government and binding theory;greedy algorithm;hamiltonian path;international conference on functional programming;iterative method;np-completeness;network topology;overhead (computing);query optimization;requirement;responsiveness;scalability;simulation;software deployment;timing library format;tree traversal;velocity (software development);while	Azzedine Boukerche;Ahmed Mostefaoui;Mahmoud Melkemi	2016	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2016.04.012	embedded system;sargable;query optimization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;robustness;computer network	DB	5.500981456301075	78.94247346125852	70128

Unlike previously proposed schemes, our architecture avoids expensive mechanisms such as global flooding as well as complex coordination between nodes to form a hierarchy. CARD is also independent of any external source of information such as GPS. In our architecture nodes within a limited number of hops from each node form the neighborhood of that node. Resources within the neighborhood can be readily accessed with the help of a proactive scheme within the neighborhood. For accessing resources beyond the neighborhood, each node also maintains a few distant nodes called contacts. Contacts help in creating a small world in the network and provide an efficient way to query for resources beyond the neighborhood. As the number of contacts of a node increases, the network view (reachability) of the node increases. Paths to contacts are validated periodically to adapt to mobility. We present mechanisms for contact selection and maintenance that attempt to increase reachability while minimizing overhead. Our simulation results show a clear trade-off between increase in reachability on one hand, and contact selection and maintenance overhead on the other. Our results suggest that CARD can be configured to provide a desirable reachability distribution for different network sizes. Comparisons with other schemes for resource discovery, such as flooding and bordercasting, show our architecture to be much more efficient and scalable.	global positioning system;hoc (programming language);information source;overhead (computing);reachability;scalability;simulation	Saurabh Garg;Priyatham Pamu;Nitin Nahata;Ahmed Helmy	2003		10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213401	mobile ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.0642934752399373	80.8245476725521	70145

In the method, a source node sends source packets intermittently and periodically with some transmit period, by which co-transmission space of forwarding packets, that is defined as space between multihop nodes in packet transmission, can be controlled in accordance with the given transmit period. If the transmit period is greater than a certain limit, packet collisions due to interference are eliminated and thus packet forwarding is maximized in its efficiency. However, the IPT forwarding needs elaborations on network topology for a given node layout because the principle of the scheme relies on string topology of node layout. This paper proposes a technique to enable the IPT forwarding in any network topologies. In the proposed scheme, a source node reserves a packet forwarding path to make the relay nodes on the path devote themselves to forward the packets originated by the source node. In addition, neighboring nodes close to the forwarding path are made to set their NAV (Network Allocation Vector) to prevent them from giving interference to the nodes on the reserved path. The proposed scheme can be combined with a conventional routing algorithm such as tree type ones or mesh type ones. Simulation results ensure that the combination of the IPT forwarding with the proposed path reservation achieves higher throughput and lower average packet delay compared with a conventional packet forwarding method.	algorithm;fairness measure;information processes and technology;interference (communication);microsoft dynamics nav 2016;network packet;network topology;packet analyzer;port forwarding;relay;routing;simulation;throughput;iptables	Yuji Tohzaka;Yukinori Higa;Hiroshi Furukawa	2007	2007 IEEE 65th Vehicular Technology Conference - VTC2007-Spring	10.1109/VETECS.2007.56	routing table;bidirectional forwarding detection;network allocation vector;routing;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;ip forwarding;frequency;distributed computing;packet forwarding;interference;forwarding plane;packet switch;reverse path forwarding;spread spectrum;scheduling;network topology;computer network	Mobile	-0.525504079240716	84.48417482650078	70256

The energy management is a crucial issue on WSN since it has a real influence on a network lifetime. Since such networks are used for many sensitive applications, they may need to guarantee some Quality of Service requirements as continuous connectivity or continuous monitoring or balanced energy consumption over all network nodes. In this paper, we suggest a centralized approach which monitors the energy consumption of all nodes (in relation with their main activity: communication). We present an activity model of the network and evaluate how the remaining energy behaves. Our main objective is to predict (after a learning step) the energy consumption of all the nodes. Many techniques could be used to find a cure to such troubles (wake up sleeping neighbor nodes, increasing radio ranges of some neighbor nodes,. . . ).	centralized computing;function model;non-functional requirement;quality of service	Hacène Fouchal;Michel Herbin;Frédéric Blanchard	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289183	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	8.918840423827092	77.70675044548376	70285

In this paper, we propose a Route Stability based QoS Routing (RSQR) protocol in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) which is an extension of QoS routing with throughput and delay constraints. Ensuring a data path to be valid for sufficiently longer period of time is a very difficult problem in MANET due to its highly dynamic nature. We propose a simple model for computing link stability and route stability based on received signal strengths. By including some extra fields in route request/reply packets, the route stability information can be utilized to select a route with higher stability among all the feasible routes between a given source destination pair. Further, inclusion of a signal strength based admission control enhances the performance of the routing. Results of our experiments show performance improvements in terms of packet delivery ratio, control overhead and average end-to-end delay in comparison with a QoS routing protocol proposed by Q.

It has a crucial impact on network load. But few researches refer to it. This paper discusses the correlation effect on network load firstly, and then presents DOSC and DOTC as parameters to quantify the spatial and time correlation of the neighbor nodes respectively. Based on these, the paper proposes STCAS-MAC. STCAS-MAC is evolved from AS-MAC by improving its adaptive scheduling and considering the validity period of information. Simulation results show that compared with the AS-MAC, the proposed protocol improves greatly in several performances. Especially when the network load is heavy or variable, the STCAS-MAC protocol can improve the delivery ratio effectively or adaptation obviously.	performance;scheduling (computing);simulation	Jijun Zhao;Zhongcheng Wei;Zhihua Li;Xiang Sun	2011	JCM	10.4304/jcm.6.3.262-269	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	8.743258806457089	83.6317929816993	70862
02820a83618f4ddcd3d8591bd31769d763c16c0b	a mechanism for scalable concast communication	concast communication;gather mechanism;wide area networks	Efficient techniques have been developed to support multicast, i.e. the delivery of messages from one source to multiple receivers, over wide area networks. On the other hand, support for concast, the delivery of messages from multiple sources to a single receiver, has not received much attention. Such communication is often implemented as relatively expensive, multiple unicasts. Apart from the high message overhead of unicasts in large groups, concast communication may be subject to the so-called implosion effect, whereby a destination is overwhelmed by simultaneous responses from a set of sources. These limitations restrict the scalability of a number of distributed applications based on group communication. In this paper, we propose a simple mechanism called gather that reduces concast message overhead and eliminates implosion in a number of applications.gather can be implemented in any wide area network which supports tree-based multicasting, and its use results in concast communication that is as efficient as forward multicast. In essence,gather messages propagate from the leaves to the root of a multicast tree, and gateways enroute 'reduce' many incoming concast messages into a single outgoing message. We describe the gather mechanism in detail, discuss some of its properties, and illustrate its utility in supporting a variety of concast applications.	scalability	Bala Rajagopalan	1993	Computer Communications	10.1016/0140-3664(93)90063-X	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-0.5383711681475197	82.2746520061638	70954
e943a59afda4cc0bea80507d51275e9d401ddd44	a new elastic trickle timer algorithm for internet of things	iot;emerging services;internet of things;routing protocol for low power and lossy networks;trickle timer algorithm;rpl	The term IoT emerging services is used to refer to the modern kinds of services that IoT can provide to enhance service and experience quality by reducing complexity, speeding up requests, and using techniques involved with cloud, Big Data, and protocols to allows services to function seamlessly. Therefore, IoT utilises protocols found within different network layers. RPL or Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks is one of the most important routing protocols utilised on the network layer. This protocol is considered an IPV6 distance vector proactive routing protocol. The trickle timer algorithm is one of its major components. This algorithm is used to control and track the control messages’ flow throughout the network. However, one weakness of the trickle algorithm is that it suffers from short listen problem that makes some nodes starve for delay and long latency in propagating transmissions. Based on existing literature, there have been several research studies on this trickle method. Development of the Enhanced Trickle algorithm (E-Trickle) was done to get rid of the listen only period. However, there still is relatively low activity on studying the trickle algorithm’s performance merits. Our proposed elastic trickle timer algorithm will try to fill this gap by dealing only with the listen to only period problems. The power consumption and convergence time are mainly affected. Therefore, our proposed algorithm was incorporated in the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). Different network densities were used to evaluate the simulation experiments. Its implementation was done on 20, 40, 60, and 80 nodes using different ratios for reception success (RX) (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%), and grid network and random topologies were used. The Cooja 2.7 simulator was used to implement the simulation experiments, and RPL performance was studied through the elastic trickle timer algorithm. Measurement of the simulation experiments was done on various performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), convergence time, and power consumption. Comparison of the results was done using the standard trickle timer algorithm. Using random and grid topologies, the results revealed greater enhancements in terms of convergence time. Simulation results revealed that when the network was made up of 20 nodes, there was 35% less convergence time. Moreover, when 40 nodes were randomly placed, there was 62% less convergence time, and 71% less convergence time when 40 nodes were situated in a grid topology. Additionally, there was 70% less convergence time when the network was made up of 60 nodes and approximately 76% less convergence time when there were 80 nodes. Moreover, the simulation results revealed that in terms of energy consumption, the new algorithm exhbited superior performance characteristics. © 2017 Elsevier Science.

19c412bb1d50bd03a4bbfdfa7f595244bf541ca7	a novel energy efficient and lifetime maximization routing protocol in wireless sensor networks	network lifetime;energy;routing protocols;multipath routing;wireless sensor networks	The energy consumption is a key design criterion for the routing protocols in wireless sensor networks (WSN). Some of the conventional single path routing schemes may not be optimal to maximize the network lifetime and connectivity. Thus, multipath routing schemes is an optimal alternative to extend the lifetime of WSN. Multipath routing schemes distribute the traffic across multiple paths instead of routing all the traffic along a single path. In this paper, we propose a multipath Energy-Efficient data Routing Protocol for wireless sensor networks (EERP). The latter keeps a set of good paths and chooses one based on the node state and the cost function of this path. In EERP, each node has a number of neighbours through which it can route packets to the base station. A node bases its routing decision on two metrics: state and cost function. It searches its Neighbours Information Table for all its neighbours concerned with minimum cost function. Simulation results show that our EERP protocol minimizes and balances the energy consumption well among all sensor nodes and achieves an obvious improvement on the network lifetime.	attribute-value system;expectation–maximization algorithm;loss function;multipath routing;sensor;simulation	Samra Boulfekhar;Mohamed Benmohammed	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1081-4	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;energy;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	6.86670515235996	81.78358950071033	71105

In the high performance routing protocol, to reduce the number of rerouting times, we take the bandwidth issue into account to choose the path with the capability to transmit the maximum amount of data with the help of the GPS. With exchanging the moving vectors and the coordinates of two adjacent mobile nodes, the possible link lifetime of two adjacent mobile nodes can be predicted. Subsequently, a path with the maximal amount of data transmission can be found. With regard to our proposed long lifetime routing protocol, to maximize the overall network lifetime, we find a path with the maximal remaining power after data transmission. With the link bandwidth and the desired amount of data transmitted, the consumption power is computed to obtain the remaining power of a mobile node. Accordingly, we can choose the path with the maximal predicted remaining power to maximize the overall network lifetime. In the simulation, we compare our high performance routing protocol with the AODV and LAWS in terms of throughput, rerouting (path breakage), and route lifetime. With respect to power consumption, we compare our proposed power-aware routing protocol with the POAD and PAMP in terms of the overall network lifetime and the ration of survival nodes to the all nodes.	entity–relationship model;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);mamp;maximal set;national supercomputer centre in sweden;path (graph theory);routing;simulation;throughput;transmitter	Ching-Wen Chen;Chuan-Chi Weng	2008	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-008-0260-7	private network-to-network interface;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;supercomputer;mobile ad hoc network;supernetwork;global positioning system;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile computing;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	-1.550413051976093	76.33190350191613	71109

QoS-aware routing based on ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms is a promising approach to overcome these problems. However, as compared to MANETs, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) face additional challenges due to a rapid topology change, making the estimation or prediction of QoS parameters difficult or stale. VANETs require time-critical message delivery, as late delivery may result in endangering lives. Currently existing routing protocols usually require the exchange of additional control message between neighbor nodes to compute QoS parameters. This makes the routing protocol too slow to react to fast topology change and also does not consider network congestion when forwarding a data packet. To reduce the overhead introduced to collect information from neighbor nodes and to obtain an accurate estimate of QoS parameters, we use the simple network management protocol to estimate these values locally. This paper describes a new approach for calculating QoS parameter locally and avoiding congestion during data transmission. The simulations are implemented using the network simulator ns-3, and the results show that our approach QoS Routing based on Ant Colony Optimization (QoRA) protocol is scalable and performs well in high mobility.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;model of computation;network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;requirement;routing;scalability;simple network management protocol;simulation;window of opportunity	Aymen Dawood Al-Ani;Jochen Seitz	2015	Network Protocols & Algorithms	10.5296/npa.v7i4.8513	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;ant colony optimization algorithms;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;simple network management protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	3.0187026318767294	83.65754544901348	71349

However, conventional centralized and broadcasting based network association mechanisms may consume large energy, and distributed network association mechanisms may suffer from addressing failure when applied to large scale WSNs. In this paper, we consider distributed network association with scalability for the construction of a large scale WSN. The proposed mechanism constructs a large scale addressing tree before network initialization. Based on the addressing tree, it allows each router to have its own addressing space which will be used for unique addressing of its child nodes. Then, a novel parent/child selection algorithm can assign routers to be located throughout the whole deployment area. Thus, nodes can join the network in the presence of sufficient neighbor routers and receive a unique address in a distributed manner. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by computer simulation, showing remarkable performance improvement over conventional schemes when applied to a large scale WSN.	address space;centralized computing;computer simulation;router (computing);scalability;selection algorithm;software deployment;tree (data structure)	Hyung-Sin Kim;Jin-Seok Han;Jae-Seok Bang;Yong-Hwan Lee	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications	10.1109/GreenCom.2012.36	wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;intelligent computer network;wireless wan;overlay network;network architecture;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;heterogeneous network;network management station;bridging;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;municipal wireless network;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	5.341641227391871	79.50540974834864	71401

Clustering for personal networks intends to organize these ad-hoc networked heterogeneous devices into hierarchical clusters. A new clustering scheme, Personal Network Clustering Protocol (PNCP), is proposed for PNs and compared with clustering algorithms in the literature in terms of various performance metrics. PNCP performs the cluster formation based on heterogeneity of PNs in a distributed way, forms clusters with a moderate number of nodes, limits the cluster radius to k-hops, decreases the change in the cluster composition, extends the average membership time in the clusters providing stability and generates less overhead traffic. Though it was aimed for PNs, this protocol can also be used for any other heterogeneous ad hoc network for clus-	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer cluster;hoc (programming language);interconnection;organizing (structure);overhead (computing);personal network;requirement;routing	Yanying Gu;Weidong Lu;R.

408197a5e01da0bdb62de4caa19c5e6b90d42c37	combined genetic and fuzzy approach for shortest path routing problem in ad hoc networks	search techniques;wireless multi hop network;dynamic optimization problem	Shortest path (SP) routing problem for static network has been addressed well in the recent past using different intelligent optimization techniques such as artificial neural network, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithms (GA) etc. However, advancements in the wireless communication result in more and more wireless mobile networks such as mobile ad hoc network, wireless mesh network, etc. for which static path routing algorithms will not work well due to the dynamic nature of the mobile networks whose environmental conditions change over time. In this paper, we present a new method to address the SP routing problem for dynamic wireless sensor networks using well known optimization technique called GA. In this method, different paths which are formed randomly by the nodes between source and destination are modeled as chromosomes in the GA. Then, these chromosomes are undergone various genetic process such as selection, crossover and mutation to get new chromosomes. Every time the topology changes, network parameters such as sent packets, received packets, transmission time and dropped packets are estimated for each path and the optimized route is selected using fuzzy based fitness function applied to each chromosomes.	ant colony optimization algorithms;artificial neural network;crossover (genetic algorithm);fitness function;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;mesh networking;mutation (genetic algorithm);overhead (computing);particle swarm optimization;pathfinding;randomness;routing;selection (genetic algorithm);shortest path problem;simulation;software release life cycle;wireless mesh network	K.

bb4b7fddaf58c96544d76063475fee3d8b3c8396	an energy-efficient and obstacle-avoiding routing protocol for underwater acoustic sensor networks	energy-efficient;fuzzy logic-based forwarding relay selection;obstacle-avoiding;routing protocol;underwater acoustic sensor networks	Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) have become one of the promising technologies for exploring underwater natural resources and collecting scientific data from the aquatic environment. As obstacles hinder the communications among sensor nodes in UASNs, designing an effective bypass routing protocol to avoid obstacles is an urgent need. Moreover, the sensor nodes are typically powered by batteries, which are difficult to replace, restricting the network lifetime of UASNs. In this paper, an Energy-efficient and Obstacle-Avoiding Routing protocol (EOAR) is proposed not only to address the issue of marine animals acting as obstacles that interfere with communications, but also to balance the network energy according to the residual energy. In the EOAR protocol, when the current node perceives the existence of marine animals, the interference area of the animal-nodes is first calculated using the underwater acoustic channel model, and then the candidate forwarding relay set of the current node is obtained according to the constraint conditions. The optimal candidate forwarding relay is determined by a fuzzy logic-based forwarding relay selection scheme based on considering the three parameters of the candidate forwarding relay, which includes the propagation delay, the included angle between two neighbor nodes, and the residual energy. Furthermore, in order to solve the problem of energy waste caused by packet collision, we use a priority-based forwarding method to schedule the packet transmission from the candidate forwarding relay to the destination node. The proposed EOAR protocol is simulated on the Aqua-sim platform and the simulation results show that proposed protocol can increase the packet delivery ratio by 28.4% and 11.8% and can reduce the energy consumption by 53.4% and 32.7% and, respectively, comparing with the hop-by-hop vector-based forwarding routing protocol (HHVBF) and void handling using geo-opportunistic routing protocol (VHGOR).

These assumptions, in turn, are either very relaxed (i.e., compatible only with undemanding real-time requirements) or very hard to justify. When dealing with WSNs supporting highly dynamic applications and operating environments (e.g., media streaming, robot control, vehicle coordination, etc.) this problem cannot be ignored. Accordingly, we argue for, and show the efficacy of, using probabilistic models to characterize dynamic WSN QoS, which is the first step to tackle the problem head on. Using our network monitoring technique, we demonstrate that it is possible to meet probabilistic real-time objectives.	best-effort delivery;global serializability;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;robot control;streaming media	Luis Marques;Antonio Casimiro	2013	2013 IEEE 32nd International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems	10.1109/SRDS.2013.12	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;quality of service;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;statistics;computer network	Embedded	7.967620259012935	75.09625882597011	72002

Such bandwidth aggregation capability is routinely used in infrastructure mode operation, where the traffic to and from wireless nodes is distributed among multiple interfaces of an access point or among multiple access points to balance the traffic load. However, bandwidth aggregation is rarely used in the context of multi-hop 802.11-based LANs that operate in the ad hoc mode. Most past research efforts that attempt to exploit multiple radio channels require modifications to the MAC protocol and therefore do not work with commodity 802.11 interface hardware. In this paper, we propose and evaluate one of the first multi-channel multi-hop wireless ad-hoc network architectures that can be built using standard 802.11 hardware by equipping each node with multiple network interface cards (NICs) operating on different channels. We focus our attention on wireless mesh networks that serve as the backbone for relaying end-user traffic from wireless access points to the wired network. The idea of exploiting multiple channels is particularly appealing in wireless mesh networks because of their high capacity requirements to support backbone traffic. To reap the full performance potential of this architecture, we develop a set of centralized channel assignment, bandwidth allocation, and routing algorithms for multi-channel wireless mesh networks. A detailed performance evaluation shows that with intelligent channel and bandwidth assignment, equipping every wireless mesh network node with just 2 NICs operating on different channels can increase the total network goodput by a factor of up to 8 compared with the conventional single-channel ad hoc network architecture.	aggregate data;algorithm;centralized computing;goodput;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;mesh networking;network architecture;network interface controller;performance evaluation;requirement;routing;serial experiments lain;wireless access point;wireless mesh network	Ashish Raniwala;Kartik Gopalan;Tzi-cker Chiueh	2004	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/997122.997130	multi-frequency network;ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;switched mesh;service set;wireless wan;wireless site survey;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;shared mesh;monitor mode;distributed computing;order one network protocol;wireless distribution system;wireless lan controller;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	-2.645793458352966	85.46934610614122	72032

A key challenge is to find a route that can provide good delivery performance and low end-to-end delay in a disconnected network graph where nodes may move freely. This paper presents a multidisciplinary solution based on the consideration of the so-called small world dynamics which have been proposed for economy and social studies and have recently revealed to be a successful approach to be exploited for characterising information propagation in wireless networks. To this purpose, some bridge nodes are identified based on their centrality characteristics, i.e., on their capability to broker information exchange among otherwise disconnected nodes. Due to the complexity of the centrality metrics in populated networks the concept of ego networks is exploited where nodes are not required to exchange information about the entire network topology, but only locally available information is considered. Then SimBet Routing is proposed which exploits the exchange of pre-estimated """"betweenness' centrality metrics and locally determined social """"similarity' to the destination node. We present simulations using real trace data to demonstrate that SimBet Routing results in delivery performance close to Epidemic Routing but with significantly reduced overhead. Additionally, we show that SimBet Routing outperforms PRoPHET Routing, particularly when the sending and receiving nodes have low connectivity."""	betweenness centrality;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);information exchange;network topology;overhead (computing);population;routing;simulation;social network analysis;software propagation;sparse matrix	Elizabeth M.

392e99bd0c5717ea08f4141018b98f975c75457c	performance evaluation of wirelesshart networks using a new network simulator 3 module		Nowadays, wireless communication is a tendency in industrial environments, enabling the addition of new applications and saving resources when compared to their wired counterparts. In this context, the WirelessHART specification is emerging as a solution for the last mile connection. Despite its high degree of applicability, a WirelessHART network faces some challenges. Some of the most challenging problems are its reliability, energy consumption, and interference from the environment, issues which involve the lower layers. In order to enable performance evaluations in a low cost and scalable way, we propose a new NS-3 module for the WirelessHART physical layer including an error model (Gilbert/ Elliot), station positioning, signal attenuation and energy consumption. Furthermore, the module permits configuring each link with different fault probabilities, allowing more accurate simulations. For validation, the scheduling and routing approaches were statically configured assuming different topologies and probabilistic error scenarios already validated in the literature. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

75360aa08bc14f14ce19c43b2071d8b7011a1e93	exclusive channel allocation methods based on four-color theorem in clustering sensor networks		The effective use of energy efficiency is a big challenge in sensor networks, since sensor nodes have limited power and are deployed in inaccessible regions. Clustering on the sensor networks reduces the volume of inter-node communications and raises energy efficiency by transmitting the collected data from members by a cluster head to a sink node. Nevertheless, due to radio frequency characteristics in wireless communications, interference and collision can occur between neighboring clusters, leading to increased energy consumption due to the resulting re-transmission. The occurring of interference and collision channels among clusters can be resolved by assigning non-overlapping channels among neighbor clusters. In this paper, we propose an exclusive channel allocation method based on four-color theorem. This method assigns exclusive channels among neighbor clusters in various clustered topologies and makes nodes transfer data in collision free environments among clusters. The experimental results show successful assigning of exclusive channel among neighbors using the 4 number of channels in various cluster topologies.	four color theorem	Mary Wu;SungYong Ha;Turki Abdullah;Chonggun Kim	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-10774-5_10	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;data mining	Robotics	9.14383746059935	80.48162334231328	72157

Hierarchical cluster-based routing protocols are considered an efficient technique to route data from sensor nodes to base station. This paper proposes a scheme which considers K-means clustering in cluster formation phase and calculates a weight function for the cluster head selection process. Moreover, it considers an optimal fixed packet size with respect to radio parameters and channel conditions of the transceiver. In data transmission phase, it implements a multiobjective weight function as a link cost using traditional Dijkstra algorithm. This technique results in balanced and efficient energy consumption of nodes within the network. Simulation results show that proposed scheme is better than the CERP and TEEN routing protocol in terms of energy conservation of nodes in the network and increases the throughput of the overall system. It also indicates high scalability and packet delivery rate due to the efficient use of energy in the system.	cluster analysis;design review (u.s. government);dijkstra's algorithm;k-means clustering;network packet;routing;scalability;simulation;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system;transceiver;weight function	Madiha Razzaq;Goo-Rak Kwon;Seokjoo Shin	2018	2018 Third International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing (FMEC)	10.1109/FMEC.2018.8364074	wireless sensor network;computer network;throughput;scalability;weight function;cluster analysis;network packet;dijkstra's algorithm;routing protocol;computer science	Mobile	8.35565605225144	80.57530849304715	72399

We conduct extensive experiments on a MicaZ platform to compare the performance of the proposed EERS and the collection tree protocol (CTP) in terms of packet reception ratio (PRR), collection delay, energy consumption, and energy balancing. Experimental results show that EERS outperforms CTP in terms of reliability, delay and energy consumption. In particular, EERS reduces nearly 30% mean delay as compared to CTP, and saves 10% energy consumed by CTP at the default power (0dBm) while achieving at least 0.95 PRR.	end-to-end encryption;experiment;network packet;overhead (computing);production rule representation;routing	Liang Liang;Yu Ge;Gang Feng;Wei Ni;Aung Aung Phyo Wai	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503174	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	8.38832108511259	83.27954350899091	72458

This paper investigates the feasibility of extending this coverage via air-air (A/A) multihop communications over oceanic, remote and polar regions, where no such infrastructure is available, so that aircraft flying over these areas can access the ground services without having to use an expensive high-delay satellite link. We focus on a particularly attractive scenario, the North Atlantic Corridor, and use realistic flight data to extract statistics about the dynamic topology of the airborne ad hoc network, such as connectivity and link stability. In addition, we assess the performance of greedy forwarding in the aeronautical environment and show that, under moderate connectivity, this technique delivers almost all packets to their destinations with a minimum hop count.	airborne ranger;geographic routing;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);köppen climate classification;load balancing (computing);lévy flight;maxima and minima;network packet	Daniel Medina;Felix Hoffmann;Serkan Ayaz;Carl-Herbert Rokitansky	2008	2008 5th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks	10.1109/SAHCN.2008.23	wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;aerodynamics;computer science;computer network	Mobile	2.574986049341923	85.50614804421345	72997

The Smart Grid solution is recognized as a key technology to cope with these challenges, not just concerning the environmental impact of greenhouse gases but also regarding the increasing electric demand. Smart Grid is a combination of two networks, the first being the electrical transmission and distribution network, while the other is the modern data communication network. The Smart Grid communication network can be divided into three parts, HAN (Home Area Network), NAN (Neighborhood Area Network), and WAN (Wide Area Network). IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 MAC protocols, which are based on the CSMA/CA mechanism, are assumed to be the candidates for the MAC layer of HAN. However, it has latency and energy efficiency problems. In this paper, we have redesigned a tree based TDMA MAC protocol which can be applied in Smart Grid HAN. From the experiments, we verify the performance of our proposed protocol with respect to the network latency, high packet transmission rate and energy efficiency.	experiment;han unification;nan;network packet;requirement;telecommunications network	Min Seok Kim;Sungryul Kim;Jeonghyun Kim;Younghwan Yoo	2011	2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2011.78	greenhouse gas;network allocation vector;network architecture;wireless sensor network;environmental change;telecommunications;computer science;smart grid;efficient energy use;computer security;time division multiple access;sustainable development;environmental impact assessment;computer network	Visualization	4.251756098834906	77.6585081050252	73142

Thus, the optimization and accurate prediction of the lifetime of the system can only be performed in the presence of accurate execution models that take energy consumption into account. In this paper, we propose a generic routing metric and associated policies that encompass most other existing metrics in the literature and use this model for the optimal construction of a routing tree to the sink.

Due to the limited WSN node resources, distributed processing is required for completing application tasks. Proposals implementing distribution services for WSNs are evolving on different levels of generality. In this paper, these solutions are reviewed in order to determine the current status. According to the review, existing distribution technologies for computer networks are not applicable for WSNs. Operating systems (OSs) and middleware architectures for WSNs implement separate services for distribution within the existing constraints but an approach providing a complete distributed environment for applications is absent. In order to implement an efficient and adaptive environment, a middleware should be tightly integrated in the underlying OS. We recommend a framework in which a middleware distributes the application processing to a WSN so that the application lifetime is maximized. OS implements services for application tasks and information gathering as well as control interfaces for the middleware.	algorithm;distributed computing;experiment;middleware;operating environment;operating system;quality of service;routing	Mauri Kuorilehto;Marko Hännikäinen;Timo Hämäläinen	2005	EURASIP J.

bc486e6c2e9f9a743cbca3d7a7efec46b91efbcb	on the use of bio-inspired desynchronization algorithms for beaconing in its		Road safety applications heavily rely on periodic message exchanges known as beaconing in order to gain awareness about the current situation within the vehicle communication range. The high level of transmission contention in dense vehicular networks can induce successive beacon collisions. These collisions impede the vehicles to have an up-to-date view of the environment which can lead to bad decisions from the applications and in the worst case create car crashes. Many propositions of the literature try to tackle this problem by modifying the beacon emission period and/or power either randomly or based on the network density or other measured indicators. In this paper, we explore the possibility to use bio-inspired desynchronization algorithms to avoid beacon collisions. The main idea behind these algorithms is to make nodes converging toward a consensus where they do not emit their beacon at the same time in order to avoid collisions. We show that desynchronization algorithms, if properly implemented, can significantly reduce the probability to have large inter-beacon delays.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;british informatics olympiad;converge;crash (computing);high-level programming language;interference (communication);randomness;simulation;transmission (bittorrent client)	Alexandre Mouradian;Véronique Vèque	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997021	computer network;distributed algorithm;real-time computing;vehicular ad hoc network;synchronization;computer science;mobile computing;mobile telephony;algorithm;jitter;convergence (routing)	Mobile	9.568270397606945	83.96461019829212	73306

Chief among these challenges to enabling real-time applications for mobile ad hoc networks is incorporating support for quality of service (QoS), such as meeting bandwidth or delay constraints. In particular, it is important that routing protocols incorporate QoS metrics in route finding and maintenance to support end-to-end QoS. This article extensively and exclusively studies the issues involved with QoS-aware routing and presents an overview and comparison of existing QoS-aware routing protocols.

It constructs an initial multicast tree using KPP and builds a virtual trunk (VT) simultaneously. The nodes of the VT are relatively stable and nodes changes are based on the VT. The algorithm employs trigger function (TF) that associates QoS reduction caused by members update in this region, at the same time the algorithm satisfies delay constraints. We compare the performance of CRMR algorithm, by simulation, with others. The simulation results indicate that CRMR algorithm provides better balance between cost performance and changes in the multicast tree after each update.

a863688b7344235b7b904dfe4ee4d005aa2406ff	bp neural network based continuous objects distribution detection in wsns	wsns;bp neural network;global distribution status monitoring;optimal fusion set	WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) are widely applied in environment monitoring. Especially, in large scale environment monitoring, its flexibility in deployment and self-organization are strong points. However for distribution detection of continuous objects in large scale environment monitoring, there are two primary constraints: energy consumption and the accuracy of the detection which relies on the density of the WSNs. Currently, almost all of the continuous object monitoring are based on the boundary detection, and all the energy efficiency solutions only focus on the WSNs itself. Unfortunately, with the boundary detection method, the accuracy of the continuous objects detection highly relies on the density of the sensor nodes. What is worse, it is even impossible to make sure of the density of the sensor nodes in real situation. In order to deal with these issues, we proposed the Optimal Fusion Set based Clustering algorithm based on the continuous characteristics of the targets to enhance the energy efficiency and Global Distribution Status Monitoring (GDSM) algorithm to implement the monitoring with finite sensor nodes. Firstly, a dynamic diffusion model based on the Gaussian Puff model is proposed, and then the characteristics of continuous objects are analyzed. According to the theoretic analysis and simulation results, the GDSM algorithm can achieve stable accuracy with limited sensor nodes.	algorithm;artificial neural network;puff model;self-organization;simulation;software deployment;theory	Xiaoling Wu;Hainan Chen;Yanwen Wang;Lei Shu;Guangcong Liu	2016	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-015-1074-1	real-time computing;data mining;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	8.786137529475276	76.60387760486523	73484

Gossiping is a promising method for quickly disseminating messages in a large-scale system, but in its application to information dissemination for location-aware applications, it is important to consider the network topology and patterns of spatial dissemination over the network in order to achieve effective delivery of messages to potentially interested users. To this end, we propose a continuous-space network model extended from Kleinbergu0027s small-world model applicable to actual location-based applications. Analytical and simulation-based study shows that the proposed network achieves high dissemination efficiency resulting from geographically neutral dissemination patterns as well as selective dissemination to proximate users. We have designed a highly scalable location management method capable of promptly updating the network topology in response to node movement and have implemented a distributed simulator to perform dynamic target pursuit experiments as one example of applications that are the most sensitive to message forwarding delay. The experimental results show that the proposed network surpasses other types of networks in pursuit efficiency and achieves the desirable dissemination patterns.

d78fb258cc58a80fd5b267bc8bbceedca6d25547	a scheme for connecting vehicular networks to the internet		This paper proposes a scheme for connecting vehicular networks to the Internet protocol version 6-based Internet. In this scheme, the architecture based on road domains is proposed in order to reduce the mobility handover frequency. Based on this architecture, the distributed address configuration algorithm for vehicular networks is proposed. In this algorithm, a vehicle obtains a unique address from the nearest access point (AP) without duplicate address detection. Based on this architecture, the routing algorithm based on the geographical position is proposed. The routing algorithm is performed in the link layer, and a vehicle achieves the communication with the Internet via the nearest AP. As a result, the communication delay is shortened. In this scheme, a vehicle is always identified by its home address, and during the mobility process, it does not need to be configured with a care-of address. Therefore, the packet loss caused by the address change is avoided. Moreover, during the mobility handover process, a vehicle can receive the data from the same AP, so the packet loss rate is substantially reduced. This paper evaluates the performance of the proposed scheme, and the data results show that this scheme shortens the communication delay and lowers the packet loss.

Redundancy elimination results in traffic reduction which in turn improves the efficiency of network links. In this paper, the concept of network compression is introduced that aspires to exploit the statistical correlation beyond removing large duplicate strings from the flow to better suppress redundancy. In the first part of the paper, we introduce """"memory-assisted compression,"""" which utilizes the memorized content within the network to learn the statistics of the information source generating the packets which can then be used toward reducing the length of codewords describing the packets emitted by the source. Using simulations on data gathered from real network traces, we show that memory-assisted compression can result in significant traffic reduction. In the second part of the paper, we study the scaling of the average network-wide benefits of memory-assisted compression. We discuss routing and memory placement problems in network for the reduction of overall traffic. We derive a closed-form expression for the scaling of the gain in Erdős-Rényi random network graphs, where obtain a threshold value for the number of memories deployed in a random graph beyond which network-wide benefits start to shine. Finally, the network-wide benefits are studied on Internet-like scale-free networks. We show that non-vanishing network compression gain is obtained even when only a tiny fraction of the total number of nodes in the network are memory-enabled."""	code word;erdős number;erdős–rényi model;image scaling;information source;internet;network packet;random graph;routing;simulation;software deployment;tracing (software)	Ahmad Beirami;Mohsen Sardari;Faramarz Fekri	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2015.2418296	data compression;traffic generation model;routing;network traffic control;linear network coding;dijkstra's algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;network simulation;distributed computing;predictive modelling;redundancy;computer network	Networks	-2.8234485615296783	86.54899327671919	73892
c58b87d20357aed94458e8daad9ccadb5f833ceb	topology management-based distributed camera actuation in wireless multimedia sensor networks	radio interference;wireless multimedia sensor networks;in network packet aggregation;coalition formation game;social network analysis;wireless sensor networks	Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) involving camera and Scalar Sensor (SS) nodes provide precise information of events occurring in the monitored region by transmitting video packets. In WMSNs, it is necessary to provide coverage of events occurring in the monitored region for longer durations of time. The Camera Sensor (CS) nodes provide the coverage of an event and transmit the video data to the Base Station (BS), when these nodes are actuated by the associated SS nodes on occurring of an event. Therefore, in the existing pieces of work, distributed actuation focuses on the coverage of an event and prolongation of the lifetime of the CS nodes. However, for distributed actuation of the CS nodes, the SS nodes play a vital role. When the data sent by the associated SS nodes in an event area exceed the preconfigured threshold, the CS nodes start sensing the event and send the video data to the BS. Therefore, in addition to the lifetime of the CS nodes, the lifetime of the SS nodes and their data reporting latencies are important aspects for distributed actuation of the CS nodes, while sending both the video and scalar data to the BS. In this work, we propose a topology management-based distributed camera actuation scheme, named TADA, to prolong the lifetime of SS nodes, and decrease the data reporting latency in event area only. The increased lifetime of the SS nodes, in turn, increases the event coverage and packet delivery ratio. To increase the lifetime of the SS nodes in an event area, the SS nodes with the most residual energies are selected as the packet aggregators. In addition, the transmission range of these nodes is decreased, and in-network packet aggregation is performed, while reporting the happening of an event to the associated CS nodes. The aggregator selection mechanism helps in balancing energy consumption of the SS nodes. Similarly, the decrease in transmission range and aggregation mechanism help in decreasing energy consumption of these nodes. The transmission range of the SS nodes is decreased using social network analysis and Coalition Formation Game (CFG). CFG also helps in decreasing the data reporting latency of an event by the SS nodes to their associated CS nodes. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed scheme, TADA, which is based on the distributed topology management protocol named T-Must, achieves high performance in terms of the lifetime of the SS nodes, data reporting latency, coverage ratio of the event, event reporting credibility index, and packet delivery ratio in an environment affected by shadow fading.	context-free grammar;network packet;object composition;packet analyzer;performance evaluation;scalar processor;social network analysis;transmission (bittorrent client);transmitter	Goutam Mali;Sudip Misra	2017	TAAS	10.1145/3014430	electromagnetic interference;social network analysis;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.249797431424218	82.03066616898322	74027

2777694490ce3240dce0b34214c4951ba87a55a7	lightweight routing with dynamic interests in wireless sensor and actor networks	wireless sensor;routing;quality of service;wireless sensor and actor networks	Wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs) have been increasingly popular for environmental monitoring applications in the last decade. While the deployment of sensor nodes enables a fine granularity of data collection, resource-rich actor nodes provide further evaluation of the information and reaction. Quality of service (QoS) and routing solutions for WSANs are challenging compared to traditional networks because of the limited node resources. WSANs also have different QoS requirements than wireless sensor networks (WSNs) since actors and sensor nodes have distinct resource constraints. In this paper, we present, LRP-QS, a lightweight routing protocol with dynamic interests and QoS support for WSANs. LRP-QS provides QoS by differentiating the rates among different types of interests with dynamic packet tagging at sensor nodes and per flow management at actor nodes. The interests, which define the types of events to observe, are distributed in the network. The weights of the interests are determined dynamically by using a nonsensitive ranking algorithm depending on the variation in the observed values of data collected in response to interests. Our simulation studies show that the proposed protocol provides a higher packet delivery ratio and a lower memory consumption than the existing state of the art protocols.	actor model;algorithm;network packet;overhead (computing);quadratic sieve;quality of service;quorum sensing;requirement;routing;scheduling (computing);sensor web;simulation;software deployment	Mustafa Ilhan Akbas;Damla Turgut	2013	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2013.05.012	routing;quality of service;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.53872251950711	76.01783874342398	74405

Understanding the subtle characteristics of human mobility leads to better service and application provisioning for mobile DTNs. We use GPS traces collected from multiple mobile users to empirically study different aspects of human mobility. Various Markov models (first, second and third-order) are estimated from users' mobility data. Based on empirical evidence, second-order Markov models are deemed sufficient to estimate mobile users' future locations accurately. These Markov models permit the design of a new routing algorithm for mobile DTNs capable of more efficiently routing data objects to their destination locations. The relay selection in this routing algorithm is based on mobile users' absorption times to the destination location. Simulations show that the proposed routing algorithm consumes less energy than legacy epidemic routing algorithms without excessive transmission delays.	algorithm;denial-of-service attack;global positioning system;markov chain;markov model;provisioning;relay;routing;tracing (software)	Arezu Moghadam;Tony Jebara;Henning Schulzrinne	2011		10.1145/2068897.2068954	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;algorithm design;optimized link state routing protocol;design;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;empirical evidence;performance;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;markov model;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobility model;triangular routing;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	3.2906424752721763	85.04291286743236	74409

Considering the applications of MANETs, it is generally preferred that the CDS protocol not only creates CDS of small size, incurs less communication and computatio nal overheads, adapts to the nodal mobility, but also generates CDS as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, none of the existingCDS protocols possesses all of these desirable properties. In t his paper, we propose an algorithm to rapidly grow a CDS tree from an initiator. By incorporating this algorithm with the MultiInitiator CDS protocol, we have created the CDS protocol for MANETs which enjoys all the aforementioned desirable properties.The simulation results validate that our proposed protocol achieves its design goals. In addition, an analytical model is provided that can accurately estimate the convergence time required by ou r proposed CDS protocol.	algorithm;connected dominating set;hoc (programming language);routing;scsi initiator and target;simulation	Kazuya Sakai;Min-Te Sun;Wei-Shinn Ku	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199026	mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	1.3313980326669772	83.12674589601157	74521
9b452f093c64f482cc91dfb52ab4dd2e99c6915c	social olsr: - a social based routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks		In our area of Mobile Multimedia, the expansion of wireless networks is dazzling and mobility has become a major issue exacerbated by the significant increase in the number of mobile users. A node operating in a basic mobile network behaves the same way a blind person moving in our universe by developing his own representation with his stick, a mechanism known in the literature as terminal mobility. To reduce this blindness, several methods have been developed that are based on community behavior. One of the facets of the use of community behavior is the integration of the faculty of “perception” of groups in social communities at the heart of a routing protocol for mobile networks. We propose a routing protocol based on the original Optimized Link State Routing protocol (OLSR) to which we add the component of social perception of groupings of individuals. We attache our proposal to tests in simulated environment which shows that indeed the stability of wireless network is more sustainable when the perception exists that in its	algorithm;deployment environment;link-state routing protocol;minkowski portal refinement;optimized link state routing protocol;simulation;virtual reality	Leila Harfouche	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13329-4_10	vehicular ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;computer network;wireless routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;optimized link state routing protocol;ad hoc wireless distribution service;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;wireless ad hoc network;computer science	Mobile	0.9235836902359926	83.60904677622396	74647

f2d0798d13cb10ffed48cbfb05c8b0ce3546f168	stochastic analysis of dtn routing protocols in delay tolerant network routing hierarchical topology		We propose in this work a topology adapted to the routing in the delay tolerant networks (DTN). This topology plays a very important role in the design and the implementation of routing protocols in this type of networks devoid of any infrastructure and any centralised administration with an intermittent connectivity. Indeed, we develop a DTN routing hierarchical topology (DRHT) which incorporates three fundamental concepts: ferries messages, ferries routes and clusters. The intra-cluster routing is managed by the cluster head, while the inter-cluster routing is managed by the ferries messages. This approach allows us to improve the performances of DTN networks. In addition, we present a modelling and an analysis of the process of the bundles distribution in a delay tolerant network through a Markov process of birth and death in continuous time; our modelling takes into account the characteristics of the DTN network.

Today there are a lot of social and non-social mobility models. The problem is how to use these models in MANET-DTN. Therefore, proper evaluation method is needed, that is able to reveal the social aspect of investigated mobility model. Since there are a lot of methods that do not directly exhibit the social aspect of mobility models, in this paper the new evaluation method was proposed based on Louvain method for community detection and the other network graph parameter (average weighted degree). Simulations of evaluation method were made as a comparison between two random mobility models and one social based mobility model in order to point out differences between social and non-social mobility models. All models were evaluated by proposed method and other existing protocol dependent and independent methods. The main idea of the simulations was to analyse how the mobility models with social and non-social mobility models can affect the network performance and provide new and reliable tool, which enables analysis of the mobility models from social behaviour point of view.

The proposed algorithm is called LBA-Ie (Load Balancing Algorithm for IoT communications within e-health environment) and it is based on the integration of IoT communication parameters in the flow control process supported by TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). LBA-Ie is self-organized and adaptive algorithm by taking into account the changes occurred within the network, the links situations and the objects parameters. LBA-Ie is evaluated in terms of QoS (Quality of Service) and energy efficiency. The simulation results are compared to those obtained by three other solutions. LBA-Ie improves the QoS of IoT communications by increasing the data reliability which improves then the e-health applications. LBA-Ie allows also economizing the consumed energy by the objects and increase then their average lifetime.	adaptive algorithm;flow control (data);internet of things;load balancing (computing);logical block addressing;quality of service;replication (computing);self-organization;simulation	Sofiane Hamrioui;Pascal Lorenz	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254435	computer network;adaptive algorithm;quality of service;real-time computing;algorithm;algorithm design;transport layer;transmission control protocol;load management;computer science;load balancing (computing);flow control (data)	Mobile	7.596487876747372	83.42229931187917	75015

This technique produces huge redundant messages in each hop. These Redundant messages limit system scalability and cause unnecessary traffic in a network. To improve this searching technique and reduce redundant messages, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called HybridFlood. In HybridFlood algorithm, flooding scheme divided into two phases. At the first phase the algorithm follows flooding by limited number of hops. In the second phase, it chooses nosey nodes in each searching horizon. The nosey nodes are nodes, which have the most links to others. These nodes maintain the data index of all clients. The proposed algorithm extends the search efficiency by reducing redundant messages in each hop. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm decreases 60% of redundant messages and saves up to 70% of searching traffic.	algorithm;peer-to-peer	Hassan Barjini;Mohamed Othman;Hamidah Ibrahim	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16167-4_23	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Theory	3.3503720013057103	81.5397871439404	75175

The cost and complexity associated with infrastructure based wireless networking is leading researchers to investigate ad hoc networks.

We have developed a mobile agent based system that allows for real time topology discovery of the network. As opposed to many such mobile agent based systems that utilize """"ant"""" based algorithms, our system makes efficient use of the limited network resources of the ad hoc network by restricting the mobility of the agents.

In order to infer future contact opportunities, a large amount of information extracted from the context of users, such as its social behavior, associated to connectivity metrics have been used to design new forwarding protocols for opportunistic networks. Yet one open issue in this approach is the frequent usage of repeated nodes considered as the most likely to deliver the messages, thus funneling forwarded information towards certain routes containing such nodes overloading them and, therefore, causing a faster consumption of its battery resources. This paper presents SOCLEER, a social-based forwarding protocol which proposal is to relieve the constant demand for nodes considered most popular for forwarding messages in an opportunistic network. To this end, a performance evaluation was fulfilled and the SOCLEER protocol obtained better results than BUBBLE-Rap on forwarded messages load distribution, as well as a battery consumption reduction of preferred nodes when also compared to Epidemic and PROPHET protocols.	centrality;dot-com bubble;end-to-end principle;function overloading;load balancing (computing);operand forwarding;pagerank;performance evaluation;relay;sorted array;tracing (software)	Nelson Machado;Carlos Alberto Vieira Campos	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289178	computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.4139836382536046	82.57551477255984	75529

To achieve a precise synchronized clock between nodes, fast distribution of time information of a reference node to all other nodes in multi-hop without a scheduling is necessary. In this letter, we propose a time synchronization algorithm, RFTS (Ripple Flooding Time Synchronization), that presents the fastest distribution of time information of a reference node by using synchronized packet broadcasting instead of CSMA-CA based broadcasting. We show that error in any hops is not affected by a prior hop node in the evaluation, average error and distribution time of RFTS outperforms widely used FTSP by a factor of 2.5 and 2 respectively.	ripple effect	Jinyoung Yang;Daeyoung Kim	2012	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.9.691	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;linear regression;data synchronization;computer network	Embedded	9.963744159528762	83.87492657156297	75657

In WSNs, the existing multipath routing schemes have demonstrated the effectiveness of traffic distribution over multipaths to fulfill the quality of service requirements of applications. However, the failure of links might significantly affect the transmission performance, scalability, reliability, and security of WSNs. Thus, by considering the reliability, congestion control, and security for multipath, it is desirable to design a reliable and service-driven routing scheme to provide efficient and failure-tolerant routing scheme. In this paper, an evaluation metric, path vacant ratio, is proposed to evaluate and then find a set of link-disjoint paths from all available paths. A congestion control and load-balancing algorithm that can adaptively adjust the load over multipaths is proposed. A threshold sharing algorithm is applied to split the packets into multiple segments that will be delivered via multipaths to the destination depending on the path vacant ratio. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the adaptive and secure load-balance routing scheme.	algorithm;computer simulation;load balancing (computing);multipath propagation;multipath routing;network congestion;non-functional requirement;quality of service;scalability;service composability principle;service-oriented device architecture	Shancang Li;Shanshan Zhao;Xinheng Wang;Kewang Zhang	2014	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260626	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	-1.3521482814474692	83.71529499798912	75677

Previous research in this area has concentrated on routing algorithms which are designed for fully connected networks. The usual way to deal with a disconnected ad-hoc network is to let the mobile computer wait for network reconnection passively, which may lead to unacceptable transmission delays. In this paper, we propose an approach that guarantees message transmission in minimal time. In this approach, mobile hosts actively modify their trajectories to transmit messages.

Partly, the contribution to its increasing complexity and everlasting significance has some correlation to the continuous rising demands of public transportation. Transportation systems are now urged to break through the boundaries using communication technology. The integration of communication and computing in the realm of transportation is coined Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The reliability of transportation systems have yet to mature as there are still problems that require support or restructuring. The current new fleets of public transport lacks of proper communication assistance which could potentially identify traffic conditions instantly. The dynamic environments of transportation regions will always pose challenges to wireless communications. Accordingly, there is a need for reliable, uninterrupted and high speed communication systems for the application in ITS. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate a wireless communication protocol suitable for vehicular scenarios. The wireless communication scheme exhibits ad-hoc behavior and coupled with adaptive capabilities. Together, with multiple communication units, they are able to deliver reliable point-to-point wireless communication within a network. With good planning, the communication system can help with the improvements of the efficiency and safety public transportation systems.	communications protocol;hoc (programming language);linear network coding;modulation;network architecture;point-to-point protocol;sensor	Scott Carr Ken Lye;Zhan Wei Siew;Shee Eng Tan;Chen How Wong;Kenneth Tze Kin Teo	2012	2012 Sixth UKSim/AMSS European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation	10.1109/EMS.2012.70	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;intelligent transportation system;wireless wan;network architecture;broadcast communication network;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;wireless network;vehicular communication systems;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;advanced traffic management system;computer network	Embedded	5.8829288366994135	88.3335496953853	75893

In, a quick convergecast solution is proposed for data collection in a ZigBee beacon-enabled tree-based WSN. However, it does not consider the network repair issue. When a ZigBee router loses its link to its parent, all its descendants have to rejoin the network. The rejoining procedure is time-consuming and may incur high communication overheads. The proposed network repair scheme consists of a regular repair and an instant repair schemes. Periodically, the network coordinator can issue regular repair to refresh the network (so as to keep the network in good shape). During normal operations, if a router loses its parent, it tries instant repair to reconnect to a new parent. Our design thus improves over ZigBee in that nodes can continue their operations even during instant repair.	router (computing);web beacon	Meng-Shiuan Pan;Yu-Chee Tseng	2009	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOM.2009.5282363	maintenance engineering;embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network;data collection	Embedded	7.936452489797926	77.44043082639935	75974

In clustered WSNs the communication overheads and the energy consuming are minimized. In addition, network tasks like routing, data aggregation as well as networks self-reconfiguration are more easy. Although many previous efforts, clustering in mobile WSNs (MWSNs) is always a challenging problem due to the dynamic topology of the network and the limit of sensor resources. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to maximize clusters lifetime in MWSNs which is based on link lifetime between mobile sensors. Performances of the proposed method are measured through a simulation study using NS-2.	cluster analysis;data aggregation;performance;routing;sensor;simulation	Tarek Moulahi;Salem Nasri;Hervé Guyennet	2014		10.1145/2668260.2668282	telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;cluster analysis;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	9.038347470842481	79.57023416485686	76008

In this way, a set of optimal solutions, know as Pareto set is calculated in only one run of the algorithms, without a priori restrictions.

As a result, how to conserve the energy to prolong the network lifetime becomes a key problem in WBANs. In this paper, to address the energy conservation problem in WBANs, we develop an Energy-Efficient Leader Election mechanism, called EELE. In EELE, each node competes for the leader following the distributed leader election algorithm in which a utility function is constructed with the consideration of the residual energy and the location of the node. Moreover, a distance-aware hybrid communication mode is proposed such that a node can choose either direct communication or cooperative communication to alleviate the burden of the leader or the far node. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of EELE mechanism in terms of longer network lifetime, better energy characteristics and higher throughput.

The unpredictable motion and the unreliable behavior of mobile nodes is one of the key issues in wireless mobile network. Virtual mobile node (VMN) consists of robust virtual nodes that are both predictable and reliable. Based on VMN, in this paper, we present a hierarchical routing algorithm, i.e., EHRA-WAVE, for large-scale wireless mobile networks. By using mobile WAVE technology, a routing path can be found rapidly between VMNs without accurate topology information. We introduce the routing algorithm and the implementation issues of the proposed EHRA-WAVE routing algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the performance of EHRA-WAVE through experiments, and compare the performance on VMN failure and message delivery ratio using hierarchical and non-hierarchical routing methods. However, due to the large amounts WAVE flooding, EHRAWAVE results in too large load which would impede the application of the EHRA-WAVE algorithm. Therefore, the further routing protocol focuses on minimizing the number of WAVE using hierarchical structures in large-scale wireless mobile networks.	algorithm;experiment;routing;traverse	Guofeng Yan;Yuxing Peng;Ying Hu;Junyi Liu	2014	JNW	10.4304/jnw.9.2.344-352	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;quality of service;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile computing;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.498041140880577	83.2480249532199	76262

In this paper, we introduce a new divisible load scheduling strategy to solve the problem how to complete the tasks within the possibly shortest time in multi-sinks wireless sensor network. In this strategy, the tasks are distributed to wireless sensor network based on the processing and communication capacity of each sensors by multiple sinks. After received the sub-tasks, the intra-cluster sensors perform its tasks simultaneously, and send its results to cluster head sequentially. By removing communications interference between each sensor, reduced makespan and improved network resource utilization achieved. Cluster heads send fused data to sinks sequentially after fused the data got from intra-cluster sensors, which could overlap the task-performing and communication phase much better. A unique scheduling strategy that allows one to obtain closed form solutions for the optimal finish time and load allocation for each node in heterogeneous clustered networks is presented. And solutions for an optimal allocation of fractions of task to sensors in the network are also obtained via bi-level programming. Finally, simulation results indicate this strategy reasonably distributes tasks to each node in multi-sinks wireless sensor networks, and effectively reduces the time-consuming of task completion. Compared to the traditional single-sink structure, makespan is reduced by 20%, and the energyconsuming of sensors is more balanced.	black and burst;interference (communication);makespan;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing);sensor web;simulation	Liang Dai;Hongke Xu;Ting Chen	2011	JNW	10.4304/jnw.6.11.1586-1593	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	9.581395622602624	80.79228438732622	76694

Since communications among all network components in sensor networks are wireless, a peer-to-peer protocol is employed between two nodes. Among many concerns about design of sensor networks are growing bandwidth demands, speed of information retrieval, and transporting bytes over the wireless networks to provide a quality service for the diverse requirements of the users, such as signal processing or multimedia applications. Although traditional routing protocols ignore power management issues for sensor networks, design and implementation of an efficient energy based routing is in the core interest. In this paper, we discuss the current power management protocols, and propose an energy restrained information dissemination scheme. Experimental analysis and comparison with related work show that using the proposed scheme we can save substantial energy as compared to the prior methods.	baton;byte;computer architecture;computer engineering;data compression;definition;dropsy;electrical engineering;elegant degradation;fault tolerance;fault-tolerant computer system;gary kimura;hoc (programming language);ieee transactions on computers;image processing;information retrieval;interconnection;peer-to-peer;power management;quality of service;rouge (metric);requirement;routing;signal processing	Naoto Kimura;Vasu Jolly;Shahram Latifi	2006	IJDSN	10.1080/15501320600642692	wireless routing protocol;embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;ant;computer security;dissemination;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	6.605212529674593	77.13585619324267	76736

In this paper, we propose a new routing model to account for the link utilization between nodes, as well as the remaining energy left in each node. The framework, called Distributed Split-path, is implemented on top of the Optimized Link-State Routing (OLSR) protocol. We demonstrate the improvement our proposed scheme offers to the longevity of the network while maintaining similar performance as the original OLSR protocol. We devise a performance indicator to show in which cases our approach benefits the network system designer, depending on the priorities of the network application. Simulation results show that by allowing a trade-off in the performance, the new model outperforms current protocol.	centralized computing;data rate units;hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;mesh networking;network performance;optimized link state routing protocol;simulation;systems design	Paulo Alexandre Regis;Shamik Sengupta	2017	MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)	10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170838	performance indicator;hop (networking);optimized link state routing protocol;computer network;wireless;computer science;routing protocol;mesh networking	Mobile	6.905393004281414	83.42696265892077	76807

In hybrid wireless underground sensor network (HWUSN), communication between nodes is implemented from underground-to-air or air-to-underground, not underground-to-underground. This paper proposes a novel hybrid underground probabilistic routing protocol that provides an efficient means of communication for sensor nodes in HWUSN. In addition, signal propagation based on the shadowing model for underground medium is developed. The proposed routing protocol ensures high packet throughput, prolongs the lifetime of HWUSN and the random selection of the next hop with multi-path forwarding contributes to built-in security. Moreover, the proposed mechanism utilizes an optimal forwarding (OF) decision that takes into account of the link quality, and the remaining power of next hop sensor nodes. The performance of proposed routing protocol has been successfully studied and verified through the simulation and real test bed.

Based on these findings, hub-based routing has become one of the most promising strategies in order to successfully deliver messages in DTNs. Considering human mobility traces, we empirically prove that the selection of a suitable set of hubs as relays, not only ensures the same probability of successful delivery, but also leads to a decrease in the mean shortest path length, combined with a limited increase of the delivery time with respect to the optimal case. By analyzing the empirical distributions of path length and travel times, we study the conditions for the best trade-off between delay-optimal and delay-sub-optimal shortest paths, which uniquely depends on the number of hubs enabled as forwarders. This analysis turns out to be useful in the design of energy-saving routing algorithms based on epidemic propagation. We found that in some real experiments, using a very little set of hubs (under 50%) and limiting the number of hops per packet to three (corresponding to the mean delay-optimal shortest path length), epidemic routing guaranteed a delivery ratio around 90%, when tolerating at most double travel time only for a little fraction of messages.	algorithm;delay-tolerant networking;experiment;network packet;relay;routing;shortest path problem;software propagation;tracing (software);usb hub	Alessandro Adamo;Giuliano Grossi;Federico Pedersini	2010	2010 IFIP Wireless Days	10.1109/WD.2010.5657728	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	3.9969361013025773	84.88501427355762	77004

The typical MANET routing protocols of IETF are shortest routing protocols, that is, the least hops but do not consider the energy aware problem. Because the ad hoc networks is an energy constrained system with the portable devices, it is a very important metric to evaluate the routing protocols whether which have a longer network lifetime or not. Based on the mobile node energy level and using the different forward tactics, this paper presents an energy level based routing protocol-ELBRP. The routing protocol not only makes the system energy consumption low but also prolongs the system lifetime and improves the delay characteristic. In this paper, the proof of correctness and complexity analysis of ELBRP are given. This paper compares the performance of existing protocols AODV, RDRP and proposed ELBRP via simulation. The simulation result shows that ELBRP has a better delay performance, a lower energy consumption and longer network lifetime than the other two and provides an available approach to as hoc networks routing.	energy level;hoc (programming language);routing	Layuan Li;Chunlin Li;Peiyan Yuan	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-2166-4	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;energy level;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	6.042678212889745	82.61143257251832	77252

For mobility service, MIPv6 has been proposed by IETF. With no restriction on node's geographical location, mobility is provided to a mobile node (MN) by MIPv6. However, MIPv6 has critical points, such as handover latency resulting from movement detections, IP address configurations and location updates which is unacceptable in real-time application. To make up for it, hierarchical MIPv6 (HMIPv6) has been proposed. HMIPv6 guarantees to reduce handover latency, because the MN only registers the new addresses at mobility anchor point (MAP) when the MN moves around access routers in the same MAP domain. HMIPv6 still has packet loss problem when the MN moves from one MAP to another. In this paper, we propose an efficient handover scheme which reduces packet loss when the MN moves between MAP domains. We adopt the fast handover method from FMIPv6 (fast MIPv6) for proposed scheme.	mobile ip	Kyunghye Lee;Youngsong Mun	2005		10.1007/11424758_43	internet protocol;embedded system;the internet;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;network interface;operating system;packet loss;critical point;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-2.444828146901513	77.13711731369031	77268

However, due to the complexity of the problem, existing solutions have various limitations. In this paper, we analyze the inherent factors, design principles and evaluation methods for cost function based routing algorithms. Two energy aware cost based routing algorithms named Exponential and Sine Cost Function based Route (ESCFR) and Double Cost Function based Route (DCFR) have been proposed in this paper. For ESCFR, its cost function can map small changes in nodal remaining energy to large changes in the function value. For DCFR, its cost function takes into consideration the end-to-end energy consumption, nodal remaining energy, resulting in a more balanced and efficient energy usage among nodes. The performance of the cost function design is analyzed. Extensive simulations demonstrate the proposed algorithms have significantly better performance than existing competing algorithms. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The LCCA system applies vehicular sensor networks to preventing chain vehicle collisions, which allows vehicles with merely onboard sensors to prevent such collisions on the road because of sharp stops. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CCA system that does not use inaccurate GPS locations and costly roadside infrastructures to avoid chain vehicle collisions. LCCA employs inter-vehicle communications and onboard sensing to form warning groups, where each warning group is a set of vehicles that drive along the same lane and every pair of adjacent cars is within a certain distance. Only single-hop transmissions are needed to join/leave a warning group, thus keeping the group maintenance overhead low. When a sudden braking is taken in a warning group, LCCA can quickly propagate warning messages among group members. This paper demonstrates our current prototype.	global positioning system;overhead (computing);prototype;sensor;vehicle-to-vehicle	Lien-Wu Chen;Po-Chun Chou	2013		10.1145/2500423.2505293	simulation;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.393299927140273	83.55540902833384	77452
53009cc2eb4d03d0c70ed31db616ba6e9bf181cc	par: petal ant routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc network		During route discovery of mobile ad hoc network, broadcasting of route request and route reply packets are the essential operations for finding the path between two ends. In such situations, intermediate node which may or may not belongs will participate in route discovery process, update routing table and rebroadcast the route discovery packets again to its neighboring nodes. Finally optimal path is found with minimum hops. This simply upsurges overhead and deteriorates the performance of routing. The proposed Petal Ant Routing (PAR) algorithm offers a low overhead by optimizing FANT and BANT transmissions in route discover process. The algorithm is an improved version of SARA and has features extracted from petal routing. The algorithm is simulated on NS2, compared with ACO frame work called SARA and classical routing protocols such as AODV and AOMDV. The simulation results shows that PAR further reduces overhead by eliminating redundant FANT transmission compared to other routing algorithm.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);routing table;simulation	M.

Existing solutions for multicast in WSNs are limited because they either support multicast only from a single source node (usually the root node) or they limit the multicast group size to constrain memory usage. Our design allows any node to be a mulitcast source with an unlimited number of subscribers. We constrain the memory usage by approximating multicast group membership using a fixed sized Bloom filter. The efficiency of the protocol degrades as the false positive rate of the Bloom filter increases; however, correct operation is always maintained. Using detailed simulations we show that PIM-WSN achieves 1) high packet delivery rate (over 97%), 2) low latency per hop (less than 5 ms), and 3) lower radio utilization than all other comparable protocols (by more than 50%). Using a ten-hop testbed of TelosB motes we have verified our implementation of PIM-WSN for TinyOS 2.× with the Blip IPv6 networking stack which uses only 5,978 bytes of ROM and 235 bytes of RAM.	bloom filter;byte;multicast;network packet;protocol stack;random-access memory;routing;testbed;timeout (computing);tinyos;trace-based simulation;tree (data structure);unicast;vii	Alan Marchiori;Qi Han	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks	10.1109/WoWMoM.2011.5986469	embedded system;real-time computing;multicast;wireless sensor network;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Mobile	6.307522502101041	84.34725123902055	77568

Our forwarding scheme includes Two-Hop Forwarding and the conventional Epidemic Routing as special cases. In such forwarding schemes, the original packet is copied many times and its packet copies spread over the network. Therefore those packet copies should be deleted after a packet reaches the destination. We analyze the performance of (p, q)-Epidemic Routing with VACCINE recovery scheme. Unlike most of the existing studies, we discuss the performance of (p, q)-Epidemic Routing in depth, taking account of the recovery process that deletes unnecessary packets from the network.	hoc (programming language);hop;network packet;population;routing	Takahiro Matsuda;Tetsuya Takine	2008	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2008.080605	vehicular ad hoc network;policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;index term;dsrflow;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ip forwarding;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;computer network	Mobile	1.8996581284472307	82.78302820299857	77570

Since AODV routing in MANETs is known for its advantageous properties, the proposed routing algorithm is based on the AODV, and called RAODV (Resilient AODV). In the route discovery phase, it differs from AODV, which only establishes one routing path from a source node to the destination node, whereas RAODV establishes as many routes as possible. Thus, when the primary route breaks, the node can immediately adopt an alternative route without further route research effort. If no possible alternative route exists, the node will transmit the route break information backward to instruct the previous node on the reverse route to select an alternative one, and so on. The proposed RAODV can reduce the number of route rediscovery procedures, and thus improve the packet loss rate and transmission delay, especially in sparse MANETs. Simulator ns2 was used to evaluate the performance of RAODV. In some cases, the proposed RAODV was able to reduce the packet loss rate by 72.61% compared to traditional AODV.	algorithm;experiment;hoc (programming language);network packet;route distinguisher;routing;software deployment;sparse matrix;transmission (bittorrent client)	Ming-Yang Su;Chih-Wei Yang	2015	2015 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)	10.1109/HPCSim.2015.7237102	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;dsrflow;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.764675409877702	83.96687566405159	77593

Specifically, network lifetime and packet delay are investigated for two alternative forwarding schemes: random forwarding and deterministic forwarding. In the random forwarding, a probabilistic function is used to select a next-hop from the set of candidate nodes, whereas the candidate node with the greatest value (or minimum cost if it is favored) in terms of routing metric is selected in the deterministic forwarding. In order to gain the insight into the nature of those forwarding schemes, we establish a Markov chain model for a simple two-hop network. Based on the analytic model, we obtain the network lifetime for two alternative schemes and identify the conditions in which one scheme outperforms the other. Moreover, the simulation results using ns2 validate that such conditions exist even in more realistic scenarios.	end-to-end principle;glossary of computer graphics;markov chain;metrics (networking);network packet;network performance;quantum fluctuation;routing;simulation	Shu Li;Jeong Geun Kim	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554728	wireless ad hoc network;routing table;stochastic process;bidirectional forwarding detection;virtual routing and forwarding;routing;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;forwarding information base;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;ip forwarding;probability;distributed computing;packet forwarding;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;forwarding plane;markov process;mobile wireless sensor network;statistics;computer network	Mobile	5.620748241263386	85.41876291052178	77784

Flooding and SPIN, which are very well-known proactive methods, spontaneously disseminate the sensed data without a request from an arbitrary sink node. However, these proactive protocols disseminate the data even to some nodes that do not need it, which is energy inefficient. In order to overcome this weakness, we introduce a novel semi-proactive protocol to disseminate only to pertinent nodes instead of all nodes. Thus some nodes, such as arbitrary sink nodes that want the sensed data, are able to obtain the data easily within n hops. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol has higher average node energy efficiency than that of well-known earlier work, SPIN. If a proactive protocol, such as SPIN, is changed to semi-proactive and has only a 1-hop burden, then the energy efficiency enhancement is up to 83.7% compared with SPIN.	accessibility;relevance;spin;semiconductor industry;simulation	Moonseong Kim;Matt W.

This new algorithm attempts to reduce the initialization overhead in determining the optimal transmission power level while providing good link qualities. Our testbed experiment results show that ODTPC consumes much less energy than previous transmission power control algorithms (PCBL ( D. Son,et al.) and ATPC (S.

To face the short lifetime, some sensor nodes have the option to connect an extra battery, or to use smart battery-packs with multiple cells. In these cases, a major technique to save the energy is to schedule the batteries or battery cells through the properties of the batteries. This study presents a scheduling algorithm to decide which batteries have to work based on the remaining energy. Hence, the energy consumption model of node based on ZigBee protocol was proposed. The parameters, including working current, working voltage, time duration of data sending and receiving, and so on are used to establish energy consumption model of node. Experiment based on JN5148 shows that the energy consumption model is feasible. Using the kinetic battery model and configuring relevant parameters can accurately express battery’s energy consumption curve. On the basis of the above work, MATLAB simulation results show that the proposed battery scheduling strategy is superior to best-of-two scheduling.	algorithm;matlab;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;smart battery	Rencheng Jin;Zhiping Che;Zhen Wang;Ming Zhu;Liding Wang	2015	IET Wireless Sensor Systems	10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0097	embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Embedded	9.96914267327548	80.92978308859674	78142

The paper proposes a new routing algorithm based on the geographical position, called Multi-Priority Opportunistic Directional Routing (MPODR). The algorithm improves the existing Opportunistic Directional Forwarding Strategy from two aspects. Moreover, it works together with 802.11p protocol, and adds a strategy to process the security alarm packets with high-priority, which makes the algorithm reliable and efficient. We compare the performance of GPSR and MPODR using network simulator NS2, with a specialized node mobility model simulator called VanetMobiSim to produce realistic vehicular movement trace. In the simulation, MPODR shows a much better performance than GPSR, the packet loss rate is reduced by about 80%, and the delay of the high-priority packet is within 300ms. As a result, MPODR is more suitable for vehicular network.	algorithm;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;hfss;hoc (programming language);könig's lemma;network packet;programming tool;simulation	Zhigang Jin;Wei Deng;Ningxiao Yan;Bing Li	2010	2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633560	routing table;routing;geography;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.494198607545705	85.65881085983216	78198

The determination of the best route is not an easy process, and requires research into metrics that identify the best path, such as network performance, processing power, node’s identification, battery power, and so on. These models will be appraised in terms of performance, reconfigurability, and easy of installation.

Since the GPS device is expensive, we used a small number of fixed anchor nodes that are aware of their locations to help estimate the locations of sensor nodes in WSNs. To efficiently route sensed data to the destination (the server), identifying the location of each sensor node can be of great help. We adopted a range-free color-theory based dynamic localization (CDL) [Shen-Hai Shee, Kuochen Wang, I.L. Hsieh, Color-theory-based dynamic localization in mobile wireless sensor networks, in: Proceedings of Workshop on Wireless, Ad Hoc, Sensor Networks, August 2005] approach, to help identify the location of each sensor node. Since sensor nodes are battery-powered, we propose an efficient color-theory-based energy efficient routing (CEER) algorithm to prolong the life time of each sensor node. The uniqueness of our approach is that by comparing the associated RGB values among neighboring nodes, we can efficiently choose a better routing path with energy awareness. Besides, the CEER has no topology hole problem. Simulation results have shown that our CEER algorithm can save up to 50-60% energy than ESDSR [Mohammed Tarique, Kemal E. Tepe, Mohammad Naserian, Energy saving dynamic source routing for ad hoc wireless networks, in: Proceedings of Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks, April 2005, pp. 305-310] in mobile wireless sensor networks. In addition, the latency per packet of CEER is 50% less than that of ESDSR.	algorithm;mobile phone;routing	Tai-Jung Chang;Kuochen Wang;Yi-Ling Hsieh	2008	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2007.10.004	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;satellite navigation;systems modeling;wireless sensor network;internationalization and localization;sensor node;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;sensor array;computer network	Mobile	-0.5519690986712027	75.87505038827203	78278
4f9dd4ca20d23256c941005bf85528248ea27d2b	efficient data aggregation and routing in wireless sensor networks. (agrégation et routage efficace de données dans les réseaux de capteurs sans fils)		Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have gained much attention in a large range of technical fields such as industrial, military, environmental monitoring etc. Sensors are powered by batteries, which are not easy to replace in harsh environments. The energy stored by each sensor is the greatest impediment for increasing WSN lifetime, because power failure of a sensor not only affects the sensor itself, but also its ability to forward packets on behalf of others sensors. Since data transmission consumes more energy than sensing and processing activities, our major concern is how to efficiently transmit the data from all sensors towards a sink. We address this issue by proposing a global solution addressing aggregation, routing as well as channel assignment. We suggest three tree-based data aggregation algorithms: Depth-First Search Aggregation (DFSA), Flooding Aggregation (FA) and Well-Connected Dominating Set Aggregation (WCDSA) to reduce the number of transmissions from each sensor towards the sink. In each proposed algorithm, the degree of connectivity of each sensor is taken into account in the tree construction, by electing sensors having the highest degree of connectivity as parents, and sensors with the lowest as leaves. As a result, aggregated data is efficiently transmitted along the shortest path through multiple hops from parent to parent towards the sink, helping to reduce the number of individual transmissions. Our approach provides local optimization for energy saving that can be used in dense configurations. Tree-based data aggregation suffers from increased data delivery time because the parents must wait for the data from their leaves. As the network topology varies randomly, some parents might have many leaves, making it very expensive for a parent to store all incoming data in its buffer. We need to determine the aggregation time each parent in the tree has to spend in aggregating and processing the data from its leaves. Failing to account for aggregation time may lead to a longer waiting time for each parent and increase the overall data delivery latency. We propose an Efficient Tree-based Aggregation and Processing Time (ETAPT) algorithm using Appropriate Data Aggregation and Processing Time (ADAPT) metric. Given the maximum acceptable latency, ETAPT’s algorithm takes into account the position of parents, their number of leaves and the depth of the tree, in order to compute an optimal ADAPT time to parents with more leaves, so increasing data aggregation gain and ensuring enough time to process data from leaves. The results obtained show that our ETAPT provides a higher data aggregation gain, with lower energy consumed and end-to-end delay. At any time, the amount of data aggregated by parents may becomes greater than the amount of data that can be forwarded. To alleviate this, we propose the introduction into the network of many data aggregators called Mini-Sinks (MSs). MSs are mobile and move according to a random mobility model inside the sensor field to maintain the fully-connected network in order to aggregate the data based on the controlled Multipath Energy Conserving Routing Protocol (MECRP). A set of multiple paths is then generated between MSs and sensors in order to distribute the global traffic. We have showed that our original solution can achieve better results in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, network lifetime, and residual energy compared to the single and mobile sink solutions. Sensors may use many radio interfaces sharing a single wireless channel, which they may use to communicate with several neighbours. Two sensors operating on the same wireless channel may interfere with each other during the transmission of data: packets will be lost and will therefore not be received. We need to know which channel to use in the presence of multiple channels for a given transmission. We propose a distributed Well-Connected Dominating Set Channel Assignment (WCDS-CA) approach, in which the number of channels that are needed over all sensor nodes in the network in such a way that adjacent sensor nodes are assigned to distinct channels. Parents and leaves are assigned to a single static channel. Mediators, are assigned to several orthogonal channels so that they can dynamically switch to the static channels of the parents to aggregate the data. This allows the data to be efficiently propagated in parallel on multiple channels from the parent to the mediator to the parent towards the sink. Our approach outperforms Sensor Multi-Channel Medium Access Control (SMC MAC) and the single channel in terms of interference, sink throughput, broadcast latency, routing overhead and energy consumption.

We assume that link-state routing is used, and we essentially propose a reputation system, where trusted gateway nodes compute Node Trust Values for the routers, which are fed back into the system and used in the route selection procedure. The computation of the Node Trust Values is based on packet counters maintained in association with each route and reported to the gateways by the routers in a regular manner. The feedback mechanism is based on limited scope flooding. The received Node Trust Values concerning a given router are aggregated, and the aggregate trust value of the router determines the probability with which that router is kept in the topology graph used for route computation. Hence, less trusted routers are excluded from the topology graph with higher probability, while the route selection still runs on a weighted graph (where the weights are determined by the announced link qualities), and it does not need to be changed. We evaluated the performance of our solution by means of simulations. The results show that our proposed mechanism can detect misbehaving routers reliably, and thanks to the feedback and the exclusion of the accused nodes from the route selection, we can decrease the number of packets dropped due to router misbehavior considerably. At the same time, our mechanism only slightly increases the average route length.	aggregate data;compiler;computation;embedded system;feedback;link-state routing protocol;linux;mesh networking;network packet;openwrt;quality of service;reputation system;router (computing);sensor;simulation;wireless mesh network	Gergely Ács;Levente Buttyán;László Dóra	2010	"""2010 IEEE International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534995	wireless mesh network;core router;link state packet;routing;convergence;logic gate;route poisoning;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;feedback;distributed computing;administrative distance;routing protocol;one-armed router;particle detector;default gateway;wireless;computer network	Metrics	2.7204518280284846	78.35548029015317	78414

In particular, the paper focuses on a new approach which we call stochastic partitioning. We investigate the performance of this technique and develop an intelligent partitioning strategy that reduces the computational effort in routing, usually by orders of magnitude. The trade-off is an increase in QoS blocking probability (probability of failure to find a path that satisfies the QoS constraints). Finally, simulation results are produced which demonstrate the benefits and some practical limitations of stochastic partitioning.	algorithm;blocking (computing);computation;emoticon;erlang (unit);image scaling;network topology;overhead (computing);quality of service;randomness;routing;scalability;simulation;stochastic gradient descent;stochastic optimization;window function;windows rt	Swati Sinha Deb;Michael E.

5fcb73db3249886d3d249f51543869acc3022704	city-level ip geolocation algorithm based on pop network topology		The existing city-level IP geolocation algorithms determine the location of IP by delay measurement and landmark comparison, and thus, the geolocation ability of these algorithms is affected by the delay precision and the number of landmarks. To alleviate the dependence on these conditions, a new city-level geolocation algorithm is proposed based on the PoP network topology in this paper. First, according to the distribution of one-hop delay between network nodes in different cities, the network nodes belonging to the target city are picked out from the detection path, and the landmarks are extended. Second, common anonymous route structures are used to find and merge anonymous routes in the path information. Finally, the PoP network topology inside the city is extracted through the tightly connected network nodes, recorded into the PoP database, and used for city-level geolocation. The experiment results of 35 808 IP geolocations in 28 cities of China and the United States verify that the proposed algorithm still has good city-level geolocation ability when the delay accuracy is low or the number of landmarks is small, comparing with the existing typical IP geolocation algorithms LBG and SLG, the proposed algorithm improves the success rate of city-level geolocation from 74.86% and 94.14% to 97.67%.

The environments of IoT require highly efficient, immediate and worldwide communication services. Accordingly, efficient multicast routing architecture is a fundamental premise for IoT. This paper proposes a mixed multicast architecture for IoT environments that employs the centric, hierarchical, and distributed traditional multicast architectures. The aim is to determine the most suitable traditional multicast architecture, relative to the current state of the IoT system. First, an algorithm to manage the proposed multicast architecture is introduced. Then, an IoT case study for each traditional multicast architecture is demonstrated. Finally, a simulation environment is established, using the network simulator package NS2, to measure the performance of the proposed architecture. The considered performance metrics are end-to-end delay, packet loss, throughput, energy consumption, and transformation rate between traditional multicast architectures. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture relative to individual traditional multicast architectures.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;internet of things;multicast;network packet;performance evaluation;routing;simulation;smoothing;throughput	Omar Said;Amr Tolba	2018	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-018-2386-6	throughput;multicast;computer science;distributed computing;packet loss;architecture;network simulation;internet of things	Networks	-1.2995183523197247	86.47177090340753	78750

The analysis is based on Contiki's Rime networking protocol stack, and its target is to determine an upper bound for the stated metrics. We explain that in Contiki with CSMA-CA as a MAC layer protocol, a node's throughput is limited to 8.1 kbps, at maximum, even without power saving features. In order to maximize a node's transmission capability, we modified Contiki's CSMA-CA implementation. A number of simulations are performed, and it is observed that with our modifications node throughput reaches 45 kbps, at maximum. Simulation results for estimating the channel capacity with our modified CSMA-CA MAC layer protocol show that the average per-node delay is low when the offered data load remains below 100 kbps. For an offered load of 100 kbps, the channel drops almost 20% of packets. Going beyond 100 kbps results in large latencies and significant packet loss. Results presented in this paper can serve as basis for the available bandwidth estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), QoS-based routing, and design of congestion control algorithm.	algorithm;channel capacity;communications protocol;contiki;data rate units;event (computing);experiment;network congestion;network packet;operating system;protocol stack;quality of service;routing;simulation;throughput	Muhammad Omer Farooq;Thomas Kunz	2012	2012 IFIP Wireless Days	10.1109/WD.2012.6402828	carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;embedded system;service set;neurfon;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;engineering;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;hidden node problem;computer network	Mobile	8.317284066998672	85.79182778319525	78755

These protocols assume high path stability between the mobile nodes in the network. This paper studies persistence of paths under various mobility patterns and network sizes. The conclusions drawn from this study enable us to determine the effectiveness of caching and also to suggest suitable caching durations. The simulation experiments indicate that path persistence declines with increasing network density and diameter. Restricting the motion of nodes increases path persistence while also increasing network partitioning. Hence, caching of routes in mobile ad hoc networks appears to have serious scalability problems.	algorithm;cache (computing);experiment;hoc (programming language);network partition;persistence (computer science);routing;scalability;simulation	Ashwini Kamat;Ravi Prakash	2000		10.1109/ICCCN.2000.885518	communications protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.0755677414001767	84.07165798442568	78790

DMPR poses significant challenges in terms of obtaining loopfree multiple (disjoint) paths and effectively forwarding the data over the multiple paths, the latter being particularly significant in datagram networks. One approach to reduce the number of routing table entries for multipath forwarding is to construct two trees, namely red and blue, rooted at a destination node such that the paths from a source to the destination on the two trees are link/node-disjoint. This paper develops the first distributed algorithm for constructing the colored trees whose running time is linear in the number of links in the network. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of employing generalized low-point concept rather than traditional low-point concept in the DFS-tree to reduce the average path lengths on the colored trees.	distributed algorithm;multipath propagation;multipath routing;pokémon red;routing table;time complexity	Srinivasan Ramasubramanian;Mithun Harkara;Marwan Krunz	2006		10.1007/11753810_85	multipath propagation;time complexity;distributed algorithm;routing;combinatorics;average path length;computer science;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;mathematics;distributed computing;robustness	Networks	-3.0470746856766753	74.9531841498134	78852

In this paper, the Best Fit Node Policy (BFNP) is proposed to repair coverage holes of WSN. The main idea of Best Fit Node Policy (BFNP) is that WSN detects the coverage holes when the base station has found the failed nodes of network, and selects the closest inactive node to the center of the minimal coverage circle of the polygon that surrounds the hole and then replaces the failed nodes, meanwhile activates the closest inactive node to repair the coverage holes. The simulation results show that Best Fit Node Policy can maintain better quality of coverage, make higher utilization of energy resources, and extend lifetime of networks. In conclusion, BFNP performs superior to the Coverage Hole Patching Algorithm (CHPA).	algorithm;best practice;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Xiaoheng Deng;Chu-Gui Xu;Fu-Yao Zhao;Yi Liu	2010	2010 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/EUC.2010.61	maintenance engineering;embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.702903302426549	79.24515563228886	78989

Each intermediate wireless sensor node broadcast data messages in its wireless transmission range to forward them to its next-hop intermediate wireless sensor node. Hence, eavesdropper wireless nodes within the wireless transmission range easily overhear the data messages. In order to interfere with the eavesdropper wireless nodes illegally overhearing the data messages in transmission, wireless sensor nodes whose wireless transmission ranges overlap and their next-hop intermediate wireless sensor nodes are out of the wireless transmission ranges each other forward data messages in transmission concurrently and cause collisions between these two data messages at any possible eavesdropper wireless nodes intentionally. To enhance regions where concurrently forwarded data messages intentionally collide to prevent their overhearing and to realize concurrent forwarding of data messages, this paper designes an algorithm for TDMA transmission slot assignments for more opportunities to interfere the eavesdropper wireless nodes.

ca9ea6fb8ab090b8e8f7842269b6be1b7df9a428	a cache-aware congestion control for reliable transport in wireless sensor networks		Data caching and congestion control are two strategies that can enhance the transport reliability in constrained Wireless Sensor Networks. However, these two mechanisms are designed independently for most transport protocols developed for WSN. This work developed a new cache-aware congestion control mechanism for reliable transport. RT-CaCC utilizes cache management policies such as cache insertion, cache elimination and cache size to mitigate packet losses in the network while maximizing cache utilization and resource allocation. It uses two cache management policies for packet loss detection: implicit notifications and expiration of timeout. In addition, it utilizes congestion avoidance using cache-aware rate control mechanism employing transmission window limit as a function of cache size. Results showed that the RT-CaCC obtained significant improvement gain in terms of cache utilization, end-to-end delay and throughput performance specifically during high level of packet loss in the network.	network congestion	Melchizedek I.

MANETs are especially popular in locations that lack a fixed communication infrastructure. To achieve zero-configuration MANETs, as well as quick and easy access to network resources, resources must be well managed by the network. This paper proposes a hierarchical service discovery and advertisement protocol (HSDAP) implemented in the routing layer. HSDAP queries services by piggybacking service REQuest (SREQ) packets on routing packets to reduce overhead and energy consumption. We extend the cluster-based routing protocol (CBRP) to improve service management hierarchy. Simulation results show that adding service discovery and advertisement (SDA) functions to CBRP does not significantly affect overhead. SDA overhead, routing overhead, energy consumption, and SDA delay are significantly less than the extended zone routing protocol. Furthermore, SDA hit ratio of the proposed protocol is greater than 86% for various levels of mobility. The proposed HSDAP is robust and scalable.

A multicast routing tree with multiple QoS constraints may be the tree in which the delay, delay-jitter, packet-loss and bandwidth should satisfy the pre-specified bounds. This paper discusses the multicast routing problem with multiple QoS constraints, which may deal with the delay, delay-jitter, bandwidth and packet-loss metrics, and describes a network model for researching the routing problem. It presents a QoS multicast routing protocol with dynamic group topology (QMRPD). The QMRPD attempts to significantly reduce the overhead of constructing a multicast tree with multiple QoS constraints. In MPRMQ, a multicast group member can join or leave a multicast session dynamically, which should not disrupt the multicast tree. It also attempts to minimize overall cost of the tree, and satisfy the multiple QoS constraints and least cost's (or lower cost) requirements. In this paper, the proof of correctness and complexity analysis of the QMRPD are also given. Simulation results show that QMRPD is an available approach to multicast routing decision with dynamic group topology.	multicast;quality of service;routing	Layuan Li;Chunlin Li	2005	Inf.

The scatternet formation algorithm includes two phases. In the first phase, a root node begins to create a conventional tree-shaped topology. To improve the network reliability of tree topology, a return connection mechanism is introduced in the second phase to generate more connection paths and to convert the tree-shape into a mesh-shaped topology. The mechanism contains two connection models including the ‘slave/slave mesh’ (SSM) and the ‘master/slave mesh’ (MSM) models. The SSM model builds a mesh-shaped topology by interconnecting more leaf nodes, whereas the MSM model connects additional intermediate nodes to establish the backbone connection in a mesh-shaped topology. Simulation results show that the enhanced Bluetree effectively improves the performance metrics, including the piconet efficiency, path length and end-to-end delay, beyond the Bluetree with more formation packets. As a result, the enhanced Bluetree not only builds a mesh-shaped topology that improves the network reliability but also generates an efficient network with less packet delay performance than a conventional Bluetree network.	bluetooth;mesh networking	Chih-Min Yu;Jyun Hong Lin	2012	IET Wireless Sensor Systems	10.1049/iet-wss.2011.0059	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Embedded	0.1871592155708881	84.37751240092945	79386
3cc46951f4abbba5a33414c70261b53b5fbdedad	mobility as the main enabler of opportunistic data dissemination in urban scenarios		The use of opportunistic communications to disseminate common interest messages in an urban scenario have various applications, like sharing traffic status, advertising shop offers, spread alarms, and so on. In this paper, we evaluate the combined use of fixed and mobile nodes to establish an optimal urban opportunistic network aimed at the distribution of general interest data. Our results not only contradict current assumptions about the combination of fixed and mobile nodes, but also provide interesting generalpurpose observations about the dynamics of opportunistic networks. First of all, we found that mobility is not the hindering and challenging property of these networks, but probably their main enabler. Moreover, we determined that if we want to increase the performance of opportunistic networks by increasing the node density, we should increase the number of mobile and not the fixed nodes since adding fixed nodes only increases the overhead. Finally, our evaluation approach goes beyond the state of the art and is based on using two different simulators, the ONE and OMNeT++, and two different mobility traces from cities with different structure.	apollonian network;list of code lyoko episodes;overhead (computing);simulation;tracing (software)	Jorge Herrera-Tapia;Anna Förster;Enrique Hernández-Orallo;Asanga Udugama;Andrés Tomás;Pietro Manzoni	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67910-5_9	computer network;vehicular ad hoc network;computer security;enabling;delay-tolerant networking;computer science;dissemination	Mobile	4.031327263487975	87.35463624777033	79405

The scheme is oblivious, compact, and completely decentralized. It is intended to support dynamic and diverse multicast requests typical of, for example, publish/subscribe and content-based communication. The scheme is built on top of a geographical routing layer. Each message is transmitted along the geometric minimum spanning tree that connects the source and all the destinations. Then, for each edge in this tree, the scheme routes a message through a random intermediate node, chosen independently of the set of multicast requests. The intermediate node is chosen in the vicinity of the corresponding edge such that congestion is reduced without stretching the routes by more than a constant factor. We first evaluate the scheme analytically, showing that it achieves a theoretically optimal level of congestion. We then evaluate the scheme in simulation, showing that its performance is also good in practice.	file spanning;minimum spanning tree;multicast;network congestion;publish–subscribe pattern;routing;simulation	Antonio Carzaniga;Koorosh Khazaei;Fabian Kuhn	2012		10.1145/2248371.2248395	real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;dynamic source routing;minimum spanning tree;wireless network;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;publish–subscribe pattern;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;geographic routing;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-0.8312866088505267	81.09749078414809	79443

This helps to achieve connectivity even if an end-to-end contemporaneous path does not exist between a pair of nodes. Next-hop decision is generally dependent on future probability of encounters with a destination node while other constraints on nodes' resources are ignored. We argue, in this paper that considering multiple parameters related to destination dependent and independent characteristics of a node, while determining its next-hop fitness, can help achieve better performance in resource-stringent opportunistic network environments. Our proposed routing protocol, MARS, not only gets itself cognizant of mobility patterns present within the network but also combines these mobility patterns with other stochastic information about nodes' characteristics. With the help of simulations, we show that MARS is able to achieve high delivery rates and comparable end-to-end latency with well-known routing protocols while maintaining its overhead to a significantly low limit.	end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;overhead (computing);routing;simulation	Sadaf Yasmin;Rao Naveed Bin Rais;Amir Qayyum	2014	2014 23rd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2014.6911876	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	4.58176324441088	83.99877056196951	79458
a05ce7e4eec2050f454505b11d218a8dc5e35510	optimisation of the enhanced distance based broadcasting protocol for manets	mobile ad hoc networks;broadcasting;energy use optimisation;multi-objective optimisation	Mobile ad hoc networks (or MANETs) are wireless networks that are spontaneously created by the neighbouring devices, without the use of any kind of infrastructure. These devices usually rely on batteries, so the lifetime of this type of network highly depends on the energy consumption of the devices composing it. Therefore, the optimisation of the energy consumption is a must in a realistic MANET. We deal in this paper with the optimisation of enhanced distance based (or EDB) broadcasting protocol for MANETs. EDB is an improved version of DB (distance based protocol), a state-of-the-art broadcasting protocol for MANETs, that is focussed on saving the energy used by the devices in the dissemination process (an essential component in MANETs), without degrading the network connectivity or the performance in the coverage of the broadcasting process. A set of parameters were identified in EDB and optimised using CellDE, a hybrid multi-objective optimisation algorithm, to maximise the coverage of the broadcast while minimising at the same time both the energy consumption and the broadcast time. The ns3 simulator was used to evaluate the different configurations of EDB. As a result, 100 different solutions are provided for every studied network, covering a wide range of design options; all of them have quality better than or similar to that provided by EDB with previously recommended values for its parameters.	algorithm;apollonian network;bus (computing);communications protocol;dbm;decibel;display resolution;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;simulation	Patricia Ruiz;Bernabé Dorronsoro;Giorgio Valentini;Frédéric Pinel;Pascal Bouvry	2011	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-011-0564-x	telecommunications;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	6.278987215409927	82.97647609297168	79459

Vehicular Ad-hoc Network, VANET, is one of the emerging technologies, which will make the life easier. VANET provide an important knowledge to drivers. This knowledge is provided by one vehicle to another using vehicle to vehicle communications. To make VANET successful, routing protocols should be given a greater attention. In this paper, we present SODV Speed based On Demand Vector link routing protocol which is an AODV based routing protocol. SODV improve the routing process and make the choice of neighboring vehicles more and more relevant by taking into consideration the vehicle velocity in packet transmission procedure. Performance analysis illustrates that SODV outperform AODV routing protocol especially in transmission delay.	end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);network packet;routing;velocity (software development)	Manel Kchaou;Lamia Chaari	2017	2017 Sixth International Conference on Communications and Networking (ComNet)	10.1109/COMNET.2017.8285587	computer network;computer science;transmission delay;vehicular ad hoc network;routing protocol;network packet;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;intelligent transportation system;transmission (mechanics)	Mobile	3.9845143410872765	86.27788239119623	79516

A new mobility model is developed to represent the steady state node distribution, and it accurately captures the statistical properties of random node arrival, time-varying node speed, and the distinct behaviors of nodes following different traffic patterns.With the mobility model, the statistical properties of network connectivity are studied and identified. Unlike most previous works that do not consider the impacts of transmission latency, which is critical for real time applications, this paper identifies the quantitative relationship between network connectivity and delay constraint. The results are applicable to both delay constrained networks and delay tolerant networks. The connectivity analysis is performed with a novel geometry-assisted analytical method. Exact connectivity probability expressions are developed by using the volumes of a hypercube intersected by a hyperplane, and a hyperpyramid. The geometry-assisted analytical method significantly simplifies the connectivity analysis.	steady state	Jingxian Wu	2009	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2009.090917	probability density function;real-time computing;mobile telephony;computer science;delay-tolerant networking;probability;distributed computing;mobility model;steady state;mobile computing;network delay;statistics;computer network	Mobile	2.626691816369979	87.08701409862765	79631

As part of CPS, sensor networks can observe a physical system by acquiring data and processing queries. In this paper, a query processing approach based on a queuing model is proposed for a mass of periodic queries and ad hoc queries, which are both expected to be supported simultaneously for the soft real-time applications in the large-scale sensor networks. A query processing region is provided as a buffer where the nodes are able to map the data of remote nodes and queries, so as to process queries in time. Based on queuing theory, a management model is developed for the queries in the buffer with its optimization scheme designed, thus giving the appropriate width and position of the buffer to design the algorithm of query processing. The experimental results show that this approach is very efficient at decreasing the query misses and saving the energy.	algorithm;computation;cyber-physical system;database;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;query optimization;queueing theory;real-time clock;real-time computing	Fangfang Li;Dejun Yue;Chuanwen Li	2010	2010 12th International Asia-Pacific Web Conference	10.1109/APWeb.2010.57	query optimization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;database;distributed computing;computer network;spatial query	DB	9.357238133459942	75.74052529614471	79921

In order to extend the network lifetime, how to select the best route is a critical issue for routing protocols in MANETs. In this work, we propose the ant colony-based energy control routing (ACECR) protocol to find an optimal route by using the positive feedback character of ant colony optimization (ACO). In our ACECR protocol, the routing choice depends on not only the number of hops between nodes and the node energy, but also the average and the minimum energy of the routes. The performance of our ACECR routing protocols is evaluated in different mobility models. In addition, we do extensive simulations to study the movement characteristics of different mobility models and their effect on routing protocols. Simulation results show that ACECR has a better performance in balanced energy consumption and a longer network lifetime compared with existing protocols.

33c40e9600bea71eb5e492e4cbe641a964dfaf65	a new game-theoretical approach in network routing: algorithms and their performance analysis in omnet++		In this paper, we generally study performance of some network routing algorithms. These are Kruskal’s, Prim’s and Sollin’s algorithms as tree algorithms that are used in minimum spanning trees problems. Further, we propose new algorithms that are modeled by game-theoretical approach. Mathematical models have been used to solve complex problems such as those in social sciences, economics, psychology, politics and telecommunication. In this context, game theory can be defined as a mathematical framework consisting of models and techniques analyzing the behavior of individuals concerned about their own benefits. Game theory deals with multi-person decision making, in which each decision maker tries to maximize own utility or minimize own cost and is applied to networking, in most cases to solve routing and resource allocation problems in a competitive environment. Modeling the network scenarios with the game-theoretical approach is one of the pioneering aims of the study. The algorithms for performance analysis are carried out OMNeT++, which is a network simulation program. Finally, the results are compared with each other and the literature.	profiling (computer programming);routing	Serap Ergün;Tuncay Aydogan	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-33622-0_23	kruskal's algorithm;game theory;tree traversal;network simulation;mathematical model;algorithm;spanning tree;resource allocation	HPC	-3.857528052961661	85.1392533737285	80110

WSNs are used in three-dimensional (3D) scenarios such as the surface of sea or lands with different levels of height. This paper presents and evaluates the Three-Dimensional Position-Based Adaptive Real-Time Routing Protocol (3DPBARP) as a novel, real-time, position-based and energy-efficient routing protocol for WSNs. 3DPBARP is a lightweight protocol that reduces the number of nodes which receive the radio frequency (RF) signal using a novel parent forwarding region (PFR) algorithm. 3DPBARP as a Geographical Routing Protocol (GRP) reduces the number of forwarding nodes and thus the traffic and packet collision in the network. A series of performance evaluations through MATLAB and Omnet++ simulations show significant improvements in network performance parameters and total energy consumption over the 3D Position-Based Routing Protocol (3DPBRP) and Directed Flooding Routing Protocol (DFRP).

We present inference-based Contact Graph Routing (iCGR), a logical-level routing method for DTN internetworks that comprise heterogeneous data link and/or network layers. iCGR constructs a time-variant ‘Contact Graph’ at each node in the network to describe logical contact opportunities regardless of underlying physical media access. The iCGR approach extends the established approach of graph based routing beyond static networks and provides a mechanism for multiple data link protocols to co-exist in an internetwork. This overlay-routing approach allows otherwise routing-protocol-incompatible networks to join an internetwork with little overhead. iCGR is validated through NS3 simulation of a DTN internetwork comprising manually asserted contact opportunities, a non-DTN routing protocol, and probabilistic DTN routing protocol.	delay-tolerant networking;internetworking;overhead (computing);routing;simulation	Edward J.

For such sparse networks, Delay Tolerant Networks are proposed where a packet is carried by an intermediate vehicle until it meets with another vehicle or destination. This approach introduces variable amounts of delays in the networks. Therefore, an intelligent decision is required to select the next intermediate vehicle that can deliver a packet to the destination as soon as possible without any further delays. In this paper, we introduce a minimum delay routing protocol that utilizes the neighbor vehicles' velocity and distance from destination information to calculate the delivery delay for intermediate vehicles. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared with FFRDV. Using an ns-2 simulation, we have verified that our scheme shows better performance and reduces end-to-end delay and average inter-meeting time by 70% as compared to FFRDV.	delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);network packet;network partition;routing;simulation;sparse matrix;velocity (software development)	Ajmal Khan;Dong-Won Kum;Jae-Choong Nam;You Ze Cho	2012	2012 18th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2012.6388251	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;telecommunications;engineering;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;end-to-end delay;link-state routing protocol;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	3.317199652390318	83.82599051141595	80618
ac78f62bf7be857b834cc6162a0f236c04964e3d	performance analysis of biased localization of heterogeneous nodes combined with pure leach routing protocol		Energy efficiency and network lifetime are the one of the most important issues in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). As well as, they are mandatory for low-cost solutions to various real world challenges. Sensor nodes depend on the power of its battery which has a significant effect on their performance. Clustering and localization of sensor nodes are one of the efficient techniques to increase the network lifetime. This paper discusses a new clustering protocol scheme is proposed and evaluated; the new scheme depends on hybrid nodes localization formation to improve the existing Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol. The LEACH static clustering is based on the heterogeneous routing protocol. Hence, enhancing allocation improves a number of transmission data rate and node lifetime to achieve the network longevity in WSN. Results are simulated using Matlab simulation tools; the proposed scheme shows 15 % improvement in WSN total network lifetime and 15 %–49 % enhancement in the total number of packets transmitted.	profiling (computer programming);routing	Ahmed Lotfy;Amr A.

The multicast members cannot receive multicast data continuously when they move outside the geocast region. Therefore, a geocast-based multicast method for continuous information delivery in MANET environments was developed. The method combines geocasting and GPSR to advertise a multicast session and gather multicast information from members. The multicast sender sends data packets using a multicast tree construction algorithm that uses location information of multicast members. We implemented the method in a network simulator, and showed the results of performance evaluation by simulation.	algorithm;geocast;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;hoc (programming language);multicast;network packet;performance evaluation;simulation	Yoh Shiraishi;Osamu Takahashi;Ryo Miki	2010	2010 International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing	10.1109/3PGCIC.2010.87	multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;computer network;multicast address	HPC	2.2701170173512475	81.93449942393518	80624
13a736de524f39634a598bdfe133a2cff433ee8e	correlation-free multipath routing for multimedia traffic in wireless sensor networks		Delivering multimedia content, requiring high throughput and reduced end-to-end delay, is a hard task in Wireless Sensor Networks, due to the limited bandwidth and energy. Multipath routing is an attractive alternative to remedy to these constraints by allowing bandwidth aggregation to achieve high throughput and load balancing to reduce latency and energy consumption. However, inter-path correlation can throttle concurrent data transfer through different paths. Besides, operating under duty-cycle mode, adopted by many long-term applications, incurs additional challenges due to the intermittent unavailability of nodes. In this context, we propose CFMPR-M, a Correlation-Free MultiPath Routing protocol for multimedia traffic in duty-cycled networks, providing simple mechanisms to construct non-correlated routes towards the sink. It relies on a cross-layer interaction between MAC and routing levels, useful to avoid the drawbacks inherent to duty-cycle mode. Simulation results show the good performance of our protocol in terms of energy consumption, establishment time and control overhead.	multipath propagation;multipath routing	Dhouha Ghrab;Imen Jemili;Abdelfettah Belghith;Mohamed Mosbah	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67910-5_23	link-state routing protocol;multipath routing;wireless routing protocol;dynamic source routing;computer network;wireless sensor network;geographic routing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer science;multimedia	Mobile	7.632557670609865	83.88021907213225	80627

In the recent past, there has been a renewed interest in devising new efficient distance-vector algorithms as an attractive alternative to link-state solutions for large-scale Ethernet networks, in which scalability and reliability are key issues or the nodes can have limited storage capabilities. In this paper, we present Distributed Computation Pruning (DCP), a new technique, which can be combined with every distance-vector routing algorithm based on shortest paths, allowing to reduce the total number of messages sent by that algorithm and its space occupancy per node. To check its effectiveness, we combined the new technique with DUAL (Diffuse Update ALgorithm), one of the most popular distance-vector algorithm in the literature, which is part of CISCO’s widely used EIGRP protocol, and with the recently introduced LFR (Loop Free Routing) which has been shown to have good performances on real networks. We give experimental evidence that these combinations lead to a significant gain both in terms of number of messages sent and of memory requirements per node.	algorithm;algorithm engineering;computation;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;experiment;gateway (telecommunications);link-state routing protocol;performance;requirement;scalability;shortest path problem;simulation	Gianlorenzo D'Angelo;Mattia D'Emidio;Daniele Frigioni;Daniele Romano	2015	Theory of Computing Systems	10.1007/s00224-015-9608-6	distributed algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;distributed computing;algorithm;experimental analysis of behavior	Theory	-1.1995233581473173	79.12076104356282	80628

The source of AODV's problems with sequence numbers is the use of a delete period after which nodes are allowed to forget invalid routes to destinations. We present a new approach for the handling of sequence numbers in AODV that eliminates the use of delete periods for destination-based sequence numbers, and show, with simulation experiments, that the new approach performs the same as or better than AODV.	access control;correctness (computer science);design rule for camera file system;distance-vector routing protocol;experiment;hoc (programming language);ieee 802.11i-2004;network packet;simulation	Hari Rangarajan;J.

Due to diverse group mobility patterns, the network may remain partitioned for extended durations. This paper describes an approach to reduce the communication disruptions by deploying forwarding nodes. The forwarding nodes explore the field periodically in orderto gather network information for countering the influence from mobility and sparseness of node deployment. By selecting the rendezvous grid pair, the forwarding nodes can move to appropriate locations to recover communication between disconnected groups. The mechanism has been implemented in the network simulator ns-2. The simulation results show that the mechanism can efficiently improve information availability and also achieve the required communication quality.	hoc (programming language);neural coding;operand forwarding;simulation;software deployment	Wei-Tong Wang;Kuo-Feng Ssu;Cheng-Chieh Chien;Yu-Yuan Lin	2009	2009 15th IEEE Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing	10.1109/PRDC.2009.70	wireless ad hoc network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;packet forwarding;mobility model;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.82098994486399	80.52806980013845	80760

A simple broadcasting mechanism, known as flooding, is to let every node retransmit the message to all its 1-hop neighbors when receiving the first copy of the message. Despite its simplicity, flooding is very inefficient and can result in high redundancy, contention, and collision. One approach to reducing the redundancy is to let each node forward the message only to a small subset of 1-hop neighbors that cover all of the node's 2-hop neighbors. In this paper we propose two practical heuristics for selecting the minimum number of forwarding neighbors: an O(n log n)time algorithm that selects at most 6 times more forwarding neighbors than the optimum, and an O(n log2 n) time algorithm with an improved approximation ratio of 3, where n is the number of 1- and 2-hop neighbors. The best previously known algorithm, due to Bronnimann and Goodrich [2], guarantees O(1) approximation in O(n3 log n)time.	hoc (programming language)	Gruia Calinescu;Ion I.

We set up our test environment by using WSN430 wireless sensor nodes. To overcome the need for significant number of wireless nodes required to perform a realistic experiment in high density network, we introduce a novel approach - emulation by using relatively small number of nodes in 1-hop experimental setup. Source node is a fixed sensor, all available sensors are candidate forwarding neighbors with virtual destination. Source node makes one forwarding step, destination position is adjusted, and the same source again searches for best forwarder. We compare three georouting algorithms. We introduce here Greedy geographical routing Algorithms in a REal environment (GARE)which builds a RNG by using ETX(uv)|uv| as edge weight (ETX(uv)counts all transmissions and possibly acknowledgments between two nodes until message is received), and selects RNG neighbor with greatest progress toward destination (if none of RNG neighbors has progress, all neighbors are considered). Our experiments show that GARE is significantly more efficient than existing XTC algorithm (applying RNG on ETX(uv)) in energy consumption. COP GARE selects neighbor with progress that minimizes ETX(uv)|uv|, and outperforms both algorithms.	deployment environment;emulator;experiment;geographic routing;greedy algorithm;sensor;simulation	Milan Lukic;Bogdan Pavkovic;Nathalie Mitton;Ivan Stojmenovic	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks	10.1109/MSN.2009.11	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	5.172809642032694	81.74087263405822	81013

Due to the limited resources in the sensor nodes, protocols developed for wireless sensor networks should not impact heavily on the computational overheads and power consumption in order to extend the network lifetime. In this paper, we exploit the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Viterbi algorithm, to detect the wormhole attack based on the maximum probabilities computed for a hidden state transition. We use different shortest paths hop count costs between a source and a destination node as the states input to the Viterbi algorithm, earmarking the least cost paths as the suspect wormhole paths, for a given observation sequence of the given shortest paths.	hidden markov model;markov chain	Victor Obado;Karim Djouani;Yskandar Hamam	2012		10.1016/j.procs.2012.06.140	distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.5354719179706726	76.19267881184095	81110

In the first phase, nodes in the network, organized as clusters, execute an efficient algorithm to dynamically calibrate sensed data. Each node provides its current energy level and the state of each on-board sensor to a cluster-head. In the second phase, each cluster-head executes an efficient, ontology-driven algorithm to determine the future state of the network under existing conditions, based on information received from each sensor node. We describe an example application scenario to show how our two-phase solution can be employed to enable a real-world wireless sensor network to adapt itself to variations in environmental conditions.	algorithm;computer cluster;control theory;cryptographic protocol;energy level;initial condition;on-board data handling;requirement;semantic web;sensor node;sensor web;simulation;software deployment;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking	Sasikanth Avancha;Chintan Patel;Anupam Joshi	2004	The First Annual International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking and Services, 2004.

The root node may unconditionally initiate a change or decide conditionally based on feedback from other nodes. MCONF is designed so that feedback and confirmation messages are sent back to the root node (and therefore to the network control center) in an efficient manner. MCONF does not rely on specific routing or medium access protocols, and therefore can work with a wide range of network and link layer technologies. Protocol performance is tested and validated using emulation for static and mobile topologies, several message sizes, and a range of link loss rates. Based on experimental results MCONF is found to successfully execute a mass configuration change with confirmation for 10-node MANETs with link loss rates approaching 20% and random node mobility.	block cipher mode of operation;feedback;routing;tree (data structure)	Peter Katlic;Koushik Kar;James Morris;James H.

One of the most significant strategies that improve DSR is the route cache. The route cache strategy is utilized to reduce overheads and peer-to-peer delay, which means in brief, allowing an intermediate node to reply a RREQ message. In this paper, we concentrate on the DSR protocol and the strategies which are proposed to improve its performance. We indicate that some of the strategies are so novel that they can be extracted as an individual protocol with a little complementarity. As a result, we establish a semi-proactive protocol composed of the Active Packets and RERR flooding, both of which are improving strategies on the route cache of DSR. Simulation results show that it can be used as a protocol under a certain circumstance and has a performance outperforms its source strategies and DSR on several metrics.	ansi escape code	Jiaxu Chen;Yazhe Tang;Dian Fu;Heng Chang	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16355-5_35	computer science;cache algorithms;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Robotics	3.980784215722521	83.32021792172984	81623

Specifically, a novel framework is proposed to handle two major research issues. Firstly, we optimize the utilization of resources available to various nodes at hand. This is achieved via proposed optimal network clustering enriched with layer-adaptive 3-tier communication mechanism to diminish energy holes. We also introduce a mathematical coverage model that helps us minimize the number of coverage holes. Secondly, we present a novel approach to recover the corrupted version of the data received over noisy wireless channels. A robust sparse-domain based recovery method equipped with specially developed averaging filter is used to take care of the unwanted noisy components added to the data samples. Our proposed framework provides a handy routing protocol that enjoys improved computation complexity and elongated network lifetime as demonstrated with the help of extensive simulation results.

They outperform other algorithms in the network lifetime aspect, however, they require heavy signaling overheads because new routes are found based on the flooding method and route re-establishments occur frequently as a result. Because of the overhead they often can not extend the lifetime of the network as much as they want. In the paper, we propose a new maintenance algorithm which considers the costs associated with packet transmission and route re-establishment at the same time. Since the proposed algorithm considers packet transmission and future route re-establishment costs at the same time when it initially finds the route, it spends less energy to transmit the packets while evenly consuming the energy of the node as much as possible. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other route re-establishment methods.	hoc (programming language);routing	Il-Hee Shin;Chae-Woo Lee	2005		10.1007/11561354_24	wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;route poisoning;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;routing protocol;computer security;packet switching;computer network	Mobile	-1.4834325126153023	76.40306945464094	81736
73b565b489df2e774064bd31f3843567fdea2c8b	a multi qos genetic-based adaptive routing in wireless mesh networks with pareto solutions		Wireless Mesh Networks(WMN) is an active research topic for wireless networks designers and researchers. Routing has been studied in the last two decades in the field of optimization due to various applications in WMN. In this paper, Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA) for identifying the shortest path in WMN satisfying multiQoS measure is introduced. The proposed algorithm is adaptive in the sense that it uses various selection methods during the reproduction process and the one with the best multiQoS measure is adopted in that generation .The multi-objective QoS measure defined as the combination of the minimum number of hops, minimum delay, and maximum bandwidth. The multi-objective optimization has been formulated and solved using weighted sum approach and Pareto optimal solution techniques. The simulation experiments have been carried out in MATLAB environment with a wireless network modeled as weighted graph of fifty nodes and node coverage equals to 200 meter, and the outcomes demonstrated that the proposed AGA performs well and finds the shortest route of the WMN proficiently, rapidly, and adapts to the dynamic nature of the wireless network and satisfying all of the constraints and objective measures imposed on the networks.	electrical engineering;end-to-end principle;experiment;genetic algorithm;information security;matlab;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;multi-objective optimization;pareto efficiency;quality of service;routing;shortest path problem;simulation;weight function;wireless mesh network	Ibraheem Kasim Ibraheem;Alyaa Abdul-Hussain Al-Hussainy	2018	CoRR	10.5815/ijcnis.2018.09.01	wireless network;genetic algorithm;computer network;computer science;distributed computing;quality of service;pareto principle;adaptive routing;wireless mesh network;shortest path problem;bandwidth (signal processing)	Robotics	-2.1074494286111016	81.46252955186712	81746

This paper suggests a new approach to ease the route switching problems in a network with higher migration rate of hosts. By monitoring the signal strength of messages, a host in a route that receives an incoming message can detect possible route fluctuations locally. As the average signal strength declines into a dangerous level, the host that receives the message wil l send an advance-warning message to the route source host. If the source host can find more stable routes locally, it wil l adapt a substitute route and wil l complete the process of adaptation before the breakdown of the original route actuall y occurs. If the route source host cannot adapt a new route locall y, the source host will be forced to search for a new route by considering the entire network.	routing	Tien-Chung Tien;Shambhu J.

ed8e29a079c0f970fa899b926d11e4af554843d4	multi-path route determination method for network load balancing in fap-based wsns using fuzzy logic		A flooding attack in wireless sensor networks is a type of threat that shortens the lifetimes of the sensor networks. Although flooding attack prevention techniques have been proposed, if a continuous flooding attack occurs, the sensor node energy is depleted during detection. In this paper, we use multi-path routing to solve this problem. In order to balance the load of the sensor node, energy balancing of the sensor node is controlled by determining the number of pathways using fuzzy logic. By adjusting the energy balancing of the sensor nodes, the number of energy-exhausting sensor nodes can be reduced. As a result, when a flooding attack occurs, the energy efficiency of the sensor node is increased by determining the number of pathways.	face animation parameter;fuzzy logic;load balancing (computing);multipath routing;network load balancing;sensor node	Won-Jin Chung;Tea-Ho Cho	2017	CoRR			Mobile	7.676364098746193	78.06281989300423	82011

In mobile ad hoc networks, network topologies dynamically change because of node mobility. Thus, it is important to design an algorithm that has strong stability against frequent topology changes. Attractor selection is one of the biologically inspired approaches that have strong stability against environmental changes. In this paper, we propose a stable clustering algorithm based on attractor selection for mobile ad hoc networks. Clustering is a fundamental problem for distributed systems and makes it easy to manage large scale networks. We show the effectiveness of our algorithm by simulations.	algorithm;cluster analysis;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;experiment;hoc (programming language);network topology;simulation	Gen Nishikawa;Fukuhito Ooshita;Hirotsugu Kakugawa;Toshimitsu Masuzawa	2008			wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;ad hoc wireless distribution service;machine learning	Mobile	4.645602744353349	79.70394715064286	82411
5721a06b8787c4d8dc16248000785362c73cc804	a multipath extension for the heterogeneous technology routing protocol		In recent years we have witnessed the emergence of new access tech- niques that use both wireless technologies and self-organizing features. Their combination eliminates the need for using pre-defined wired structures and pri- or configurations. In this paper, we propose an extension by enabling multipath routing over our Heterogeneous Technologies Routing (HTR) Framework. HTR Multipath routing offers several benefits such as load balancing, fault tolerance, routing loop prevention, energy-conservation, low end-to-end delay, congestion avoidance, among others. This work performs a comparative analysis of the proposed HTR extension, with the baseline HTR, and the widely-used Opti- mized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol. The evaluation is validated through the simulation of heterogeneous technologies such as WiMAX, 3GPP LTE and Wi-Fi. Results show that our proposal effectively improves the data delivery ra- tio and reduces the end-to-end delay without major impact on network energy consumption.	multipath propagation;routing	Josias Lima;Thiago Rodrigues;Rodrigo Melo;Gregório Correia;Djamel Fawzi Hadj Sadok;Judith Kelner;Eduardo Feitosa	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07425-2_2	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;operating system;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	EDA	1.3231862138343888	85.4543670624042	82527
ab4608b9ce3de394f5727c4d46857752d3a9f9bd	enhanced tree routing protocols for multi-hop and multi-channel cognitive radio network (emm-trp)		Abstract Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising technology and innovative solution for current spectrum allocation problems. We can exploit the unused licensed bands to meet the increased demand on spectrum bands by applying CR technology. The routing process in CR environment has many challenges such as the absence of centralized infrastructure, the lack of cooperation between the network layer and lower layer, the dynamic nature of channel status, and frequent link failure according to Primary users’ traffic. In this paper, we develop an enhanced multi-hop multichannel tree routing protocol (EMM-TRP) for cognitive radio network and we contributed to the following: (i) we proposed an EMM-TRP that jointly utilized the tree routing algorithm with a spectrum management module in routing decisions. (ii) We also proposed a new metric to find the best route (The main purpose for the design of this metric is safeguarding the PUs traffic from CR node interference and quick data transmission.) (iii) We have improved the EMM-TRP routing tree algorithm search by adding neighboru0027s table technology. (iv) Finally, we offered recovery and discovery unit in the case of link failure. We carried out our experimental evaluations in ns2 simulator. These evaluations have been shown that EMM-TRP protocol achieves better performance in terms of average throughput, end-to-end delay, overhead and hop count, compared by SAMER, CRP, STOD-RP and CTBR routing protocols.	cognitive radio;routing	Mohammed Hashem;Shrief I.

ff0a8c430d0fa6610763d7cf80ed6adbd5faacbb	how network coding system constrains packet pollution attacks in wireless sensor networks	pollution attack;network coding security;buffer strategy	Packet pollution attack is considered as the most threatening attack model against network coding based sensor networks. A widely held belief says that, in a single source multi-destination dissemination scenario, the total number of polluted packets in the network will grow with the length of the transmission path, and the decoding failure (DF) rate at the further destination nodes are relatively lower. In this work, we first obtain an opposite result by analyzing the pollution attack in multicast scenarios, and find out a convergence trend of pollution attack by network coding system, and quantify the network resiliency against the pollution attacks which happen at any place along the source-destination paths. Then, the analysis result is proved by our simulations on two most widely deployed buffer strategies, Random-In Random-Out (RIRO) and First-in First-Out (FIFO). Finally, it is proved that RIRO has an much advanced security feature than FIFO in constraining the pollution attack gradually, and almost vanished in the end.	attack model;direction finding;fifo (computing and electronics);k-ary tree;linear network coding;multicast;network packet;simulation;software deployment	Yuanyuan Zhang;Marine Minier	2013	IJGUC	10.1504/IJGUC.2013.056256	packet drop attack;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Security	6.55872834355035	86.45293246124665	82663

The most fundamental requirement for QoS routing is the ability to find and maintain a network path that provides the required network resources between two or more nodes. In this paper, we present a distributed collaborative multicast QoS routing architecture that uses a semi-greedy probing heuristic to quickly find a QoS path between a joining node and the multicast tree. The proposed architecture will enable the routers along the path to intelligently and dynamically discover a QoS path. Any router that receives a probe will only know its neighbours and it will create a link to the previous router from where the probe comes from. The proposed architecture is a tree-initiated QoS search and the first QoS packet to reach the joining node will be used as the QoS path. Analysis of this method shows that the path search time and message overhead is lower than other similar schemes.	greedy algorithm;heuristic;hoc (programming language);multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;router (computing);routing;semiconductor industry;shortest path problem;simulation	Jaipal Singh	2010	2010 24th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2010.165	path analysis;routing;real-time computing;multicast;mobile qos;quality of service;computer science;resource;distributed computing;routing protocol;bandwidth;polynomial;computer network;collaboration	Embedded	-2.51099553758629	83.07882313814328	82693
979428a70439379332bc18cb0ffe4008cea915e0	experimental evaluation of coexistence method for zigbee under wlan interference		—ZigBee has attracted attention for constructing the sensor network such as home energy management system. Both ZigBee and wireless LAN (WLAN) use a 2.4GHz band, called the industrial, scientific, and medical unlicensed band; therefore, ZigBee faces severe interference problems in the presence of WLAN. Frame collisions are serious problems between ZigBee and WLAN. Both employ a carrier sense mechanism to avoid collision, but both use different channel access mechanisms. The primary problem is the competition that exists between WLAN data frames and ZigBee ACK frames, i.e., because of WLAN interference, ZigBee may not receive any given ACK frame; therefore, the ZigBee transmission success ratio is degraded. To overcome this problem, the authors propose an interference avoidance method that improves ZigBee and WLAN coexistence and utilizes actual equipment to present the experimental evaluation. The experimental results reveal that the ZigBee transmission success ratio increases as the WLAN transmission rate increases. In addition, we clarified the distance in which the proposed method can effectively operate.	acknowledgement (data networks);coexist (image);interference (communication);wireless access point	Ryosuke Murata;Masakatsu Ogawa;Jyunya Fukuzawa;Ken Okamoto;Yuichiro Okugawa;Kazuhiro Takaya	2015	JCM	10.12720/jcm.10.3.161-169	embedded system;neurfon;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	9.197174845487291	87.7414270513642	82727

According to position distribution of the neighboring nodes, a node scheduling algorithm of wireless sensor network is proposed on the basis of the necessary condition that a node becomes a redundant one and whether the complementary neighboring nodes meet the circle cover. The new algorithm reduces the computational complexity. Simulation results show that the new algorithm is effective to schedule the redundant node to sleep for energy-saving. It predicates nearly 26 % nodes to sleep when the perception radius is 10 meters and coverage rate is unchanged. It identifies more than 50 % nodes to sleep with 15 meters radius.	algorithm;scheduling (computing)	KaiGuo Qian;ShiKai Shen;ZuCheng Dai;Ren Duan	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-46981-1_6	real-time computing;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;sensor node;wireless network;brooks–iyengar algorithm;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	9.679163286652203	79.68515214456563	82759
ca4014422054f8f6b381be17ca4332e5ca268b7c	an efficient emergency message broadcasting scheme in vehicular ad hoc networks		Broadcasting of emergencymessage (EM) in the vehicular Ad hoc networks (VANETs) plays a significant role in safety applications, which require immediate broadcasting of EM to the relevant vehicles located in the risk zone (RZ).This paper proposes an efficient emergencymessage broadcasting (EEMB) scheme inVANETs.This scheme aims at avoidingmultiple accidents and reducing traffic jams by broadcasting EM at high speed and with low overhead. When an accident takes place, the crashed vehicle (CV) will choose the best relayer(s) and broadcast the EM. The relayer will also choose the best next relayer(s) and rebroadcast the EM further. This process continues until the EM covers the whole RZ. The EEMB scheme reduces the overhead caused by beacons by using the prediction method. Our proposed scheme also overcomes the network fragmentation problem either by choosing the vehicles moving in the opposite direction as the relayer(s) if there are no vehicles in the same direction or by using the store-carry-forward (SCF) mechanism when there are no vehicles moving in both directions. The simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme has better performance in terms of the risk zone latency (RZL) and the beacons overhead (BCO).	fragmentation (computing);hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);simulation	Hayder Salman Dawood;Yuming Wang	2013	IJDSN	10.1155/2013/232916	embedded system;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.363768562937287	87.68166984650304	82844

With flooding, many copies of each message are retransmitted unnecessarily resulting in a sub-optimal resource consumption. Given that mobile devices usually have limited power and computational resources, it is of the utmost importance to reduce the resource consumption of each route discovery. A number of alternatives to flooding have been presented but their impact on the performance of reactive routing protocols is not well understood. This paper compares and discusses the performance of a routing protocol for MANETs with three distinct broadcast algorithms.	algorithm;computation;computational resource;experiment;hoc (programming language);mobile device;routing;simulation	João Matos;Hugo Miranda	2011	2011 Fifth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies	10.1109/NGMAST.2011.28	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;zone routing protocol;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;flooding;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;network topology;computer network	Mobile	3.0812810487786715	83.1876123942039	82854

Such interconnections hold the promise of improved connectivity and communications resilience, but also introduce policy complexity and scalability challenges. Diversity in these tactical networks in waveform, mission, security and ownership as well as scaling issues preclude flat network topologies. Exterior gateway protocols (EGPs) are traditionally used to interconnect non-aligned network domains, enabling the implementation of policy controls at network edges and enhancing scalability. This work briefly reviews some of the challenges faced by exterior gateway protocols in tactical MANETs.

We consider networks in which a number of links are vulnerable to these disruptions leading to a significantly higher travel time on these links. For these vulnerable links, we consider known link disruption probabilities and knowledge of transition probabilities for recovering from or getting into a disruption. We develop a framework based on dynamic programming in which we formulate and evaluate different known online and offline routing policies. Next to this, we develop computation-time-efficient hybrid routing policies. To test the efficiency of the different routing policies, we develop a test bed of networks based on a number of characteristics and analyze the results in terms of routes, cost performance and calculation times. Our results show that a significant part of the cost reduction can be obtained by considering only a limited part of the network in detail. The performance of our proposed hybrid policy is only slightly worse than the optimal policy.	routing;shortest path problem	Derya Sever;Nico P.

It presents a scheme where the tree routing and maintenance burden is laid only upon the source node and the destination nodes associated with the multicast tree. The main concept behind this scheme is to view each multicast tree as a collection of unicast paths and to locate only the multicast source and destination nodes on the junctions of their multicast tree. The paper shows that despite this restriction, the cost of the created multicast trees is not necessarily higher than the cost of the trees created by other algorithms that do not impose the restriction and therefore require all nodes along the data path of a tree to participate in routing over the tree and in the maintenance of the tree.	best, worst and average case;datagram;direct graphics access;domain generation algorithm;emoticon;multicast;routing;scalability;steiner tree problem	Ehud Aharoni;Reuven Cohen	1998	IEEE/ACM Trans.

The paper shows the Network Protocols and Algorithms ISSN 1943-3581 2011, Vol. 3, No. 1 www.macrothink.org/npa 83 effects of FHAMIPv6/AODV on QoS. The simulation was realized in NS-2 version 2.32. The traffic used is TCP. We analyzed the delay, jitter and throughput in an end to end communication. The metrics from the ACN perspective are presented in the paper. The FHAMIPv6/AODV integration is a step forward to the FHAMIPv6/MPLS/AODV integration in order to provide quality of service in MANET networks. We can consider FHAMIPv6/AODV and the future FHAMIPv6/MPLS/AODV integration as part of development Long Term Evolution standard (LTE) included in the all-IP concept that allows us to meet some requirements of LTE, such as end to-end quality of service. We test it MANET (Mobile Ad hoc Network) networks with different number of nodes. The paper shows the scenarios with 25 nodes as shown. The results of all simulations are displayed in a table.

In fact, sender-based protocols would fall into invalidation owing to high mobility of vehicles, while receiver-based ones would generate extra delay. Combining both, this paper proposes a broadcast protocol with the minimum delay forwarding (BP-MDF) optimization for disseminating safety messages in city scenario. Based on the presented delay model, considering both of the static and dynamic routing attributes of urban road, BP-MDF firstly specifies the only one neighbor node as forwarder at sending end, and other receivers assist in forwarding if specified forwarder rebroadcasts unsuccessfully. Consequently, both reliability and timeliness performance of broadcast are satisfied. The simulation results show that the delay and dissemination efficiency of BP-MDF outperforms Slotted-1 protocol, accompanying with the achievement of more than 95% packet delivery ratio.	acknowledgement (data networks);hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network packet;openbsm;overhead (computing);queuing delay;relay;routing;simulation	Wenjie Wang;Tao Luo	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7564751	vehicular ad hoc network;communications protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;nakagami distribution;telecommunications;computer science;link-state routing protocol;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	5.595976944389779	87.98745776852441	83342

This paper presents the design of a routing protocol called source-initiated adaptive routing algorithm (SARA), for AWLAN environments that may contain asymmetric links. To allow efficient operation in a symmetric network while ensuring correct operation in asymmetric networks, SARA supports two different modes of protocol operation: one optimized for symmetric networks and the other providing additional capabilities needed for operation in asymmetric networks at a higher cost. The ability of SARA to adapt its mode of operation and optimize its execution for each network environment is one of its major advantages and distinguishes it from existing routing protocols for, wireless networks. Furthermore, within each of its operating modes, SARA supports best-effort as well as policy-based routing.	routing	Ranga S. Ramanujan;Siddhartha Takkella;Jordan Bonney;Kenneth J.

Distributed Tree Expansion (DTE) is based on an implementation of a distributed minimum spanning tree algorithm in which the tree grows at each iteration by adding a node that can cover the maximum number of currently uncovered nodes in the network with minimum incremental transmission power and without violating the delay constraint. In Distributed Link Substitution (DLS), given a feasible broadcast tree, the solution is improved by replacing expensive transmissions by transmissions at lower power levels while reserving the feasibility of the tree with respect to the delay bound. Although DTE increases the message complexity to O(n3) from O(n2∆) in a network of size n, it provides up to 50% improvement in total expended power compared to DLS. 1677 Copyright © 2010, IGI Global.

Owing to the deployment of large number of sensor nodes in uncontrolled hostile environments and unmonitored operation, it is common for the nodes to exhaust its energy and become inactive. The failing nodes create holes in the network topology causing connectivity loss, which may lead to critical information loss. To avoid degradation of performance, it is necessary that the failures are detected well in advance and appropriate measures are taken to sustain the network operation. An energy-efficient cluster-based technique is proposed to detect failures and recover the cluster structure. The proposed technique relies on the cluster members to detect the failures in the cluster and recover the connectivity. The proposed failure detection and recovery technique recovers the cluster structure in less than one-fourth of the time taken by the Gupta algorithm and is also proven to be 70% more energy-efficient than the same. The proposed cluster-based failure detection and recovery scheme proves to be an efficient and quick solution to robust and scalable sensor network for long and sustained operation.

The paper investigates the size of routing tables as the number of nodes in the network increases. A routing protocol is information-efficient if the amount of information at individual nodes required to route packets does not increases with the network size. It is shown that the shortest-path and straight-line routing algorithms are not information-efficient, i.e., these protocols can be implemented only when nodes' memory increases with the network size. On the other hand, it is established that there exists an information-efficient routing algorithm -routing is feasible even if each node in the network is capable of storing information on a fixed number of destinations.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);routing table;scalability;shortest path problem	Petar Momcilovic	2007	IEEE INFOCOM 2007 - 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFCOM.2007.150	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.1855426194172156	81.88004062419094	83750

Unlike classical RPL routing the proposed DMRPL routing model incorporates a robust link quality (i.e., Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)) based mobility management, proactive network management, Dual Objective Functions (RSSI and ETX) and Dynamic link quality based best parent node selection for reliable data transmission. In addition DMRPL applies a novel fault-resilient link repair model to assure alternate forwarding path formation for timely data delivery to the destination for optimal decision process. Performance evaluation under different network conditions has revealed that the proposed DMRPL routing protocol outperforms native RPL protocol while preserving backward compatibility that makes it suitable to be used for real-time IoT data gathering for SCPM applications.

2b5edaa7ffc21c3b8a5072eb86e140adb29e4861	the emergency direct mobile app: safety message dissemination over a multi-group network of smartphones using wi-fi direct	performance evaluation;wi fi direct;public safety applications;device to device d2d communication	Nowadays, the Wi-Fi Direct technology is supported by most of smartphones on the market, and provides a viable solution to guarantee opportunistic communication among group of devices in a 1-hop range. However, the current specifications of the standard do not support the inter-group communication, which constitutes a key requirement for content-delivery applications like the public safety ones. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the utilization of the Wi-Fi Direct technology for safety message dissemination over emergency and post-disaster scenarios. Three main contributions are provided. First, we show the experimental results of the Wi-Fi Direct technology on a test-bed composed of multiple heterogeneous smartphones, and we analyze the main factors affecting the system performance, like the network setup overhead, the communication range and the network throughput. Second, we investigate how to create multi-group Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks by leveraging on the presence of P2P relay devices, which are in charge of offloading the data among different P2P groups, although being connected to only one P2P group at a time. An analytical model is proposed in order to derive the optimal group switching time which provides the best trade-off between the multihop delay and the delivery rate, by taking into account the buffer size of the P2P Group Owners (GO) devices. Finally, we describe the implementation of the network formation algorithm within the Emergency Direct mobile application, which allows the multi-hop dissemination of instantaneous and geo-localized alert messages among the smartphones located in the scenario of the emergency.	algorithm;inter-process communication;mobile app;network formation;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;relay;smartphone;switching time;testbed;throughput	Marco Di Felice;Luca Bedogni;Luciano Bononi	2016		10.1145/2989250.2989257	embedded system;telecommunications;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.6503912920541413	88.40475033416615	84012

Tag collision arbitration for passive tags is a significant issue for fast tag identification due to communication over a shared wireless channel. This paper presents an adaptive memoryless protocol, which is an improvement on the query tree protocol. Memoryless means that tags need not have additional memory except ID for identification. To reduce collisions and identify tags promptly, we use information obtained from the last process of tag identification at a reader. Our performance evaluation shows that the adaptive memoryless protocol causes fewer collisions and takes shorter delay for recognizing all tags while preserving lower communication overhead than other tree based tag anticollision protocols	communications protocol;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;simulation;tag cloud;transmitter	Jihoon Myung;Wonjun Lee;Timothy K.

While a black-box can be easily recovered in crash events on land, the same does not apply to crash events in great deep ocean water. This paper presents a new solution towards solving black-box data loss on ocean crash using a paradigm called communicating materials. The solution is developed through uniformly integrating hundreds of micro sensors nodes in the aircraft structure. The nodes could then construct a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) inside the aircraft. When a crash is detected by the aircraft system, the black-box data could be stored in all nodes using data storage protocols for WSN. Since nodes are uniformly deployed in the whole aircraft structure, investigators could thus gather preliminary crash causes information from the nodes inside any floated aircraft wreckage in the ocean. This solution was evaluated using Castalia simulator in terms of reliability, storage capacity, and energy efficiency.

In this paper, we incorporate the trust mechanism into OR, so it can enhance the security of routing to resist the malicious attacks. While the precondition of the forwarder list is trusted, a new trusted opportunistic forwarding model based on degree of trust and cost of routing is proposed, then a trusted minimum cost routing algorithm (MCOR) is formally formulated. Finally, MCOR algorithm is verified by simulation using nsclick software and compared its performance with the classic ExOR. The simulation results show that MCOR scheme can prevent attacks from malicious nodes and boost the survivability of network. Furthermore, MCOR algorithm outperforms ExOR in terms of: throughput, expected ETX and cost of routing.	algorithm;etx (form factor);hoc (programming language);linear network coding;link-state routing protocol;precondition;quality of service;simulation;throughput	Bo Wang;Xunxun Chen;Weiling Chang	2012	2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542838	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;business;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.873014022913373	82.84389747354248	84317

Some protocols work in such a way that when a node shares its working schedule with its neighbors, each sender node schedules its transmission to the moment when the next node is awake. In others, the nodes do not share information and when one needs to send a frame, it first discovers the time when the next node will be awake. Both approaches are limited due to additional transmissions. This work proposes a hybrid policy that combines the existing ones in order to minimize their costs. Simulation results reveal that our solution often reduces the number of transmissions and energy consumption of the existing policies in the evaluated scenarios.	access control;byte;duty cycle;overhead (computing);simulation;transmitter	Max do Val Machado;Raquel A.

The algorithm combines ideas from the Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) for mobile ad hoc networks [16] with a wave algorithm [21], all within the framework of a height-based mechanism for reversing the logical direction of communication links [6]. It is proved that in certain well-behaved situations, a new leader is not elected unnecessarily.	connected component (graph theory);hoc (programming language);leader election;reversing: secrets of reverse engineering;temporally ordered routing algorithm	Rebecca Ingram;Patrick Shields;Jennifer E.

Majority numbers of researchers have introduced the routing protocols based on node mobility but still research needs improvement to design the efficient routing protocols which control the node movement. This article focuses the routing protocols based on node mobility with its classification like: vector based, depth based, clustered based, AUV based, and path based. In classification the major focus is on deployment, node mobility, data forwarding, route discovery, and route maintenance. The article also focuses the existing problems in the mobility based routing protocols. We have introduced two analysis methods one is analytical method and other is numerical simulation method. In analytical method we have compared the proposed routing protocols through architectural parameters and performance characteristics parameters.

In multi-application scenarios, the network might need to handle different types of packets to satisfy the requirements of diverse data transmission metric. For example, multimedia-based applications may include different multimedia packets, such as voice, compressed images, even video streams with different quality of experience. To meet the requirements of such applications, in this paper, we propose a hybrid adaptive routing scheme (HARS) for drifting restricted floating ocean sensor networks (DR-OSNs), which exploits both surface wireless and underwater communication channels to fulfill different performance requirements. We evaluate the performance of the routing scheme and investigate the factors which affect the scheme. The simulation results demonstrate that the scheme achieves a reasonable performance for different communication channels and packet delivery.	dr-dos;data compression;end-to-end principle;energy level;network packet;relay;requirement;routing;scheme;simulation;streaming media	Hanjiang Luo;Rukhsana Ruby;Xiumei Xie;Yongquan Liang	2017	2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)	10.1109/ICPADS.2017.00046	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;streams;data transmission;underwater acoustic communication;network packet;computer science;routing protocol;ranging;communication channel	Embedded	7.826791917418487	84.73574797137483	85342

Based on the evolutionary game theory, this paper proposes a proactive defense model for wireless sensor networks, in which we emphasize that the node has a limited ability to learn the evolution of rationality from different attack strategies of the attacker, and can dynamically adjust their strategies to achieve the most effective defense. Following this approach, the cost (e.g., energy consumption and wastage of machinery) has been greatly saved and the life cycle of the nodes has been extended as well. By employing the proposed model, the whole wireless sensor network can be implemented in an effective way.		Zhide Chen;Cheng Qiao;Yihui Qiu;Li Xu;Wei Wu	2014	J. Comput. Syst.

A variety of workload and scenarios, as characterized by mobility, load and size of the ad hoc network have been simulated using NS-2. We use OLSR as the flat routing protocol and our own implementation of HOLSR (which uses HNA messages) as the hierarchical one. We make a complete comparison between these protocols focused on video evaluation. The simulations lets us compare the quality of service (QoS) of the video streaming paying attention to objective parameters (PSNR, packet delivery ratio, packet delay). Results indicate that traffic overload is reduced and video quality is improved using hierarchical protocols.	hoc (programming language);network packet;optimized link state routing protocol;peak signal-to-noise ratio;performance evaluation;quality of service;simulation;streaming media;video;web traffic	Pau Arce;Juan Carlos Guerri;Ana Pajares;Óscar Lázaro	2007		10.1145/1385289.1385312	wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;telecommunications;computer science;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer network	Networks	1.0221949485060011	87.39028159007628	85448

Once a link is detected broken, an alternate route has to be discovered, incurring extra route discovery overhead and packet latency. The traffic is also interrupted at the transport layer, and proper traffic recovery schemes have to be applied. To reduce the frequency of costly route re-discovery procedures and to maintain continuous traffic flow for reliable transport layer protocols, we suggest discovering long lifetime routes (LLR). In this paper, we first propose g-LLR, a global LLR discovery algorithm, that discovers LLRs of different route lengths for any given pair of nodes. We then propose a distributed LLR discovery scheme (d-LLR) that discovers two of the most desirable LLRs through one best-effort route discovery procedure. Simulations show that the lifetimes of the routes discovered by d-LLR are very close to those discovered by g-LLR. Simulations also show that the performance of different transport layer protocols is greatly improved by using LLRs. More importantly, traffic can remain continuous using the provided LLRs. D-LLR can be implemented as an extension to existing ad hoc routing protocols, and it improves the performance of transport layer protocols without modifications on them. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we propose a clustering scheme that allows self-configuration and adaptation of the network, prolonging its lifetime by distributing energy consumption among clusters. A combined weighted metric approach is used to select cluster-head nodes, taking into account energy, mobility and location of nodes. We have evaluated the clustering scheme using a prototype of the system which includes smart phones and Android emulators. The experimental results show that our clustering approach results in high average nodes' residual life, proving its effectiveness in prolonging network lifetime.	android;cluster analysis;component-based software engineering;computation;emulator;hoc (programming language);mobile computing;network packet;prototype;routing;simulation;smartphone;transmission (bittorrent client)	Carmela Comito;Domenico Talia;Paolo Trunfio	2011	2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2011.119	wireless ad hoc network;data stream clustering;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;efficient energy use;cluster analysis;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	8.48591688289478	79.67188686798877	85609

So battery life is also important research issue in the routing protocol design. During packet transmission over multi-hop nodes, if a node failed, it should be caused link failure and source node will perform route recovery. It results that increases time of route recovery and packet loss rate. The objective of this study is to reduce route failure caused by dead nodes which consume all the battery life. We propose a new routing protocol based on AODV which provides an ability of changing routes to neighbor nodes before some of intermediate nodes be shutting down. From extensive simulations, results show that possibility of cutoffs and time-delay caused by packet-loss have been decreased and also improve overall performance by comparison with original AODV.	communications protocol;hoc (programming language);network packet;routing;simulation	Kwan-Woong Kim;Jeong-Soo Lee;Kyoung-Jun Hwang;Yong-Kab Kim;Mike Myung-Ok Lee;Kyung-Taek Chung;Byoung-Sil Chon	2006		10.1007/11941439_94	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security	Mobile	-1.809086006702929	76.25705781911067	85946

Due to this imbalance load communication, the nodes near to the sink will lose energy faster that leads to an energy hole problem. In this paper, we propose an energy balancing zone-based cluster head EBZNCH approach in which conical clustering area is divided into concentric rings called coronas. Each corona is further divided into equal zones of non-uniform distribution of nodes called homogenous clusters. A mathematical model is designed to maintain homogenous clusters of the same area by deriving a relationship between the width of the concentric rings and a mixed routing with load balancing strategy, which is used to balance the transmission energy of CHs. The simulation result demonstrates that the proposed scheme outperforms many existing cluster head rotation schemes such as HEED, LEACH, EBCAG and multihop transmission schemes.		L. Bhagyalakshmi;K.

It measures the page response acceptance rate when the MSC/VLR believes that the mobile is in the coverage area and pages the mobile to find the terminating mobile party to complete the incoming call. Obviously, the page message has to reach the mobile, and then the page response message has to reach the MSC before the originating party gives up. The paper is not about paging algorithms, rather about achieving the best page response rate for any paging algorithm. We present all the important factors and the parameters that impact paging success, based on our experience with the commercial operation of Samsung CDMA BSS. We believe that most of the details are applicable to other wireless networks.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;newman's lemma;paging	Jey Veerasamy;John Jubin;Sanjay Kodali	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424713	demand paging;real-time computing;page replacement algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	-3.143888580754294	87.91202823191587	86117

The common approach among existing wireless ad hoc routing solutions is to establish a global optimal path between a source and a destination. We argue that establishing a globally optimal path is both unreliable and unsustainable as the network diameter, traffic volume and number of nodes all increase in the presence of moderate node mobility. To address this we propose landmark guided forwarding (LGF), a protocol that provides a hybrid solution of topological and geographical routing algorithms. We demonstrate that LGF is adaptive to unstable connectivity and scalable to large networks. Our results indicate therefore that landmark guided forwarding converges much faster, scales better and adapts well within a dynamic wireless ad hoc environment in comparison to existing solutions	algorithm;control theory;formal verification;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;local optimum;maxima and minima;network packet;performance evaluation;profile-guided optimization;reliable messaging;routing;scalability;simulation;social inequality;swift (programming language);testbed;velocity (software development);while	Menghow Lim;Adam Chesterfield;Jon A Crowcroft;Julian Chesterfield	2005	13TH IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP'05)	10.1109/ICNP.2005.21	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;mobile computing;global optimization;computer network	Mobile	1.5705172037728976	83.52091661055097	86138
2121a046033e5c5518e91bbee02028ee5dc234ff	constructing reliable virtual backbones in probabilistic wireless sensor networks		Most existing algorithms used for constructing virtual backbones are based on the ideal deterministic network model (DNM) in which any pair of nodes is either fully connected or completely disconnected. Different from DNM, the probabilistic network model (PNM), which presumes that there is a probability to connect and communicate between any pair of nodes, is more suitable to the practice in many real applications. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to construct reliable virtual backbone in probabilistic wireless sensor networks. In the algorithm, we firstly introduce Effective Degree of Delivery Probability (EDDP) to indicate the reliable degree of nodes to transfer data successfully, and then exclude those nodes with zero EDDP from the candidate dominator set to construct a reliable connected dominating set (CDS). Moreover, each dominatee selects the neighbor dominator with the maximum delivery probability to transfer data. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can remarkably prolong the network lifetime compared with existing typical algorithms.	algorithm;connected dominating set;dominator (graph theory);internet backbone;network model;simulation	Yong Feng;Qian Qian;Bin Zhang	2017	CIT		wireless sensor network;distributed computing;computer science;computer network;network model;theoretical computer science;probabilistic logic;dominator;connected dominating set	AI	5.217628880790854	79.828329908029	86147

Reliable broadcast is an important operation in MANET (e.g., giving orders, searching routes, and notifying important signals). However, using a naive flooding to achieve reliable broadcasting may be very costly, causing a lot of contention, collision, and congestion, to which we refer as the broadcast storm problem. This paper proposes an efficient reliable broadcasting protocol by taking care of the potential broadcast storm problem that could occur in the mediumaccess level. Existing protocols are either unreliable, or reliable but based on a too costly approach. Our protocol differs from existing protocols by adopting a low-cost broadcast, which does not guarantee reliability, as a basic operation. The reliability is ensured by additional acknowledgement and handshaking. Simulation results do justify the efficiency of the proposed protocol. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In our previous work, we proposed a real-time disaster evacuation guidance using opportunistic communications as an application of Delay Tolerant Networking to disaster management. In the guidance, evacuees gather disaster information, such as impassable roads and dangerous areas, on their mobile phones by themselves and share it with each other using opportunistic communications between nearby phones on their evacuation routes to refuge areas. We numerically evaluated the performance of the guidance and showed that the guidance considerably reduces evacuation time. In this evaluation, however, we neglected the effect of traffic volume of evacuees, which might cause serious traffic congestion, inhibiting a smooth evacuation. In this paper, we consider the effect of traffic volume on evacuation time and numerically evaluate the performance again by introducing capacity-constrained nodes on road graphs. We show that the guidance also effectively reduces the evacuation time regardless of the traffic volume.	real-time transcription	Akihiro Fujihara;Hiroyoshi Miwa	2012		10.1109/iNCoS.2012.99	wireless ad hoc network;routing;disaster;simulation;mobile telephony;computer science;delay-tolerant networking;computer security;computer network	HCI	3.9507172027364525	87.14272118120147	86429

An efficient data routing protocol is important in such networks for high network capacity and scalability. However, most routing protocols for these networks simply combine the ad-hoc transmission mode with the cellular transmission mode, which inherits the drawbacks of ad-hoc transmission. This paper presents a Distributed Three-hop Routing protocol (DTR) for hybrid wireless networks. To take full advantage of the widespread base stations, DTR divides a message data stream into segments and transmits the segments in a distributed manner. It makes full spatial reuse of a system via its high speed ad-hoc interface and alleviates mobile gateway congestion via its cellular interface. Furthermore, sending segments to a number of base stations simultaneously increases throughput and makes full use of widespread base stations. In addition, DTR significantly reduces overhead due to short path lengths and the elimination of route discovery and maintenance. DTR also has a congestion control algorithm to avoid overloading base stations. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the superiority of DTR in comparison with other routing protocols in terms of throughput capacity, scalability, and mobility resilience.

5e2816caaac9b1b142bba994e37529087e66369f	content centric cross-layer scheduling for industrial iot applications using 6tisch		The latest 6TiSCH standard enables highly reliable industrial monitoring and control applications through deterministic wireless communications and efficient allocation of radio resources among wireless nodes. However, much of these benefits are tied to the ability of the scheduler in orchestrating communication over individual links in an efficient and a non-conflicting manner. The state-of-the-art 6TiSCH scheduling algorithms only tackle the scheduling problem at the MAC layer with an assumption of having an optimal routing layer. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no solution so far has taken content-specific scheduling into account. This paper proposes CONCISE, which is a content-centric cross-layer scheduling solution. CONCISE creates content-independent routing topologies and schedulers, resulting in an overlaid routing structure and multiple content-based schedules. Further, CONCISE addresses in-network processing and data aggregation with the objective of reducing network traffic. Performance evaluation demonstrates that CONCISE can effectively reduce inner layer network traffic by up to 65%. As a result, it can provide up to 50% delay reduction and achieve significantly higher packet delivery ratio, compared with existing scheduling solutions. Initial proof of concept is implemented and evaluated in Contiki OS.	algorithm;contiki;data aggregation;network packet;network processor;network traffic control;operating system;performance evaluation;routing;scheduling (computing)	Yichao Jin;Usman Raza;Adnan Aijaz;Mahesh Sooriyabandara;Sedat Gormus	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762079	proof of concept;job shop scheduling;computer network;wireless;scheduling (computing);distributed computing;network topology;computer science;network packet;schedule;internet of things	Mobile	8.185238007488186	84.8436182480677	86707

A known technique to improve QoS is to use multipath routing where packets (voice/video/...) from a source to a destination travel in two or more maximal disjoint paths. We observe that the need to find a set of maximal disjoint paths can be relaxed by finding a set of paths S wherein only bottlenecked links are bypassed. In the proposed model we assume that there is only one edge along a path in S is a bottleneck and show that by selecting random paths in S the probability that bottlenecked edges get bypassed is high. We implemented this idea in the MRA system which is a highly accurate visual ad hoc simulator currently supporting two routing protocols AODV and MRA. We have extended the MRA protocol to use multipath routing by maintaining a set of random routing trees from which random paths can be easily selected. Random paths are allocated/released by threshold rules monitoring the session quality. The experiments show that: (1) session QoS is significantly improve, (2) the fact that many sessions use multiple paths in parallel does not depredate overall performances, (3) the overhead in maintaining multipath in the MRA algorithm is negligible.	algorithm;computer simulation;elegant degradation;experiment;hoc (programming language);hysteresis;maximal set;multipath propagation;multipath routing;overhead (computing);performance;persistent data structure;quality of service;streaming media	Yosi Ben-Asher;Sharoni Feldman;Moran Feldman	2008	2008 Second International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications (sensorcomm 2008)	10.1093/comjnl/bxq029	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;computer science;multipath routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	2.120593456271242	84.08858573433953	86825

An improved implementation of a post-detection packet combining scheme, which is especially applicable to low power, resource-constrained sensor networks, is developed and practically implemented on popular off-the-shelf wireless motes. The algorithm can be used as part of protocols such as cooperative communications and hybrid-ARQ schemes which have been shown to be of major benefit for wireless communications. Using the packet combining implementation developed in this paper more than an 85% reduction in energy costs are possible over previous, similar approaches. Both simulated and practical experiments are developed in which packet combining is shown to offer up to approximately 2.5 dB reduction in the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for a desired Packet Error Rate (PER). This is a welcome result as complex schemes, such as maximal-ratio combining, are not implementable on many of the resource constrained devices under consideration. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, these networks have a major issue which is the coordination among relays. In this work, we study the cooperative transmission for DTNs using coalitional game theory. We design a new incentive mechanism for heterogeneous system to induce coordination among DTN relays. In particular, we focus on the source packet dissemination to a destination using tow-hop relaying scheme, considering networks resource constraints: the relay buffer, the packet life time, and the energy consumption according to the mobile technologies. Rational mobiles are organized into separate coalition structures to meet a trade off between the source reward and the energy conservation. We discus the Nash equilibria for our game and the stable strategy state in which no mobile can get a higher payoff through changing unilaterally its coalition. Then, we use the distributed imitative Boltzmann-Gibbs learning algorithm enabling relays to learn the Nash equilibrium strategy; grand coalition. The improvement of the global system performance is examined, and a comparison between different inter-node collaboration states is presented.	algorithm;cache (computing);delay-tolerant networking;game theory;heterogeneous computing;nash equilibrium;network packet;relay	Omar Ait Oualhaj;Abdellatif Kobbane;Mouna Elmachkour;Essaid Sabir;Jalel Ben-Othman	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289217	simulation;distributed computing;efficient energy use;computer security;nash equilibrium;computer network	Mobile	6.3657045519384585	81.38243825074917	87183

However, most of the work is theoretical in nature and while providing insights into the asymptotic behavior of these querying mechanisms, does not account for the non-idealities faced by the network in real deployments. In this paper, we propose a 3-way handshake protocol as a reliable implementation of a random walk and compare its performance with flooding in real environments. The metrics considered are delay, reliability and transmission cost. Our initial results suggest that flooding is better suited for low-interference environments, while random walks might be a better option in networks with high interference. We also present possible research directions to improve the performance oflooding and random walks.	interference (communication)	Joon Ahn;Shyam Kapadia;Sundeep Pattem;Avinash Sridharan;Marco Zuniga;Jung-Hyun Jun;Chen Avin;Bhaskar Krishnamachari	2008	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/1384609.1384612	computer science;distributed computing;computer security;random walk;computer network	Mobile	8.55419230129667	86.4452149749464	87427
f63e448fe657e8bd9cae6cedd36f07b3a3465f3d	a mobile wsn sink node using unmanned aerial vehicles: design and experiment		In this paper, we construct a new type of mobile wireless data sinking platform for data collection based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, which aims to address the increasing demand for wireless sensor network (WSN) distribution in different monitoring areas and enlarge the coverage for various application scenarios. A wireless environmental monitoring system is firstly studied, and then wireless communication capacity and data collection experiments are performed. The communication capacity test results show that when the RF modules operate with a transmission power above 1 dBm and a communication distance below 100 m, the UAV wireless sink node can maintain a high quality communication data link. Additionally, an outdoor data collection experiment is performed using this UAV platform within a mountainous area. In this outdoor experiment, the data analysis results show that the validity rate of the environmental data that is obtained from the WSN cluster head node on the ground is higher than 92%, and most of the missing data results from WSN communication failures. This experiment proves the feasibility of introducing UAV as a sink node in a clustering WSN. The overall contributions of this paper can provide guidance for building a UAV cooperative WSN system in future.	aerial photography;unmanned aerial vehicle	Huiru Cao;Zhi Yang;Ye-Qian Li	2016	iJIM		embedded system;computer science;data analysis;computer security;computer network	Robotics	9.834443959519433	77.98314806440052	87453

For MANET, routing packets between any pair of nodes is not a trivial task because of mobility of the nodes. A path that was considered to be optimal at a given instant might not work at all a few moments later. Moreover, variations of wireless channels as well as interference coming from other ad hoc networks nearby add uncertainty to the routing. The Lifetime of MANET depends mainly on each mobile node’s battery capacity. With this constraint, routing algorithms must provide energy-efficient mute discovery and maintenance mechanisms. Even when all the traffics are routed through minimum energy paths to the destination, it mi;y not maximize the Lifetime of the network. The reason is that some nodes may constitute several routes at the same time, quickly running down batteries and shortening the lifetime of the network. This problem is the focus of this paper. Some prior studies have approached maximization of network Lifetime via shortest path algorithms with various metrics related to residual battery capacity. Among those, the paper [l] introduced a concept of cost of packet transmission that measures a node’s reluctance to forward packets. They used each node’s remaining battery capacity as a variable of the node cost battery cost muting (MMBCR) p].

In this paper, a simple method will be proposed to involve the WTGLs in calculation of optimal routes and its simulation results will be presented. Simulation results show that this method can improve the average speed of vehicles up to 66% as compared to random routes and up to 27% as compared to original UTOSPF, in the simulated scenarios.	dijkstra's algorithm;distributed computing;guidance system;shortest path problem;simulation;state diagram;state transition table;timer	Karim Faez;Mohammad Khanjary	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346709	wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;computer network;open shortest path first	Robotics	3.424440728725138	85.30852332060131	87706

The network topology changes frequently due to nodes' migrations, signal interferences and power outages. One of the ad hoc network routing protocols is the on-demand routing protocol that establishes a route to a destination node only when it is required by a source node. The overhead of maintenance is low, but it is necessary to reestablish a new route when the routing path breaks down. Several recent papers have studied about ad hoc network routing protocols avoiding the disconnection of the existing route. Each active node on the routing path detects the danger of a link breakage to a downstream node and try to reestablish a new route. The node detects a link problem, try to find a substitute local path before the route breaks down. If the local reestablishment process fails, the route breaks down. In this paper, a robust routing protocol is proposed to increase the success rate of the local route reestablishment and enhance the communication delay performance. The results of computer simulation show that the proposed routing protocol increases system performance.

We modified previous ranking metrics heuristic method and we tried to assign the synthetically generated traffic to a topology based on traffic type. In our work, transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP), as two major traffic types of today's Internet, are considered to generate special traffic matrices for them. By generating special traffic matrices for each type of traffic, traffic matrices may better describe the network conditions and consider the traffic type constraints. We made a comparison between our proposed algorithm and the two previous algorithms, called Load Minimization Solution (LMS) and ranking metrics heuristic (RMH), using simulation and results are presented. Simulation results indicate that our proposed heuristic method performs better in all cases which conqueror traffic (TCP & UDP) exists and correctly identifies more flow rates than the two other algorithms. Moreover, results show that, it is better to use LMS in the case of no conqueror traffic exists. The total absolute error rates between the amount of originally assigned flow rates and the rates that the RMH, LMS, and our conqueror traffic based RMH are assigned is another comparison we made which, proves that our heuristic method assigns the rates much closer to the original rates.	algorithm;approximation error;assignment problem;code;conqueror;datagram;heuristic (computer science);simulation	Saman Taghavi Zargar;Mohammad Hossein Yaghmaee Moghaddam	2007	2007 2nd International Conference on Communication Systems Software and Middleware	10.1109/COMSWA.2007.382611	the internet;user datagram protocol;internet traffic;word error rate;computer science;transmission control protocol;distributed computing;volumetric flow rate;computer security;transport layer;computer network	HPC	-3.2020565473292266	81.99382493320677	87953

Sink-tree based resource management integrates routing and resource reservation along the routes, and therefore has a number of advantages over other resource management scheme, in terms of: admission probability, link resource utilization, flow set up latency, signaling overhead, and routing overhead. In this paper we show by simulation experiments that even for simple cases the sinktree based approach shows excellent results in terms of admission probability.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);differentiated services;experiment;heuristic (computer science);np-completeness;overhead (computing);polynomial;programming paradigm;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;routing;scalability;simulation;time complexity	Byung Kyu Choi;Riccardo Bettati	2000		10.1109/RTCSA.2000.896379	heuristic;routing;in situ resource utilization;real-time computing;scalability;np-complete;differentiated service;resource allocation;computer science;telecommunications service;resource management;distributed computing;computational model;computer network	Embedded	-3.556177316967509	87.556848509724	88083
3b8962ec631cde53cbc6922888574738a69ddd0a	a delay-tolerant framework for integrated rsns in iot	iot;delay tolerant networks;rfids;optimization;wireless sensor networks	The Internet of Things (IoT) represents an evolutionary vision that promises to identify and connect physical objects and devices. This vision faces many challenges in terms of integrating technologies, especially RFID-sensor networks (RSNs). In this paper, we introduce a framework for node deployment and delaytolerance in RSNs under the IoT paradigm. Our framework is comprised of two components. The first is SIWR, a novel Smart Integrated WSNs and RFIDs architecture that classifies nodes into light nodes and super integrated nodes. SIWR employs an optimal linear programming formulation to cost-efficiently place integrated RFID readers. However, integrated IoT architectures face significant connectivity challenges. IoT settings assume no guaranteed contemporaneous end-to-end path between node pairs. To this end, in the second part of our framework, we introduce DIRSN, an optimized delay-tolerant approach for integrated RFID-sensor networks. This is a novel scheme for data routing and courier nodes’ selection in RSNs. DIRSN’s formulation minimizes delay across the network without violating the main dense-deployment and load-balancing requirements. In addition, DIRSN builds on SIWR’s novel architecture to locate the best set of couriers that promise to provide connectivity. Our combined approach is compared to three types of RSN integration architectures and the results show that our architecture and courier selection approaches perform substantially better than other architectures in terms of minimizing delay, cost, packet loss, and in handling extensive traffic demands. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

eed5525d9cec74cda3baf8aee03b67f5d9dc40c5	modeling of energy consumption for k-coverage in wireless sensor networks		Lifetime in wireless sensor network plays a vital role in the success of different operations in an application specific way. Besides main quality of service features such as node availability, coverage, and connectivity the guaranteed lifetime is one of the key characteristic of many applications for efficient operations in wireless sensor networks. Energy management is important in wireless sensor network since sensors node are equipped with non-rechargeable batteries that limited network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a scheme to guarantee the lifetime of such wireless sensor networks in terms of scary energy by dividing the maximum estimated time in different slots. We propose an algorithm that checks the status of every sensor node at each time slot and conclude that how much energy is spent during performing different operations. The proposed algorithm dynamically changes mode of each sensor node so that the wireless sensor network guarantee lifetime by switching the least number of nodes for achieving k-coverage of the field to sensing node. Simulation results validate the effect of the proposed guaranteed lifetime mechanism.

To fully take advantage of smart home, various household information, especially home environment information and user's living patterns, are collected, processed and exploited at the environment. A sensor and actuator network, which is usually constructed in a mesh topology, has been usually deployed to collect these information. In this paper, we propose a self-configuring, self-regulating topology switch algorithm for such the network, so that the resulting network provides a personalized environment for users. To construct this algorithm, we selected some parameters that reflect home's environmental property and user's propensity. We then conducted a simulation study with some scenarios which can be observed in real smart home to verify the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the algorithm can improve both the network connectivity and efficiency, and provide personalized home environment for users.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;home automation;mesh networking;overhead (computing);personalization;sensor;simulation	Mungyu Bae;Dong-kyu Roy Lee;Hwantae Kim	2013	2013 International Conference on ICT Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2013.6675405	embedded system;engineering;computer security;network topology;computer network;logical topology	HCI	6.801251362650889	75.4605713271372	88399

The only practical method for routing and delivering messages is to use the store-carry-forward routing method. As a case in point, spray and wait is considered to be one of the most appropriate routing methods. The efficiency of this method depends directly on the proper selection of the next hop and the number of copies when it encounters a node. In this paper, a method was proposed that constantly selects the next node and considers the number of copies a node can deliver. In the proposed method, the selection of the next node and the number of message copies to be transmitted by the next hop are based on message carrying time and the probability of message delivery. The network model, based on Markov chain, is extended for analysis. Simulation and analysis results showed that significant enhancement is obtained with the proposed method when measuring metrics such as delay, delivery ratio and copy do comparisons with similar methods.	algorithm;routing	Nahideh Derakhshanfard;Masoud Sabaei;Amir Masoud Rahmani	2016	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-015-1105-y	markov chain;routing;static routing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;analysis;distributed computing;geographic routing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	4.269570605264071	84.36735419770461	88420

Therefore, a MAC layer protocol for VANET that can guarantee timely delivery of data is critical. Currently, the MAC layer standard that is supporting inter-vehicular communication is IEEE 802.11 which is a contention based protocol where all the vehicles contend for one common channel. This protocol can not guarantee an upper bounded delay for delivery of safety messages. To resolve this issue, we first obtain the theoretical lower bound on the delay for delivery of safety messages. Then, we introduce a novel MAC layer protocol for inter-vehicular communication that guarantees the delivery of safety messages within a certain upper bound. This upper bound is only within a constant factor from the theoretical lower bound. Our protocol is distributed and dynamic and easily adjusts to the topological changes in the network. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we show that using our MAC layer protocol, the delay in transmission only grows linearly with the number of vehicles even in the dense networks where IEEE 802.11 protocol causes unpredictable delays.	algorithm;cluster analysis;communications protocol;graph coloring;inter-process communication;interference (communication);internet backbone;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Sarah Sharafkandi;David Hung-Chang Du	2010	IEEE Local Computer Network Conference	10.1109/LCN.2010.5735786	address resolution protocol;reverse address resolution protocol;telecommunications;resource reservation protocol;computer science;link control protocol;upper and lower bounds;computer security;computer network;internetwork protocol	Embedded	6.336523707727693	88.02329525064738	88478
878b2e8f407843ce0c3ca7c81634781373e37fbc	a focus on comparative analysis: key findings of mac protocols for underwater acoustic communication according to network topology		Underwater acoustic communication can be applicable to many fields, such as oceanic data collection, undersea exploration and development, disaster prevention, underwater environmental monitoring and tactical surveillance. However, it has several challenges to design underwater acoustic sensor networks, for instance, limited bandwidth, multi-path, padding, long propagation delay, high bit error, temporary losses of connectivity and limited battery power. Nowadays many studies are being conducted to overcome abovementioned problems. In this paper, various MAC protocols for underwater acoustic communication are classified by network topology, one is cluster head based MAC protocols and the other one is ad-hoc based MAC protocols. In recent researches, there were not comparative analyses of MAC protocols for underwater acoustic communication according to network topology. So, we summarize and analyze these protocols through comparing each other with some factors. In the future, MAC protocols for underwater acoustic communication will be designed with consideration for each advantage of cluster head and ad-hoc MAC protocols, considering the mobility of nodes to improve underwater acoustic communication, which can be applied to lots of underwater applications.

4f059e86894f738ed8b1bcd820558a5acced1cd5	a simulation environment and preliminary evaluation for automotive can-ethernet avb networks		Ethernet is being considered as the backbone network protocol for next-generation automotive control networks. In such networks, Controller Area Network (CAN) messages related to automotive control can be sent from a CAN network to other sub-networks via the backbone Ethernet bus and, if the CAN messages have real-time constraints, these have to be guaranteed. This paper presents a simulation environment for CAN–Ethernet Audio Video Bridging (AVB) mixed networks based on OMNeT++. We use Ethernet AVB, which can guarantee network bandwidth, to improve the real-time property of CAN messages through the backbone Ethernet bus. To simulate the networks, we also developed a CAN–Ethernet AVB gateway (GW) model. To verify the efficacy of our model, we measured the latency of CAN messages sent from a CAN bus to an Ethernet AVB node via the backbone Ethernet AVB bus in both bandwidthguaranteed and best-effort queue scenarios. The results indicate that the latency of Ethernet AVB frames containing CAN messages is minimized and limited by the bandwidthguaranteed mechanism of Ethernet AVB.	best-effort delivery;bridging (networking);can bus;communications protocol;gw-basic;gateway (telecommunications);internet backbone;real-time clock;simulation	Keigo Kawahara;Yutaka Matsubara;Hiroaki Takada	2014	CoRR		embedded system;real-time computing;synchronous ethernet;ethernet flow control;ata over ethernet;ethernet global data protocol;connection-oriented ethernet;carrier ethernet;ethernet over sdh;ethernet over pdh;ethernet powerlink;computer network	Networks	-3.9690816333470718	88.23278948709294	88693

However, many simulations and practical experiments have shown that when communication is between mobile nodes in MANET and fixed nodes on Internet, the bandwidth is asymmetrical and the available throughput is greatly limited. In this paper, we present a gateway-centric multi-path routing protocol (GCMPR), which ensures every mobile node has a set of link-disjoint and loop-free paths to gateway. The novel routing algorithm over multiple paths can provide higher aggregate bandwidth and improve the end-to-end delay. Simulations for comparing performance between GCMPR and other connectivity methods show that GCMPR achieves 40% throughput enhancement and remarkable improvement for the end-to-end delay. Furthermore, GCMPR can be easily applied to other scenarios in MANET when some hosts provide special service and are visited frequently.	routing	Yongqiang Liu;Wei Yan;Yafei Dai	2005		10.1007/11577188_69	wireless routing protocol;multipath propagation;web service;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;the internet;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;parallel algorithm;routing protocol;mobile computing;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	-2.7262680210162507	76.57649765238827	88719

Several papers proposed solutions to turn Passive a large subset of nodes. However, only few of those provide information on how to translate this activity state in reality. In this paper, we further improved several activity scheduling mechanisms by introducing a new activity state called Sensing–Only. This new sensor node state concerns formerly Active nodes, all the more reducing the size of this subset. In addition, radio usage being the sensor nodes main source of energy depletion, we also provide a realistic translation of activity states by adjoining to each of those a specific configuration of the medium access control layer. Finally, we validate our approach both by simulation and experimentation over a large set of real sensor nodes.	scheduling (computing)	Julien Beaudaux;Antoine Gallais;Thomas Noël	2014	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2014.059909	real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	9.974984041010439	81.16592236096233	88805
18aa996f809b6d54e5432feedea267ad6fb835ce	energy-efficient packet relaying in wireless image sensor networks exploiting the sensing relevancies of source nodes and dwt coding	sensing relevance;energy efficient packet relaying;dwt coding;wireless image sensor networks	When camera-enabled sensors are deployed for visual monitoring, a new set of innovative applications is allowed, enriching the use of wireless sensor network technologies. In these networks, energy-efficiency is a highly desired optimization issue, mainly because transmission of images and video streams over resource-constrained sensor networks is more stringent than transmission of conventional scalar data. Due to the nature of visual monitoring, that follows a directional sensing model, camera-enabled sensors may have different relevancies for the application, according to the desired monitoring tasks and the current sensors’ poses and fields of view. Exploiting this concept, each data packet may be associated with a priority level related to the packet’s origins, which may be in turn mapped to an energy threshold level. In such way, we propose an energy-efficient relaying mechanism where data packets are only forwarded to the next hop if the associated energy threshold level is below the current energy level of the relaying node. Thus, packets from low-relevant source nodes will be silently dropped when the current energy level of intermediate nodes run below the pre-defined thresholds. Doing so, energy is saved potentially prolonging the network lifetime. Besides the sensing relevancies of source nodes, the relevance of DWT subbands for reconstruction of original images is also OPEN ACCESS J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2013, 2 425 considered. This allows the creation of a second level of packet prioritization, assuring a minimal level of image quality even for the least relevant source nodes. We performed simulations for the proposed relaying mechanism, assessing the expected performance over a traditional relaying paradigm.	algorithm;computation;discrete wavelet transform;energy level;hard disk drive;image quality;image sensor;mathematical optimization;network packet;node (computer science);programming paradigm;relevance;sensor web;simulation;streaming media	Daniel G.

To ensure the successful packet delivery in the NSI-Mesh, Transport Layer Assisted Routing (TLAR) scheme was proposed. It has better performance than the conventional routing approaches for NSI-Mesh. However, it still suffers significant traffic congestion in the bottom chip layer due to the insufficient lateral path diversities. To achieve more balanced traffic, we propose a Traffic-balanced Topology-aware Multiple Routing Adjustment (TTMRA). The experimental results show that the proposed TTMRA can improve 81.8% ~102.3% network throughput than TLAR scheme.	lateral thinking;load balancing (computing);national supercomputer centre in sweden;network congestion;network on a chip;network packet;routing;stationary process;throughput;topology (electrical circuits)	Kun-Chih (Jimmy) Chen;Shu-Yen Lin;Hui-Shun Hung;An-Yeu Wu	2012	2012 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems	10.1109/SiPS.2012.13	policy-based routing;three-dimensional integrated circuit;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;network on a chip;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	0.8984201505497843	80.97533497033604	88888

Xia), asck Routing in Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) has been an active research area in the past few years. It is observed that as the mobility of nodes increases, the performance of existing cluster based routing protocols tends to deteriorate rapidly. Although many mobility based clustering schemes have been proposed to address this problem, majority of these proposals assume the movement of nodes follows group mobility. In this paper, we propose a new cluster based routing protocol FASTR which utilizes mobile backbone to mitigate the impact of node mobility for networks with high node mobility and low group mobility. Our scheme eliminates the delay caused by cluster head election and enables nodes to start communication immediately after joining a cluster. Through simulation and analysis, our protocol is shown to possess good scalability, incur lower control overhead and achieve higher packet delivery ratio than existing OLSR and HOLSR routing protocols for various node mobility. Furthermore, unlike other proactive routing protocols, the control overhead of FASTR is shown to be independent of node mobility and consume less network resources than HOLSR and OLSR. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is argued that, as the number of nodes grows to infinity, the throughput tends to the limit represented by the maximum throughput attainable with the store-and-forward technique and infinite queueing storage. The results obtained show the suitability, as far as the throughput is concerned, of meshed networks using packet switching without storing packets at nodes. The routing techniques investigated perform similarly. At least one of these is simple enough to be implemented with very-fast circuitry, able to cope with the speed foreseen in future metropolitan-area networks (MANs). >	routing	Flaminio Borgonovo;Enrico Cadorin	1990		10.1109/INFCOM.1990.91282	routing table;link state packet;routing;static routing;source routing;lan switching;fast packet switching;dsrflow;metropolitan area network;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;processing delay;flooding;mesh networking;distributed computing;packet forwarding;transmission delay;link-state routing protocol;shortest path problem;packet switch;burst switching;geographic routing;packet switching;circuit switching;computer network	ECom	-1.652493325261685	80.27998768856042	89007
0b47a76e6ef20b037c5586881cc4c03ce0a53a50	a scheme to update ospf network metrics without loops while minimizing routing instability duration	routing protocol;routing;ospf	This letter proposes a scheme to update metrics without loops while minimizing routing instability time in an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) network. The original OSPF network enters the transient state when metrics are being updated to improve the routing performance, and in this state packets may fall into loops. This may cause packet loss and inefficient network resource utilization. To avoid transient loops, a conventional scheme gives each router a priority that reflects the optimum time for metric update. However, when the updated metrics include both larger and smaller values than the preceding ones, two sequential updating processes, one for larger values and one for smaller values, are required. It takes time to converge on the final metric values in the conventional scheme, given that the interval time between the two processes is not insignificant. The second process starts only when the first process is confirmed to be completed. The interval time including the confirmation time and the time needed to reconfigure the metrics in all routers, lengthens the transient state duration; from several seconds to several tens of seconds. This causes routing instability. The proposed scheme transforms the set of updated metrics into an equivalent set of metrics that are either all larger or all smaller (if changed at all) than the ones before the update. The set of equivalent metrics yield exactly the same results in terms of routing as the conventional scheme, i.e. the result desired by the network operator. The non-mixture update requires only one updating process and so eliminates the interval time. Numerical results indicate that the probability that the proposed scheme can achieve non-mixture update is more than 67% in the networks examined.	instability;routing	Yutaka Arai;Eiji Oki	2012	IEICE Transactions		routing;static routing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;mathematics;distributed computing;routing protocol;metrics;computer network;open shortest path first	Networks	-3.719948164222881	86.39314250521088	89233

However, their deployment on mobile ad hoc networks still presents a lot of challenges especially when there are quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we approach these challenges by looking first at network routing protocols. We present experimentations that allow to study the reaction of these protocols against QoS degradation that occur at the middleware layer. Based on an empirical study, we show that the routing layer is generally not aware about QoS degradations and so it does not react when they occur. Thus, a reaction in the middleware layer have to be developed in order to achieve a reasonable performance.	elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);middleware;publish–subscribe pattern;quality of service;requirement;routing;software deployment	Imene Lahyani;Mohamed Jmaiel	2011	2011 IEEE Workshops of International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/WAINA.2011.139	adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;routing protocol;computer network	Embedded	-0.8435653185015278	85.37662548644438	89265

However, most existing schemes for location service incur a high overhead because of the periodical updates of location information. In this paper, we intend to address this issue. Using the temporal relationship among historical locations of mobiles in the network, we propose a novel History information based Light Location Service (HLLS). In HLLS, location information of mobiles is propagated via Hello beacons locally, and location query is performed in a tracing manner with the aid of historical locations. In such a way, HLLS can eliminate the tremendous periodical location updates and significantly reduce the overhead for location service. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HLLS in terms of high accuracy and low overhead.	algorithm;cluster analysis;geographic routing;hoc (programming language);lldb;location-based service;overhead (computing);simulation	Xinyu Yang;Xiaojing Fan;Wei Yu;Xinwen Fu;Shusen Yang	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1016/j.comnet.2011.11.001	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.048503671740161	80.83655769632303	89321

Indeed, the near-far effect provides extremely reliable transmissions between near nodes, regardless of node density, which cannot be achieved by CSMA/CA. However, CDMA cannot be directly applied in realistic traffic accident scenarios, where highly reliable transmissions are required between far nodes as well. This paper proposes to apply packet forwarding and transmission scheduling methods that try to expand the area, where reliable transmissions are achievable. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly excels a CSMA/CA-based scheme in terms of delivery ratio and delay under realistic traffic accident scenarios. Specifically, the proposed scheme achieves approximately 90% of delivery ratio and 4 milliseconds of end-to-end delay in a scenario, where the CSMA/CA scheme achieves 60% of delivery ratio and 80 milliseconds of delay.	end-to-end principle;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);network packet;scheduling (computing);simulation	Oyunchimeg Shagdar;Takashi Ohyama;Mehdad N.

BitTorrent is one of the most important applications on the Internet. Statistics show that it has accounted for more than 1/3 of the Internet bandwidth. Part of BitTorrent’s immense success may be attributed to its simple design and effective peer choking and piece selection mechanisms for distributing large files over the Internet. As these mechanisms are performed on the application overlay, how the overlay is constructed and maintained is crucial to their performance. In this paper we divide the overlay construction process into three stages: initial peer set selection, peer set update, and connection management, representing how a peer obtains an initial list of peers in the overlay, how it updates the list, and how it maintains its overlay links. In each stage, several strategies can be selected, yielding a variety of design choices to build and maintain an overlay. The purpose of the paper is to sort them out and find the key choices that improve the performance. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A particular case of this problem is encountered in MANET routing protocols, which need to distribute routing control information to all member nodes as efficiently as possible. While both proactive and reactive MANET routing protocols exist, in some environments a proactive approach will be used to reduce communications latency as much as possible. Even in a hybrid protocol, the proactive portion requires some amount of information exchange among all nodes. Many previous papers have discussed optimal flooding in a variety of environments under a variety of assumptions, but none have assessed the performance of a recently developed cluster based routing protocol called Adaptive Hybrid Domain Routing (AHDR). In this paper, the optimal flooding architecture developed for the clustered based AHDR protocol is discussed in detailed. The paper also compares AHDR’s flooding architecture against two prominent MANET routing protocols, OLSR [3] and OSPFMDR [11]. The paper also shows simulation results for each of the flooding architectures using an unbiased and non-intrusive monitoring technique. The performance results show that AHDR’s flooding architecture imposes lower overhead control traffic as compared to OLSR and OSPF-MANET-MDR while still providing better network reachability.	attribute-value system;forwarding plane;information exchange;link-state routing protocol;memory data register;network topology;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);proactive parallel suite;reachability;simulation	Phong C.

1da09f9611a9b7de84dfb7c168648ed2a60405ca	automatic evacuation guiding scheme based on implicit interactions between evacuees and their mobile nodes	implicit interactions between evacuees and their mobile nodes;automatic evacuation guiding	When large-scale disasters occur, evacuees have to evacuate to safe places quickly. They, however, may not be able to afford to obtain sufficient information for their evacuations under such emergent situations. In this paper, we propose an automatic evacuation guiding scheme using evacuees’ mobile nodes, e.g., smart phones. The key idea to achieve automatic evacuation guiding is implicit interactions between evacuees and their mobile nodes. Each mobile node tries to navigate its evacuee by presenting an evacuation route. At the same time, it can also trace the actual evacuation route of the evacuee as the trajectory by measuring his/her positions periodically. The proposed scheme automatically estimates blocked road segments from the difference between the presented evacuation route and the actual evacuation route, and then recalculates the alternative evacuation route. In addition, evacuees also share such information among them through direct wireless communication with other mobile nodes and that with a server via remaining communication infrastructures. Through simulation experiments, we show that 1) the proposed scheme works well when the degree of damage is high and/or road segments are continuously blocked, 2) the average evacuation time can be improved even in small penetration ratio of the proposed system, and 3) the direct wireless communication can support many evacuations at almost the same level as the communication infrastructure when the number of evacuees becomes large.	interaction	Nobuhisa Komatsu;Masahiro Sasabe;Jun Kawahara;Shoji Kasahara	2018	GeoInformatica	10.1007/s10707-016-0270-1	simulation;computer science;computer security	Mobile	3.969660144048406	87.10768986331082	89914

The disparity between the bandwidth offered by a wavelength and the bandwidth requirement of a multicast connection can be tackled by grooming multiple low bandwidth multicast connections into a high bandwidth wavelength channel or light-tree. Light-trees are known to be especially suited for networks that carry ample multicast traffic. In this paper, we propose new algorithms to address the problem of multicast traffic grooming. In particular, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is proposed for optimal assignments of hop constrained light-trees for multicast connections so that network throughput can be maximized. Hop constrained light-trees improve the scalability of the approach by reducing the search space of the ILP formulation. Since solving the ILP problem is very time consuming for realistically large networks, we are motivated to propose a heuristic algorithm with a polynomial complexity, called Dividable Light-Tree Grooming (DLTG) algorithm. This algorithm is based on grooming traffic to constrained light-trees and also divides a light-tree to smaller constrained light-trees on which traffic is groomed for better resource utilization. Simulations show that the proposed DLTG heuristic performs better than other algorithms. It achieves network throughputs which are very close to the ILP formulation results, but with far lower running times.	algorithm;binocular disparity;computer simulation;heuristic (computer science);hop;iptv;integer programming;linear programming;mesh networking;multicast;national science foundation network;procedural generation;scalability;throughput;time complexity;wavelength-division multiplexing	Rongping Lin;Wen-De Zhong;Sanjay K.

ff71d31e8967b2809d53c5989730a2e5d68b953a	efficient cluster-based top-k query routing with data replication in manets		Top-k queries, which retrieve k data items with the best score, have been receiving considerable attention because they can support many real life applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient query routing scheme in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), namely CTR. CTR enables top-k data retrieval by only necessary nodes by employing a new clustering framework for top-k query processing. In this framework, nodes holding high rank data items become ClusterHeads (CHs), and top-k queries are transmitted between CHs via gateway nodes which belong to multiple clusters. Each CH maintains a set of hop counts between itself and high rank data items, so that it can judge whether or not to transmit a query on the fly. We further propose a query routing method, CTR2, which integrates the clustering framework of CTR and a data replication approach. CTR2 improves the performance by retrieving the top-k data from nearby nodes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approaches function well in terms of accuracy of the query result, traffic, and delay. Communicated byW.-Y. Lin, H.-C. Yang, T.-P.

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of an impact of blackhole and Sybil attacks on the DWSIGF. The analyses on blackhole attack were carried out on a single and multiple attackers using priority selection, random selection, an optimal relay, non-optimal relay, with and without clear to send (CTS) rushing attack. While on the other hand, the Sybil attack's analyses were investigated on the impact of single attacker using optimal and non-optimal relay over increasing traffic loads and growing number of Sybil attackers. The study showed that the DWSIGF promised a superior protection against blackhole/selective forwarding and Sybil attacks with minimum attacker selection and high performance in packet delivery ratio even without inserting any security mechanism in the routing protocol.	blackhole exploit kit;microsoft windows;routing;sybil attack	Zurina Mohd Hanapi;Mahamod Ismail	2014	IET Information Security	10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0202	sampling;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	1.3139476930950031	85.76039871542415	90352

But due to bandwidth constraints, communication costs, high loss rate and the dynamic topology of wireless networks, obtaining and keeping up-to-date state information is a very complex task. A commonly used QoS metric is router queue length, used as a load metric in a number of load-balancing routing protocols. In this paper, we explore how to accurately propagate information about a router's queue length in a network that runs the optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol. We report the quantification of state information accuracy under different traffic rates. The results show that state information is inaccurate, especially under high traffic rates. Tuning the OLSR protocol parameters has no noticeable impact on inaccuracy levels. Based on our initial analysis, we propose two additional techniques to collect queue length information as an attempt to reduce inaccuracies. We compare the different techniques against the basic OLSR, no additional improvements were observed. The results raise questions as to how load-balanced routing should be done in the face of non-negligible inaccuracies in the load metric.	energy level;internet access;link-state routing protocol;load balancing (computing);node (computer science);optimized link state routing protocol;quality of service;randomness;router (computing);time complexity	Thomas Kunz;Rana Alhalimi	2007	Third IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob 2007)	10.1109/WIMOB.2007.44	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;wireless network;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.066188266864484	84.6841775821952	90705

In the suburban areas or during the night when the density of vehicles is low, multi-hop communication is only possible if (i) the vehicles store-carry-forward the messages or (ii) by using roadside units. Each of the solutions has its drawback. The former introduces delivery delay and the latter is an expensive solution. In this paper, we propose the Parked Vehicle Communication Model (PVCM) to use the parked vehicles along the roads to act as relay nodes and assist the communication in low density situations. We argue that the number and the distribution of parked vehicles is suitable to serve our purpose. We also show that the automotive battery can be utilized to keep the on-board unit running without draining all its energy.	hoc (programming language);on-board data handling;relay;simulation;sparse matrix;unbalanced circuit	Josip Balen;Goran Martinovic;Koosha Paridel;Yolande Berbers	2012	2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems	10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459650	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.620708707712058	79.61165743833809	90835

Designing a communication protocol that satisfies the stability and safety of networked control systems is a challenging task, because there is not yet a clear understanding of the interaction between communication and control layers in the overall system. In this paper, the main challenges to design a communication protocol for networked control systems are first clarified. Starting from these requirements, a power controlled fair access protocol is proposed where nodes send packets to their respective receivers within a broadcast range in the context of random access networks. The protocol design is based on a constrained optimization problem where the objective function is the information coverage of individual nodes subject to the state update interval constraint. The state update interval is the time elapsed between successful state vector reports derived from the networked control systems. A simple power control algorithm determines the transmit power of each node to satisfy their broadcast transmissions. A distributed channel access algorithm coordinates the channel access probability of individual nodes to achieve max---min fairness of the state update interval of a random access network. The proposed protocol is applied for a conflict detection and resolution of an air transportation system. Furthermore, the protocol is compared with the default MAC and TSMA protocol (Chlamtac and Farago in IEEE/ACM Trans Netw 2(1):23---29, 1994) under various scenarios. Simulation results indicate that the protocol significantly improves the information coverage while reducing the state update interval. The proposed algorithm converges very fast while meeting the heterogeneous requirement of networked control systems. It also guarantees fairness among various nodes compared to the default MAC and TSMA protocol. By improving the communication performance, the proposed protocol improves the control efficiency and meets the safety criteria for air transportation systems.	control system	Pangun Park	2015	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-014-0866-z	real-time computing;telecommunications;power control;computer science;networked control system;link control protocol;distributed computing;port control protocol;computer network	Mobile	6.5759589041958	88.35268524367366	90874
9f4f86e3f39bf8828ba22d9945e22cd3df80d1e8	rpl mobility support for point-to-point traffic flows towards mobile nodes	ibcn;technology and engineering	The “routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks” (RPL) from the IETF ROLL working group is a widely used standard to support routing in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Although the RPL protocol was originally designed with static topologies in mind, recently a number of extensions have been proposed to support traffic flows from mobile nodes towards a static gateway. However, this paper demonstrates that these solutions do not support traffic flows going the other direction, for example, from the gateway towards mobile devices. To remedy this, the paper first analyses the problems that prevent reliable traffic flows towards mobile devices when using RPL. Afterwards, a new mechanism to improve downward route updating is proposed. Our new approach minimizes the probability of connectivity loss by ensuring that the internal state of the static network remains consistent. Our solution is implemented and evaluated using both simulation tools and experimental facilities and it is shown that it improves the end-to-end packet delivery ratio to mobile nodes from 20–30% up to 80% while reducing the overall RPL signalling overhead without the use of location information.	computer simulation;end-to-end principle;experiment;lossy compression;low-power broadcasting;mobile device;network packet;overhead (computing);point-to-point protocol;real life;routing;traffic exchange;tree (data structure)	David Carels;Eli De Poorter;Ingrid Moerman;Piet Demeester	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/470349	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.2281390353325885	83.0543269786118	90932

E-mail addresses: cdomingo@entel.upc.edu (M.C. l.edu (M.C. Vuran). Several error control schemes have been introduced for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) to combat the effects of high error rates. However, these schemes have only been evaluated based on point-to-point communication metrics and do not consider the different underwater propagation phenomena. On the other hand, the unique properties of UWSNs such as the three-dimensional architecture and the underwater channel characteristics prevent existing studies of error control schemes for terrestrial sensor networks to be applied to this domain. In this paper, a cross-layer analysis framework is developed to evaluate existing error control techniques in three-dimensional multi-hop UWSNs. The developed framework captures the effects of automatic repeat request (ARQ), forward error correction (FEC), and hybrid ARQ schemes on end-to-end energy, latency, and packet error rate. In addition, different underwater propagation phenomena are considered with a particular attention on the presence of shadow zones. The theoretical analysis and the numerical evaluations reveal that exploiting FEC schemes with channel-aware routing reduces the end-to-end energy consumption and latency under all propagation phenomena for all water depths in UWSNs. The selection of the suitable error control scheme depends also on the water depth (shallow/ deep water) and on the different underwater propagation phenomena. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

b1be8606303294f9c004d568789e124bbe02fad4	designing 2-hop interference aware energy efficient routing (hier) protocol for wireless body area networks		With the evolution of wireless communication and advent of low power, miniaturized, intelligent computing devices, sensor network technology initiates the era of Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) for medical applications. This new trend of healthcare empowers continuous supervision of vital physiological parameters under free living conditions. However, the potency of WBAN applications are subject to reliable data delivery. Inherent challenges of WBAN such as scarce energy resource, varying link quality, propensity of tissue damage necessitate optimal routing strategy to combat with hostilities. In addition, coexistence of multiple WBANs within proximity results in severe degradation of throughput as well. In this paper, a cost-based energy efficient routing protocol has been designed which ensures satisfactory performance without fostering thermal effect and adapts itself in adverse situations like intra BAN as well as inter BAN interference. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed through comprehensive simulations. The protocol is analyzed for different mobility models signifying relative body movement due to posture change. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed protocol out performs other protocols with respect to energy efficiency while maintaining a stable packet delivery ratio under interference.

The basic tenet of the algorithm is to build multiple reliable multicast trees that adapt to topology changes in a dynamic fashion. The main characteristics of RoMR are its robustness and mobility awareness in efficiently supporting multicast communication. The robustness of our multicast strategy stems from two techniques in creating the multicast trees. First, RoMR constructs the multicast trees with links that are less prone to failure than other links. Second, multiple trees are constructed, possibly interconnected, so that if a link fails in one tree, reliable paths established from an alternate tree are immediately available. Links that have a high probability of existing in the next time interval are chosen as the links that the trees have in common.	hoc (programming language);multicast;routing	Gretchen H.

eb6d62bb534175e62a044da04a4e5f67424634f1	a simulation-based performance analysis of various multipath routing techniques in zigbee sensor networks	data stream;sensor network;wireless sensor network;energy consumption;performance analysis;routing protocol;end to end delay;multipath routing;packet delivery ratio	Multipath routing is generally known for its highly effective performance in applications involving data streaming. However, to date, only a handful of research studies have looked at the performance of multipath routing in WSN systems. Moreover, according to our knowledge, there has been no earlier study on the use of multipath routing in ZigBee WSNs. In this paper, three multipath routing techniques (Multipath AODV, Multipath DSR, and Multipath ZDR) are compared to ZigBee’s standard AODV single path routing protocol. Simulations are conducted in WSNs of different sizes using the IEEE 802.15.4 / ZigBee stack provided in OPNET, and statistics such as end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, and battery consumption are collected. The obtained results indicate that Multipath ZDR achieves the largest packet delivery ratio while also providing the shortest endto-end delay, but at the cost of greater energy consumption. The standard ZigBee AODV shows inferior performance with respect to most metrics when under a stressed network load; however, being a single-path routing protocol, it naturally consumes less energy than other examined protocols. Multipath AODV and DSR perform considerably poorer than Multipath ZDR with regard to all considered metrics as a result of increased inter-path and intra-path interference.	ansi escape code;end-to-end principle;interference (communication);multipath i/o;multipath propagation;multipath routing;network packet;performance;profiling (computer programming);router (computing);simulation;throughput	George Spanogiannopoulos;Natalija Vlajic;Dusan Stevanovic	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-11723-7_20	wireless routing protocol;routing table;embedded system;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;neurfon;static routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	7.596558068769736	83.95849262331556	91365

In this paper, a Network Coding based Power Efficient Routing (NCPER) algorithm integrated with multi-path routing algorithms is proposed to eliminate retransmission and ACK, which guarantees that the receiving node can decode the original data sent by a source node so that the source node need not care whether the transmitted packets are lost or not. In addition, numeric experiments are conducted to show impacts of packet size and finite field size on energy cost of the NCPER. The NCPER expends energy efficiently and alleviates radio interferences among nodes.	acknowledgement (data networks);experiment;genetic algorithm;linear network coding;multipath routing;network packet;retransmission (data networks)	Wen-wei Lu;Jian Pan;Yi-hua Zhu	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-11164-8_93	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;source routing;linear network coding;genetic algorithm;wireless sensor network;electrical efficiency;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;efficient energy use;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;finite field;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	5.755626875520602	82.47038859952919	91419

In this paper, we propose a novel event detection mechanism based on matching the contour maps of in-network sensory data distribution. Our key observation is that events in sensor networks can be abstracted into spatio-temporal patterns of sensory data and that pattern matching can be done efficiently through contour map matching. Therefore, we propose simple SQL extensions to allow users to specify common types of events as patterns in contour maps and study energy-efficient techniques of contour map construction and maintenance for our pattern-based event detection. Our experiments with synthetic workloads derived from a real-world coal mine surveillance application validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.	algorithm;computation;contour line;documentation;experiment;incremental backup;library (computing);map matching;matching (graph theory);multipath routing;network packet;pattern matching;prototype;sql;sensor;server (computing);server-side;software deployment;synthetic intelligence;tinyos;usability	Wenwei Xue;Qiong Luo;Lei Chen;Yunhao Liu	2006		10.1145/1142473.1142491	computer vision;wireless sensor network;computer science;pattern recognition;data mining	DB	9.68263518336138	75.180527974139	91547

However, the static nature of existing network caching techniques makes them unsuitable for wireless environments. As mobile clients move from one location to another, the performance of these caches deteriorates. To combat this problem, object relocation strategies can be used, where objects are dynamically relocated to locations near the moving clients. Existing work on object relocation have focused on achieving relocation transparency. Little attention has been given to the network overhead introduced by the relocation. In this paper, we propose a low overhead object relocation strategy suitable for wireless environments. Object lists are passed between nodes prior to relocation to ensure only the nearest copy of each object is relocated. We have developed detailed analytical models of the proposed strategy and a number of other strategies to facilitate comparison. Analytical and simulation results show the proposed strategy effectively reduce the effect of mobility on the performance of network caches. The relocation overhead of the proposed method is also significantly lower compared to existing schemes.	analytical engine;cache (computing);overhead (computing);relocation (computing);scalability;simulation	Mario Gerla;Zahir Tari;Peter Bertók	2004	Proceedings.

Clustering happened to be most effectual technique in order to attain steady performance and better utilization of energy. Traditional clustering approach elects a cluster coordinator so as to manage the whole cluster in terms of data collection, data fusion and transmission of the fused data to the distant base station. Random mobility in the phenomenal area leads to impose excess burden on the coordinator resulting quicker energy diminution which is analogous to minimum network life span. The proposed scheme exploits the heterogeneous sensor modules order to form the network and aims to balance the load of the cluster coordinator alias cluster head by concentrating on formation of nested cluster with the nodes imposing load so as to bypass the burden of the cluster head. The novelty of the scheme is not only to concentrate on load harmonization of the coordinator but also to establish an effectual arrangement of hustle free cluster formation and to prolong the network life time.	cluster analysis;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);offset binary;solaris cluster	Rupam Some;Tuhina Samanta;Indrajit Banerjee	2017		10.1145/3007748.3018287	real-time computing;computer science;load balancing;distributed computing;computer network	OS	8.679456446580879	79.97040444741957	91692

However, some inherent drawbacks of this protocol are partially solved. Although Route Optimization tries to solve these problems, it cannot manage mobility binding efficiently. In this paper, three mobility binding management schemes, including Always Push Scheme, On Demand Scheme, and Threshold Scheme, are proposed, evaluated and compared. The simulation results show that the mobility binding updating strategy significantly impacts the overall performance of mobile systems. Threshold Scheme proposed in this paper outperforms both the Mobile IP and Route Optimization for mobility management in IP based networks.	internet protocol suite;performance evaluation;scheme	Yen-Wen Lin;Hsin-Jung Chang;Ta-He Huang	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30585-9_48	telecommunications;computer science;engineering;wireless network;computer security;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	0.5361360136234793	85.08605816437657	91707

In sensor networks, and specifically the routing issue, given the need to conserve sensor energy and maximize application performance, cooperation between several layers in the protocol stack is needed. This can be reached in a cross-layer architecture. Cross-layer design allows protocols belonging to different layers to cooperate and share network status information; this will ensure that the best route is chosen by taking into consideration energy consumption and performance requirements. This paper presents a routing protocol for Wireless sensor networks using Cross-layer approach for energy optimization and lifetime raise.	artificial intelligence;fuzzy logic;link-state routing protocol;mathematical optimization;protocol stack;requirement;routing;sensor;stack machine	Asma Messaoudi;Rabiaa Elkamel;Abdelhamid Helali;Ridha Bouallegue	2017	2017 13th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986381	link-state routing protocol;wireless sensor network;wireless routing protocol;computer network;distributed computing;computer science;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;ad hoc wireless distribution service;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;zone routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	7.317323470578655	79.85130255898206	91801

A geographic routing protocol usually uses a greedy forwarding scheme with a recovery policy to solve the void problem. In this paper, we propose a new positive virtual position (PViP) scheme, for solving the local minimum problem. Positive virtual position of nodes are considered when selecting the next optimum neighbor node. Positive virtual position of a node is the average positions of node’s itself position and all single-hop neighbor nodes that are closer to the sink than itself. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed scheme increases the success delivery rate compared with other schemes without any significant overhead.	geographic routing;grammatical framework;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;maxima and minima;overhead (computing);simulation;the void (virtual reality)	Ali Ghaffari;Saeid Bahanfar	2012	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.9.185	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;embedded system;virtual routing and forwarding;routing;static routing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	4.8373412406387715	81.25304593436026	91919

In mobility-assisted routing, messages are stored in mobile nodes and carried across the network with nodal mobility. Hence, the delay involved in message delivery is tightly coupled with the properties of nodal mobility. Currently, commonly used mobility models are simplistic random i.i.d. model that do not reflect realistic mobility characteristics. In this paper we propose a novel time-variant community mobility model. In this model, we define communities that are visited often by the nodes to capture skewed location visiting preferences, and use time periods with different mobility parameters to create periodical re-appearance of nodes at the same location. We have clearly observed these two properties based on analysis of empirical WLAN traces. In addition to the proposal of a realistic mobility model, we derive analytical expressions to highlight the impact on the hitting time and meeting times if these mobility characteristics are incorporated. These quantities in turn determine the packet delivery delay in mobility-assisted routing settings. Simulation studies show our expressions have error always under 20%, and in 80% of studied cases under 10%.	backup;download;hoc (programming language);network packet;routing;simulation;tatsunoko vs. capcom:;tracing (software)	Wei-jen Hsu;Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos;Konstantinos Psounis;Ahmed Helmy	2007	IEEE INFOCOM 2007 - 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFCOM.2007.94	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;mobility model;computer network	Mobile	3.6720633537573244	86.12894369136829	92048
e6cd69d6a27328e547fcde98fb76a60c102dae0f	a protocol for data discovery and retrieval in content-centric and delay-tolerant networks		Content-Centric Networks (CCN) has emerged as an innovative paradigm that modifies the traditional host-centric and address-based communication model. Its application to delay tolerant network scenarios is known to positively impact some important network metrics and characteristics, such as delay and intermittence. Thus, we justify the feasibility of this combination and present DIRESC, a protocol for selection of message relays for data announcement, discovery and retrieval through a scheme of social cooperation between nodes. We implement our proposal using the ONE simulator and compared its performance against CCN broadcasting, PIFP and STCR protocols. Our results show that DIRESC is able to decrease at least 73.3% of data recovery delay and a gain of at least 9.88% in satisfaction of content requests over PIFP. Thus, we present DIRESC as a promising solution for accelerating the process of obtaining data in this type of network.	cyclomatic complexity;data recovery;delay-tolerant networking;experiment;programming paradigm;relay;simulation;social collaboration	Claudio Diego Souza;Danielle L.

32f2f0535c42a0471508eb73a8f8ea2912c14ada	a cost efficient multicast routing and wavelength assignment in wdm mesh network		Multicast Routing and Wavelength Assignment (MRWA) is a technique implemented in WDM optical networks, where dedicated paths are established between a source and a set of destinations, unlike unicasting where a source is connected with only one destination. For a multicast session request a multicast tree is generated to establish a connection from source to all the destinations. A wavelength is assigned to each and every branches of the generated multicast tree to create a light-tree for the session. In this work, we have tried to minimize the wavelength usage to establish multicast sessions for a set of multicast session requests. Our approach is to minimize the size of the multicast tree by sharing branches, as much as possible, to connect all the destinations from the source node. A lesser usage of links minimizes the collision probability for the assignment of wavelength, say w, in each of the selected links to be assigned the wavelength. Secondly, greater sharing implies lesser splitting. As splitters are costly, minimum usage of splitters incurs lesser infrastructure cost in the network. The effectiveness of our approach has been established through extensive simulation on different set of multicast session under different network topologies and comparing with standard Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) based algorithm. The simulation shows our algorithm performs better than the MST based algorithm.	mesh networking;multicast;routing and wavelength assignment;wavelength-division multiplexing	Subhendu Barat;Ashok Kumar Pradhan;Tanmay De	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27245-5_10	wireless mesh network;multicast;protocol independent multicast;dynamic source routing;shared mesh;order one network protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;xcast;computer network	Networks	-1.9017639140176477	83.15162714320282	92150

Group multicast is a kind of multicast where only members of the group can multicast to the group and every member of the group is allowed to multicast to the group. The routing of group multicast is to find a set of routing trees, one for each group member, for multicasting messages to the group. The traditional method is to generate each of this set of trees independently from the others and each of the trees is made optimal in terms of network cost. However, the overall network cost of the set of optimal trees may not be optimal. This paper proposes an algorithm for generating a set of routing trees, which aims at optimizing the overall cost of the set of routing trees of the group. Simulations have been done to compare our algorithm with the traditional method in various network situations.	algorithm;multicast;routing;steiner tree problem	Xiaohua Jia;Lusheng Wang	1997	Computer Communications	10.1016/S0140-3664(97)00081-9	computer simulation;routing;steiner tree problem;communication in small groups;protocol independent multicast;computer science;computer-supported cooperative work;distributed computing;steiner system;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;algorithm;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-3.686528308260647	75.82800693924493	92220

This paper presents the results of a simulation study of the performance and throughput capacity of a specific three-tier hierarchical ad hoc network with 802.11 radios, forwarding nodes and access points. The performance of the proposed hierarchical network is evaluated for two well-known classes of ad hoc routing protocols: dynamic source routing (DSR) and ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV), and compared with that of a conventional """"flat"""" ad hoc network. The results for an example sensor network scenario have shown significant capacity increases with the hierarchical architecture for both DSR and AODV cases. Modifications to ad hoc routing metrics for energy efficiency are also considered. The scalability properties of the three-tier hierarchy are studied further in terms of the achievable system capacity as a function of the relative densities of sensor nodes, forwarding nodes and access points. It is shown that the capacity of the three-tier hierarchical network scales well when the number of forwarding nodes and access points are increased in the right proportions."""	ansi escape code;channel capacity;distance-vector routing protocol;hoc (programming language);image scaling;multitier architecture;network packet;network topology;organizing (structure);scalability;self-organization;simulation;source routing;throughput;tree network;wireless access point	Suli Zhao;Ivan Seskar;Dipankar Raychaudhuri	2004	2004 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (IEEE Cat.

To have low routing requests, mobile nodes help to broadcast the routing request only when they first receive the routing requests. In addition, based on the receipt of the routing requests from the neighboring nodes, a mobile node records the location information of its one-hop neighboring nodes. In the path-reply phase, to have high path bandwidth, mobile nodes in the found path use the collected location information of their neighbors and our proposed relay model to modify the found path with high bandwidth. In our simulation, we compare our proposed routing protocol with AODV, DSR, and MMBCR in terms of average path bandwidth, power consumed during data transmission, and overall power consumption. As a result, the overall power consumption of our proposed routing protocol is better by about 51% to 58% than that of the other three routing protocols.	ansi escape code;hoc (programming language);relay;routing;simulation	Ching-Wen Chen;Chuan-Chi Weng	2009	2009 10th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks	10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.12	policy-based routing;private network-to-network interface;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.9906035614088573	82.776945617588	92496

Due to nodes’ mobility, the efficiency of a dynamic ad hoc routing protocol depends highly on updating speed of network topology changes. To achieve continuous updated routing tables, the nodes periodically broadcast short Hello messages to their neighbors. Although benefits of these messages have been proven, many studies show some drawbacks for these messages. In this paper, we adaptively optimize the frequent needs of those messages using a fuzzy logic system. The proposed fuzzy algorithm is used to model the uncertainty measurements for updating local connectivity successfully in time. Extensive performance analysis via simulation proves the effectiveness of the proposed method to improve the accuracy of neighborhood information and, hence, overall network performance.	algorithm;fuzzy logic;hoc (programming language);network performance;network topology;routing table;simulation	Essam Natsheh;Adznan B.

Each sensor node is equipped with a wireless communication device, a small microprocessor, and a battery-powered energy source. Typically, the applications of WSNs such as habitat monitoring, fire detection, and military surveillance, require data collection, processing, and transmission among the sensor nodes. Due to their energy constraints and hostile environments, the main challenge in the research of WSN lies in prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. #R##N#In this dissertation, we present four different topology management protocols for K-coverage and load balancing to prolong the lifetime of WSNs. #R##N#First, we present a Randomly Ordered Activation and Layering (ROAL) protocol for K-coverage in a stationary WSN. The ROAL suggests a new model of layer coverage that can construct a K-covered WSN using the layer information received from its previously activated nodes in the sensing distance. Second, we enhance the fault tolerance of layer coverage through a Circulation-ROAL (C-ROAL) protocol. Using the layer number, the C-ROAL can activate each node in a round-robin fashion during a predefined period while conserving reconfiguration energy. Next, Mobility Resilient Coverage Control (MRCC) is presented to assure K-coverage in the presence of mobility, in which a more practical and reliable model for K-coverage with nodal mobility is introduced. Finally, we present a Multiple-Connected Dominating Set (MCDS) protocol that can balance the network traffic using an on-demand routing protocol. The MCDS protocol constructs and manages multiple backbone networks, each of which is constructed with a connected dominating set (CDS) to ensure a connected backbone network. We describe each protocol, and compare the performance of our protocols with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and/or existing K-coverage algorithms through extensive simulations. #R##N#The simulation results obtained by the ROAL protocol show that K-coverage can be guaranteed with more than 95% coverage ratio, and significantly extend network lifetime against a given WSN. We also observe that the C-ROAL protocol provides a better reconfiguration method, which consumes only less than 1% of the reconfiguration energy in the ROAL protocol, with a greatly reduced packet latency. The MRCC protocol, considering the mobility, achieves better coverage by 1.4% with 22% fewer active sensors than that of an existing coverage protocol for the mobility. The results on the MCDS protocol show that the energy depletion ratio of nodes is decreased consequently, while the network throughput is improved by 35%.	hoc (programming language)	Hogil Kim	2009			wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;engineering;tunneling protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network;internetwork protocol	Mobile	7.898696417126678	80.36018136380397	93062

In WSNs, there are generally two kinds of networks: always-on WSNs (AO-WSNs) in which sensors always keep awake and duty-cycled WSNs (DC-WSNs) where sensors dynamically sleep and wake. To the best of our knowledge, there are a lot of work about top-k query in AO-WSNs but little research has been done regarding top-k query in DC-WSNs. However, DC-WSN is a very practical network model in which energy consumption can be greatly saved. In this paper, we analyze the research issues when implementing top-k query in DC-WSNs and propose the DCDC-WSNs (DC-WSNs with data replication (DR) and connected k-neighborhood (CKN)) to implement top-k query. Further theoretical analysis and simulation results show that implementing top-k query in DCDC-WSNs can achieve the best tradeoff with respect to query data accessibility and query cost (total energy consumption, query response time), compared with AO-WSNs and DCC-WSNs (DC-WSNs with only CKN).	accessibility;ambient occlusion;call of duty: black ops;dc-to-dc converter;high availability;moore neighborhood;network model;regular expression;replication (computing);response time (technology);sensor;simulation	Chunsheng Zhu;Laurence Tianruo Yang;Lei Shu;Takahiro Hara;Shojiro Nishio	2011	2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference	10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982593	embedded system;online aggregation;sargable;query optimization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;computer security;computer network	DB	8.661331668620639	74.91947215762617	93272

272a65e30c29be9ed2fccebd8bc83f9c60c307fb	cft: a cluster-based file transfer scheme for highway vanets		Effective file transfer between vehicles is fundamental to many emerging vehicular infotainment applications in the highway Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), such as content distribution and social networking. However, due to fast mobility, the connection between vehicles tends to be short-lived and lossy, which makes intact file transfer extremely challenging. To tackle this problem, we presents a novel Cluster-based File Transfer (CFT) scheme for highway VANETs in this paper. With CFT, when a vehicle requests a file, the transmission capacity between the resource vehicle and the destination vehicle is evaluated. If the requested file can be successfully transferred over the direct Vehicular-to-Vehicular (V2V) connection, the file transfer will be completed by the resource and the destination themselves. Otherwise, a cluster will be formed to help the file transfer. As a fully-distributed scheme that relies on the collaboration of cluster members, CFT does not require any assistance from roadside units or access points. Our experimental results indicate that CFT outperforms the existing file transfer schemes for highway VANETs.	digital distribution;download;file transfer;lossy compression;simulation;throughput;vehicle-to-vehicle;wireless access point	Quyuan Luo;Changle Li;Qiang Ye;Tom H.

In such sensor networks, real-time data are generated by a large number of distributed sources. Queries are made that may require sophisticated processing and filtering of the data. A query is represented by a query graph. In order to reduce the data transmission and to better utilize resources, it is desirable to place operators of the query graph inside the network, and thus to perform in-network processing. Moreover, given that various queries occur with different frequencies and that only a subset of sensor data may actually be queried, caching intermediate data objects inside the network can help improve query efficiency. In this paper, we consider the problem of placing both operators and intermediate data objects inside the network for a set of queries so as to minimize the total cost of storage, computation, and data transmission. We propose distributed algorithms that achieve optimal solutions for tree-structured query graph topologies and general network topologies. The algorithms converge in Lmax(.HQ + 1) iterations, where Lmax is the order of the diameter of the sensor network, and Hq represents the depth of the query graph, defined as the maximum number of operations needed for a raw data to become a final data. For a regular grid network and complete binary tree query graph, the complexity is 0(radic(N)log2 M), where N is the number of nodes in the sensor network and M is the number of data objects in a query graph. The most attractive features of these algorithms are that they require only information exchanges between neighbors, can be executed asynchronously, are adaptive to cost change and topology change, and are resilient to node or link failures.	approximation algorithm;binary tree;cache (computing);computation;computer;converge;distributed algorithm;emergence;filter (signal processing);grid network;heuristic (computer science);iteration;np-hardness;network processor;network topology;real-time data;regular grid;tree (data structure)	Lei Ying;Zhen Liu;Donald F.

A new open spectrum operation necessitates a novel routing scheme to exploit the available spectrum opportunistically. In this paper, we propose a distributed routing scheme for multi-hop cognitive radio mesh networks. In cognitive radio networks the behavior of the primary user influences the secondary networks connectivity and the relevant performance. Some primary users may be hidden node and some primary user may be exposed node to the secondary users. The proposed routing schemes can avoid the primary exposed and primary hidden node problem during routing. We propose, a channel priority lists is kept by the secondary users. The secondary users select the channel among the channel priority lists depending on the primary user activity. Therefore it can avoid the end to end reroute procedure due to the exposed or hidden node problem. Throughput and end to end delay is used for the evaluation criteria. Simulation result shows that the proposed routing scheme enhances the network throughput and reduces the end to end delay significantly.	cpl;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;mesh networking;network packet;programming paradigm;routing;simulation;throughput	Shamsad Parvin;Takeo Fujii	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140027	policy-based routing;routing;cognitive radio;static routing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	-0.7584017387378766	84.41851010377576	93611

However, in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), sound propagation in the ocean medium is more complex than that in the air due to many factors, including sound speed variations and the interaction of sound waves with the sea surface and floor, causing the sound rays to bend. Therefore, propagation of sound is anisotropic in water, and may cause a phenomenon called shadow zone where nodes in the communication range of the sender cannot hear any signal. This renders conventional routing protocols no longer energy-efficient. In this paper, we make use of the ray-model to account for the environment-dependent behavior of the underwater channel, re-define nodes’ one-hop neighbors based on signal attenuation rather than geographical distance, and design a distributed energy-efficient routing protocol for UASNs. Results show that our ray-model-based routing policy consistently outperforms the shortest path policy, and performs very close to the optimal one in several scenarios. key words: Energy-Efficient Routing, Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks, Geographical Distance, Ray Model, Anisotropic Propagation.	acoustic cryptanalysis;geographical distance;rendering (computer graphics);routing;shadow copy;shortest path problem;software propagation	Ping Wang;Lin Zhang;Victor O.

Principles of geometric routing approaches are very simple. Every node is assumed to be aware of the location of itself, of its neighbors, and of the destination. Based only on these information, every node is able to perform a routing decision. The location can be determined by either geographic coordinates (we thus talk of geographic routing) or logical coordinates extracted from the environment. In the former case, location coordinates may be derived thanks to GPS or estimated thanks to any other positioning mean such as triangulation. In the latter case, a new coordinate system has to be built. This chapter reviews the main routing algorithms in every coordinate-based system, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each of them.	routing	Nathalie Mitton;Tahiry Razafindralambo;David Simplot-Ryl	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-14849-1_15	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;dsrflow;geography;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.4060545798835666	80.23635245645814	93677

To mitigate the broadcast storm, improve the broadcasting reliability and prolong the lifetime of networks, we propose a broadcasting algorithm based on successful broadcasting ratio and energy balance of nodes (BSREB) in mobile ad hoc networks. Heavy traffic usually aggravates the broadcast problem. Thus, we introduce the successful broadcasting ratio which reflects both local topology and traffic to determine the forwarding probability. To prolong the network lifetime, energy balance strategy is adopted by using residual energy to determine the forwarding probability. Since the forwarding probability of each node is determined by its own successful broadcasting ratio and residual energy, BSREB is simple and easy to implement. The simulation results show that BSREB can achieve a lower latency and higher reachability. Meanwhile, the BSREB algorithm has a strong adaptability to node mobility.	algorithm;hoc (programming language)	Yanping Yu;Long Li;Keyan Liu;Yichen Deng;Xue Su	2018	IJIPT	10.1504/IJIPT.2018.10012652	mobile ad hoc network;residual;latency (engineering);computer network;computer science;adaptability;algorithm;energy balance;reachability;broadcast radiation;distributed computing;broadcasting	Mobile	4.2519459367619445	83.48177806192678	93771

By well designed data aggregation algorithms, nodes' energy would be conserved and the utilization of wireless channel would be improved. So designing reasonable data aggregation algorithm is one of the most important research fields to improve WSNs' performance. In this paper, a new data aggregation algorithm named DQDA (Dynamic Queue Data Aggregation) is proposed which is design on the base of hierarchal routing algorithm. In DQDA, a dynamic queue would be defined in every filter node to store history messages transmitted by this node, and new message would be judged whether reduplicated in time, and the filtering efficiency is also improved. At last, a series experiments are simulated to prove the performance of DQDA.	algorithm;data aggregation;experiment;information design;real-time transcription;routing;transmitter	Tao Du;Shouning Qu;Qingbei Guo;Zhe Qu	2014	2014 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing	10.1109/BDCloud.2014.34	filter;data aggregator;algorithm design;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;cluster analysis;computer network	DB	8.524736133461044	82.55669602774411	94073

The long duty cycle makes the sensors can have more time to transmit data, and low duty cycle makes the sensors can conserve battery energy. In this paper, we propose an application-specific duty cycle adjustment MAC protocol (i) to conserve energy on sensors with low data traffic and (ii) to decrease transmission latency on sensors with heavy data traffic. In the proposed scheme, nodes are not required to follow a single generic duty cycle. Each node can have different listen and sleep schedules with different duty cycles. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Considering the characteristics that nodes are almost static and position aware in wireless sensor networks, we propose a novel broadcasting algorithm (NBA) for utilizing energy efficiently. The energy status of nodes is regarded as an important factor, as well as the local network topology, in clustering and deciding retransmission nodes. We prove the accurateness of NBA. Simulations show that NBA reduces the number of redundant retransmissions and balances traffic efficiently, so energy is conserved and energy dissipation is distributed evenly throughout the network. Thereby the lifetime of WSN is prolonged greatly.

Lately various measurement studies of human walk traces have discovered several significant statistical patterns of human mobility. Namely these include truncated power-law distributions of flights, pause-times and inter-contact times, fractal way-points, and heterogeneously defined areas of individual mobility. Unfortunately, none of existing mobility models effectively captures all of these features. This paper presents a new mobility model called SLAW (Self-similar Least Action Walk) that can produce synthetic walk traces containing all these features. This is by far the first such model. Our performance study using using SLAW generated traces indicates that SLAW is effective in representing social contexts present among people sharing common interests or those in a single community such as university campus, companies and theme parks. The social contexts are typically common gathering places where most people visit during their daily lives such as student unions, dormitory, street malls and restaurants. SLAW expresses the mobility patterns involving these contexts by fractal waypoints and heavy-tail flights on top of the waypoints. We verify through simulation that SLAW brings out the unique performance features of various mobile network routing protocols.	fractal;individual mobility;mobile device;performance evaluation;routing;scalability;simulation;social engineering (security);synthetic intelligence;tracing (software)	Kyunghan Lee;Seongik Hong;Seong Joon Kim;Injong Rhee;Song Chong	2009	IEEE INFOCOM 2009	10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061995	probability distribution;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;anthropometry;routing protocol;mobile computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	3.3121066421063494	86.70173323347262	94480

With the greater transmission power and more aggressive channel access time resolution, WLANs often affect the communication of WSNs severely. To eliminate this kind of interference effect, we design protection nodes and propose a transmission protection protocol, WSNs Transmission Protection Protocol (WTPP), to improve the transmission performances of WSNs in hybrid networks. The protection nodes can emit protection signal periodically to block the traffic of WLANs and permit the transmission of WSNs. We implement WTPP in a hybrid network testbed to prove its feasibility. Comparing with legacy ZigBee, the experimental results show that WTPP can improve the packet delivery ratio of WSNs efficiently under the interference of WLANs. When WSNs work on low duty cycle, the throughput degradation of WLANs is less than 6%.

The map can be obtained from detailed measurements, which are time consuming and require network down time. We explore methods and models to produce the interference map with a reduced number of measurements, by identifying interference properties that help to extrapolate complex measurements from simple measurements. Actual interference in an 802.11a testbed is shown to follow certain regularities - it is linear with respect to packet rate of the source, packet rate of the interferer, and shows independence among interferers. When multiple cards are available, they behave differently, and even different channels of the same card have different performance. We find that while current methods of gathering the interference map may be appropriate for characterizing interference in one card networks, they are unscalable for multiple card networks when considering: 802.11 characteristics (card and channel asymmetries, time variation), required downtime, and complexity of the measurement procedure.	data structure;downtime;extrapolation;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);network packet;routing;testbed	Dragos Niculescu	2007		10.1145/1298306.1298355	electronic engineering;real-time computing;data structure;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;interference;quantum mechanics;measurement;computer network	Mobile	-2.736200933097213	87.45946628496341	94758

Such feedback is typically sent as control messages by receiver nodes. Since sending of control messages involves communication overhead, many protocols rely on aggregating a number of control messages and sending them together as a single packet over the network. On the other hand, the delays in the transmission of control messages may reduce the rate of data transmission from the sender. Thus, there is a basic tradeoff between the communication cost of control messages and the effect of delaying them. We develop a rigorous framework to study the aggregation of control packets for multicast and other hierarchical network protocols. We define the multicast aggregation problem and design efficient online algorithms for it, both centralized and distributed.	centralized computing;communications protocol;control flow;feedback;multicast;network packet;online algorithm;overhead (computing);tree network	Sanjeev Khanna;Joseph Naor;Danny Raz	2002		10.1007/3-540-45465-9_13	transmission time;online algorithm;message passing;multicast;telecommunications;communication in small groups;computer science;programming language;computer security;computer network;data transmission	Networks	-1.888118702322207	75.15340310671724	94976
35d3e9bffbc526b5d786c91ffa82060b38970e84	saving energy in wireless local area sensor networks	sensor network	Many wireless sensor network developers have adopted Bluetooth and Zigbee technologies for sensor communication. However, it has a big problem: the radio coverage is very short; so many sensors are needed to cover wide areas and sensors are expensive. On the other hand, these technologies lack a high bandwidth. IEEE 802.11a/b/g technologies have higher coverage areas and higher bandwidth, but their energy consumption is significantly higher. This paper discusses the energy consumption analytically and gives the considerations that should be taken into account in developing a wireless local area sensor network. Then, we propose a new protocol based on group collaboration to be implemented in these types of networks in order to decrease the energy consumption and save the energy wasted by the whole system. Finally, the protocol proposed is simulated and compared with other protocols available in the Ns2 simulator in order to prove that our solution is better.

584d0c3cbcdeba5c78ca8ca364fdd4d99dee0ca8	a novel minimum delay maximum flow multicast algorithm to construct a multicast tree in wireless mesh networks	cost function;traffic flow;load balancing;wireless mesh networks	The construction of multicast tree within given constraints, such as delay and capacity, is becoming a major problem in many wireless networks, especially wireless mesh networks (WMN). Due to the limited capacity of the wireless node, amulticast call may be dropped if there is no multicast tree formed within the given constraints. In this paper, we propose a newmulticast tree construction algorithmwhich has maximum traffic flow andminimum delay under capacity constraints. The problem of multicast is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem with associated constraints. A cost function (CF) is defined to choose the less loaded route among the available ones. A Minimum Delay Maximum Flow Multicast (MDMF) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem using CF and associated constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm and CF is evaluated and compared withwell-known algorithmswith respect to packet delivery fraction, latency, and network throughput. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithm has a lesser number of transmissions for a given CF. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has high throughput, packet delivery fraction and less latency compared to other well-known algorithms in this category. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Supporting pervasive communications among mobile devices in such a large-scale mobile social network becomes a key challenge for this new mobile sensing system. One possible solution is allowing packet delivery among mobile devices via opportunistic communications during intermittent contacts. However, the lack of rich contact opportunities still causes poor delivery ratio and long delay, especially for large-scale networks. Deployment of additional stationary throwboxes can create a greater number of contact opportunities, thus improve the performance of routing. However, the locations of deployed throwboxes are critical to such improvement. In this paper, we investigate where to deploy throwboxes in a large-scale throwbox-assisted mobile social DTN. By leveraging the social properties discovered from real-life tracing data, we propose a set of social-based throwbox placement algorithms which smartly pick the location of each throwbox. Extensive simulations are conducted with a real-life wireless tracing dataset and a wide range of existing DTN routing methods. The results confirm the efficiency of the proposed methods. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In 5G milieu, the Aggregator Node B (ANB) is the base station with enhanced computing capabilities and storage space. In this paper, an integration of 5G-cloud-VMesh network is initiated. In this paper, we also propose a new routing algorithm for 5CVN, dubbed as 5CVN-adroit algorithm. The proposed 5CVN-adroit algorithm chooses an optimal gateway and ANB in the network layer to route the request/response from and to the service requesters and the cloud using 5G technologies. This paper endows with the network architecture and main technical features such as interconnection, integration, and intelligence of 5CVN-adroit algorithm. The simulation study shows that the 5CVN-adroit algorithm augments the routing issues such as delay, congestion, and deployment cost and it is justified based on the packet delivery ratio, average response time, routing overhead ratio, and packet collision ratio.

It's an important issue that how to consume lower energy and transfer data stably based on energy considerations. A routing protocol is proposed with sequential repair and backup routing protocol (Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing-Sequential Repair and Backup Routing Protocol, AODV-SRBR Protocol), that can reduce the number of transceivers and have a stable connection. In the proposed routing protocol, the node of network can create multi-route message through decoding the path information of packets. When the link is broken, the proposed protocol can repair the data transmission by sequential repair or select backup routing. This study implements the routing protocol to verify a multi-hop connection and data transfer in the general environment. The performance of AODV-SRBR and AODV is compared and simulated by NS2. The proposed routing protocol can achieve same transmission efficiency in the fewer route request packets; fewer maintained packets and fewer transmit and receive times according to the simulation result. By stable connection, low power consumption and multi-hop data transfer, this work expects that the proposed routing protocol on the embedded systems platform can be extended in large sensor mesh network.	backup;distance-vector routing protocol;embedded system;mesh networking;pmr446;simulation;transceiver;wireless mesh network	Jih-Ching Chiu;Chun-Yao Zheng;Yao-Chin Huang;Kai-Ming Yang	2014	2014 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785486	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;order one network protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	5.418338652649153	83.16031565367297	95924

This paper proposes a Distributed Energy Efficient Scheme to Cluster Wireless Sensor Networks (DESC). This protocol achieves energy efficiency using two techniques: on demand clustering and a multi-criteria cluster formation. Whenever a cluster head consumes a prespecified part of its energy, it indirectly informs other nodes to hold cluster head elections for the upcoming round. Therefore, clustering is performed sporadically (in contrast to performing it every round). In DESC, a node with higher amount of remaining energy is considered a more eligible candidate for election as a cluster head. Besides, each node computes a multi-criteria cost, and a regular (non-cluster head) node elects the cluster head with the most cost to connect to. Simulation results show that the protocol outperforms HEED and LEACH protocols in terms of network lifetime and energy savings.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer cluster;cylinder-head-sector;institute for operations research and the management sciences;load balancing (computing);matlab;overhead (computing);simulation;stationary process;whole earth 'lectronic link	Peyman Neamatollahi;Hoda Taheri;Mahmoud Naghibzadeh;Mohammad Hossein Yaghmaee Moghaddam	2011			distributed algorithm;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;cluster analysis;computer network	Mobile	9.012308399566182	80.12421131185872	96192
0a930e289dcda35bac0fc42af26e929ae942ddcf	one- and multi-pass long-hop routing for wireless network		Radio is a widely used means of communication for many devices. As such, the devices constitue a radio network, which enables them to pass information from one to another (unicast) or one to many (broadcast). Each radio network operates a given set of frequencies (channels) to transmit, but in majority of settings this set is limited to one channel only. While that brings simplicity to the radio hardware and avoids problems of choosing the right channel by all communicating devices, it also causes the problem of channel occupation. When two stations transmit at the same time, their communication may reach other stations simultaneously, making it impossible to receive either of them. This is called a collision, and there are many MAC (medium-access) protocols designed to avoid that. They can utilise a time-division approach, where each station is given its timeshare when only it is allowed to transmit. Others leverage the hardware capability of carrier sensing – CS (there are also software-based versions of CS), where a station listens to the channel prior to transmitting to assure the channel is free. Some protocols enforce a game on the stations – the one station that wins becomes a leader and is allowed access to the channel. This last group is often referred to as leader election problems, applicable not only in the realm of radio communication. In this paper we consider a form of randomized leader election algorithm for an efficient routing of a message. The routing concept is present when information originates at one point of a network and is destined to another. Depending on additional characteristics of the network, many different approaches for routing are implemented. When all stations are in each others’ transmission range this problem trivially reduces to a case of the leader election. However, when the message must be passed by intermittent stations (multi-hop network), then means of deciding which stations should be on its way must be devised. In dynamic settings, or when geometry of the network is unknown, this must be done locally by each station involved. The easiest form of information dissipation is flooding, wherein each station, upon receiving the message, re-transmits it blindly. This brings many collisions and unnecessary bandwith use, so other routing methodologies are in use to prevent some stations from re-transmitting the	hop;leader election;randomized algorithm;routing;time-sharing;transmitter;unicast	Przemyslaw Blaskiewicz;Jacek Cichon;Jakub Lemiesz;Miroslaw Kutylowski;Marcin Zawada	2016	CoRR		policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Networks	7.618007385529412	87.95159509730601	96340

First, it suggests two directions for the new paradigm; one is “microand nano-device communication system” which is the projected scenario considering that the entities in source and destination have been shrinking throughout the history of wireless communication systems. The second direction is “networked robot system”, which emerges as a natural extension of mobile ad hoc networking where the networking is closely related to motion control of robots. Secondly, it shows two interesting research topics, “the new communication protocol design” and “signal processing”, respectively, that arise in the wake of the fusion between the two directions in the novel communication paradigm.

This dissertation focuses on improving the energy consumption of radio communication in sensor networks by proposing novel approaches in two key aspects of low-power wireless communication, namely, wireless link quality estimation and low duty-cycle data forwarding protocol. I first motivate the research with a comparative study of the routing performance and energy consumption with respect to existing link quality estimation protocols. Then, I propose 4C, a data-driven approach to build link quality prediction models based on empirical data collected from the deployment site in order to address the problems of link quality estimation in low-power sensor networks. Furthermore, I improve this novel data-driven approach to predict short temporal link quality variations without prior collected training data by employing online learning techniques. Analytical and empirical evaluations show that the proposed link quality prediction approach can significantly reduce the cost of radio transmissions by utilizing long links with variable quality. Moreover, I proposed SAF, an energy-efficient data forwarding protocol that can effectively utilize the short term link quality prediction models in duty-cycled networks. With the help of link quality prediction models, SAF not only minimizes the energy consumption spent on idle nodes, but also leverage the spatial diversity of wireless links via opportunistic routing. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of the potential improvements of the proposed approaches in low-power sensor networks as well as in other wireless networks.

5ddd4bf12dc72f5f28f08216eb91ad46182eab9d	escape: effective scalable clustering approach for parallel execution of continuous position-based queries in position monitoring applications		Massive data sets of continuous position-based queries (CPQs) in position monitoring applications offer a challenge of time ingestion while forwarding the position-based data within wireless search space area. As a result of recurrent modifications in network topology due to the mobility of users, processing of large CPQ data sets and roaming CPQs is one of the challenges in position monitoring. Therefore, the parallel algorithm is proposed in this paper for clustering and parallel processing of roaming CPQs which will recognize solid clusters in the wireless search space area. We present an algorithm which proposes the use of search space areas for clustering and introduce a parallel framework for parallel processing of CPQ data sets. The wireless search space area from wireless networks are used for scalable and effective calculation of clusters and dimensions in wireless networks. Present continuous query processing techniques cannot competently process roaming CPQs in the wireless search space area. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated to have practically best speedups in processing roaming CPQs. Results indicate that the proposed work determine improved ability of CPQs over existing mechanisms and attain small query latency and high precision in position monitoring applications.	cluster analysis;database;network topology;parallel algorithm;parallel computing;scalability	Darshan Vishwasrao Medhane;Arun Kumar Sangaiah	2017	IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing	10.1109/TSUSC.2017.2690378	marketing;management science	Visualization	4.060641365861534	79.23788818840632	96490

For that reason, energy efficiency has become a primary design consideration in emerging and future IoT solutions. Already, beaconing and discontinuous transmission/reception is included in the upcoming IoT standards to enable devices to duty cycle between the active and sleep states in order to save energy. In many cases however, this periodic mode of operation results in unnecessary wake-ups that greatly reduce energy efficiency. Event-based communication greatly outperforms periodic triggering in efficiency, since wake-ups occur only when particular events take place. The networking aspects of this promising approach are investigated herein with devices exchanging events for monitoring and control purposes. Both centralized optimal and distributed heuristic strategies are formulated to intelligently adjust the number of wake-up events in order to maximize energy efficiency. Extensive simulations are conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed strategies.	autonomy;block cipher mode of operation;caffeine;centralized computing;discontinuous transmission;duty cycle;heuristic;internet of things;location-based service;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;simulation;software deployment;testbed;wake-on-lan	Panayiotis Kolios;Georgios Ellinas;Christoforos Panayiotou;Marios M.

Traditional multicast routing algorithms used for solving the          Steiner tree problem cannot be used in this scenario, because QoS constraints on links          are not considered. In this paper, we present two efficient source‐based multicast          routing algorithms in directed networks. The objective of the routing algorithms is          to minimize the multicast tree cost while maintaining a bound on delay. Simulation          results show that these two heuristics can greatly improve the multicast tree cost          measure in comparison with the shortest path routing schemes.

Unfortunately, capturing complete traces of wireless traffic is difficult, and using incomplete traces can degrade the quality of the aforementioned analyses. In this paper we examine three different methods for estimating the completeness of wireless traces. We find that a method that examines MAC-layer sequence numbers provides the most accurate results. We also examine the effect of the placement of wireless sensors on the completeness of wireless-side traces. We determine that locating sensors such that the signal strengths between clients and access points is over 40% results in low miss rates at the sensor, and few CRC errors.	acknowledgement (data networks);cyclic redundancy check;informatics;network planning and design;sensor;technical support;tracing (software);wireless access point	Aniket Mahanti;Martin F.

These applications are becoming very important in many areas such as sensing and controlling of temperature. The wireless sensor nodes use routing protocols for sending data between the nodes of the system as required by the application. These routing protocols vary in their effect on the node power consumption, the node life time and the system scalability. We propose a Multipath Adaptive Periodic Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient Network Protocol (MAPTEEN). This routing protocol allows multiple routes for the information to reach a certain destination. The multipath approach increases the reliability of the network, decreases the power consumption and increases the life time of the network.	communications protocol;multipath propagation;routing;scalability	Osama Abouelkhair;Amr Elsaadny	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks	10.1109/CICSyN.2014.15	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	9.297391667017013	80.97738751664312	97317

The performance of vehicle mobility in terms of average inter-vehicle link available time and the average number of inter-vehicle link changes for maintaining an active link in VANET is analyzed using both handover model and random moving model, respectively. The theoretical analysis is verified by simulation experiments. The numerical results indicate that the analytical random moving model is able to appropriately present the behavior of vehicle moving under different conditions, especially when mobile vehicle is moving relatively fast. On the other hand, the effect of traffic conditions on the accuracy of theoretical analysis is also investigated. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the high mobility and dynamic nature of VANETs leads to unreliable links that pose a great challenge in protocol to support the high quality of experience (QoE) for video delivery. To provide an efficient protocol for VANETs, we propose a novel protocol called Reliable Beaconless Routing Protocol (RBRP) to perform receiver-based unicast forwarding without the help of beacons. In RBRP, we propose a self-adaptive forwarding zone to avoid the multipoint relay. And then the nodes compete for the forwarding right based on a comprehensive waiting time which considers the greedy strategy, the quality of link and the load of the node. To verify the performance of the RBRP, we compare it with the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) and the gossiping-based protocol by means of simulation with NS-2. Simulation results show that the RBRP improves the packet delivery ratio and reduces the end-to-end delay.	display resolution;end-to-end principle;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);multipoint ground;network packet;optimized link state routing protocol;relay;simulation;stateless protocol;unicast	Yun Chen;Changle Li;Xiaolei Han;Mingyu Gao;Lina Zhu	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2014.118	wireless routing protocol;virtual routing and forwarding;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;ad hoc wireless distribution service;link-state routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.4834485885757402	84.69780980406775	97421

Our analysis is based on the most accurate known interference model, namely the SINR-based physical interference model. We first study the problem in a low-intensity multicast scenario where we derive optimal node selection strategies for different subtree structures. We then extend these analyses to account for interference between consecutive packets in higher-rate multicast scenarios. Based on these analyses, we propose and evaluate two new multicast routing structures: the interference-aware Steiner tree (IAST) algorithm, which requires global knowledge of node locations, and the fixed-distance tree merging (FTM) algorithm, which does not require global knowledge. We show that our proposed algorithms provide up to 57% reduction in schedule length and up to 41% increase in goodput over existing tree-based routing structures.	algorithm;goodput;interference (communication);multicast;routing;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;steiner tree problem;tree (data structure);vii	Daniel Lertpratchya;Douglas M.

Proxy is introduced to localize feedback and retransmission, and therefore significantly depress traffic redundancy and reduce latency. Placement of proxies is a key issue in HRM. This paper theoretically analyzes the performance improvement made by placement of proxies and presents a new approach to optimal partition of a subtree for performance optimization in the placement of a single proxy. Based on this approach, we propose a new algorithm, designed in a greedy fashion. We experimentally compare our new algorithm with several existing heuristic algorithms, and observe that it outperforms in the tradeoff between performance and complexity. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To overcome this issue, Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) has come up with lot of novel ideas such as vehicular communication, navigation and traffic controlling. In this study, the main focus is on congestion control at the intersections which result from unclear ahead. For this purpose, a city lane and intersection model has been proposed to manage vehicle mobility. It shows the actual vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to traffic infrastructure communication. The experiment was conducted using Network Simulator 2 (NS 2). The implementation required modelling the road side unit, traffic control unit, and on-board unit along the roadside. In the simulation, including traffic volume, the distance between two signals, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, throughput and packet lost were taken into consideration. These parameters ensure efficient communication between the traffic signals. This results in improved congestion control and road safety, since the vehicles will be signalled not to enter the junction box and information about other vehicles.	control system;control unit;end-to-end principle;network congestion;network packet;on-board data handling;simulation;throughput	Ruchin Jain	2018	CoRR		vehicular ad hoc network;throughput;computer network;vehicle-to-vehicle;network congestion;network simulation;network packet;control unit;population;computer science	Mobile	4.169471356834825	87.82776924501697	97758

Specifically, there is no published investigation of the relation between routing overhead on one hand and route request pattern (traffic) on the other. This paper provides a mathematical framework for quantifying the overhead of a cluster-based routing protocol. We explicitly model the application-level traffic in terms of the statistical description of the number of hops between a source and a destination. The network topology is modelled by a regular two-dimensional grid of unreliable nodes, and expressions for various components of the routing overhead are derived. The results show that clustering does not change the traffic requirement for infinite scalability compared to flat protocols, but reduces the overhead by a factor of O(1/M) where M is the cluster size. The analytic results are validated against simulations of random network topologies running a well known (D-hop max-min) clustering algorithm.	algorithm;cluster analysis;hoc (programming language);maxima and minima;network topology;overhead (computing);random graph;routing;scalability;simulation	Huaming Wu;Alhussein A.

Considering the feature of the DTNs where there may be rare stable links, we propose an application-oriented broadcast (AOB) protocol built atop “bundle layer” in DTNs, which adjusts the forwarding probability for different types of traffic categories. As a result, AOB can provide differentiated services for prioritized data packets and simultaneously reduce the broadcast overhead. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated by extensive simulations for scenarios with not only Random Way Point mobility model but also realistic mobility traces collected from cars moving in the city.	differentiated services;network packet;overhead (computing);simulation;tracing (software)	Huazhi Gong;JongWon Kim	2009	2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917536	broadcast radiation;atomic broadcast;telecommunications;computer science;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	2.101555799944973	86.80033786032622	98159

As the real-time applications used in today’s wireless network grow, we need some schemes to provide more suitable service for them. We know that most of actual schemes do not perform well on traffic which is not strictly CBR. Therefore, in this paper we have studied the impact, respectively, of mobility models and the density of nodes on the performances (End-to-End Delay, Throughput and Packet Delivery ratio) of routing protocol (Optimized Link State Routing) OLSR by using in the first a real-time VBR (MPEG-4) and secondly the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic. Finally we compare the performance on both cases. Experimentally, we considered the three mobility models as follows Random Waypoint, Random Direction and Mobgen Steady State. The experimental results illustrate that the behavior of OLSR change according to the model and the used traffics.	case-based reasoning;experiment;futures studies;hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;network packet;optimized link state routing protocol;packet delay variation;performance;proactive parallel suite;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time web;spatial variability;steady state;throughput;time value of money;volume boot record;waypoint	Mohamed Amnai;Youssef Fakhri;Jaafar Abouchabaka	2011	CoRR		wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;end-to-end delay;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;constant bitrate;mobility model;triangular routing;steady state;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.4916618248154963	87.44098650825244	98206

However, Mobile IP suffers from many drawbacks especially handoff latency. In this paper, we investigate the loss of successive binding update requests and their impact on handoff latency. We show that handoff latency increases in case of successive binding update requests loss. We propose an enhancement of binding update in Mobile IP. It consists on reducing the timeout to half just after the loss of the first binding update. So, the mobile node sends two binding update requests within a timeout. By doing so, we increase the probability that one binding update request reach the home agent. We present an analytical model of handoff latency based on packets loss probability. The simulation shows that our solution reduces considerably the additional handoff latency induced by successive binding update requests loss.	mobile ip;profiling (computer programming)	Djamel Tandjaoui;Nadjib Badache;Abdelmadjid Bouabdallah	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-25969-5_45	embedded system;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;network interface;model-based reasoning;packet loss;mobile computing;computer security;telecommunications network;mobile ip;computer network	HCI	-2.3911923894202247	77.1153259184441	98371

Nodes in an ad hoc network have limited power resources as well as limited processing power. When routing, a sharp degradation in the network service may result if the routing algorithm does not account for the limited resources, eventually decreasing the network lifetime. The objective of our work is to extend the life time of ad hoc networks through implementing a multi-path congestion and power aware routing protocol. The protocol developed is a swarm-based routing protocol that incorporated both power awareness and load balancing techniques. PowerAnt extended network lifetime by 33% on average; besides, it provided a cheaper energy routing strategy per byte by 23% compared with AODV.	algorithm;byte;elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);network congestion;routing;swarm	Ahmed S.

However, the structure of scatternets is not defined in the Bluetooth specification and remains as an open issue at the designers’ choice. It is desirable to have simple yet efficient scatternet topologies with good supports of routing protocols, considering that Bluetooths are to be used for personal area networks with design goals of simplicity and compactness. In the literature, although many routing protocols have been proposed for mobile ad hoc networks, directly applying them poses a problem due to Bluetooth’s special baseband and MAC-layer features. In this work, we propose an attractive scatternet topology called BlueRing, which connects piconets as a ring interleaved by bridges between piconets, and address its formation, routing, and topology-maintenance protocols. The BlueRing architecture enjoys the following fine features. First, routing on BlueRing is stateless in the sense that no routing information needs to be kept by any host once the ring is formed. This would be favorable for environments such as Smart Homes where computing capability is limited. Second, the architecture is scalable to median-size scatternets easily (e.g. around 50 3⁄4 70 Bluetooth units). In comparison, most staror treelike scatternet topologies can easily form a communication bottleneck at the root of the tree as the network enlarges. Third, maintaining a BlueRing is an easy job even as some Bluetooth units join or leave the network. To tolerate single-point failure, we propose a protocol-level remedy mechanism. To tolerate multipoint failure, we propose a recovery mechanism to reconnect the BlueRing. Graceful failure is tolerable as long as no two or more critical points fail at the same time.

In this paper, we propose a service discovery protocol with maximal area disjoint path (SDMAD) for mobile ad hoc networks. The goal of SDMAD is to exploit multiple servers simultaneously and do parallel delivery. One key feature of SDMAD is that there is no contention between the multiple paths discovered by it. Moreover, SDMAD considers service discovery and routing jointly to reduce control overhead. Extensive simulations show that with SDMAD the performance of service delivery is greatly improved over that with other service discovery protocols.	hoc (programming language);maximal set;service discovery	Shihong Zou;Le Tian;Shiduan Cheng;Yu Lin	2005		10.1007/11561354_29	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;best-effort delivery;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;service discovery;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-3.3129147511353674	76.73941988434005	98594

This has been a strong motivation to examine and develop methods and techniques to find routing paths efficiently and to provide effective multimedia communication. This thesis is mainly concerned with designing, implementing and adapting intelligent algorithms to solve the computational complexity of network routing problems and testing the performance of intelligent algorithms’ applications. It also introduces hybrid algorithms which are developed by using the similarities of genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) intelligent systems algorithms. Furthermore, it examines the design of a new encoding/decoding method to offer a solution for the problem of unachievable multimedia information in multimedia multicast networks. The techniques presented and developed within the thesis aim to provide maximum utilization of network resources for handling communication problems.#R##N#This thesis first proposes GA and PSO implementations which are adapted to solve the single and multi-objective functions in network routing problems. To offer solutions for network routing problems, binary variable-length and priority based encoding methods are used in intelligent algorithms to construct valid paths or potential solutions. The performance of generation operators in GA and PSO is examined and analyzed by solving the various shortest path routing problems and it is shown that the performance of algorithms varies based on the operators selected. Moreover, a hybrid algorithm is developed based on the lack of search capability of intelligent algorithms and implemented to solve the single objective function. The proposed method uses a strategy of sharing information between GA and PSO to achieve significant performance enhancement to solve routing optimization problems. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the hybrid algorithm by optimizing the shortest path routing problem. Furthermore, intelligent algorithms are implemented to solve a multi-objective function which involves more constraints of resources in communication networks. The algorithms are adapted to find the multi-optimal paths to provide effective multimedia communication in lossy networks. The simulation results verify that the implemented algorithms are shown as efficient and accurate methods to solve the multi-objective function and find multi-optimal paths to deliver multimedia packets in lossy networks.#R##N#Furthermore, the thesis proposes a new encoding/decoding method to maximize throughput in multimedia multicast networks. The proposed method is combined with two most used Multiple Description Coding (MDC) methods. The utilization of the proposed method is discussed by comparing two the MDC methods.#R##N#Through analyzing the simulation results using these intelligent systems algorithms, it has been shown that feasible solutions can be obtained by optimizing complex network problems. Moreover, the methods proposed and developed, which are hybrid algorithms and the encoding/decoding method also demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness as compared with other techniques.	mathematical optimization;quality of service;routing;telecommunications network	Huseyin Kusetogullari	2012			routing;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;distributed computing	EDA	-2.8456735233899093	81.08856653063162	98769

The sensed data must be gathered and transmitted to a base station for further processing to meet the end-user queries. Since the network consists of low-cost nodes with limited battery power, it is a challenging task to design an efficient routing scheme that can collect massive data and offer good performance in energy efficiency, and long network lifetimes. Grid structure was proposed for energy efficient data routing. Instead of propagating query messages from sink to all sensors to set up data forwarding information, the grid structure uses only sensors located at the grid points needed to acquire the forwarding information. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient routing technique, called Steiner Trees Grid Routing (STGR) protocol, to improve the performance of previous grid routing protocols. Simulation results show that STGR achieves a better solution in data delivery and therefore ensures more energy efficient of data transmission in wireless sensor networks.	operand forwarding;routing;sensor;simulation;steiner tree problem	Chiu-Kuo Liang;Chih-Hsuan Lee;Jian-Da Lin	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Information Security	10.1109/WCINS.2010.5544132	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;steiner tree problem;computer science;dynamic source routing;base station;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;distributed computing;efficient energy use;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	9.522475528069245	77.54824541502076	99118

8c6eb9ac48cc80f244692fbbf4165091ac71b5c3	smoggy-link: fingerprinting interference for predictable wireless concurrency		Operating in unlicensed ISM bands, ZigBee devices often yield poor throughput and packet reception ratio due to the interference from ever increasing wireless devices in 2.4 GHz band. Although there have been many efforts made for interference avoidance, they come at the cost of miscellaneous overhead, which oppositely hurts channel utilization. Our empirical results show that, a specific interference is likely to have different influence on different outbound links of a ZigBee sender, which indicates the chance of concurrent transmissions. Based on this insight, we propose Smoggy-Link, a practical protocol to exploit the potential concurrency for adaptive ZigBee transmissions under harsh interference. Smoggy-Link maintains an accurate link model to describe and trace the relationship between interference and link quality of the sender's outbound links. With such a link model, Smoggy-Link can obtain fine-grained spatiotemporal link information through a low-cost interference identification method. The link information is further utilized for adaptive link selection and intelligent transmission schedule. We implement and evaluate a prototype of our approach with TinyOS and TelosB motes. The evaluation results show that Smoggy-Link has consistent improvements in both throughput and packet reception ratio under interference from various interferer.	acknowledgement (data networks);concurrency (computer science);hyperlink;interference (communication);network packet;overhead (computing);prototype;radio fingerprinting;throughput;tinyos	Meng Jin;Yuan He;Xiaolong Zheng;Dingyi Fang;Dan Xu;Tianzhang Xing;Xiaojiang Chen	2016	2016 IEEE 24th International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	10.1109/ICNP.2016.7784420	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	9.263586722136164	87.87480640868175	99578

This paper presents a dependable and pragmatic trust and reputation aware geographic routing (TARA-GR) method for mobile WANETs to achieve self-adaptability, scalability, lightweight communication, and efficiency. It supports the GR decisions by the dynamic computation of consolidated trust value (CTV) of each node in the network by integrating direct and indirect trust values. With the calculated trust value, each source or forwarding node selects the trusted nodes to route the packets from the source to the destination. TARA-GR is integrated with a well known greedy perimetre stateless routing (GPSR) protocol. This integration is termed as TARA-GPSR. The simulation results have shown that TARA-GPSR significantly improved the network performance metrics, such as packet delivery fraction, throughput, and energy consumption.	geographic routing;hoc (programming language)	P.

0be2778f29559b9e8e0af2684acd680a17e473fc	a cellular data dissemination model for wireless sensor networks		Abstract In a wireless sensor network, the use of mobile sink brings new challenges to these networks. The advertisement of the mobile sink position to the sensor nodes is one of these challenges that is a core problem for any routing protocol. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol based on virtual cellular infrastructure. The proposed protocol uses virtual infrastructure in a different way from the previous protocols. The proposed protocol instead of saving and updating the sink position in the infrastructure, which causes more energy consumption, uses the infrastructure and the properties of the cells to create a routing between cluster heads. Therefore, there is no need to save and update the sink position in all or some of the nodes in the network. We perform extensive simulations on the proposed schemes and the results are compared with the existing algorithms to demonstrate their superiority in terms of various performance metrics.

Although both protocols are based on the same algorithmic foundations for computing best paths across large networks, they made different choices at various aspects in the protocol designs. We selected ten major design differences between the two to understand the reasoning behind their choices. We hope that this comparative study helps shed new light on the design space of link-state routing protocols and prove useful to future routing protocol design efforts.	canonical account;capability maturity model;communications protocol;future internet;link-state routing protocol;network architecture;router (computing);shortest path problem	Yu M.

Traditionally, sensors are deployed for sensing and transmitting data to Base Station BS for further data processing in cities. However, instead of sensor independently allocated, we apply the existing transportation infrastructure - Bus-based Ad hoc Network BANETs to assist the sensing and transmission of the WSNs. A novel hybrid scheme is derived to this hybrid network. Then we utilize the practical simulator ONE [1] to analyse our scheme and simulation indicates that the scheme can significantly reduce the number of sensors to be deployed, and the information collected from the city could reach the BS within a fixed time.

Wireless sensor networks have been applied to various businesses and industries since the last decade. Most sensors have the ability of communication and the requirement of low power consumption. 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) plays an important role in this convergence of heterogeneous technologies, which allows sensors to transmit information using IPv6 stack. Sensors perform critical tasks and become targets of attacks. Wormhole attack is one of the most common attacks to sensor networks, threatening the network availability by dropping data or disturbing routing paths. RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) is a standard routing protocol commonly used in sensor networks. This study proposes a RPL-based wormhole detection mechanism.

03a0af480afe0212bb9c35fb4fb0c77a48ace795	a hierarchical routing protocols for self-organizing networks		Recently studies and technological developments are being actively carried out on applying sensor networks using low-cost, low-power wireless sensors to USNs. Wireless sensor networks are changing from static network environments to active networks capable of generating various environments and rapid transformations, and in such environments the ability to collect and deliver data between sensor nodes is very important. Therefore, an autonomous, efficient network must be designed to link the sensor nodes together. It suggests strained routing protocols that can efficiently self-organized in the event of changes in sensor networks due to node obstruction and environmental factors, and proved their practicality and efficiency. The research also measured energy consumption per node and showed reduction of energy use of 68.1% for GTR, 65.6% for ComHRP, and 4.4% for CTR, and a comparison of average Hops by node according to route establishment between all nodes evidenced a 21.44% efficiency rate.	organizing (structure);routing	Hoon Kwon;Ho-Young Kwak;Sang Joon Lee;Sung-Joon Lee	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30507-8_6	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Theory	7.279382961100777	77.93668806294076	99840

These devices (network nodes) typically act as the network infrastructure to forward data to other nodes from a source to the destination. However, several constraints (e.g., processor, energy consumption, and bandwidth) affect the overall network performance. Cooperation strategies have been considered as a solution to such network limitations and constraints. Recent studies have presented cooperation mechanisms as a solution to unstable network infrastructures where mobile nodes cooperate with each other, forwarding data and performing all the networking functionalities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state of the art on cooperation strategies and algorithms for mobile ad hoc networks and delay-tolerant networks. These challenged networks frequently comprise situations where traditional Internet protocols fail to effectively provide desired or expected communication. This paper focuses on cooperation incentive-based approaches for network architectures that support mobile devices and are challenged by mobility constraints such as battery and storage capacity, broadcast constraints, interferences, disconnections, noises, limited bandwidths, and network delays. The surveyed approaches' merits and weaknesses are discussed, and open issues are identified. Finally, conclusions are detailed.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);control theory;game theory;hoc (programming language);internet protocol suite;mobile device;network architecture;network performance	Bruno M.

The guaranteed link bandwidths are necessary to provide deterministic end-to-end bandwidth guarantees. Using Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), links are assigned slots in each frame and during each slot a number of non-conflicting links can transmit simultaneously. The bandwidth of each link is given by the number of slots assigned to it the frame and the modulation used in the slots. Our scheduling algorithm has two parts. The first part of the algorithm is an iterative procedure that finds locally feasible schedules by exchanging link scheduling information between nodes. The iterative procedure is based on the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm running on the conflict graph, whose partial view is available at every node. The second part of the algorithm is a wave based termination procedure used to detect when all nodes are locally scheduled and a new schedule should be activated. We use analysis to show the worst case convergence time of the algorithm and simulations to show performance of the algorithm in practice.	bellman–ford algorithm;best, worst and average case;centralized computing;end-to-end encryption;hoc (programming language);iterative method;mesh networking;modulation;provisioning;scheduling (computing);serializability;simulation;slot a	Petar Djukic;Shahrokh Valaee	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.630	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;computer science;graph theory;mesh networking;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Embedded	-4.095074859880251	83.14931255385835	99910

Based on the application scenario, the reliability of the nodes deployed has become more important for trust management evaluation. At the same time, trust management system should not be power killing, complex in terms of computation and processing capability. To convey a noticeable framework, we propose Collaborative Trust based Secure Routing protocol (CTSR) for observing direct and indirect trust values. Here we utilize two-way acknowledgementbased trust framework (2-ACKT) which requires lesser memory resources and minimizes the communication overhead. Our simulation setup for Mobile Adhoc Networks with 2-ACKT framework calculates trust value with both direct and indirect observations based on Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of uncertain reasoning approach respectively. Since the inception of DST for indirect observation in wireless networks trust values are effectively derived with data packets and control packets. The capability of DST to solve the problems with different reliability has flaws in certain areas where the nodes were subjected to disclose critical information like residual energy level and available bandwidth. And also common results derived from DST may lead to uncertain decisions. Considering all these factors we make few notable modifications in DST to enhance the security feature in 2-ACT.	computation;energy level;hoc (programming language);mike lesser;network packet;overhead (computing);routing;simulation;trust management (information system)	S.

Pak 1 Part of this paper was presented at IEEE PIMRC’09 Although various medium access control (MAC) and routing protocols have been designed for WSNs (wireless sensor networks) to extend the network lifetime, their performances are significantly aggravated under extremely low duty cycled environments because they are optimized for low duty cycles, i.e., 0.1–10%. In this paper, we propose a new centralized routing protocol with multi-hop wakeup time estimation to maximize the network lifetime of WSNs under ultra low duty cycles. It does not use packet flooding for route recovery and solves the high energy consumption problem caused by each node’s clock drift. It achieves a very long network lifetime regardless of the node density because the number of control messages does not increase with the node density. The sink node in the proposed protocol collects the clock drift information from each node and calculates the wakeup time of each node using the multi-hop wakeup time estimation. We investigate the performance of the proposed routing protocol through extensive simulations, and show that it extends the network lifetime over ten times compared to the other combinations of existing routing and MAC protocols, when it runs on the top of W-MAC designed for ultra low duty cycled environments. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

9b6f9284a0f30467a48db757d0f1fec88926632f	static vs. mobile sink: the influence of basic parameters on energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks	energy efficiency;health research;uk clinical guidelines;biological patents;sink mobility;europe pubmed central;citation search;duty cycles;uk phd theses thesis;life sciences;congestion;uk research reports;medical journals;wireless sensor networks;europe pmc;biomedical research;bioinformatics	Over the last decade a large number of routing protocols has been designed for achieving energy efficiency in data collecting wireless sensor networks. The drawbacks of using a static sink are well known. It has been argued in the literature that a mobile sink may improve the energy dissipation compared to a static one. Some authors focus on minimizing Emax, the maximum energy dissipation of any single node in the network, while others aim at minimizing Ebar, the average energy dissipation over all nodes. In our paper we take a more holistic view, considering both Emax and Ebar. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a simulation-based analysis of the energy efficiency of WSNs with static and mobile sinks. The focus is on two important configuration parameters: mobility path of the sink and duty cycling value of the nodes. On the one hand, it is well known that in the case of a mobile sink with fixed trajectory the choice of the mobility path influences energy efficiency. On the other hand, in some types of applications sensor nodes spend a rather large fraction of their total lifetime in idle mode, and therefore higher energy efficiency can be achieved by using the concept of reduced duty cycles. In particular, we quantitatively analyze the influence of duty cycling and the mobility radius of the sink as well as their interrelationship in terms of energy consumption for a well-defined model scenario. The analysis starts from general load considerations and is refined into a geometrical model. This model is validated by simulations which are more realistic in terms of duty cycling than previous work. It is illustrated that over all possible configuration scenarios in terms of duty cycle and mobility radius of the sink the energy dissipation in the WSN can vary up to a factor of nine in terms of Emax and up to a factor of 17 in terms of Ebar. It turns out that in general the choice of the duty cycle value is more important for achieving energy efficiency than the choice of the mobility radius of the sink. Moreover, for small values of the duty cycle, a static sink turns out to be optimal in terms of both Emax and Ebar. For larger values of the duty cycle, a mobile sink has advantages over a static sink, especially in terms of Emax. These insights into the basic interrelationship between duty cycle value and mobility radius of a mobile sink are relevant for energy efficient operation of homogeneous WSNs beyond our model scenario.	beds;bone structure of radius;complement system proteins;duty cycle;elegant degradation;experiment;holism;large;network congestion;node - plant part;protocols documentation;routing;simulation;throughput;waisman syndrome	Majid I.

However, the successor candidate set (SCS) is different every time the relative location of the relay node to the destination changes. The configuration in the entire network, when all succeeding paths from a relay node are blocked by localminima, is irregular and its concern region cannot be determined unless the routing actually initiates. In the real deployment environment of the wireless ad hoc networks, the link quality also changes dynamically. This brings a challenge for the local decision of the greedy advance to precisely adjust its SCS for the flip-flop of link quality that blocks the nondetour path ahead. This paper introduces a new information model to a non-detour routing, also called progressive routing, under the impact of dynamic blocks. As a result, each 1-hop advance, by sacrificing little routing flexibility, can avoid those unsafe situations and remains on a non-detour path. In ourmodel, each node prepares the information in a proactive mode, but can use it for all different paths passing through, saving the cost and delay in the reactive mode. We focus on an ‘‘everyone’’ model, in which each node will apply the same generic process in a fully distributed manner, in order to achieve a scalable and reliable solution. In detail, we discuss how in a sample realistic environment the pattern of SCS can be interpreted in a single safety descriptor ∈ [0, 1] at each node. It indicates the maximum probability of a successful non-detour path from this node to the edge of networks. The larger value the more likely the non-detour routing will be successful and themore stable the path will be. We illustrate the effectiveness of this indirect reference information in the corresponding routing in terms of the success of non-detour path constitution and the ability of self-adjustment for dynamics in the networks, while the cost of information construction and update propagation is minimized. The results are compared with the best results known to date. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

0b493536f28dbb268ef27a4f0b796668dc3fe6e7	an on demand interference aware routing protocol for vanets	vanet;802 11p;wave;dsrc;multi channel routing;interference aware routing;sir	Vehicular communication systems represent one of the most desirable technologies when the safety, efficiency and comfort of everyday road travel need to be improved. The main advantage is the absence of an infrastructure, typical of centralized networks, that makes them adequate for highly-variable network topologies. On the other hand, communication protocols become very complex and, sometimes, signaling overhead may waste bandwidth availability. Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) are able to provide a wireless networking capability in situations where no fixed infrastructure exists: communication performance and Quality of Service (QoS) strongly depend on how the routing takes place in the network, on how protocol overhead affects the available bandwidth and on how different channels are selected in order to minimize interference levels. Attention is focused on the routing level of VANET and we propose an interference aware routing scheme for multi-radio vehicular networks, wherein each node is equipped with a multichannel radio interface. In order to relieve the effects of the co-channel interference perceived by mobile nodes, transmission channels are switched on the basis of a periodical Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) evaluation. A new metric is also proposed, based on the maximization of the average SIR level of the connection between source and destination. Our solution has been integrated with the AdHoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol to design an enhanced Signal-to-Interference-Ratio-AODV (SIR-AODV). NS-2 has been used for implementing and testing the proposed idea, and significant performance enhancements were obtained, in terms of throughput, packet delivery and, obviously, interference.

Central to both approaches are the allocation of scarce resources between the various users of a network and the importance of discovering distributed mechanisms that work well. The specific setting of our study is ad-hoc networks where a game-theoretic approach is particularly appealing. We discuss the underlying motivation for the primal and dual algorithms that assign routes and flows within the network and coordinate resource usage between the users. Important features of this study are the stochastic nature of the traffic pattern offered to the network and the use of a dynamic scheme to vary a user’s ability to send traffic. We briefly review coalition games defined by a characteristic function and the crucial notion of the Shapley value to allocate resources between players. We present a series of experiments with several test networks that illustrate how a distributed scheme of flow control and routing can in practice be aligned with the Shapley values which capture the influence or market power of individual users within the network.	characteristic function (convex analysis);display resolution;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;flow control (data);game theory;hoc (programming language);information science;routing;stable marriage problem	Richard J.

e5b1ba6a7c5a06d2d615cd8be10203a66476ff3e	performance study of inter-vehicle information dissemination using long range wireless system for assisting congestion resolution at sags		Sags are road sections where gradient slowly changes from downslope to upslope, being mainly found in expressways. It has been observed that some drivers are not aware of speed decrease due to grade resistance at sags, and as a result congestion occurs. For velocity control to mitigate the congestion, the theory of Jam Absorption Driving (JAD) has been attracting attentions which encourages vehicles running behind the congested platoon to reduce their speed and to delay arrival to the platoon. The authors have presented velocity control system that utilizes inter-vehicle communication with long range wireless system such as 700MHz ARIB-T109 for quickly sharing congestion information among cars and leads cars approaching the congested platoon to perform JAD. This paper evaluates the proposed scheme by focusing the effect on the communication range of wireless system on the congestion alleviation performance. The simulation results show that using communication range of 1km has substantially reduce the travel time of the vehicles compared to using small communication range such as 300m and information is relayed among cars with multihop broadcast. Also, this configuration is effective for the case where only low ratio of vehicles are equipped with communication systems. The findings of the paper show that the proposed scheme is beneficial to improve traffic flow at sags.	control system;gradient;jad;jam;network congestion;propagation delay;simulation;software propagation;velocity (software development)	Takuya Watanabe;Hiroaki Morino	2017	2017 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2017.8275626	communications system;computer network;computer science;traffic flow;wireless;control system;platoon;traffic congestion;information dissemination;broadcasting	Mobile	5.052872587911665	87.93817552524888	100323

Each node in a MANET moves independently in any direction, thus the network’s topology change rapidly in an unpredictable manner. Wireless nodes try to communicate to the destination using the intermediate nodes. In such situation, MANET is vulnerable to both internal and external attacks caused by malicious nodes present in the network. In this paper we implement an approach based upon trust to provide security to ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) protocol, which helps AODV to detect the compromised nodes. This proposed approach is able to detect the compromised nodes and isolates it from the network. The reliability of the trusted AODV routing protocol is evaluated by implementing black hole attack and the performance is calculated in terms of metrics like packet delivery ratio, throughput and average packet drop.

Our main goal is to compare the applicationlevel performance of fully distributed and centralized data dissemination approaches in the context of traffic advisory systems. Vehicular networks are emerging as a new distributed system environment with myriad promising applications. Wirelesslyconnected, GPS-equipped vehicles can be used, for instance, as probes for traffic advisory or pavement condition information services with significant improvements in cost, coverage and accuracy. There is an ongoing discussion on the pros and cons of alternative approaches to data distribution for these applications. Proposed centralized, or infrastructure-based, models rely on road-side equipment to upload information to a central location for later use. Distributed approaches take advantage of the direct exchanges between participating vehicles to achieve higher scalability at the potential cost of data consistency. While distributed solutions can significantly reduce infrastructures’ deployment and maintenance costs, it is unclear what the impact of “imprecise” information is to an application or what level of adoption is needed for this model to be effective. This paper investigates the inherent trade-offs in the adoption of distributed or centralized approaches to a traffic advisory service, a commonly proposed application. We based our analysis on a measurements study of signal propagation in urban settings and an extensive simulation-based experimentation in the Chicago road network.	centralized computing;distributed computing;environment variable;global positioning system;penetration test;scalability;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;traffic collision avoidance system;upload	John S.

Moreover, environmental holes (e.g., physical obstacle or area without the functionality of communication) significantly cause a low packet delivery ratio. This paper proposes a simple hole-resistant technique, called SHORT, to achieve reliable geocasting in location-free wireless sensor networks (LF-WSNs). Sensor nodes in LF-WSNs are recognized by their direction and hop distance. The proposed SHORT aims to select appropriate candidate forwarders to relay received geocast packets using a forwarding probability, which is derived from nodes' direction and hop distance. With the aid of multiple forwarders, SHORT can efficiently resist environmental holes. Simulation results validate that the proposed SHORT outperforms the simple direction-based forwarding scheme in packet delivery ratio under LF-WSNs with environmental holes.	geocast;most bus;network packet;relay;sensor;simulation	Sheng-Shih Wang;Hui-Mei Yang;Pei-Chun Huang	2011	2011 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks	10.1109/MSN.2011.70	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;packet forwarding;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	4.705703123809223	82.35635742206058	100543

The communicating agent must quickly adapt to changes in the network in order to maintain optimal performance. This adaptive element is an extremely difficult component to construct as the highly dynamic environment in which the protocol operates is difficult to predict. Our work attempts to automate the design process by converting it from a design problem to one of optimisation, in which genetic algorithms are used to search the space of possible protocol designs in an attempt to find the optimal solution. We present results from experiments in which we have evolved alternating bit protocols and also windowed flow control protocols, which have high channel utilisation.

The communication pattern between sensor nodes and their associated base station is exploited in building an efficient network structure prior to network deployment. Such an approach is feasible for sensor networks whose installation and layout can be planned ahead of time, as is possible in many sensor network applications including intrusion detection, powerline monitoring and indoor monitoring. Since sensor nodes expand energy for relaying packets, we consider the question of placement of nodes in the typical line network topology to reduce the packet forwarding load on sensor nodes closer to the base station. Similar to scheduling problems in other domains, we also exploit the problem structure to find the periods for each sensor node to keep its radio active. The novelty of our problem formulation is that it jointly determines geometric layout and idlelistening times for line topologies. We also explain how the line solution can be used as a primitive in design of networks for the coverage of two dimensional regions. Simulation results show that such a joint design approach yields significant improvements in network lifetime as compared to the conventional network design method using uniform node distribution.	approximation algorithm;data compression;data retrieval;distributed source coding;intrusion detection system;mahdiyar;network packet;network planning and design;network topology;pipeline (computing);scheduling (computing);sensor node;simulation;software deployment	Rahul Simha;Hidayet Ozgur Sanli	2005			intelligent computer network;computer science;computer network;distributed computing;wireless network;wireless sensor network;packet forwarding;network topology;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;sensor node;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	6.476772191810614	77.32225910324746	100646

These devices use communication technologies which often support the formation of wireless multihop topologies. Therefore, end-to-end data transfer involves the collaboration of multiple protocol layers. However, the settings and mechanisms used in a specific layer affect performance of the others. In this paper, we assess a set of crucial network design criteria for potential MAC layer, network layer and transport layer protocols for networks of constrained devices. We evaluate the default and alternative settings and mechanisms for these protocols on a 60-node testbed. The experiments show how performance can be improved significantly by using different settings and mechanisms from the default ones.	communications protocol;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;experiment;goodput;internet of things;network planning and design;synergetics (haken);testbed;transport layer security	August Betzler;Carles Gomez;Ilker Demirkol;Josep Paradells Aspas	2012	2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)			Mobile	-0.16422169075178744	86.76601388252061	100955
fb082f8f4664f75dc142d31a38be2e0eda915629	a communication method for wireless mesh networks suitable to iot communication environment		Recently, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) are widespread as extension technology of Wireless LAN (WLAN) area. WMN can provide low cost and wide area WLAN by connecting Access Points (AP) of WLAN to mesh shape. Meanwhile, a research of Internet of Things (IoT) is doing actively. The IoT is a technology which connects various things to the Internet, and collects and analyzes information of the things or controls the things. In order to realize IoT, the communication environments to the Internet have to prepare. So, it is considered to provide the communication environment widely by using WMN. However, what is worried in case of assuming IoT is an increase in network traffic. This becomes a cause of degrade of network performance. In this paper, we propose a packet integration method and a route reconstruction method to avoid degradation of network performance with increasing network traffic. In packet integration method, by dynamically deciding a waiting time for the packet integration, the packet integration is performed efficiently, and increasing of network traffic is suppressed. In the route reconstruction method, a destination node monitors a packet delay and throughput, and if the route characteristic becomes bad, the route is reconstructed. The simulation results showed that the proposed method has better performance than the conventional method.	mesh networking;wireless mesh network	Kyohei Kishi;Hiroyuki Suzuki;Akio Koyama	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-61566-0_11	the internet;throughput;computer network;distributed computing;wired communication;computer science;network performance;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wireless mesh network;network packet;order one network protocol	Robotics	7.7117015295992495	84.77688511813828	100962

However, WSN's independent and un-attended usages, which are generally supposed to be advantages, also limit its power supply and life expectancy. As a result, energy efficiency is a critical issue for any WSN implementation. In-network processing (a process of data local convergence and aggregation) which intends to minify data volume locally can greatly reduce the energy consumption of data delivery over long distance to the sink. However, open problems are still remain, such as, how to carry out in-network processing, and how to combine routing scheme to the sink (corresponding to the long distance delivery) with in-network processing. For any WSN application, a pre-assumption is vital that there must be a physical signal field (e.g. a field of sensing signal) that bridge physical event to sensors, otherwise WSN can not work. Moreover, the physical signal field can be used for data local convergence. Our proposed algorithm exploits the gradient direction of the physical signal field. Along the gradient direction of the physical signal field, sensory data at sensors will also converge to local extremes of the physical signal field. In addition, this routing scheme for in-network process requires zero overhead, because the physical signal field exists naturally. The proposed schemes are simple to be implemented, and details of the implementation are discussed. Simulation shows that the schemes are robust, adaptable, and reliable to variation of physical events.	data aggregation;routing	Xiwei Zhao;S.

Receiving nodes list all known neighbor nodes with their position in the neighbor table and remove entries after they have failed to receive a beacon for a certain time from the corresponding node. In highly dynamic networks, the information stored in the neighbor table is often outdated and does no longer reflect the actual topology of the network causing retransmissions and rerouting that consume bandwidth and increase latency. An analysis on the possible impact of beacons due outdated and inaccurate neighbor tables is needed. We quantify by analytical and simulation means the possible performance loss and explore the limitations of position-based routing protocols which use beaconing. In highly mobile ad-hoc networks, the delay can increase by a factor of 20. The neighbor table inaccuracy is the main source of packet loss in uncongested networks. We propose and evaluate several concrete mechanisms to improve the accuracy of neighborhood information, e.g., by dynamic adaptation of the timer values when beacons are broadcasted, and show their effectiveness by extensive simulation.	apollonian network;carpal tunnel syndrome;computer science;geographic routing;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;hoc (programming language);network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);rs-232;simulation;sparse matrix;table (database);timer;transmission (bittorrent client);unreachable memory	Marc Heissenbüttel;Torsten Braun;Markus Wälchli;Thomas Bernoulli	2007	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2006.03.002	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;packet loss;mobile computing;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	3.2076549592362347	83.1227482510441	101031

7a3f2fc50d5898820e9b423e775d82fc46b3ab02	an efficient cluster-based communication protocol for wireless sensor networks	energy efficiency;clustering protocol;sensor networks	A wireless sensor network is a network of large numbers of sensor nodes, where each sensor node is a tiny device that is equipped with a processing, sensing subsystem and a communication subsystem. The critical issue in wireless sensor networks is how to gather sensed data in an energy-efficient way, so that the network lifetime can be extended. The design of protocols for such wireless sensor networks has to be energy-aware in order to extend the lifetime of the network because it is difficult to recharge sensor node batteries. We propose a protocol to form clusters, select cluster heads, select cluster senders and determine appropriate routings in order to reduce overall energy consumption and enhance the network lifetime. Our clustering protocol is called an Efficient Cluster-Based Communication Protocol (ECOMP) for Wireless Sensor Networks. In ECOMP, each sensor node consumes a small amount of transmitting energy in order to reach the neighbour sensor node in the bidirectional ring, and the cluster heads do not need to receive any sensed data from member nodes. The simulation results show that ECOMP significantly minimises energy consumption of sensor nodes and extends the network lifetime, compared with existing clustering protocol.	aggregate data;cluster analysis;communications protocol;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;overhead (computing);randomness;rechargeable battery;sensor node;simulation;transmitter;whole earth 'lectronic link	Fuad Bajaber;Irfan-Ullah Awan	2014	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-013-9794-y	embedded system;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	9.162059728705138	80.13544482671408	101215

For example, routing will not be properly evaluated when a simulation scenario with a low average hop count or a large degree of network partitioning is used. To ensure that a simulation scenario provides an effective platform for testing a MANET routing protocol, we recommend that researchers use two metrics to characterize their simulation scenarios: the average shortest-path hop count and the average amount of network partitioning. In this paper, we provide researchers with several models that take the desired values for these two metrics as inputs, and output the simulation area and number of nodes required to create a simulation scenario that meets the researcher's target values for these two metrics to a close approximation. In this way, we provide several models that researchers can use to construct simulation scenarios that meet their standards in the evaluation of a MANET routing protocol.	approximation;link-state routing protocol;network partition;shortest path problem;simulation	Stuart Kurkowski;William Navidi;Tracy Camp	2007	2007 IEEE Internatonal Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428640	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;metrics;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.4655393342411231	85.03732807737575	101291

By shifting data compression into a dedicated layer,only minor modifications to applications are required, while efficient data transfer between nodes is provided. As a proof-of-conc ept, we implement a stream-based compression algorithm on senso r nodes and perform an experimental analysis to determine the potential gains under realistic traffic conditions. Results indicate that our presented lossless stream-oriented payload compr ession leads to considerable savings.	algorithm;data compression;lossless compression;network packet;transceiver	Andreas Reinhardt;Matthias Hollick;Ralf Steinmetz	2009	2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks	10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168975	data compression;embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	9.053805949493908	84.50460321775901	101414

In particular, we consider the cache placement problem where the goal is to determine a set of nodes in the network to cache/store the given data item, such that the overall communication cost incurred in accessing the item is minimized, under the constraint that the total communication cost in updating the selected caches is less than a given constant. In our network model, there is a single server (containing the original copy of the data item) and multiple client nodes (that wish to access the data item). For various settings of the problem, we design optimal, near-optimal, heuristic-based, and distributed algorithms, and evaluate their performance through simulations on randomly generated sensor networks.	approximation algorithm;centralized computing;data item;distributed algorithm;dynamic programming;heuristic;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network model;optimization problem;polynomial;procedural generation;server (computing);simulation;time complexity;topological graph theory;tree network	Bin Tang;Himanshu Gupta	2007	J.

Four routing algorithms are suggested and evaluated for a broad¬casting scenario. Simulation results show that the best algorithm reduces the energy consumption by up to 42% in comparison to non-SFN multihop routing for the same node reachability. SFN-based multihop routing improves the reachability by up to 37 percentage points as compared to non-SFN routing. A 3.8 dB diversity gain is observed that allows a 54% higher data rate for the same bit error probability. By restricting the SFN sizes to a maximum number of nodes, the energy efficiency may be improved while the reachability is deteriorated.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel (communications);decibel;profiling (computer programming);reachability;routing;simulation;single-frequency network;uncompressed video	Magnus Eriksson;Arif Mahmud	2010	2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2010.95	wireless routing protocol;routing;static routing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	5.334499414644596	84.3454110079638	101517

We are creating the VANET by using the methods of MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network) and applying them onto the vehicular domain. The sensors which are attached to the vehicles help in sharing the information among the vehicles or with the roadside infrastructure. As the topology in vehicular network is more dynamic, creation of a stable cluster is a major issue. In this paper we are selecting the best clustering technique and solving the major issues in forming the cluster from the available clustering methods like velocity-based, Connectivity-based and the Neighbor-Vehicles mobility based clustering.	algorithm;cluster analysis;hoc (programming language);sensor;velocity (software development)	Sudev Yaswanth Kannekanti;Gowri S.

In such communication scenario, however, new challenges in data transmission and energy-efficiency have arisen due to the stringent requirements of those sensor networks. Generally, congested nodes may deplete the energy of the active congested paths toward the sink and incur in undesired communication delay and packet dropping, while bit errors during transmission may negatively impact the end-to-end quality of the received data. Many approaches have been proposed to face congestion and provide reliable communications in wireless sensor networks, usually employing some transport protocol that address one or both of these issues. Nevertheless, due to the unique characteristics of multimedia-based wireless sensor networks, notably minimum bandwidth demand, bounded delay and reduced energy consumption requirement, communication protocols from traditional scalar wireless sensor networks are not suitable for multimedia sensor networks. In the last decade, such requirements have fostered research in adapting existing protocols or proposing new protocols from scratch. We survey the state of the art of transport protocols for wireless multimedia sensor networks, addressing the recent developments and proposed strategies for congestion control and loss recovery. Future research directions are also discussed, outlining the remaining challenges and promising investigation areas.	delay-gradient congestion control;download;end-to-end encryption;network congestion;network packet;reliability (computer networking);requirement	Daniel G.

Recently, such problems are showing their usefulness to communication networks, where facilities could be servers or routers offering connectivity services to clients. In this paper, we deal with the effect of mutation and crossover operators in GA for node placement problem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system using different selection operators and different distributions of router nodes considering number of covered users parameter. The simulation results show that for Linear and Exponential ranking methods, the system has a good performance for all rates of crossover and mutation.

2f212591f837037d3a36c9a08c827567249162b7	vipmesh: a virtual prototyping framework for ieee 802.11s wireless mesh networks	protocols;virtualization;wireless communication;computational modeling;linux;wireless lan;ieee 802 11 standard	WLAN mesh networks are characterized by their flexible and low-cost deployment, scalability, and self-healing capabilities. The new WLAN standard IEEE 802.11s introduces low-level mesh interoperability. However, building large-scale real-world test beds and reproducible setups is challenging and costly. In the majority of research works, network simulation is preferred over practical measurements. Here, the main disadvantage exists in simplified device and protocol models restricting the comparability to practical implementations. In contrast, using device emulation still requires the simulation of wireless channel and environment models. Consequently, a combination of both emulation and simulation is needed to enable virtual prototyping of real applications and protocols in WLAN mesh networks. Nevertheless, the computation of complex wireless channel effects requires a decoupling of wall clock and simulation time. Therefore, we present ViPMesh, a virtual prototyping framework for IEEE 802.11s and its Linux reference implementation. ViPMesh relies on WLAN device emulation and nested virtualization using QEMU and Linux containers to support the analysis of real applications on top of an unmodified protocol stack. Adopting an alternative time source approach for QEMU, ViPMesh acts as discrete-event simulator. It further integrates channel and environment models with support for IEEE 802.11n MIMO techniques, high throughput modes, multi-channel operation, and node mobility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that combines the IEEE 802.11s reference implementation with the described simulation features. The functionality of ViPMesh is demonstrated in different example scenarios.	channel (communications);computation;coupling (computer programming);emulator;hardware virtualization;high- and low-level;interference (communication);interoperability;lxc;linux;mimo;mesh networking;modulation;protocol stack;reference implementation;scalability;simulation;software deployment;testbed;throughput;wireless mesh network	Michael Rethfeldt;Hannes Raddatz;Benjamin Beichler;Björn Konieczek;Dirk Timmermann;Christian Haubelt;Peter Danielis	2016	2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763263	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;embedded system;communications protocol;real-time computing;virtualization;ieee 802.1x;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;computer science;operating system;ieee 802.11h-2003;computational model;computer security;linux kernel;wireless;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Visualization	0.011415223327047471	88.17755334000282	101754

This special type of mobile ad hoc network is a popular topic of research. Owing to the specific features of VANETs, unique routing protocols are required for short-range, high-speed communication among nearby vehicles. In this study, we propose a new opportunistic routing scheme based on the timed bargaining game. In order to dynamically adapt to the current VANET situation, the proposed scheme effectively formulates the opportunistic routing mechanism as an iterative bargaining model with a timed learning approach. Based on a simulation study, it is confirmed that the proposed scheme can achieve better performance than other existing schemes in diverse VANET environments.		Sungwook Kim	2016	EURASIP J.

Maps aid responders in decision-making and show routes that lead evacuees to refuges. However, disasters can damage communication infrastructures, rendering Cloud-based mapping services inaccessible. Responders resort to paper maps, which are difficult to share and cannot recommend routes. In this study, we present a digital pedestrian map generation system for disasters. To realize the system, we addressed these challenges: (1) how to collect the required data and generate the map without Cloud-based computing resources, (2) how to share messages within the system without continuous, end-to-end networks, and (3) how to balance the load of map inference tasks. For (1), GPS traces are collected by responders exploring the area. Then, collected data are sent to Computing Nodes: commodity workstations that are deployed in the disaster area, for processing. For (2), the system establishes a Delay-Tolerant Network that uses Epidemic Routing to communicate across shorter-ranges and uses response vehicles as data ferries to communicate across longer-ranges. For (3), we propose a load balancing heuristic, which uses ferry route timetables and statistical information about the load of Computing Nodes to determine how to offload map inference tasks. We evaluate our system through experiments and simulations and show that it decreases the time needed to generate and deliver pieces of the map by approximately two hours in an extreme case with large quantities of data have to be processed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This index could be either a centralized spatial index or an in-network data structure that is distributed over the sensor nodes. Creation and maintenance of these index structures, to reflect the network dynamics due to sensor node mobility, may result in long query response time and low battery efficiency, thus limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose a maintenance-free, itinerary-based approach called density-aware itinerary KNN query processing (DIKNN). The DIKNN divides the search area into multiple cone-shape areas centered at the query point. It then performs a query dissemination and response collection itinerary in each of the cone-shape areas in parallel. The design of the DIKNN scheme also takes into account challenging issues such as the the dynamic adjustment of the search radius (in terms of number of hops) according to spatial irregularity or mobility of sensor nodes. The simulation results show that DIKNN yields substantially better performance and scalability over previous work, both as k increases and as the sensor node mobility increases. It outperforms the second runner with up to 50% saving in energy consumption and up to 40% reduction in query response time, while rendering the same level of query result accuracy.	centralized computing;data structure;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;network topology;response time (technology);scalability;sensor node;simulation;software propagation;spatial database;tree traversal	Shan-Hung Wu;Kun-Ta Chuang;Chung-Min Chen;Ming-Syan Chen	2007	2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering	10.1109/ICDE.2007.367891	database index;query optimization;wireless sensor network;data structure;computer science;network dynamics;data mining;database;programming language;mobile computing;world wide web;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;spatial database	DB	8.988252911756982	75.4069234668559	102433

The problem, referred to as the minimum cost single flow routing and scheduling (MC-SFRS) problem, deals with incremental update of transmission schedules necessitated by dynamic arrival of new flows and termination of existing flows during the operation of the network. In the problem, we are given a multi-hop WMN, a set of ongoing flows, a transmission schedule for the ongoing flows, a set of costs associated with links, and a new flow demand. All flows contend for using one of the available wireless channels. The problem asks for finding a non-bifurcated route with minimum cost along which the new flow can be scheduled without perturbing slot assignments in the given schedule, if such route exists. Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for solving the MC-SFRS problem for arbitrary interference relations among pairs of transmission links in networks with arbitrary topologies. Among other classes of routes, our algorithm is exact over the class of shortest routes. The obtained simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm over the competing method of exact scheduling for a fixed routing tree. In addition, the results show improvement obtained by using our algorithm to augment the schedules obtained by fixed tree routing.	algorithm;incremental backup;interference (communication);mesh networking;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;wireless mesh network	Abdullah-Al Mahmood;Ehab S.

Since the NP-hard minimum Steiner tree problem can be reduced to the DRWA-DC problem, it is very unlikely to derive optimal solutions in a reasonable time for the DRWA-DC problem. In this paper, we circumvent to apply a meta-heuristic based upon the ant colony optimization (ACO) approach to produce approximate solutions in a timely manner. In the literature, the ACO approach has been successfully applied to several well-known combinatorial optimization problems whose solutions might be in the form of paths on the associated graphs. The ACO algorithm proposed in this paper incorporates several new features so as to select wavelength links for which the communication cost and the transmission delay of routing the request can be minimized as much as possible subject to the specified delay bound. Computational experiments are designed and conducted to study the performance of the proposed algorithm. Comparing with the optimal solutions found by an ILP formulation, numerical results evince that the ACO algorithm is effective and robust in providing quality approximate solutions to the DRWA-DC problem. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These applications usually call for multi-hop data delivery from access points to moving vehicles with user specified delay requirements. However, most existing routing protocols for VANETs only focus on message forwarding from vehicles to access points or take no account of the delay constraint. In this paper, we focus on the development of a carry-and-forward scheme that delivers data from access points to vehicles. Utilizing the vehicle's trajectory obtained from the navigation system, we propose TaDB, a Trajectory-assisted Delay-Bounded Message Delivery Algorithm. To choose delivery route within delay constraint while minimizing transmission cost, TaDB uses a Cluster-Aware Link Delay Model to estimate link delay for both the Carry and the Forward strategies on each road segment. TaDB also leverages the vehicle's planned trajectory to estimate its future location. Simulation results show that TaDB can achieve a delivery ratio very close to optimal.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);requirement;routing;simulation;wireless access point	Xiaojun Feng;Jin Zhang;Qian Zhang	2011	2011 IEEE Nineteenth IEEE International Workshop on Quality of Service	10.1109/IWQOS.2011.5931319	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.306104434413778	85.25818236078847	102703

Nevertheless, node connectivity is subject to changes because of disruptions in wireless communication, transmission power changes, or loss of synchronization between neighbouring nodes, so there is a need to maintain synchronization between the neighbouring nodes in order to have efficient communication. Hence even after a sensor is aware of its immediate neighbours, it must continuously maintain its view a process we call continuous neighbour discovery. In this proposed work we are maintaining synchronization between neighbouring nodes so that the sensor network will be always active.		Rushikesh B.

VANETs have received wide attention and numerous research issues have been identified in the recent time. The design and implementation of efficient and scalable routing protocols for VANETs is a challenging task due to high dynamics and mobility constraints. In this paper, we have proposed D-LAR (Directional-Location Aided Routing), is an extension of Location Aided Routing (LAR) with Directional Routing (DIR) capability. D-LAR is a greedy approach based-position based routing protocol to forward packet to the node present in request zone within the transmission range of the source node as most suitable next-hop node. We have justified the feasibility of our proposed protocol for VANET.	geographic routing;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);network packet;scalability;self-organization	Ram Shringar Raw;Sanjoy Das;Nanhay Singh;Sanjeet Kumar;Shailender Kumar	2012	CoRR		wireless routing protocol;zone routing protocol	Mobile	4.458186690527341	82.74469051345531	102760

Since sensor nodes are powered by limited-life batteries and are usually deployed in severe environments, they need to be able to conserve their power consumption as well as guarantee broad coverage and connectivity. In active sensor networks, such as RFID sensing systems, shorter sensing and communication ranges will result in a higher measuring precision and more efficient energy dissipation. In this paper, we propose a novel self-controlling method for sensor nodes to decide the most appropriate sensing radius, communication radius, and an active/sleep schedule simultaneously. The energy-saving effect is proved in our simulation section.	vrpm	Qi Zhou;Takuya Asaka;Tatsuro S Takahashi	2005		10.1007/11596042_122	radio-frequency identification;network management;wireless ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;dissipation;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;sleep;mobile wireless sensor network;ubiquitous computing;sensor array;battery;computer network	Mobile	-0.3205755586919811	75.49325610790359	102987

This ‘one size fits all’ approach is far from optimum. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an Intelligent MANet routing protocol system (IMAN), which employs Genetic Algorithms to select the most optimum protocol based on the network context. Comprehensive performance models of three MANET routing protocols (AODV, DSR and OLSR) were built based on the Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System. Representative MANET scenarios, with different number of nodes and mobility schemes, were tested by means of simulations. Findings indicated considerable reduction in packets delay and data load when IMAN was utilized.	ansi escape code;fits;genetic algorithm;neuro-fuzzy;optimized link state routing protocol;simulation	Nagham H.

The growing number of these mobile units demand for communication structures which are specially tailored for their needs. A lot of research has been done, especially in the area of cellular networks , leading to the construction of highly reliable, wireless networks ooering acceptable bandwidth for data transfer. However, cellular networks require a well organized infrastructure and cause considerable costs for setup and operation. In order to gain more exibility ad-hoc networks have been developed which do not require any external infrastructure at all. The basic idea is that all mobile units act as routers and cooperate in transmitting messages. Unfortunately, coping with such a highly dynamic environment is a diicult task. Due to the lack of a central point of administration, the management must be distributed among all the nodes. This causes communication overhead which limits the number of supportable nodes and the lifetime of battery powered machines. Hence, the few existing prototypes support only a small number of users within a small area. New approaches must be found which allow the construction of larger ad-hoc networks. This paper presents part of our research on this topic. In particular, we describe the architecture of a simulation system for evaluating ad-hoc networking protocols and present example simulations analyzing the throughput of some medium access and routing protocols.	communications protocol;computer;hoc (programming language);mobile device;overhead (computing);router (computing);routing;simulation;throughput;transmitter	Ralph Jansen	1998			policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;wireless wan;hierarchical routing;heterogeneous network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;wireless network;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;wi-fi array;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	4.615806981938096	80.37209180020552	103188

Such temporal community structure of MANETs has been shown to be extremely useful in improving the performance of routing and content-based routing in MANETs. However, detecting temporal communities in a completely distributed and real time manner is a hard problem, and it is often performed offline with knowledge of the full network topology over time. We propose CLAN, a distributed and real-time protocol for detecting temporal communities in MANETs. CLAN is an adaptation of the Label Propagation algorithm to distributed and time-varying graphs that MANETs are. A key novel component of CLAN is local rules for community rediscovery as the network evolves. CLAN also uses a weighted version of the network topology where the weights are defined using a novel notion of social entropy to promote stability of communities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that CLAN is quick to converge, incurs minimal overhead and is as effective as centralized approaches to temporal community detection. We also demonstrate how the temporal community structure can be used by designing a hierarchical routing protocol that achieves the delivery ratio of the OLSR routing protocol at a fraction of the overhead.	centralized computing;converge;discretization;distributed algorithm;label propagation algorithm;network topology;online algorithm;online and offline;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);real-time clock;sensor;simulation;snapshot (computer storage);social entropy;spatial variability	Stephen Dabideen;Vikas Kawadia;Samuel C.

Routing protocols play an important role in the performance of mobile ad hoc networks. Routing protocols are responsible for deciding how the information is going to move through the network. Although one paramount parameter of ad hoc networks is the mobility of nodes, little effort has been made to evaluate the performance of mobile ad hoc networks under mobility models where the movements of rescue teams during evacuating operations are modelled. The objective of this paper is to evaluate real case disaster scenarios in terms of performance using several well-known routing protocols metrics.	ansi escape code;computer simulation;hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;quality of service;requirement;semantic network;software propagation	Daniel Gutiérrez-Reina;Sergio L.

In MWSNs the transmission path is affected due to node mobility and node failures. Routing protocols in MWSNs must adjust to topology changes and should determine the path with minimum overheads. Dynamic nature of opportunistic routing strategy is observed to be more suitable for MWSNs. In this paper, a connectivity based energy efficient opportunistic robust (CBEEOR) routing protocol is designed and implemented for MWSNs. CBEEOR design involves algebraic connectivity, prioritized forwarder list for selecting relay node for data forwarding. A back-off time mechanism is implemented to seek cooperation of neighbourhood nodes for forwarding the packets in case the node on the existing path becomes unavailable or fails. This mechanism also ensures coordination among neighbouring nodes. The performance of CBEEOR is compared with both energy efficient opportunistic routing (EEOR) and optimal opportunistic forwarding (OOF), it is observed that CBEEOR fares by 25 and 6 % compared to EEOR and OOF respectively for energy efficiency. CBEEOR also shows better performance for packet delivery, network overheads and end-to-end delay compared to EEOR as well as OOF, making it also suitable for MWSNs with intermittent connectivity.	routing	Mandar Subhash Karyakarte;Anil Srinivas Tavildar;Rajesh Khanna	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-2658-x	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;mobile wireless sensor network;robustness;computer network	Mobile	5.076619787920207	82.96445963085426	103446

In the PEGASIS, the base station (BS) is far away from sensor network. All the sensor nodes  form a single chain using greedy algorithm. The leader node is randomly selected among the sensor nodes and transmits aggregated  data to the BS. In order to gather data, the leader node sends a small token to the end nodes along the chain, and then non-leader  nodes on the chain send the sensing data along the chain toward the leader node from the end nodes. In the PEGASIS, non-leader  node’s transmission distance decreased. However, still the leader node’s transmission distance has not decreased since the  BS is far away from the network field. Therefore, the leader node consumes more energy for data transmission than non-leader  nodes. If the leader node’s energy exhaustion has arisen, the leader node’s data transmission is unreliable. As well as, the  sensor nodes have to form a re-chaining for the next round. In order to resolve this problem in this paper, we proposed energy  based re-transmission of the leader node’s neighbor nodes in the PEGASIS. Through our approach, we have proved more high reliable  transmission on the same simulation condition. Also, our approach decreases the number of re-chaining during the whole round.    	algorithm;pegasus	Se-Jung Lim;Ali Kashif Bashir;Soyeon Rhee;Myong-Soon Park	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-20975-8_13	real-time computing;distributed computing;computer network	Theory	9.010974458312567	81.16093119553298	103478

There are many challenges in implementation of such systems: energy dissipation and data gathering being one of them. Gathering sensed information in an energy efficient manner is critical to operate the sensor network for a long period of time. While cluster-based data collection is efficient at energy and bandwidth, it’s difficult to ensure balanced energy depletion on all cluster-members after a longtime run. In this paper we propose a new distributed cluster-based data gathering algorithm using PSO to optimize clustering process. The election of cluster-heads need synthetically consider the state information including location and energy reserved about candidates and their neighbors. Our preliminary simulation results show that the proposed algorithm balances the energy dissipation over the whole network thus prolongs the network lifetime.	particle swarm optimization;sensor	Ying Liang;Haibin Yu	2005		10.1007/11599463_36	telecommunications;swarm intelligence;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;computer security;artificial neural network;data collection	Mobile	-0.13861974803289415	75.2965991531707	103689

In our proposal, if the mobile node’s mobility is not local, the mobile node sends location update messages to correspondent nodes in the same way as Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6). After the creation of a spatial locality of the mobile node’s movement, the mobile node sends location update messages to the correspondent nodes in same way as HMIPv6. Therefore, our proposal can reduce signaling costs in terms of packet transmission delays in HMIPv6 networks. The cost analysis presented in this paper shows that our proposal offers considerable performance advantages to MIPv6 and HMIPv6.	locality of reference;mobile ip;network packet;principle of locality;profiling (computer programming)	Myung-Kyu Yi	2005		10.1007/11596356_62	internet protocol;network management;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;cost–benefit analysis;operating system;wireless network;mobility model;mobile computing;computer security;packet switching;computer network	Mobile	-2.312040378166786	76.9017550131359	103868

In this paper, we propose a new data gathering scheme which is a combination of clustering and shortest hop pairing of the sensor nodes. The cluster heads and the super leader are rotated every round for ensuring an evenly distributed energy consumption among all the nodes. We have implemented the proposed scheme in nesC and performed simulations in TOSSIM. Successful packet transmission rates have also been studied using the interference-model. Compared with the existing popular schemes such as PEGASIS, BINARY, LBEERA and SHORT, our scheme offers the best “energy × delay” performance and has the capability to achieve a very good balance among different performance metrics.	algorithm;cluster analysis;holographic data storage;interference (communication);nesc;network packet;pegasus;routing;simulation;throughput;tinyos	Ayon Chakraborty;Swarup Kumar Mitra;Mrinal K.

Research in ad hoc networks often involves simulators since management and operation of a large number of nodes is expensive. However, the widely used simulator NS-2 does not scale; it is very hard to simulate medium scale networks with 100+ nodes. We describe here improvements to NS-2 to meet the needs of large ad hoc network simulations. The modified NS-2 simulator is based on the idea of exploiting the limited interference of wireless communication. The modified simulator has simulated populations of up to 3000 nodes so far and works up to 30 times faster than the original version.

Before exchanging information between moving vehicles, the location of destination node should be discovered. However, the existing location service employed in MANET is not very suitable for vehicular ad hoc network. In this paper, a Vehicle Location Service Protocol (VLS) is proposed to support Inter-vehicle communication (IVC) in cities. The information in digital maps is utilized to help realize location service. We present a method of partitioning the network and constructing distributed location servers, which can avoid selecting servers in void areas and decrease the average location discovery delay. In order to reduce the location update cost, forwarding trees and adaptive update policies are used to send messages. In addition, the cost of location update and discovery delay can be balanced through different parameters setting for a given network. Different scenarios are simulated to compare the performance of GLS, GHLS and VLS. The experiment results show that VLS outperforms others in urban environments.

One of the main problems is energy conservation since most of the sensors are devices with limited battery life and it is infeasible to replenish energy via replacing batteries. An effective approach for energy conservation is scheduling sleep intervals for some sensors, while the remaining sensors stay active providing continuous service. In this paper we consider the problem of selecting a set of active sensors of minimum cardinality so that sensing coverage and network connectivity are maintained. We show that the greedy algorithm that provides complete coverage has an approximation factor of , where is the number of sensor nodes. Then we present algorithms that provide approximate coverage while the number of nodes selected is a constant factor far from the optimal solution.	approximation algorithm;greedy algorithm;rechargeable battery;scheduling (computing);sensor	Stefan Funke;Alexander Kesselman;Zvi Lotker;Michael Segal	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-28634-9_5	cardinal number;wireless ad hoc network;greedy algorithm;wireless sensor network;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;wireless network;telemetry;sleep;scheduling;sensor array;approximation algorithm;algorithm;battery;computer network	Mobile	-0.18688906309648567	75.10873235739776	104358

28ea8b219ee9205544f8c5a925616c1de3affe86	load balancing in wsns using a novel markov decision process based routing algorithm		The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of many sensor nodes which are vital to various applications in our daily lives. Load-balancing is a key challenge for WSNs. Improving load-balancing can help with controlling traffic, saving energy and eventually, resulting in a better lifetime. In this paper, a modification of the Energy Efficient Credit-Based (EECB) routing algorithm is proposed, which selects optimal routes based on priority of relay nodes using Markov Decision Process (MDP). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves better load-balancing, better lifetime, and lower energy consumption, at the expense of slightly higher packet loss and lower data delivery rate. The results are presented in comparison with the commonly used Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) algorithm.	algorithm;load balancing (computing);low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;markov chain;markov decision process;network packet;preemption (computing);relay;routing;simulation	Shahab Tayeb;Miresmaeil Mirnabibaboli;Shahram Latifi	2016	2016 6th International Conference on IT Convergence and Security (ICITCS)	10.1109/ICITCS.2016.7740350	real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	7.906264133808059	82.24603604011071	104398

Our study has two goals. First, we characterize the high-level mobility and access patterns of hand- held PDA users and compare these characteristics to previous workload mobility studies focused on laptop users. Second, we develop two wireless network topology models for use in wireless mobility studies: an evolutionary topology model based on user proximity and a campus waypoint model that serves as a trace-based complement to the random waypoint model. We use our evolutionary topology model as a case study for preliminary evaluation of three ad hoc routing algorithms on the network topologies created by the access and mobility patterns of users of modern wireless PDAs. Based upon the mobility characteristics of our trace-based campus waypoint model, we find that commonly parameterized synthetic mobility models have overly aggressive mobility characteristics for scenarios where user movement is limited to walking. Mobility characteristics based on realistic models can have significant implications for evaluating systems designed for mobility. When evaluated using our evolutionary topology model, for example, popular ad hoc routing protocols were very successful at adapting to user mobility, and user mobility was not a key factor in their performance.	personal digital assistant	Marvin McNett;Geoffrey M.

However, the power and dynamism of MANETs renders their management a significant challenge. For example, unpredictable link qualities render quality of service assurance to the mission critical/platinum services very challenging. Likewise, lack of fixed infrastructure coupled with intermittent connectivity place a significant burden on network management systems that are expected to provide seamless recovery amidst random network failures. Additionally, the network management operations in MANETs need to be automated to a large extent. This paper discusses the challenges associated with two key MANET aspects of interest to the Industry: (a) providing and maintaining QoS guarantees and (b) fault management and self-healing in MANETs, and discusses potential solutions that can be implemented in practice.	emoticon;hoc (programming language);mission critical;peer-to-peer;quality of service;random graph;rendering (computer graphics);seamless3d;service assurance	Latha A.

The primary goal of this study is to present the efficiency of a simple hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm on the design of a network infrastructure including decisions concerning the locations and sizes of links. A complementary goal is to also address quality of service issues in the design process. Optimization objectives in this case are the network layout cost and the average packet delay in the network. Therefore a multi-objective instance of the hybrid PSO algorithm is applied. The particular hybrid PSO includes mutation to avoid premature convergence. For the same reason repulsion/attraction mechanisms are also applied on the single objective case. Mutation is passed on to the mufti-objective instance of the algorithm. Obtained results are compared with corresponding evolutionary approaches.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;network packet;network planning and design;network topology;particle swarm optimization;premature convergence;program optimization;quality of service;self-similarity;telecommunications network	Chrysa A.

4ba3b9999aa0439dc4e23ed9ce926608f8cf0819	cachecast: a system for efficient single source multiple destination data transfer	doctoral thesis	The basic function of the Internet is to forward messages hop-by-hop towards their destination hosts. A single message has only one destination and the network does not provide a mechanism for delivering a message to multiple hosts. Therefore, in order to transmit the same message to multiple destinations, a host sends the message to each destination separately. This, however, leads to inefficient use of the Internet resources because packets carrying the same message traverse multiple times the same several first hops from the source. In this thesis we propose CacheCast a system for single source multiple destination data transfer. CacheCast does not change the host-to-host communication model. It is based on a link layer caching technique that removes redundant transfers of the same data. CacheCast consists of two elements: distributed architecture of link caches and server support. The link caches are designed to work independently. A single link cache consists of two elements that operate on the link end-points. The cache management unit located at the link entry removes from packets data that is already present in the cache store unit located at the link exit. The cache store unit reconstructs the packets from the local cache and passes them to a router for further processing. The server support provides a mechanism for an application to transmit the same data over multiple connections in the CacheCast manner. The resulting packets carrying the data are annotated with information that simplifies redundancy detection and removal. This, in turn, greatly reduces the storage and complexity requirements of link caches. The CacheCast system is incrementally deployable. It preserves the end-to-end relationship between communicating hosts thus it can operate with firewalls or NATs. The CacheCast deployment requires minimal changes in the network operation and the minimum amount of resources. The thesis evaluates three aspects of the CacheCast system. Firstly, it assesses the efficiency in terms of network bandwidth consumption during single source multiple destination transfer. It shows through analysis and simulations that CacheCast achieves near perfect multicast efficiency. Secondly, the thesis studies impact of the link caches on the network traffic. Simulations performed in the ns-2 network simulator indicate that CacheCast does not violate current understanding of “fairness” in the Internet. Thirdly, the thesis evaluates the computational complexity of the server support and link cache elements. The server support is implemented as a system call in Linux. The detailed measurements of the system call execution show that it outperforms the standard send system call when transmitting data to multiple destinations. The link cache is evaluated in the context of the Click router. Even though, the link cache elements consume the router processing capacity, the CacheCast router can forward much larger traffic volumes than a standard router. Finally, the thesis includes an example of a live streaming application that uses the CacheCast system to transmit audio stream to thousands of clients.	cpu cache;cache (computing);computational complexity theory;computer simulation;distributed computing;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;firewall (computing);hop-by-hop transport;internet;linux;multicast;network address translation;network packet;requirement;router (computing);server (computing);software deployment;streaming media;system call;traverse;transmitter	Piotr Srebrny	2011			real-time computing;computer science;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science	Networks	6.164413317307929	84.4019374306961	104697

While several centralized schemes have been proposed for efficient path marking and capacity reservation, the decentralized approach is one of the motivating reasons for employing adaptive behavior of swarm-based agents. Algorithmically complex problems such as reliable network routing need to be faced with a dynamically adaptive approach. In this work the bandwidth clustering method is presented, a method developed using the split agent-based routing technique (SART). The SART method is applied in the network, performing path marking activating at the same time the bandwidth clustering method by which nodes within paths are clustered with respect to several levels of available bandwidth. A path freshness degree is estimated and modeled in order to ensure reliability of data traffic flow. Thorough examination is carried out for the performance, path survivability and recoverability using a SART-bandwidth clustering scheme.	adaptive behavior;agent-based model;centralized computing;cluster analysis;item unique identification;problem solving;replay attack;routing;serializability;swarm	Constandinos X.

The unique manufacturing challenges and cost considerations of these networks make for minimal complexity solutions at all network layers. From a networking aspect, packet retransmissions should be kept minimal, while ensuring communication between any two nanonodes. In addition, assigning unique addresses to nanonodes is not straightforward, since it can entail a prohibitively high number of packet exchanges. Thus, efficient data routing is considered an open issue in nanonetworking. The present paper proposes a routing system which can be dynamically deployed within a nanonetwork. Static, dense topologies with numerous, identical nodes are examined. These attributes are especially important in the context of recently proposed applications of nanonetworks. The proposed scheme incurs a trivial setup overhead and requires integer processing capabilities only. Once deployed, it operates efficiently, inducing lower packet retransmission rates than related schemes.	gnu nano;hoc (programming language);nanonetwork;network packet;overhead (computing);radial (radio);retransmission (data networks);routing	Christos Liaskos;Ageliki Tsioliaridou;Sotiris Ioannidis;Nikolaos V.

For any accurate performance study of vehicular networks using computer simulation, it is important to consider real-life vehicular phenomena such as constrained movement due to road paths and traffic control at signalized street junctions. However, currently few simulators can offer a high degree of realism in modeling both vehicular movements and wireless communication for an accurate performance study of wireless vehicular networks. In this paper, we illustrate for the first time, the feasibility of using an open-source microscopic vehicle simulator MITSIMLab to generate high fidelity vehicle movement traces for a wide range of transport settings, processing the generated traces, and exporting them as mobility profiles of vehicular nodes under study to the popular ns-2 network simulator.	computer simulation;federated identity;internet access;mobile app;mobile game;on-board data handling;open-source software;real life;tracing (software)	Devan Rehunathan;Boon-Chong Seet;Trung-Tuan Luong	2007		10.1145/1378063.1378074	computer simulation;vehicular ad hoc network;simulation;systems modeling;internet access;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;wireless network;network simulation;vehicular communication systems;wireless;computer network	Mobile	3.3005766393551963	88.36021132532483	105112

In this paper, we study the case of link state routing and OLSR, one of the strongest candidates for standardization. We analyze how these bounds are not reached in this case, and we study how much the scalability is enhanced with the use of Fish eye techniques in addition to the link state routing framework. We show that with this enhancement, the theoretical scalability bounds are reached.	algorithm;connected component (graph theory);hoc (programming language);image scaling;interference (communication);link-state routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);scalability;simulation	Cédric Adjih;Emmanuel Baccelli;Thomas H.

It is imperative to develop different approaches and communication protocols to meet these diverse and specific requirements while considering the most critical constraint, network lifetime. Adopting duty cycling is an efficient way to conserve energy, by allowing nodes to turn off their radio whenever possible. With these intermittent sleeping periods, it is hard to meet short delay delivery for real time traffic in duty cycled networks, since involved nodes in forwarding are not always awake. For delay intolerant applications, providing an always-on path without scarifying energy can be an effective solution. In this context, we propose a node-disjoint multipath routing algorithm, operating under duty cycled environment, to construct n complementary paths from the source towards the sink. To support urgent data transfer from sources of critical traffic, our protocol aims to offer always at least one available path while others are down. Simulation results show good performances in term of energy consumption and the number of exchanged packets control with a relative small increase in paths establishment time.	algorithm;duty cycle;emergence;high availability;imperative programming;multipath routing;overhead (computing);performance;requirement;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Dhouha Ghrab;Imen Jemili;Abdelfettah Belghith;Mohamed Mosbah	2016	2016 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577142	routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.444805768371938	76.71180992567379	105551

These networks consist of nodes that connect over a wireless channel, and communicate over multiple links by forwarding each other's messages. The throughput is determined by the contention among the nodes for the wireless resources. Thus routing algorithms, influence the level of contention at each location of the network, and play an important role in the network throughput. Additionally, the sequence of transmission opportunities of each node, which is determined by the scheduling algorithm, should also be carefully designed, since it affects the available resources of each node. In this paper we study the effect of routing and scheduling algorithms on the throughput of multihop networks. We propose a per-flow joint routing/scheduling algorithm that has the property of routing the flows in a way that avoids congested areas with limited availability, and also schedules links, in a way that a) slots are assigned to flows, instead of links or nodes, b) the assignment is fair c) fairness does not lead to underutilization. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm increases the average throughput, and the degree of satisfaction of each node, while at the same time it decreases the average delay.	algorithm;dijkstra's algorithm;emoticon;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);limited availability;mesh networking;routing;scheduling (computing);shortest path problem;simulation;throughput	Dimitrios J.

We consider two models to find a reasonable restriction on the worst-case mobility. In the pedestrian model we assume a maximum speed vmax of the radio stations, while in the vehicular model we assume a maximum acceleration amax of the points.Our goal is to maintain persistent routes with nice communication network properties like hop distance, energy-consumption, congestion and number of interferences. A route is persistent, if we can guarantee that all edges of this route can be uphold for a given time span Δ, which is a parameter denoting the minimum time the mobile network needs to adopt changes, i.e. update routing tables, change directory entries, etc. This Δ can be used as the length of an update interval for a proactive routing scheme.We extend some known notions such as transmission range, interferences, spanner, power spanner and congestion to both mobility models and introduce a new parameter called crowdedness that states a lower bound on the number of radio interferences. Then we prove that a mobile spanner hosts a path system that polylogarithmically approximates the optimal congestion.We present distributed algorithms based on a grid clustering technique and a high-dimensional representation of the dynamical start situation which construct mobile spanners with low congestion, low interference number, low energy-consumption, and low degree. We measure the optimality of the output of our algorithm by comparing it with the optimal choice of persistent routes under the same circumstances with respect to pedestrian or vehicular worst-case movements. Finally, we present solutions for dynamic position information management under our mobility models.	amax;best, worst and average case;cd (command);cluster analysis;directory (computing);distributed algorithm;hoc (programming language);information management;interference (communication);network congestion;persistence (computer science);persistent data structure;radio broadcasting;routing table;telecommunications network;worst-case scenario	Christian Schindelhauer;Tamás Lukovszki;Stefan Rührup;Klaus Volbert	2003		10.1145/777412.777448	distributed algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;information management;mobility model;computer network	Mobile	3.3901524119910653	80.72871988182418	105692

An effective way to improve the performance of EVs is to manage the battery pack with a battery management system (BMS), while in the actual operation, the collection and analysis of the battery state parameters is of great significance to the study of BMS. It is necessary to detect and provide the location information of the nearest charging station, thus each vehicle is required to have network communication function because the vehicles may move in real time. Then ad-hoc ntechnology is used to solve the network communication between the vehicles and the charging piles. There is no standard routing protocol forn ad hoc n, and the network routing protocol directly determines the efficiency, reliability and correctness of the network data transmission. Based on the cluster-tree andn ad-hoc non-demand distance vector junior (AODVjr) protocols, this study proposed a routing protocol suitable for mobilen ad-hoc nnetwork algorithm, and made a simulation on the NS2 platform. The results showed that compared with other protocols, then ad-hoc nrouting protocol is more suitable for the application of this system.	battery management system;hoc (programming language);routing	Jiajia Song;Jinbo Zhang;Xinnan Fan	2018	IET Networks	10.1049/iet-net.2017.0097	battery pack;charging station;battery (electricity);data transmission;correctness;routing protocol;distance-vector routing protocol;computer network;wireless ad hoc network;computer science	Mobile	7.661528971485607	74.69382921979849	105711
6d1b26d13d8f63aaabbf267e8b491f1cfcb54278	probabilistic-based broadcasting for em-based wireless nanosensor networks		Wireless nano sensors networks (WNSN) have emerged recently to allow nanonodes to communicate to each other using nano-communication mechanisms. Nanodevices are characterized by limited resources, and new communication protocols are, therefore, required. For instance, the flooding mechanism has been proposed for broadcasting in electromagnetic-based WNSNs. While the flooding scheme is very simple, the excessive number of rebroadcasts increases the utilization of the resources that affects the performance and increases the energy consumption. In this paper, we adopt the probabilistic-based broadcasting mechanism in the context of WNSNs. Simulations have been conducted using Nanosim and results show that probabilistic-based flooding mechanism reduces redundant retransmissions while maintaining good performance.	algorithm;computer simulation;design review (u.s. government);gnu nano;sensor;subscriber identity module	Ayoub Oukhatar;Mohamed Bakhouya;Driss El Ouadghiri;Khalid Zine-Dine	2017		10.1145/3151848.3151872	nanosensor;computer network;distributed computing;computer science;nano-;probabilistic logic;wireless;communications protocol;energy consumption;broadcasting	Mobile	8.526039329036193	82.95249645322934	105718

It gives a summary of the already proposed algorithms and describes more broadly some of them. It introduces also a new one called the Weighted Link Congestion and Frequency (WLCF) algorithm. Our comparative simulations are performed using an in-house developed environment in which all the OBS mechanisms are implemented in detail. Considering various network topologies and traffic scenarios, we show that basically WLCF performs better than other routing strategies in terms of mean burst blocking probability averaged over the whole network, and, thus, increases the overall network throughput.	blocking (computing);erlang (unit);multipath routing;network congestion;network topology;non-blocking algorithm;optical burst switching;simulation;throughput	Farrukh Zeeshan Khan;Muhammad Faisal Hayat;Tomasz Holynski	2016	2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2016.7760984	algorithm design;routing;static routing;real-time computing;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;probabilistic logic;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;measurement;computer network	HPC	-0.16883753649154157	85.52974548852691	105898

In particular we show that if a node wishes to communicate with n distinct destinations, multicast can reduce the overall network load by a factor Oð ffiffiffi n p Þ, when used instead of unicast. One of the implications of this scaling property consists in a significant increase of the total capacity of the network for data delivery. Hence, we show that the aggregate multicast capacity of wireless ad hoc networks is Oð ffiffiffi n p Þ larger than the unicast capacity, when the group size n is small compared to the total number of nodes in the network. We discuss how these information theoretic results can be taken into consideration in the operation of a multicast protocol for wireless mesh networks using Multicast Overlay Spanning Trees (MOST). We perform simulations of the MOST protocol to compare with the theoretical results, and we present a fully working implementation for real network environments. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Flooding is the simplest technique for information dissemination in ad hoc based networks, in which nodes disseminate a received message to all their neighbors. This algorithm leads to the broadcast storm problem that severely affects the energy consumption due to redundant submissions. To regulate redundant submissions, which can cause more collisions and requires more energy, recently there have been developed numerous broadcasting techniques. These techniques have been mainly proposed to solve the storm problem by preventing certain nodes from rebroadcasting received messages and/or by differentiating the timing of rebroadcasts. In this paper, we have evaluated and compared an adaptive information dissemination (AID) algorithm with other MANETs broadcasting protocols with respect to the energy efficiency. In AID, each node can dynamically adjust the values of its local parameters using information from neighboring nodes without requiring any additional effort, such as distance measurements or exact locationdetermination of nodes. Simulation results are reported and show that adaptive broadcasting schemes are most efficient with respect to save broadcast, energy consumption, and reachability. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, VSN implementations face stringent constraints of limited communication bandwidth, processing capability, and power supply. In-network processing has been proposed as efficient means to address these problems. The key component of in-network processing, task mapping and scheduling problem, is investigated in this paper. Although task mapping and scheduling in wired networks of processors has been extensively studied, their application to VSNs remains largely unexplored. Existing algorithms cannot be directly implemented in VSNs due to limited resource availability and shared wireless communication medium. In this work, an applicationindependent task mapping and scheduling solution in multi-hop VSNs is presented that provides real-time guarantees to process video feeds. The processed data is smaller in volume which further releases the burden on the end-to-end communication. Using a novel multi-hop channel model and a communication scheduling algorithm, computation tasks and associated communication events are scheduled simultaneously with a dynamic critical-path scheduling algorithm. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) mechanism is implemented to further optimize energy consumption. According to the simulation results, the proposed solution outperforms existing mechanisms in terms of guaranteeing application deadlines with minimum energy consumption. r 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.	algorithm;central processing unit;channel (communications);computation;computer simulation;critical path method;dynamic voltage scaling;end-to-end principle;interference (communication);network processor;penalty method;power supply;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);video sensor technology;yang	Yaoyao Gu;Yuan Tian;Eylem Ekici	2007	Sig.

These applications require an efficient management of the Quality of Service (QoS) and consist of a great number of participants. In order to support such applications, we propose a hierarchical communication architecture and multicast protocols allowing scalability. This architecture allows to guarantee QoS requirements. In fact, it allows to reduce efficiently the connection number and the communication delays. We use simulation to analyze and compare the performances of the proposed multicast protocols to the direct architecture. Simulation results confirm our purposes that are the reduction of the network charge and the average delay.	computer;multicast;performance;quality of service;requirement;scalability;simulation;telecommunications network	D Gatti	2003		10.1007/978-0-387-35703-4	software engineering;computer security;computer network	Arch	-1.6079746985898877	86.73068835508688	106358

However, it also brings big challenge to the design of efficient routing protocols. Inappropriate selection of routes can largely offset the efficiency of a sleep scheduling mechanism. This paper aims to provide a simple but efficient forwarding discipline for packet routing in a low duty cycled WSN wherein each node chooses its wakeup slot in a pseudo-random manner. In such a duty-cycled WSN, a big problem is how a node can make a forwarding decision in order to obtain an acceptable end-to-end (E2E) delivery latency as well as high energy efficiency. In this paper, we design a multipath routing protocol that combines gradient information and predictable link delay to make the forwarding decision. Simulation results show that the designed protocol can obtain high performance in terms of delivery latency and energy efficiency compared with existing work.	bonjour sleep proxy;communications protocol;end-to-end principle;euclidean distance;gradient descent;multipath routing;network packet;pseudorandomness;scheduling (computing);simulation	Jie Hao;Zheng Yao;Baoxian Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364182	wireless routing protocol;routing table;virtual routing and forwarding;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;ip forwarding;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	9.092762729630994	84.2920076895963	106411

Since ALM protocols relieve load from centralized content servers and offer flexible group communication without requiring dedicated support in the network, they can be considered a viable solution for future content distribution. Anyway, using ALM in capacity-constrained environments like dense urban cellular networks may worsen congestions due to higher bandwidth consumption inside the access networks. In this paper, we propose the integration of multi-access communication in ALM in order to unburden access networks from traffic load and avoid congestion. Doing so, we propose a two-step ALM building approach that first establishes a single-homed cellular overlay tree, before efficiently looking up and integrating alternative WiFi communication possibilities in the dissemination tree. Finding WiFi peers in range is not trivial in dense urban environments, since the number of concurrently visible public WiFi domains may be high and Ad-hoc scanning should be avoided if possible due to poorer properties concerning energy, stability, and range. Our proposal follows a space-efficient Bloom Filter-based technique, allowing to precisely join public Wifi domains with high chance of meeting foreign peers without having to try out several candidate domains first.	access network;bloom filter;centralized computing;digital distribution;hoc (programming language);multicast;multihoming;network congestion	Christian Hübsch;Oliver P.

b703a12519900947d3a55c7a211ccee14b879db3	performance comparison of proactive and reactive routing protocol in mobile ad hoc network		—Today, the use of Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is becoming increasingly popular due to its flexibility and ease of use wherever and whenever. MANET is able to adapt to many applications, such as disaster management and military operations. The MANET routing protocol consists of two types, namely Proactive Routing Protocols and On Demand Routing Protocols. Destination-Sequence DistanceVector (DSDV) is an example of a protocol that includes Proactive Routing Protocols. Meanwhile, Ad Hoc on-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) are examples of protocols that include On Demand Routing Protocols or Reactive Routing Protocols. Because routing protocols greatly affect MANET performance significantly, it is necessary to study the performance of routing protocols. This paper discusses the performance comparison of MANET routing protocol based on RandomWaypoint mobility model. The experiment was carried out by applying the MANET routing protocol to the RandomWaypoint mobility model. Routing protocols used are AODV, DSDV and DSR. The simulation is done using NS-2 software. The total of nodes used in simulations is 100, 150, 200 and 250 nodes respectively. Length of simulation time 900s. The simulation area take place in urban residential areas. Performance evaluation is performed on variable packet delivery ratio (PDR), throughput, average end to end delay, packet loss and Normalized Routing Load (NRL).

5e2e70672d29f9b0742ec09595571ab3e90398dc	a novel load balancing scheme for multipath routing protocol in manet		The recent advancements in information and communication technology create a great demand for multipath routing protocols. In MANET, nodes can be arbitrarily located and can move freely at any given time. The topology of MANET can change rapidly and unpredictably. Because wireless link capacities are usually limited, congestion is possible in MANETs. Hence, balancing the load in a MANET is important since nodes with high load will deplete their batteries quickly, thereby increasing the probability of disconnecting or partitioning the network. To overcome these, the multipath protocol should be aware of load at route discovery phase. The main objective of the proposed article is to balance the load on a node and to extend the lifetime of the node due to the congestion, energy depletion and link failures. This article describes a novel load and congestion aware scheme called Path Efficient Ad-hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (PE-AOMDV) protocol to increase the performance of routing process in MANET in terms of congestion, end-to-end delay and load balancing. A new threshold value and a counter variable are introduced to limit the number of communication paths passing over a node in route discovery phase. For every new request the counter variable is incremented by one and the threshold value is compared to see whether the maximum number of connections has been reached or not. The proposed method is network simulator ns-2 and it is found that there is a significant improvement in the proposed scheme. It reduces the energy consumption, average end-to-end delay and normalized routing overhead. Also the proposed scheme increases packet delivery ratio, throughput and minimizes routing overheads.	counter (digital);depletion region;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);media redundancy protocol;multipath propagation;multipath routing;network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);simulation;throughput;user-generated content	Kokilamani Mounagurusamy;Karthikeyan Eswaramurthy	2016	CIT		wireless routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;load balancing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.5511512617652827	83.45727627251497	106881

Several approaches have been proposed to achieve effective IoT communications, where each device has very limited communication capabilities. One such approach is the introduction of short packets for a lightweight communication protocol by which we can form a local area sensor network dedicated to IoT devices and can achieve effective packet processing, reducing power consumption, and minimizing bandwidth occupancy. The short packet can solve problems regarding local networks but creates another problem for the wide area Internet, where various devices and local networks are converged. We propose an aggregation scheme that makes it possible to reduce power consumption and packet processing loads caused by a huge amount of short packets. We focus on the wide area Internet with our proposed scheme to support IoT traffic more efficiently.	aggregate data;communications protocol;constrained application protocol;emergence;internet of things;network architecture;network packet;network performance;next-generation network;norm (social);overlay network;requirement;router (computing);social system	Arata Koike;Takumi Ohba;Ryota Ishibashi	2016	2016 5th IIAI International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics (IIAI-AAI)	10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2016.221	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;internet traffic engineering;computer network	Networks	6.057785777359913	75.64453791556689	106953

The diversity of the applications and their potential communication protocols has challenged a systematic literature survey. We apply a classification technique to IVC applications to provide a taxonomy for detailed study of their communication requirements. The applications are divided into type classes which share common communication organization and performance requirements. IVC protocols are surveyed separately and their fundamental characteristics are revealed. The protocol characteristics are then used to determine the relevance of specific protocols to specific types of IVC applications.	communications protocol;complexity;network congestion;peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;relevance;requirement;robot;software deployment;type class;world wide web	Theodore L.

Previous studies suggest that velocity vector (speed and direction) of a mobile unit (MU) can be used to design optimal strategies. But the schemes use complex velocity estimation techniques and requires explicit announcement of velocity profile during an update. We propose a novel velocity based location management scheme in which explicit announcement of velocity by MU is not required during an update as mobile switching centre (MSC) stores and adjusts velocity profile of MU intelligently. Location of MU can be predicted using the profile of MU stored in the MSC during the paging process. The proposed scheme can be implemented using directional Cell Identification Codes which requires no extra signaling overhead. Simulation shows that our scheme performs far better than existing schemes.	velocity	Subrata Nandi;Manish K.

Tree-based schemes cannot cope with network mobility due to frequent tree reconfiguration. On the other hand, mesh-based schemes waste unnecessary resource due to delivery along multiple paths. We propose to use an overlay multicast to handle network mobility efficiently with minimized resource. In our scheme, DDT (data delivery tree) can remain static as long as unicast route between members that are related to data forwarding remains reachable. Thus, it can not only minimize the effects of network mobility, but also bring about low additional control overhead. Such distinct advantages are specifically evaluated through the results of the simulation.	cost efficiency;hoc (programming language);multicast;overlay network	Ki-Il Kim;Hee-Sook Mo;In-Cheol Back;Jin-Beom Shin;Sang Ha Kim	2003		10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258331	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;multicast;mobile ad hoc network;overlay network;telecommunications;communication in small groups;protocol independent multicast;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;computer network;multicast address;cost efficiency	Mobile	1.4858233674469492	83.49303000903487	107080

In this paper, we propose a network coding routing mechanism in WSNs that is based on Vector-Based Forwarding VBF. The goal of the proposed routing mechanism is to decrease the total number of transmissions needed to deliver data to the destination. Decreasing the total number of transmissions is achieved by varying the number of transmissions performed by each sensor node in a particular way that does not sacrifice the reliability of data delivery. Decreasing the number of transmissions decreases the traffic forwarded in the process of delivering data and enhances power savings which prolong the lifetime of the WSN. Simulation results show major improvements achieved by the proposed routing mechanism.	linear network coding	Mohammed D.

Because experimental traces have holes due to packet losses, we explore two algorithms for filling the gaps in lossy experimental traces. Using completed traces, we apply the closest-fit pattern matching (CPM) algorithm, originally designed for modeling external interference, to model signal strength.  We compare the observed link behavior using our models with that of the experimental packet trace. Our approach results in more accurate packet reception ratios than current simulation methods, reducing the absolute error in PRR by up to about 30%. We also find that using CPM for signal strength improves simulation of packet burstiness, reducing the Kantorovich-Wasserstein (KW) distance of conditional packet delivery functions (CPDFs) by a factor of about 3 for intermediate links.  These improvements give TOSSIM, a standard sensor network simulator, a better capability to capture real-world dynamics and edge conditions that protocol designers typically must wait until deployment to detect.	algorithm;approximation error;interference (communication);lossy compression;network packet;pattern matching;production rule representation;radio wave;simulation;software deployment;tinyos;tracing (software)	Tal Rusak;Philip Alexander Levis	2008		10.1145/1454503.1454514	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	9.439176557126574	86.57524869391963	107319

This type of network system is useful for information sharing by using mobile devices (e.g., smart phones). On message delivery over the network, it is very difficult to assume the static routing if each node is assumed to move. In this paper, we suppose to use gossip-style epidemic message dissemination and show the performance evaluation of several gossip algorithms in terms of network topology. Specifically, we focus on the distribution of links in the network. Our results clarified the characteristics of those algorithms on the topologies that are biased the degree distribution locally.	algorithm;degree (graph theory);degree distribution;dijkstra's algorithm;fundamental fysiks group;mobile device;network topology;parsing expression grammar;peer-to-peer;performance evaluation;reachability;routing;simulation;smartphone;wireless access point	Daisuke Yamamasu;Naohiro Hayashibara	2014	2014 20th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)	10.1109/PADSW.2014.7097888	gossip protocol;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	2.3108747488996535	81.17751375132939	107662

Using a non-iterative cluster formation operation, the protocol spends an extremely low overhead energy compared to the existing protocols and terminates faster than the energy-expensive iterative processes. The distributed head election algorithm guarantees that the periodically-elected leaders have the highest residual energy among their members in each data reporting cycle, effectively balancing the energy consumption among sensors. The DEEP also accounts for sensor limitations as well as practical concerns such as wireless collision that has not been considered by the existing clustering protocols. It intelligently exploits the overhearing ability of sensors to alleviate the loss of clustering control packets due to collisions. The proposed protocol is very effective in forming well-distributed clusters that ensure the required load balancing, the connectivity of clusters, and the minimum data communication energy during the data collection stage. In addition, the DEEP does not make any advanced assumptions about the required number of clusters, the network density, the energy consumption pattern of sensors or their clock synchronization and capabilities. For a thorough evaluation, we have compared the performance of DEEP with an existing clustering protocol. The simulation results show the effectiveness of DEEP in reducing the energy expenditure besides assuring other desirable features. We have also examined its performance in prolonging the network lifetime in the context of a practical routing protocol.	algorithm;clock synchronization;cluster analysis;communications protocol;data aggregation;iteration;iterative method;load balancing (computing);overhead (computing);routing;scalability;sensor;simulation	Hend Alqamzi;Tiffany Jing Li	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502449	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;efficient energy use;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	8.32655906934516	79.62582610598785	107729
9eda283b4d7121382d7011d1a634143c7081e3aa	a hybrid genetic algorithm for the weight setting problem in ospf/is-is routing		Intradomain traffic engineering aims to make more efficient use of network resources within an autonomous system. Interior Gateway Protocols such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and IS-IS (Intermediate SystemIntermediate System) are commonly used to select the paths along which traffic is routed within an autonomous system. These routing protocols direct traffic based on link weights assigned by the network operator. Each router in the autonomous system computes shortest paths and creates destination tables used to direct each packet to the next router on the path to its final destination. Given a set of traffic demands between origindestination pairs, the OSPF weight setting problem consists of determining weights to be assigned to the links so as to optimize a cost function, typically associated with a network congestion measure. In this article, we propose a genetic algorithm with a local improvement procedure for the OSPF weight-setting problem. The local improvement procedure makes use of an efficient dynamic shortest path algorithm to recompute shortest paths after the modification of link weights. We test the algorithm on a set of real and synthetic test problems, and show that it produces near-optimal solutions.

However, most of those algorithms do not use the newest states of nodes for retrieving routing information. In this paper, we propose an efficient energy-aware routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks. In our algorithm, the energy drain rate and residual energy of each sensor node are used for selecting candidate routes. Information is retrieved with energy awareness per almost every communication.

Thus, the geographical network environments may become large and dense. In such network environments, a large number of resource discovery queries may be generated when specific resources or services are needed. In this paper, we propose a simple resource advertisement and discovery (SRAD) protocol for applications in mobile ad hoc networks. The SRAD protocol self-organizes a proximity network and works in a fully distributed architecture without centralized control and management. The simulation results show that the SRAD protocol can achieve the same level of performance as in the broadcast-based protocols while generating fewer transmitted messages in large and dense mobile ad hoc networks.	centralized computing;distributed computing;hoc (programming language);simulation;systems biology	Jean-Lien C.

Many virtual coordinate constructions rely on the furthest set of nodes as beacons. Network edges may also bound routing holes in the network, regions of failure due to environmental effects, or indicate the need for additional deployment. In this paper we propose an algorithm to identify nodes and links that sit on the boundaries of the physical network. Edge nodes may then participate to map the network boundaries. Our algorithm is provably correct and exploits the relationship between alphahulls, a generalisation of the convex hull, and communication range. This relationship allows nodes on network boundaries to identify themselves without outside intervention. We then show via simulation that our algorithm identifies meaningful boundaries even in networks of low-density and non-uniform distribution.	algorithm;convex hull;correctness (computer science);routing;simulation;software deployment	Marwan Fayed;H.

The time of network initialization is divided into rounds. The collaboration consisted of three phases: REQ, REPLY, and ACK is used to guarantee the interference-aware slot assignment during each round. The slot information is exchanged when node execute collaboration. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm by using NS2.

The resulting system that integrates robust routing and MCTP is evaluated in experiments performed in complex environments. The integrated system is observed to provide a robust architecture that allows for near lossless communication while operating in a complex environment with less traffic than standard confirmation protocols.	algorithm;autonomous robot;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;experiment;hoc (programming language);lossless compression;management component transport protocol;motion planning;network packet;quality of service;robot;routing;systems architecture;throughput;uncompressed video	James Stephan;Jonathan Fink;Benjamin Charrow;Alejandro R.

DTN nodes mostly operate on limited battery power. Hence, in such networks, there is an immediate need to have energy efficient routing protocol, allowing the network to perform better and live longer for a message with lifetime Et and delivery probability Dp. Most of the work in DTN assumes that all the nodes are co-operative in nature, but in real world, all nodes are not always co-operative, and show some form of selfishness. We propose a message-driven based algorithm add-on to the existing routing protocols (such as Epidemic Routing (ER) and Two-Hop Routing (2HR)), that enables forwards based on individual message lifetime and delivery requirements, there by improving energy efficiency. Further we analytically model the performance of these protocols with energy-efficiency add-on in DTN, with individual node selfishness using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The results show that the proposed energy-efficient add-on improves the energy efficiency up to 90% for both ER and 2HR protocols. The analysis is validated through extensive simulation.	add-ons for firefox;algorithm;delay-tolerant networking;erdős–rényi model;hop;link-state routing protocol;requirement;simulation;velocity (software development)	V.

Inspired by human's communication way, a kind of content and context awareness protocol base on knowledge (abbr. KC 2 A 2 P) is proposed in this paper. A common shared protocol ontology is built that includes content, context and act in order to not only guide the different protocol terms mapping but also provide an intelligent protocol encoding framework. To avoid unnecessary communication load, event calculus is used to build the axiom of communication cognition and  three basic encoding  rules are made that can adjust the message entity  base on the application context .Furthermore, some experiments are given to show KC 2 A 2 P would improve the meaning delivery and even help to build trust relationship.	context awareness	Li Wang	2011	JNW	10.4304/jnw.6.10.1398-1405	embedded system;protocol;universal composability;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;encoding;computer network	Robotics	1.5219118405839969	77.06598132070906	108570

However, most of the data-gathering strategies for WSNs cannot avoid the hotspot problem in local or whole deployment area. Hotspot problem affects the network connectivity and decreases the network lifetime. Hence, we propose a tree-cluster-based data-gathering algorithm (TCBDGA) for WSNs with a mobile sink. A novel weight-based tree-construction method is introduced. The root nodes of the constructed trees are defined as rendezvous points (RPs). Additionally, some special nodes called subrendezvous points (SRPs) are selected according to their traffic load and hops to root nodes. RPs and SRPs are viewed as stop points of the mobile sink for data collection, and can be reselected after a certain period. The simulation and comparison with other algorithms show that our TCBDGA can significantly balance the load of the whole network, reduce the energy consumption, alleviate the hotspot problem, and prolong the network lifetime.	algorithm;java hotspot virtual machine;simulation;software deployment	Chuan Zhu;Shuai Wu;Guangjie Han;Lei Shu;Hongyi Wu	2015	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2424452	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;mobile telephony;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;cluster analysis;tree;data analysis;mobile wireless sensor network;statistics;computer network;data collection	Mobile	8.625817693484011	78.93486147631948	108583

However, VANETs could face a great challenge arising from rapidly varying network topology. It is an essential issue to design an efficient and reliable solution for message dissemination in dynamic VANETs. In this paper, we propose an epidemic routing method with capability of self-adapting to the highly dynamic nature of VANETs. To ensure a good trade-off between reachability and efficiency of message dissemination, an adaptive probabilistic infection and an adaptive limited-time forwarding mechanisms are also proposed for the epidemic broadcasting. Moreover, inspired by the self-adaptability and robustness of the cellular gene regulatory networks, we use the attractor selection mechanism to enhance routing messages in dynamic VANETs. Through comparative simulations under different traffic scenarios, we validate our proposed method and prove that it can guarantee message reachability and achieve high delivery efficiency in terms of message delivery ratio, average routing latency and cost.	routing	Daxin Tian;Jianshan Zhou;Yunpeng Wang;Guohui Zhang;Haiying Xia	2016	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2015.05.018	routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	4.444050711275193	85.66363227422188	108639

Trust based MANET routing protocols have been developed to counteract malicious behaviour, in an effort to establish fair node behaviour. Recent research has shown that the trust protocols themselves introduce unfair behaviour among nodes.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such an integrated and systematic obstacle model for these networks appears. We define several types of obstacles that can be found inside the deployment area of a wireless sensor network and provide a categorization of these obstacles, based on their nature (physical and communication obstacles, i.e., obstacles that are formed out of node distribution patterns or have physical presence, respectively), their shape, as well as their change of nature over time. We make an extension to a custom-made sensor network simulator (simDust) and conduct a number of simulations in order to study the effect of obstacles on the performance of some representative (in terms of their logic) data propagation protocols for wireless sensor networks. Our findings confirm that obstacle presence has a significant impact on protocol performance, and also that different obstacle shapes and sizes may affect each protocol in different ways, thus giving insight to how will a routing protocol perform in the case of obstacles’ existence and indicate possible protocol shortcomings. Moreover, our results show that the effect of obstacles is not directly related to the density of a sensor network, and cannot be emulated only by changing the	categorization;computer simulation;emulator;routing;sensor web;software deployment;software propagation	Ioannis Chatzigiannakis;Georgios Mylonas;Sotiris E.

The problem is the more difficult since it connects aspects of concurrent processing and communication between different parts of applications over the Internet links with parameters changing in time. In this paper we describe the problem of estimating data transmission time over the network. The results are part of the work heading towards enabling reliable simulation of distributed applications. The model of application and resources is created using Timed Colored Petri Nets (TCPN) and it is combined with Ns-2 implementation of Linux TCP. Thus reliable simulation of concurrent processes and resource competition is ensured by the formalism of TCPN and network transmission time is estimated by implementation including real TCP code. We present preliminary results of comparison between simulations and experiments.	petri net	Wojciech Rzasa	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02671-3_9	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;computer science	HPC	0.06892364005017773	88.51845457488068	108745

In this movement model, the mobile nodes have the tendency to visit fixed places frequently. Our approach recognizes the encounter places, called hubs, and employs them as base elements for the routing procedure. Nodes visiting frequently two or more hubs are considered carriers and are used as data mule for message transport. After setting up this infrastructure, routing tables are constructed in the hubs. When a message should be routed, it is sent to a hub and, subsequently, forwarded among them until reaching a hub visited by the destination node. Simulations showed that, for scenarios strongly based on sociological movement, our method outperformed the Spray and Wait for different configurations.	computer simulation;data mule;distance-vector routing protocol;ethernet hub;overhead (computing);routing table;usb hub;whole earth 'lectronic link	Hewerton Enes de Oliveira;João Paulo de Araujo;Tales Heimfarth;João Carlos Giacomin	2015	2015 9th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/IMIS.2015.21	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.425530806390875	82.8696088588642	108845

Endto-end protocols are at an inherent disadvantage in trying to solve these problems because their feedback loop operates over multiple wireless hops, which makes it difficult to diagnose problems that occur several hops away and hinders their ability to adapt to changing network conditions. In this paper, we design HxH, a hop-by-hop transport protocol that uses credit-based congestion control and reverse ACKs to solve many of the problems observed with TCP. We use a simulation study to demonstrate that our hop-by-hop approach allows HxH to respond quickly to changing network conditions and to exploit the unique characteristics of wireless networks to reduce overhead. We show that HxH greatly increases throughput and improves fairness, as compared to several end-to-end protocols, in both mesh and mobile ad hoc networks.

02d7a72df00fb66c1870fe29f759ebc0a49d1289	communications and networking		In the routing protocol of wireless sensor networks, the traditional LEACH algorithm is too random, and the cluster head selection of it is not ideal. To solve this problem, it proposes a WSN routing algorithm based on energy approximation strategy. It chooses a series of nodes with high energy and high density to form cluster candidate clusters, and then selects the farthest node as the cluster head from the candidates by using the energy approximation strategy. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement, and the cluster head selection of it is ideal. Using Matlab software for simulation, the results show that it is less energy consuming than the LEACH algorithm, and the lifetime of the whole network is prolonged.	algorithm;approximation;matlab;routing;simulation	Paolo Bellavista;Jiannong Cao;Falko Dressler;Hisashi Kobayashi	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-78139-6		Mobile	8.51802215699374	80.40527462618002	109147

In addition, there are scenarios where the destination of interest is located in the radio range of other transmitters, so that the efforts on establishing data communication with this mobile station will fail due to collisions that may occur between transmitted control frames and undesired received control and data frames. This phenomenon becomes a bottleneck when most of data transmissions experience packet fragmentation. In such scenarios, the desired destination becomes unreachable during the data transfer of neighboring nodes. Using the same PHY of IEEE 802.11 and making slight modifications in its MAC, a new medium access control scheme is presented to address such problems. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with earlier schemes through simulation-based evaluations, showing performance enhancement due to considerable better handling of unreachability issues in the proposed MAC scheme	access control;bottleneck (engineering);fragmentation (computing);hoc (programming language);network packet;next-generation network;optimal control;phy (chip);simulation;transmitter;unreachable memory	Kaveh Ghaboosi;Matti Latva-aho	2007	2007 IEEE 65th Vehicular Technology Conference - VTC2007-Spring	10.1109/VETECS.2007.21	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	6.530135790756296	87.11803212680442	109272

Particularly, we consider that the future wireless ad hoc networks shall be able to efficiently provide connectivity and support a variety of quality of service requirements, such as bandwidth and delay requirements. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for the design of future wireless ad hoc networks. The key idea of this framework is to establish an overlay hypernetwork, which consists of multiple hyperchannels, each of which can provide connectivity for multiple nodes in the hyperchannel. By comparison, a typical tunnel in existing overlay network schemes can only provide connectivity for two end nodes. Within the framework, we also develop advanced network coding design that can further improve the performance of the network in terms of throughput and delay.	hoc (programming language);linear network coding;non-functional requirement;overlay network;quality of service;throughput	Kejie Lu;Shengli Fu;Tao Zhang;Yi Qian	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.211	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;service set;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;dynamic circuit network;computer science;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;delay-tolerant networking;monitor mode;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-1.4063808301233072	85.70083475183041	109275

Even though D2D communication has been part of previous ad hoc, meshed and sensor networks proposals, the main contribution by 3GPP is that the direct communication among two devices is carried out over a dynamically assigned, licensed spectrum; thus, it is under full control of the cellular network. D2D communication creates a market potential for new services, new approaches to efficient spectrum use, and security concepts. This is especially true if D2D communication is extended to larger communication groups organized in meshed clusters. In this article, we discuss the potential and shortcomings of D2D communication as proposed today, advocating for the use of network coding as an enabling technology for enhanced security and communication efficiency using the PlayNCool and CORE protocols as key examples to deliver smarter D2D systems.	hoc (programming language);linear network coding	Peyman Pahlevani;Martin Hundeboll;Morten Videbæk Pedersen;Daniel Enrique Lucani;Hassan Charaf;Frank H.

Deployments of WSNs have potential to shed light on a number of scientific, industrial, and societal problems such as climate change and precision agriculture. In general, they hold a great promise to enable new commercial and scientific applications and products. The richness of the collected sensor data opens a wide range of opportunities to develop new technologies and applications. One of the key design questions is how to distribute and query efficiently sensor data in the WSN. This problem has received a lot of attention. One of the challenges is to guarantee robust data storage in WSNs and eventually collecting data from temporary storage locations to the backend databases. There is a number of simple query based protocols or various data distribution mechanisms that are proposed to handle WSNs. However, the emerging extremely large-scale WSNs require us to face the scalability problem. The amount of the data and the geographical distribution of sensors are potentially so large that new protocols and mechanisms are required for both sensor data processing and transfer. In the first part of this thesis we address the problem of the in-network management of sensor data. We show how content-based routing can be used to realize robust sensor data storage and to enable efficient querying mechanisms in WSNs. We refine the scope on studying the use of the well-known Bloom filters strategy for representing content items with indexes. Despite their advantage in forming compact routing tables, Bloom filter-based routing protocols suffer from problems of probabilistic data localization. Therefore, we propose a set of novel alternative strategies based on the use of orthogonal codes to lower the probability of false-addressing or alternatively to minimize the length of addresses. We evaluate the respective performance of different schemes both analytically and using extensive simulations, and provide analyses and guidance for choosing among different methods and strategies. In the second part of this thesis we deal with the scalability problem and consider very large-scale WSNs up to planetary scale sensor networks based on cellular networks infrastructure. We provide careful estimates on the traffic volumes of sensor readings in a number of scenarios explored in the literature. The results show that machine-to-machine communications and WSNs have a potential to dominate over other forms of mobile and wireless network traffic. Based on these forecasts, we study the possible solutions for storing and	bloom filter;code;computer data storage;database;machine to machine;network traffic control;planetary scanner;routing table;scalability;sensor;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Christine Jardak	2012			wireless routing protocol;routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	9.380277105995262	74.9342131665233	109456

This talk presents representative algorithms for important problems in wireless sensor networks, such as data propagation and energy balance. The protocol design uses key algorithmic techniques like randomization and local optimization. Crucial performance properties of the protocols (correctness, fault-tolerance, scalability) and their trade-offs are investigated through both analytic means and large scale simulation. The experimental evaluation of algorithms for such networks is very beneficial, not only towards validating and fine-tuning algorithmic design and analysis, but also because of the ability to study the accurate impact of several important network parameters and technological details.	algorithm	Sotiris E.

0aa0483feacf008643b169d7e0fbf37b5a25baaf	an energy-efficient method for nodes assignment in cluster-based ad hoc networks	wireless ad hoc networks;clustering;energy efficiency;modeling	One of the most critical issues in wireless ad hoc networks is represented by the limited availability of energy within network nodes. Thus, making good use of energy is a must in ad hoc networks. In this paper, we define as network lifetime the time period from the instant when the network starts functioning to the instant when the first network node runs out of energy. Our objective is to devise techniques to maximize the network lifetime in the case of cluster-based systems, which represent a significant sub-set of ad hoc networks. Cluster-based ad hoc networks comprise two types of nodes: cluster-heads and ordinary nodes. Cluster-heads coordinate all transmissions from/to ordinary nodes and forward all traffic in a cluster, either to other nodes in the cluster or to other cluster-heads. In this case, to prolong the network lifetime we must maximize the lifetime of the cluster-heads because they are the critical network element from the energy viewpoint. We propose an original approach to maximize the network lifetime by determining the optimal assignment of nodes to cluster-heads. Given the number of cluster-heads, the complexity of the proposed solution grows linearly with the number of network nodes. The network topology is assumed to be either static or slowly changing. Two working scenarios are considered. In the former, the optimal network configuration from the energy viewpoint is computed only once; in the latter, the network configuration can be periodically updated to adapt to the evolution of the cluster-heads energy status. In both scenarios, the presented solution greatly outperforms the standard assignment of nodes to cluster-heads, based on the minimum transmission power criterion.

Each user represents a node in the network, and executes a neighbor discovery Typically, nodes broadcast beacon messages that are received by other participants within the sender’s communication range. Routing strategies are computed on-line based on the locations of nearby nodes, and geocasting is employed to deliver data packets to their destinations. However, mobile users may be reluctant to share their exact locations with other participants, since location can disclose private details about a person’s lifestyle, religious or political affiliations, etc. A common approach to protect location privacy is to replace exact coordinates with coarser-grained regions, based on the privacy profile of each user. In this paper, we investigate protocols that support MANET routing without disclosing exact positions of nodes. Each node defines its own privacy profile, and reports a cloaked location information to its neighbors. We adopt a novel strategy to advertise beacons, to prevent inference of node locations. We also propose packet forwarding heuristics that rely on cloaking regions, rather than point locations. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed routing scheme achieves low delays and high packet delivery ratios, without incurring significant overhead compared to conventional MANET routing protocols.	broadcast domain;geographic routing;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;location awareness;mike lesser;network packet;online and offline;overhead (computing);privacy;requirement	Gabriel Ghinita;Mehdi Azarmi;Elisa Bertino	2010	2010 Eleventh International Conference on Mobile Data Management	10.1109/MDM.2010.47	optimized link state routing protocol;routing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;internet privacy;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	-0.5432818544273148	78.34714799988355	109762

For example, a group of humans/robots may use the infrastructure to track the current location of the group members. Many such tasks require a service which keeps track of the order of occurrence of events in the application. Existing algorithms for this problem have been designed for traditional distributed systems using the layering paradigm where the algorithm is able to observe and intercept application messages. Pervasive applications, however, may not be structured as strictly layered systems. In this paper, we study the problem of event ordering in pervasive systems, and propose algorithms for detecting event ordering. Our first algorithm treats the entire network as a single graph, whereas the second algorithm operates in a hierarchical manner by subdividing the network into smaller groups. We present experimental evaluation of our algorithms using both simulation and deployment on a sensor testbed.	algorithm;distributed computing;entity;gateway (telecommunications);humans;pervasive informatics;programming paradigm;robot;sensor;simulation;software deployment;testbed;ubiquitous computing;visual intercept	Lakshman Kaveti;Sandeep Pulluri;Gurdip Singh	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications	10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912861	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;ubiquitous computing	Mobile	7.097025416260565	76.04790354312236	109818

Mobile devices, including smartphones, laptops and PDAs, associate with nearby access points that are located on the roadside to access Internet in VANETs. Hence, people can use these devices to communicate in VANETs. However, the unbalanced traffic distribution often occurs among the APs in the networks, which leads to unfair bandwidth share for each user. This situation may get worse in VANETs composed of thousands of high mobility vehicles. Hence, this study focuses on association control to achieve load balancing among APs RSUs, and we propose a novel association control algorithm with an aid of the navigation system. Based on the use of fully-fledged navigation system, our proposed algorithm plans a RSU-association-schedule, which selects a series of appropriate RSUs roadside units in advance to reach destination and meanwhile achieves load balancing among RSUs. The simulation results show that our scheme does improve the fairness and overall performance in VANETs.		Chuan-Gang Liu;I-Hsien Liu;Tsung-Ta Yang;Jung-Shian Li	2013	J.

Prolonging the network lifetime while covering the sufficient area is an important issue in WSN research. In a dense WSN the excessive use of sensors causes some problems such as congestion. Some researchers have applied the notion of extra nodes for connectivity purpose and develop the methodology that broadcast the status(on/off) information of sensor nodes to their one hop neighbors, but these approaches are able to increase the messaging and density of the WSN. In this paper we are providing an analytical method for increasing the lifetime of the WSN by maintaining the disjoint groups of sensors. An individual group can provide the whole area coverage at a time. So we can make only one group active at a time in WSN. The tessellation form after placing a group of sensor is regular rectangle.

This can produce, for instance, Augmented Reality games played with real interactions among players connected as wireless nodes in an ad-hoc network. To enable this scenario, we propose a hybrid architecture that allows client-server games to be played in ad-hoc mode. In our architecture, one of the players is also the server of the game, whereas other backup server nodes are ready to become active servers in case of disconnection of the network or in case of low energy level of the currently active server. This allows player to be engaged in the game for longer time even with limited energy and continuous mobility.

This was accomplished by leveraging the routing capabilities embedded into each node that implements the recently released and extremely lightweight ToLHnet protocol. With it, each network node can act as a sort of “smart repeater” only when there is need to, optimizing the overall network throughput. The key ideas underlying the routing strategies are here described, together with details of a prototype node and experimental results demonstrating transmission at distances well above the traditional limit.	embedded system;prototype;rs-485;router (computing);routing;software prototyping;throughput	Giorgio Biagetti;Paolo Crippa;Laura Falaschetti;Simone Orcioni;Nicola Ortolani;Claudio Turchetti	2015	2015 12th International Workshop on Intelligent Solutions in Embedded Systems (WISES)		communications protocol;routing;throughput;rs-485;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;reliability;routing protocol;computer security;internet of things;repeater;computer network	Mobile	4.802302050134083	78.70703847118821	110135
bf0cfeda5e64f1a67f2e5d3737dcfe11d54a5c4b	an adaptive sensor sleeping solution based on sleeping multipath routing and duty-cycled mac protocols	adaptive sensor sleeping;duty cycled mac protocols;multipath routing	Various applications of wireless sensor networks require multihop data transmission over error-prone wireless links, hence multipath routing can be used to meet the application's reliability requirement. On the other hand, wireless sensors are usually battery powered, and thus it is very important to save energy in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this article, we propose (1) Sleeping Multipath Routing, which can trade off reliability and network lifetime by dynamically activating an optimal number of paths to support the application's reliability requirement and putting the rest of the sensors to sleep, and (2) an adaptive sensor sleeping solution, which includes Sleeping Multipath Routing, a duty-cycled MAC protocol, and cross-layer coordination to further prolong the network lifetime by putting sensors to sleep at both the routing and the MAC layers. Our proposed Sleeping Multipath Routing and adaptive sensor sleeping solution can be implemented on any multipath routing protocol that discovers multiple disjoint paths between two nodes, and any duty-cycled MAC protocol that has fixed cycle length. We show an example of implementing our adaptive sensor sleeping solution using Directed Diffusion and S-MAC. Simulation results show that our proposed adaptive sensor sleeping solution outperforms single-layer sensor sleeping with a longer network lifetime with required reliability support. Moreover, our proposed adaptive sensor sleeping solution can significantly prolong the network lifetime when the application's reliability requirement varies over time, or when the number of alive nodes in the network changes over time.	cognitive dimensions of notations;multipath routing;sensor;simulation;wireless router	Ou Yang;Wendi B.

While high routing overhead usually has a significant performance impact in low bandwidth wireless networks, a good route caching strategy can reduce routing overheads by making use of the available route information more efficiently. In this paper, we first study the effects of two cache schemes, “link cache” and “path cache”, on the performance of on-demand routing protocols through simulations based on the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol. Since the “path cache” DSR has been extensively studied, we focus in this paper on the “link cache” DSR in combination with timer-based stale link expiry mechanisms. The effects of different link lifetime values on the performance of routing protocol in terms of routing overhead, packet delivery ratio and packet latency are investigated. A caching strategy incorporating adaptive link timeout is then proposed, which aims at tracking the “optimal” link lifetime under various node mobility levels by adaptively adjusting the link lifetime based on the real link lifetime statistics. The performance of the proposed strategy is then compared with the conventional “path cache” DSR. The results show that without a timeout mechanism, a link cache scheme may suffer severe performance degradation due to the use of broken routes, while the proposed adaptive “link cache” strategy achieves significantly improved performance by reducing the routing overhead when the network traffic load is high.	ansi escape code;cache (computing);communications protocol;elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);network packet;network traffic control;overhead (computing);simulation;source routing;timeout (computing);timer;whole earth 'lectronic link	Wenjing Lou;Yuguang Fang	2002	Wireless Networks	10.1023/A:1020327309720	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.8088859122166103	83.56448238341639	110366

While larger-scale deployment has been performed, it is typically costly and difficult to run under controlled circumstances. Simulation allows researchers to vary system configurations such as MAC layers and routing protocols. However, it requires the duplication of application, operating system, and network behavior within the simulator. While simulation and live deployment will clearly continue to play important roles in the design and evaluation of mobile systems, we present MobiNet, a third point in this space. In MobiNet, the communication of unmodified applications running on stock operating systems is subject to the real-time emulation of a user-specified wireless network environment. MobiNet utilizes a cluster of emulator nodes to appropriately delay, drop or deliver packets in a hop by hop fashion based on MAC-layer protocols, ad hoc routing protocols, congestion, queuing, and available bandwidth in the network. MobiNet infrastructure is extensible, facilitating the development and evaluation of new MAC layers, routing protocols, mobility and traffic models. Our evaluations show that MobiNet emulation is scalable and accurate while executing real code, including video playback.	emulator;hoc (programming language);mac address;network congestion;norm (social);operating system;real-time locating system;routing;scalability;simulation;software deployment	Priya Mahadevan;Adolfo Rodriguez;David Becker;Amin Vahdat	2005			vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;operating system;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	0.5114372097069179	88.13953604246099	110588

When used with highly directional antennas, these mesh networks also provide better frequency reuse. In a recent proposed architecture for such networks, a link can have multiple radio channels. However, to provide traffic engineering with scalability, it is needed to develop a distributed dynamic channel allocation algorithm to allocate channels to these links. This paper proposes a distributed dynamic channel allocation algorithm that is scalable and able to provide traffic engineering if invoked periodically. The proposed solution provides traffic engineering by optimizing link capacities by adding or removing channels from a link while maintaining interference constraints, based on current network conditions.

In this research, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is used to solve a variation of the multicommodity capacitated network design problem (MCNDP). This variation represents a hybrid communication network as found in network centric models with multiple objectives including costs, delays, robustness, vulnerability, and reliability. Nodes in such centric systems can have multiple and varying link capacities, rates and information (commodity) quantities to be delivered and received. Each commodity can have an independent prioritized bandwidth requirement as well. Insight to the MCNDP problem domain and Pareto structure is developed. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is modified and extended to solve such a MCNDP. Since the MCNDP is highly constrained, a novel initialization procedure and mutation method are also integrated into this MOEA.

Updating the sink location frequently by transmitting messages to preserve a route greatly increases the energy consumption of sensors. Therefore, methods to lower updating costs should be investigated. In this study, a cluster-based mobile sink exploration (CMSE) scheme is developed to guide data packets efficiently to mobile sinks. In this scheme, a source node can identify the sink location without knowledge of node locations, and multiple routing paths are established from a sensor to the sink to enhance network longevity. Simulation results show that compared with the use of previous methods, using the CMSE scheme helps save more energy and increases network longevity under various scenarios.

In this paper, using pseudonimity for achieving communication anonymity in networks that apply geographic-routing algorithms is explored. An Anonymous Receiver-Contention POsitioning (ARCPO) routing algorithm is proposed. Node identities (IDs) are kept anonymous. Pseudonyms, i.e., the positions of destinations, are used for data-packet delivery. The anonymity for a destination relies on the difficulty of matching its position to its ID by any observer. Position servers that provide node position information act as trusted third parties and handle identity management. Node mobility makes the use of the pseudonym momentary, and therefore can further improve privacy. The anonymity for the source and intermediate nodes in the path is also achieved because they are not required to reveal any identity information. A receiver-contention mechanism is proposed so that a next hop can be generated without local position information exchange, which otherwise may lead to severe privacy degradation. Analysis and simulation show that while ARCPO guarantees anonymous communication in ad hoc networks, its routing performance degrades moderately compared with other position routing algorithms	algorithm;elegant degradation;geographic routing;hoc (programming language);identity management;information exchange;location awareness;network packet;privacy;pseudonymity;simulation	Xiaoxin Wu	2006	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2006.873840	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;information privacy;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;internet privacy;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	-0.8443897443242638	77.96826321720128	111636

Most of present vehicle localization systems rely on Global Positioning Sytems (GPS). In urban canyons, GPS suffer from prolonged outages. Other vehicle motion sensors (e.g. gyroscopes, accelerometers and odometers) suffer from unsustainable error accumulation. This research presents a novel Cooperative Localization scheme that utilizes Round Trip Time (RTT) for inter-vehicle distance calculation, integrated with Reduced Inertial Sensor System (RISS) measurements to update the position of not only the vehicle to be localized, but its neighbors as well. We adopted the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), to limit the effect of errors in both the sensors and the neighborsu0027 positions, in computing the new location. Our scheme is also extended to account for the scenarios where some of the vehicles might experience GPS availability for a short duration. The ultimate aim of this work is to efficiently manage and coordinate this heterogeneous set of sensors/technologies into a consistent, accurate, and robust navigation system. Different scenarios using different velocities and neighborsu0027 densities were implemented. GPS updates with different percentages and error variances were also introduced to test the robustness of the proposed scheme. The scheme is implemented and tested using the standard compliant network simulator 3 (ns-3), vehicle traces were generated using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) and error models were introduced to the sensors, the initial and the updated positions. Results show that our RISS-based scheme outperforms the non-cooperative RISS typically used in challenging GPS environments. GPS updates with low error variance can enhance the accuracy of the proposed cooperative scheme and share this enhancement among the network. Moreover, we compare our proposed scheme to a GPS cooperative scheme and demonstrate the reliability of a RISS-based cooperative scheme for relatively long time duration.	global positioning system	Mariam Elazab;Aboelmagd Noureldin;Hossam S.

These airborne or satellite nodes will maintain communication links with specific ‘gateway’ nodes among the mobile ground nodes. To communicate with a node that is geographically distant or belongs to a different network partition, an ad hoc node can relay its data packets through an appropriate mobile gateway and via the range extension network. If we envision that the MANET is divided into different groups and a mobile gateway is deployed for each such group, an objective then, is to determine the trajectory of the mobile gateway to best serve the ad hoc group to which it belongs, in terms of network performance metrics such as throughput and latency. In this paper, this problem of computing the optimal position for a gateway is reduced to a linear optimization problem by means of some simplifying but realistic assumptions. We suggest methods that may be deployed to enable the gateway to follow this optimal trajectory as closely as possible (within the practical constraints imposed by its velocity and maneuverability). Simulation results for various scenarios show a 10–15% improvement in the throughput and in latency (per group containing a gateway) if a gateway has a dynamic trajectory whose locus follows the computed optimal position, as compared to a gateway that is statically placed at a regular position, or to a gateway that has a random trajectory. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

SMAC is a famous energy-efficient MAC. In SMAC, the boundary nodes problem brings seriously energy consumption. Because the bounder node follows multiple schedules in one cycle, it may deplete earlier and cause segmentation in sensor network. The paper proposes the virtual cluster aggregation algorithm to solve this problem. The algorithm reduces energy consumption of boundary nodes and extends the lifetime of entire sensor network by merging different virtual clusters. The simulation results show that the performance of SMAC with the virtual cluster aggregation algorithm obtains improvement.	algorithm;communications protocol;sensor web;sid meier's alpha centauri;simulation	Chenguang He;Xuejun Sha	2011	2011 6th International ICST Conference on Communications and Networking in China (CHINACOM)	10.1109/ChinaCom.2011.6158170	real-time computing;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;computer science;wireless network;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	8.483881877764357	80.57911901495574	112151

However, there remain problems associated to the location service that must be in place to provide accurate location data of the destination nodes. In this paper, we present a new routing algorithm called VNIBR that puts forward an efficient combination of topological and geographical routing, getting rid of the location service. This algorithm is based on a virtualization layer that allows decoupling routing logic from node identities in a radically different way. We prove by means of simulations that VNIBR consistently ensures moderate overhead and good packet delivery ratios in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches to VANET routing in urban scenarios with different vehicle densities.	algorithm;coupling (computer programming);flavors (programming language);hoc (programming language);location-based service;network packet;overhead (computing);reliability engineering;routing;simulation;swarm intelligence	Jack Fernando Bravo-Torres;Martín López Nores;Jose Victor Saians-Vazquez;Yolanda Blanco-Fernández;José Juan Pazos-Arias	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145682	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.9621472363553685	84.39978197273855	112345

However, designing an optimal logical topology for wireless sensor networks requires considering numerous factors. In this paper, we elaborately discuss these design issues and challenges. We also present a chain oriented logical topology, which offers solutions to those design issues. The proposed logical topology provides not only a communication abstraction, but also node management and resource management. The performance of the proposed topology is compared with other topologies with respect to energy consumptions, latency, and lifetime of the network.	computational complexity theory;fault detection and isolation;logical topology;multitier architecture;performance;requirement;scalability;scheduling (computing);security management;sensor;simulation;steady state;user requirements document	Quazi Mamun	2013	J.

This becomes an evident objective for sensors networks research. The IETF 6LoWPAN RFC proposal was developed in that sense to use the benefit of IPV6 over wirelessly connected sensors (WSN). The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer stack being popular in the domain of wireless sensors within constrained resources, a few 6LoWPAN adaptations already exist. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using IPv6 for sensor networks connected through powerline communication (PLC) non-wireless mediums and demonstrate possible interoperability. This document propose the first adaptation of the IEEE 802.15.4 commons standard on PLC medium. Following this standard interface, we demonstrate the possibility to carry out data on PLC with great reliability, and low power energy requirement using our WPC™ physical layer (called Watt Pulse Communication (WPC)). This allows to benefit from the development of WSN research for PLC communication networks. Moreover, such a IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN communication stack provides a generic communication standard for heterogeneous sensors networks. Thus, we finally demonstrate interoperability with tests between powerline and wireless sensor networks running IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN stacks.	interoperability;lr parser;phy (chip);power-line communication;sensor;telecommunications network;williams pinball controller	Cedric Chauvenet;Bernard Tourancheau;Denis Genon-Catalot	2010	ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications - AICCSA 2010	10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5586997	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	3.602422263383694	75.09983201491536	112665

In a DTN, messages are copied, stored and forwarded to other nodes when connection is established between nodes. Various routing protocols are designed to improve message delivery probability in networks but a very few of them consider energy constraint of nodes. In this paper we propose an Energy Aware Epidemic (EAEpidemic) routing protocol for DTNs. We extensively simulated our proposal and have shown that our proposed protocol performs better than the original Epidemic routing protocol in terms of energy consumption, message delivery probability and overhead ratio.	delay-tolerant networking;overhead (computing);routing	Bhed Bahadur Bista	2016	2016 10th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing (IMIS)	10.1109/IMIS.2016.74	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	4.4539439748261875	82.86187637274412	112686

Opportunistic Routing (OR) is a broadcast based technique widely used in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) that uses the relay node negotiation and link attributes to forward the data in the network. Multiple retransmissions in opportunistic routing increase the communication overhead in the network. Hence, node scheduling and network coding techniques are used to reduce the rate of re-transmissions in the network. In this article, we present a novel approach using Agent-based Multicast Opportunistic Routing Protocol (Agent-based MORP) to reduce the load of the source node by re-establishing the links with multicast member nodes using opportunistic link attributes of the network. The proposed protocol elects the maximum trusted relay node as the agent node to transfer the long-awaited data packets towards the destination. Agent-based MORP uses the stateless approach, where the forwarding nodes are divided into probable relay regions, and the routing paths are established on demand. The proposed protocol limits the number of re-transmissions and saves the energy in the network. Simulation results indicate that the proposed Agent-based MORP reduces the control overhead and improves the performance of opportunistic routing in wireless networks.	computer simulation;data compression;linear network coding;lossy compression;multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);relay;routing;scheduling (computing);stateless protocol;throughput	Bala Krishna Maddali;Dilip Kumar Barman	2013		10.1145/2507908.2507922	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	4.162952001806512	83.02479237132884	112821

A major obstacle to the collection of reliable performance results in a MANET test bed is poor repeatability. Our approach is to use a hybrid testbed, consisting of wireless (802.11-based) nodes and a wired network capable of emulating dynamic topologies. In this paper, we describe a testbed capable of emulating dynamic topologies, augmented by experiments on an IEEE 802.11b-based wireless network and describe the use of the testbed in research on protocols and integration for mobile ad hoc networks. We also discuss the transition of research using the testbed into part of a hands-on undergraduate course in wireless networks and mobile systems.	emulator;experiment;hands-on computing;hoc (programming language);prototype;repeatability;simulation;testbed	Scott F.

Recently, the problem of energy conservation has been addressed by applying mobile sink as an effective technique that can enhance efficiency of energy consumption in the networks. In this paper, the energy conservation problem is firstly formulated to maximize the lifetime of WSN subject to delay and node energy constraints. Then, to solve the defined energy conservation problem, a data collection scheduling with a mobile sink scheme is proposed. In the proposed approach, the sink movement is governed by a type-2 fuzzy controller to be located at the best location and time to collect sensory data. We conducted extensive experiments to study the effectiveness of the proposed protocol and compared it against the streaming data delivery (SDD) and virtual circle combined straight routing (VCCS) protocols. We observed that the proposed protocol outperforms both SDD and VCCS approaches by reducing energy consumption, minimize delays and enhance data collection quality.	cylinder-head-sector;experiment;randomness;routing;scheduling (computing);sensor node;streaming media	Davood Izadi;Sara Ghanavati;Jemal H.

The explosively growing number and varieties of smartphones impose heavy burdens on the communication infrastructures of mobile crowdsensing. The communication performance of crowdsensing may deteriorate in some high-density areas due to the overwhelming communication requests, while the wireless bandwidth in other areas may not be fully utilized with sporadic and infrequent communication requests. Therefore, it is of great necessity to consider the imbalanced utilization of wireless resources in the design of a communication paradigm in mobile crowdsensing to meet the stringent QoS requirements. To this end, in this article we propose a congestion-aware communication paradigm for sustainable dense mobile crowdsensing in order to achieve efficient load balancing and reliable communication in mobile crowdsensing.	crowdsensing;list of code lyoko episodes;load balancing (computing);network congestion;programming paradigm;quality of service;requirement;smartphone;telecommunications network	Wen Sun;Jiajia Liu	2017	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600742CM	wireless sensor network;quality of service;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;reliability;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile computing;computer security;crowdsourcing;wireless;computer network	Mobile	8.00612218924688	75.7723437570581	113114
4b682e62a01e3a2e9543addf437599ea7456edae	coverage holes recovery algorithm of underwater wireless sensor networks.		Underwater wireless sensor network nodes deployment optimization problem is studied and underwater wireless sensor nodes deployment determines its capability and lifetime. Underwater wireless sensor network if no wireless sensor node is available in the area due to used up energy or any other reasons, the area which is not detected by any wireless sensor node forms coverage holes. The coverage holes recovery algorithm aiming at the coverage holes in wireless sensor network is designed in this article. The nodes movement is divided into several processes, in each movement process according to the balance distance and location relations move nodes to separate the aggregate nodes and achieve the maximum coverage of the monitoring area. Because of gradually increasing the balance distance between nodes, in each movement process the nodes movement distance is small and reduce the sum of the nodes movement distance. The simulation results show that this recovery algorithm achieves the goal of the nodes reasonable distribution with improving the network coverage and reducing the nodes movement distance thus extends the lifetime of the underwater wireless sensor network in the initial deployment phase and coverage holes recovery phase.

Each node maintains a local estimate of the average and, at every iteration, it sends its estimate to all its neighbors and then updates the estimate by performing a weighted average of the estimates received. The average consensus protocol is guaranteed to converge only asymptotically and implementing a termination algorithm is challenging when nodes are not aware of some global information (e.g. the diameter of the network or the total number of nodes). In this paper, we are interested in decreasing the rate of the messages sent in the network as nodes estimates become closer to the average. We propose a totally distributed algorithm for average consensus where nodes send more messages when they have large differences in their estimates, and reduce their message sending rate when the consensus is almost reached. The convergence of the system is guaranteed to be within a predefined margin η. Tuning the parameter ! provides a trade-off between the precision of consensus and communication overhead of the protocol. The proposed algorithm is robust against nodes changing their initial values and can also be applied in dynamic networks with faulty links.	consensus (computer science);converge;dijkstra's algorithm;distributed algorithm;global variable;iteration;overhead (computing)	Mahmoud El Chamie;Giovanni Neglia;Konstantin Avrachenkov	2013	2013 IFIP Networking Conference		communications protocol;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	2.4971666659157115	77.4381179832888	113305

Through assigning a consecutive address block (CAB) to a node, IEEE 802.15.5 enables routing without table, which eliminates route discovery latency and reduces communication overhead and energy consumption in addition to saving storage space for routing table. With CAB, however, a node may fail in joining the mesh network due to insufficient address. To overcome the address-lacking problem, the scheme called Borrowing Address from Two-hop Neighbor (BATN) is proposed in this paper, which provides with two procedures for the nodes to join or leave the mesh, respectively. In addition, the routing scheme under BATN is presented. Both theoretical and simulation results show that the proposed BATN is better than the basic address assignment scheme introduced in IEEE 802.15.5 standard and the existing address borrowing schemes in terms of the probability of the node's successful joining the mesh network and the number of bytes used in reporting the number of children in address assigning stage.	byte;mesh networking;overhead (computing);routing table;scheme;simulation;wireless mesh network	Cong Sun;Yi-hua Zhu;Li-yong Yuan;Kaikai Chi	2015	2015 7th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)	10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266474	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;switched mesh;service set;network allocation vector;routing;neurfon;wireless sensor network;ieee 802;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;mesh networking;wireless network;shared mesh;ieee 802.11h-2003;distributed computing;order one network protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;ieee 802.11r-2008;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Embedded	6.116426391550472	81.73699243382416	113569

In this paper we explore the possibility of a scalable QoS flow set-up using a sink-tree paradigm. The paradigm initially constructs a sink tree at each egress edge router using network topology and bandwidth information provided by a QoS extended version of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), which is a widely used link-state routing protocol. Our sink-tree paradigm dynamically reallocates network bandwidths online according to traffic demands. As a consequence, our paradigm easily supports QoS routing, resource allocation, and admission control at ingress edge routers without consulting core routers in a way that the QoS flow set-up time and overhead are minimized. Simulation results are very encouraging in that the proposed methodology requires significantly less communication overhead in setting up QoS flows compared to the traditional per-flow signaling-based methodology while still maintaining high resource utilization. r 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	aggregate data;algorithm;centralized computing;differentiated services;egress filtering;end-to-end principle;link-state routing protocol;network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;quality of service;round-robin scheduling;router (computing);scalability;simulation;test engineer;uptime	James Lembke;Byung Kyu Choi	2008	J.

The most important feature of a routing protocol, in order to be efficient for WSNs, is the energy consumption and the extension of the network's lifetime. During the recent years, many energy efficient routing protocols have been proposed for WSNs. In this paper, energy efficient routing protocols are classified into four main schemes: Network Structure, Communication Model, Topology Based and Reliable Routing. The routing protocols belonging to the first category can be further classified as flat or hierarchical. The routing protocols belonging to the second category can be further classified as Query-based or Coherent and non-coherent-based or Negotiation-based. The routing protocols belonging to the third category can be further classified as Location-based or Mobile Agent-based. The routing protocols belonging to the fourth category can be further classified as QoS-based or Multipath-based. Then, an analytical survey on energy efficient routing protocols for WSNs is provided. In this paper, the classification initially proposed by Al-Karaki, is expanded, in order to enhance all the proposed papers since 2004 and to better describe which issues/operations in each protocol illustrate/enhance the energy-efficiency issues.	coherent;location-based service;mobile agent;multipath propagation;quality of service;requirement;routing	Nikolaos A.

This paper studies the routing problem in such a network. Assuming that the bus schedule is known, we maximize the delivery probability by a given deadline for each packet. Our approach takes the randomness into account, which stems from road traffic conditions, passengers boarding and alighting, and other factors that affect bus mobility. In this sense, this paper is one of the first to tackle quasi-deterministic mobility scenarios. We propose a simple stochastic model for bus arrivals at stops, supported by a study of real-life traces collected in a large urban network. A succinct graph representation of this model allows us to devise an optimal (under our model) single-copy routing algorithm and then extend it to cases where several copies of the same data are permitted. Through an extensive simulation study, we compare the optimal routing algorithm with three other approaches: 1) minimizing the expected traversal time over our graph; 2) maximizing the delivery probability over an infinite time-horizon; and 3) a recently proposed heuristic based on bus frequencies. We show that our optimal algorithm shows the best performance, but it essentially reduces to minimizing the expected traversal time. When transmissions frequently fail (more than half of the times), the algorithm behaves similarly to a heuristic that maximizes the delivery probability over an infinite time horizon. For reliable transmissions and values of deadlines close to the expected delivery time, the multicopy extension requires only ten copies to almost reach the performance of the costly flooding approach.	algorithm;bus network;delay-tolerant networking;graph (abstract data type);heuristic;internet backbone;network packet;randomness;real life;real-time clock;real-time data;routing;simulation;the times;tracing (software);tree traversal	Utku Günay Acer;Paolo Giaccone;David Hay;Giovanni Neglia;Saed Tarapiah	2012	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2011.2179072	stochastic process;routing;real-time computing;telecommunications;schedule;engineering;stochastic modelling;trajectory;delay-tolerant networking;probability;mathematics;public transport;statistics;computer network	Metrics	2.2828415474147317	88.37182541041844	113868

The proposed MOACS simultaneously optimizes the maximum link utilization, the cost of the multicast tree, the averages delay and the maximum end-to-end delay. In this way, a set of optimal solutions, known as Pareto set is calculated in only one run of the algorithm, without a priori restrictions. Experimental results obtained with the proposed MOACS were compared to a recently published Multiobjective Multicast Algorithm (MMA), showing a promising performance advantage for multicast traffic engineering.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;end-to-end principle;multicast;network topology;pareto efficiency;routing	Diego Pinto;Benjamín Barán	2006		10.1007/978-0-387-34827-8_9	engineering;artificial intelligence;distributed computing;computer network	EDA	-2.9840994082321197	81.82493315230938	113872

Notwithstanding the popularity of the protocol in the research literature in recent years, we find several practical issues that are not addressed in the original protocol description, which lead to a degree of freedom in the protocol design and implementation and have an impact on its resulting performance. These issues include the ability of the underlying physical layer and hardware to efficiently detect the activation events in the protocol, and necessary changes to the collision resolution and clock synchronization procedures in the presence of varying sleep patterns. Our results highlight the need for rigorous detail in protocol descriptions in the research literature and provide important insights into some of the common pitfalls.	clock synchronization;communications protocol;hash table;open-source software;scientific literature	Yuriy Tselishchev;Athanassios Boulis;Lavy Libman	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506096	castalia;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	9.87103578227318	86.76289335956122	113941

The road-constrained and high mobility of the vehicles, their unbounded power source, and the emergence of roadside wireless infrastructures make VANETs a challenging research topic. A key to the development of protocols for intervehicle communication and services lies in the knowledge of the topological characteristics of the VANET communication graph. This article provides answers to the general question: how does a VANET communication graph look like over time and space? This study is the first one that examines a very large-scale VANET graph and conducts a thorough investigation of its topological characteristics using several metrics, not examined in previous studies. Our work characterizes a VANET graph at the connectivity (link) level, quantifies the notion of “qualitative” nodes as required by routing and dissemination protocols, and examines the existence and evolution of communities (dense clusters of vehicles) in the VANET. Several latent facts about the VANET graph are revealed and incentives for their exploitation in protocol design are examined.	communications protocol;emergence;hoc (programming language);routing	George Pallis;Dimitrios Katsaros;Marios D.

An efficient MANET protocol may be applied to other important emerging wireless technologies such as wireless mesh and sensor networks. This paper proposes a hierarchical routing scheme that is scalable, energy efficient, and self-organizing. The new algorithm is called dynamic leader set generation (DLSG). It dynamically selects leader nodes based on traffic demand, locality, and residual energy level, and de-selects them based on residual energy. Energy consumption and traffic load are therefore balanced throughout the network, and the network reorganizes itself around the dynamically selected leader nodes. Time, space, and message complexities are formally analyzed; implementation issues are addressed. Incorporating the IEEE 802.11 medium access control mechanism including the power saving mode, performance evaluation is carried out by simulating DLSG and four existing hierarchical routing algorithms, which shows that DLSG successfully extends network lifetime by 20-50% while achieves a comparable level of network performance.	access control;algorithm;energy level;hoc (programming language);locality of reference;network congestion;network performance;organizing (structure);performance evaluation;routing;scalability;self-organization;simulation;software deployment;wireless mesh network	Melody Moh;Rashmi Kukanur;Xuquan Lin;Subhankar Dhar	2007	2007 IEEE Globecom Workshops	10.4018/jbdcn.2009091704	wireless routing protocol;cellular network;self-organization;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;efficient energy use;triangular routing;mobile computing	Mobile	5.821995584458477	81.62390998198563	114404

This paper studies ef®cient routing mechanisms for packet  ̄ooding in ad hoc wireless networks. Because a packet is broadcast to all neighboring nodes, the optimality criteria of wireless network routing are different from that of the wired network routing. We show that the minimum cost  ̄ooding tree problem is similar to MCDS (Minimum Connected Dominating Set) problem and prove the NP-completeness of the minimum cost  ̄ooding tree problem. Then, we propose two  ̄ooding methods: self-pruning and dominant pruning. Both methods utilize the neighbor information to reduce redundant transmissions. Performance analysis shows that both methods perform signi®cantly better than the blind  ̄ooding. Especially, dominant pruning performs close to the practically achievable best performance limit. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

One of the most crucial challenges in this field is the design of Protocol Interoperability to achieve the integration of MANET routing protocols and Mobile IP into the IP routing systems. This problem has not been effectively addressed by researches published thus far. This paper contributes solutions to solving this challenge. The protocol architecture and protocol interfaces are designed, which are suitable for gateways and mobile nodes in such Internet integrated MANETs supporting Mobile IP. Propagation methods of Mobile IP signalling messages with MANET routing information piggybacking are designed. Finally, an enhanced Mobile IP protocol suitable for MANET system is contributed.

This paper aims to meet one of the requirements of a smart city that detects traffic congestion in an area so that the traffic can be diverted on an alternate route in a vehicular adhoc network (VANET). VANET is a medium of wireless communication among vehicular commuters, which enables them to intimate their instantaneous physical characteristics such as speed, brake frequency, rain, fog, acceleration, and position to surrounding vehicles within a periphery so as to determine the level of congestion and find suitable ways to divert the traffic. The dynamic nature of the vehicular nodes makes the topology unpredictable, which is constantly monitored using a vehicular adhoc network (VANET). In this work, an integration of fuzzy inference rule based system (FRBS) and K-means clustering technique is explored to detect the traffic congestion under a dynamic traffic environment. FRBS is implemented through an Arduino Uno microcontroller. In this paper, four different physical vehicle attributes such as rain or fog, speed and brake frequency are considered for traffic congestion detection. This paper presents a detailed description regarding the co-ordination between vehicular units and a web server, which maintains a cloud database that preserves the data for future use.	algorithm;android;arduino;artificial neural network;cloud database;cluster analysis;converge;fuzzy rule;hoc (programming language);k-means clustering;logic programming;microcontroller;network congestion;php;quality of service;requirement;routing and wavelength assignment;rule-based system;server (computing);smart city;springer (tank);uno;web server	Urmila Bhanja;Rajesh Kumar;Amlan Routroy;Shivashis Behura;Sudipta Mahapatra	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384128	vehicular ad hoc network;smart city;cloud database;computer network;cluster analysis;noise pollution;wireless ad hoc network;server;traffic congestion;computer science	Mobile	7.042322213814993	80.61642638402387	114690

A geographic routing scheme usually combines a geographic greedy forwarding with a recovery mechanism to solve the local minima problem. Solutions proposed in the literature commonly combine greedy forwarding with the well known face routing for achieving this goal. However, the average path length in number of hops produced by face routing could be much worse than the optimal topological path in most realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new intermediate procedure between the geographic greedy mode and the recovery mode in order to improve routing efficiency in number of hops, without network overhead. It exploits the optimal topological route to base stations, obtained by beacon messages, as a resource to find better routes than the ones created by face routing. We show by simulations that the proposed hybrid approach leads to a significant improvement of routing performance when applied to combined greedy-face routing algorithms.	geographic routing	Gustavo Weber Denardin;Carlos Henrique Barriquello;Alexandre Campos;Ricardo Nederson do Prado	2011	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/j.jss.2011.03.030	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Embedded	4.071380120722523	82.49539262968138	114708

The features of ad-hoc networks include such advantages as not needing a network infrastructure and multi-hop communication. For practical use, however, the problem of terminal battery power consumption must be solved. An effective method for suppressing terminal power consumption is therefore necessary. The work reported here focuses on the battery power consumption caused by pre-communication flooding. We propose a flooding method that makes use of the characteristics of the existing DSR protocol to conserve power. We confirm the effectiveness of that method through simulation experiments. The experiments varied the cache data time to live and the parameters of the proposed method to evaluate power consumption and delay. The results show that the delay is increased somewhat, but the amount of power consumed is reduced.	ansi escape code;cpu cache;effective method;experiment;hoc (programming language);mac flooding;mathematical optimization;maximum power transfer theorem;mobile phone;optimized link state routing protocol;simulation;time to live	Masato Noto	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811407	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	EDA	5.527932564363009	82.49851157819582	115000

This paper considers finding Quality of Service (QoS) anycast path from client (source) to any one of the server in a Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) by using software agents. Proposed scheme Fuzzy QoS Anycast Routing (FQAR) operates in the following steps by integrating static and mobile agents. (1) Identification of single/multiple paths, and collection of status (residual bandwidth and link delay) of intermediate nodes from client to individual servers. (2) Inferring the QoS path from a set of multiple paths by using Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) where, FIS decision is dependent on residual bandwidth and link delay of the intermediate nodes and, (3) To maintain QoS anycast path, when path breaks due to mobility of node or due to link failure. To test the performance effectiveness of the approach, we have analysed the performance parameters like packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and control overhead. The scheme performs better as compared to route-count based anycast routing in wireless ad hoc networks.	anycast;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);mobile agent;network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;routing;serial ata;server (computing);software agent;wireless access point	Vijayashree Budyal;Sunilkumar S.

Such redundancy makes sensor networks robust under changing environments. However, without proper scheduling, the surplus sensing power will cost tremendous energy consumption to the wireless sensor nodes. A scheduling scheme based on social insect colonies is proposed here. The proposed scheme is a kind of adaptive ‘periodic on-off’ scheduling scheme that uses only local information for making scheduling decisions. The scheme is evaluated in terms of averaged detection delay, target 3-coverage hit-rate and energy consumption per successful target detection. Simulation results show that, when comparing with other generic scheduling schemes, the proposed scheme can reduce energy consumption from a minimum of 7.49% to a maximum of 90.81% and improve the target hit-rate from a minimum of 15.7% to a maximum of 58.9%. Optimisation of the network lifetime and other performances is possible by adjusting some parameters.	eusociality;scheduling (computing)	Chi-Tsun Cheng;C. K.

7134498f0f85361cdeeb739ac7f2b067a304d173	a load balancing scheme based on deep-learning in iot		Extending the current Internet with interconnected objects and devices and their virtual representation has been a growing trend in recent years. The Internet of Things (IoT) contribution is in the increased value of information created by the number of interconnections among things and the transformation of the processed information into knowledge for the benefit of society. Benefit due to the service controlled by communication between objects is now being increased by people who use these services in real life. The sensors are deployed to monitor one or more events in an unattended environment. A large number of the event data will be generated over a period of time in IoT. Hence, the load balancing protocol is critical considerations in the design of IoT. Therefore, we propose an agent Loadbot that measures network load and process structural configuration by analyzing a large amount of user data and network load, and applying Deep Learning’s Deep Belief Network method in order to achieve efficient load balancing in IoT. Also, we propose an agent Balancebot that processes a neural load prediction algorithm based on Deep Learning’s Q-learning method and neural prior ensemble. We address the key functions for our proposed scheme and simulate the efficiency of our proposed scheme using mathematical analysis.	algorithm;deep belief network;deep learning;information;internet of things;load balancing (computing);mathematical model;q-learning;real life;sensor;simulation	Hye-Young Kim;Jong-Min Kim	2016	Cluster Computing	10.1007/s10586-016-0667-5	computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;data mining;distributed computing;computer network	Web+IR	5.514124831934024	74.85698250666893	115224

In the paper, we model the routing behaviors of nodes as a noncooperative routing game, in which self-interested player’s route traffic through a congestion-sensitive network. We extend the model of selfish routing to study the dynamical behaviors of nodes, by adopting a generalized approach of imitative dynamics. We not only analyze the model’s stability and convergence, but reveal that the efficiency of P2P node’s routing can be improved when the model reach an equilibrium state. Finally we also give an algorithm and experiments on how to improve P2P traffic efficiency based on our evolutionary game model.	flow network;routing	Fang Zuo;Wei Zhang	2014	JNW	10.4304/jnw.9.01.10-17	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;static routing;simulation;hierarchical routing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;backpressure routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	ECom	-0.2644901427613335	81.49881886338609	115247

The key novelty of LAKER is that it can gradually discover knowledgeof topological characteristics such aspopulation densitydistrib ution of the network. This knowledge can be organized in the form of a setof guiding_routes, which includesa chain of important positionsbetweena pair of sourceand destination locations. The guiding_route information is learned during the route discovery phase,and it can be usedto guide futur e route discovery processin a more efficient manner. LAKER is especiallysuitable for mobility modelswhere nodesare not uniformly distrib uted. LAKER can exploit the topological characteristics in thesemodelsand limit the search spacein routediscovery processin a more refined granularity . Simulations results show that LAKER outperforms LAR and DSR in term of routing overhead,saving up to 30% broadcastrouting messagescompared to the LAR approach.	ansi escape code;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);simulation;source routing	Prasant Mohapatra	2003		10.1109/WCNC.2003.1200538	mobile ad hoc network;dsrflow;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;distributed computing;knowledge extraction;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.5409202781688065	82.4220990508475	115293

Since the amount of network state information that each node needs to maintain in order to route packets is minimal, location based routing is considered scalable compared to existing routing protocols in ad hoc networks. However, geographic routing requires location management, where the locations of destination nodes needs to be found before the actual routing can begin. Many location management schemes have been proposed in the literature, but no prior work has quantitatively compared the scalability of these protocols with respect to the increase in the number of nodes in the network. In this work, we use a theoretical framework to show the asymptotic scalability of three location management protocols. We also carry out extensive simulations to study the performance of these protocols under practical considerations. Our results indicate that all protocols perform well, with a slight performance degradation with the increasing network size. In particular, the hierarchical grid location management protocol (HGRID) performs the best for all practical purposes, and is a candidate for location management in a wireless network architecture.	elegant degradation;geographic information system;geographic routing;hoc (programming language);network architecture;network packet;scalability;simulation	Sumesh J.

bfe2a8846924726a8f12ca44eb077698ae6ea51b	a novel cross-layer communication protocol for vehicular sensor networks		SummaryrnCommunication protocols in vehicular sensor networks (VSNs) in urban areas play an important role in intelligent transport systems applications. Many cross-layer communication protocol studies are originated from topology-based algorithms, which is not suitable for the frequently changing computational scenario. In addition, the influence factors that have been considered for VSNs routing are not enough. With these aspects in mind, this paper proposes a multifactor cross-layer position-based routing protocol for VSNs to improve reliability and efficiency in message delivery. Considering the complex intersection environment, the algorithm for vehicles selection at intersections (called AVSI) is further proposed, in which comprehensive factors are taken into account including the position and direction of vehicle, the vehicle density, the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio, and the frame error rate in MAC layer. Meanwhile, the dynamic HELLO_STREAM broadcasting system with the various vehicle speeds is proposed to increase the decisions accuracy. Experimental results in network simulator 3 show the advantage of multifactor cross-layer position-based routing protocol over traditional state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of packet delivery ratio, overhead, and the mean end-to-end delay.	communications protocol	Tong Wang;Yunfeng Wang;Bingyi Liu;Xibo Wang;Jianfeng Zhang;Azhar Hussain;Yue Cao	2018	Int.

Because the same radio frequency is used for communication, readers may also interfere with the operations of other readers even if their interrogation zones do not overlap. Thus the problem of scheduling multiple readers to tags transmissions in dynamic systems has been arousing attention. This paper presents a priority based transaction method to coordinate simultaneous communications among multiple readers in order to increase the overall read rate in dynamic RFID systems. Through a contention-free scheduling, the reader-tag transmissions can be performed without collisions even the environment has hidden terminal. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, both network density and mobility of readers' join and leave are conducted in the tests. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques provide superior system throughput in both static and dynamic circumstances.	radio-frequency identification	Ching-Hsien Hsu;Chia-Hao Yu	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16576-4_23	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;dynamical system;video tracking;computer security;radio frequency;computer network	DB	5.753794338195913	88.32370918089991	115940

The performance of a sensor network depends to a large extent on the sensing coverage, and its lifetime is determined by its energy consumption. In real- world applications, it is unrealistic to guarantee all sensors have the same energy because they have different energy consumption. Moreover, sensors redeployment also results in the heterogeneous energy capacities. In this paper, an energy-efficient area coverage protocol for heterogeneous energy sensor networks (ACHE) is proposed. ACHE can achieve a good performance in terms of sensing area coverage, lifetime by minimizing energy consumption for control overhead, and balancing the energy load among all nodes. Adopting the hierarchical clustering idea, ACHE elects the active nodes based on the average residual energy of neighboring nodes and its own residual energy parameters. Our simulation study and analysis demonstrate that ACHE not only provide the high quality of sensing coverage, but also has the good performance in the energy efficiency. In addition, ACHE can better adapt the applications with the great heterogeneous energy capacities in the sensor networks.	cluster analysis;display resolution;hierarchical clustering;overhead (computing);sensor;simulation	Yingchi Mao;Xiaofang Li;Feng Xu	2008	2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing	10.4236/wsn.2010.210092	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.279046790121743	79.64423504055426	116186

This mechanism applies the idea of particle swarm optimization to peer selection of BitTorrent (BT) streaming system. First, improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is developed to overcome the shortcoming of falling easily into local optimum. Second, particle encoding and decoding are defined in the context of streaming media data scheduling, and fitness function based on the service ability of a peer is proposed. Third, IPSO-based neighbor peer selection (IPSO-NPS) algorithm is designed, in which the optimal solution of IPSO determines the set of peers providing data block resources. Simulation results show that IPSO algorithm enhances the convergence speed and accuracy, and the new data scheduling mechanism of IPSONPS reduces the startup delay of system, enhances the media playing continuity and reduces the network load.	algorithm;bittorrent;fitness function;ipso alliance;local optimum;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;scheduling (computing);scott continuity;simulation;streaming media	Yuqi Hu;Qingqing Yang	2015	JCP		scheduling (computing);bittorrent;computer science;particle swarm optimization;distributed computing	HPC	-3.2112309994942447	88.01260717844826	116187
03615b01d8e66a6d4c03ef3158de689052b0e25f	on the use of smart ants for efficient routing in wireless mesh networks	routing;ant colony optimization	Routing in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) has been an active area of research for the last several years. In this paper, we address the problem of packet routing for efficient data forwarding in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) with the help of smart ants acting as intelligent agents. The aim of this paper is to study the use of such biologically inspired agents to effectively route the packets in WMNs. In particular, we propose AntMesh, a distributed interference-aware data forwarding algorithm which enables the use of smart ants to probabilistically and concurrently perform the routing and data forwarding in order to stochastically solve a dynamic network routing problem. AntMesh belongs to the class of routing algorithms inspired by the behaviour of real ants which are known to find a shortest path between their nest and a food source. In addition, AntMesh has the capability to effectively utilize the space/channel diversity typically common in multi radio WMNs and to discover high throughput paths with less interflow and intra-flow interference while conventional wireless network routing protocols fail to do so. We implement our smart ant-based routing algorithm in ns-2 and carry out extensive evaluation. We demonstrate the stability of AntMesh in terms of how quickly it adapts itself to the changing dynamics or load on the network. We tune the parameters of AntMesh algorithm to study the effect on its performance in terms of the routing load and end-to-end delay and have tested its performance under various network scenarios particularly fixed nodes mesh networks and also on mobile WMN scenarios. The results obtained show AntMesh's advantages that make it a valuable candidate to operate in mesh networks.	algorithm;emoticon;end-to-end principle;heuristic;intelligent agent;interference (communication);mesh networking;network packet;operand forwarding;real life;routing;shortest path problem;simulation;smart card;testbed;throughput;wireless mesh network	Fawaz S.

In DCDD, the sink uses a number of receivers- called ldquoprongsrdquo-that connect to it with reliable links. Sensors split observations into many fragments and generate parity fragments with an FEC algorithm. The fragments are then distributed over the paths and simultaneously sent to the sink. The sink can reconstruct the observations if it receives a portion of the fragments that is of the same size as their original observation. We use the ns-2 simulator to examine the ability of DCDD to increase end-to-end reliability, as well as the effect of DCDD on energy consumption in the network. Our simulations show that the network where DCDD is used outperforms the network in which the sensors use only MAC retransmissions to increase reliability. DCDD makes the energy use in the network more fair and at the same time it increases the end-to-end reliability in the network. DCDD also decreases the delay in the network.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;forward error correction;sensor;simulation	Petar Djukic;Shahrokh Valaee	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.683	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	7.082975662894449	84.75566381964867	116307

In general, Connected Dominating Set (CDS) based routing is a promising approach for enhancing the routing efficiency in sensor networks. Our idea is to generate a quality based CDS algorithm, which can resolve the standing issues like cardinality, risk factor, node failures, redundant links and network dynamics. We report a systematic approach, which has three phases. Initial phase considers the issues of revoking a partial CDS tree from a complete CDS tree. Secondary and final phases make the design of the complete algorithm by considering the elimination of dominant-act nodes using an iteration process. Our findings reveal better performance than the existing algorithms in terms of hop count, CDS size and density.	algorithm;connected dominating set;iteration;routing	B.

In Zigbee, tree topology is commonly practiced to form wireless sensor networks and perform data delivery applications. In Zigbee wireless applications, data delivery failures occur constantly due to the node movements and topology changes of networks. To tackle the topology changes, conventional route reconstruction often involves huge resource consumption. In this paper, we utilize the regularity of mobility patterns to reduce the frequency of route reconstructions and achieve higher efficiency in sending data to mobile nodes. To increase the data delivery ratio, we introduce the metric of mobility-robustness in a tree topology, and propose tree construction with an objective to maximize the mobility-robustness of the constructed tree. We prove the $\mathcal{NP}$-hardness of the problem, and propose a heuristic algorithm for tree construction. The effectiveness of network topologies constructed using this mobility-robustness metric is demonstrated by NS2 simulations against a real-world scenario.	algorithm;data rate units;heuristic (computer science);mobile device;network packet;network topology;route distinguisher;routing;simulation;struct (c programming language);telecommunications link;tree network;with high probability	Wei-Ho Chung;Pi-Cheng Hsiu;Yuan-Yao Shih;Ai-Chun Pang;Yu-Kai Huang;Kuan-Chang Hung	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962644	neurfon;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;network topology;computer network	Mobile	7.676105014398418	82.90797722730176	116672

The proposed CN-MSTP protocol selects different nodes at random as projection nodes, and sets each projection node as a root to construct a minimum spanning tree by combining with interest nodes. Projection node aggregates sensor reading from sensor nodes using compressive sensing. We extend our method by letting the sink node participate in the process of building a minimum tree and introduce eCN-MSTP. We compare our methods with the other methods. Simulation results indicate that our two methods outperform the other methods in overall energy consumption saving and load balance and hence prolong the lifetime of the network.	compressed sensing	Fu Xiao;Guangwei Ge;Lijuan Sun;Ruchuan Wang	2017	Pervasive and Mobile Computing	10.1016/j.pmcj.2017.02.005	wireless sensor network;compressed sensing;computer network;computer science;distributed computing;minimum spanning tree;efficient energy use;energy consumption;sink (computing);key distribution in wireless sensor networks;load balancing (computing)	Mobile	9.369087282406475	79.64536530469435	116679

However, little study has been done on QoS routing with the aid of location information. The existing location-based routing approaches, such as flooding-based routing schemes and localized routing schemes, have their limitations. Motivated by ticket-based routing, we propose an on-demand location-aided, ticket-based QoS routing protocol (LTBR). Two special cases of LTBR, LTBR-1 and LTBR-2, are discussed in detail. LTBR-1 uses a single ticket to find a route satisfying a given QoS constraint. LTBR-2 uses multiple tickets to search valid routes in a limited area. All tickets are guided via both location and QoS information. LTBR has lower overhead compared with the original ticket-based routing, because it does not rely on an underlying routing table. On the other hand, LTBR can find routes with better QoS qualities than traditional location-based protocols. Our simulation results show that LTBR-1 can find high quality routes in relatively dense networks with high probability and very low overhead. In sparse networks, LTBR-2 can be used to enhance the probability of finding high quality routes with acceptable overhead.	display resolution;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);performance evaluation;quality of service;routing table;scheme;simulation;sparse matrix;utility functions on indivisible goods;with high probability	Chun Chang Huang;Fei Dai;Jie Wu	2004	International Conference on Parallel Processing, 2004.

It is efficient to centralize such content in a server and deliver it over a wide-area network if content is to be transmitted over a wide area and over a long distance. However, this method incurs a high ratio of overhead if the target is limited to a small area. This paper proposes a method of delivering content to a specific area via traveling mobile nodes using forwarding knowledge that is based on location information of receiving terminals. Specifically, a covered area is defined for each traveling mobile node as its forwarding knowledge, and traveling mobile nodes forward content towards the destination by selecting a node whose covered area is closer to the destination than their covered areas. We have developed an opportunistic network emulator, implemented the proposed method in it, and evaluated the proposed method by comparing it with epidemic routing in terms of arrival rate and delay time.	centralisation;delay insensitive circuit;digital distribution;emulator;network packet;overhead (computing);queueing theory;routing;server (computing)	Kazuaki Okamoto;Kazumasa Takami	2014	2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983140	routing table;routing;real-time computing;forwarding information base;telecommunications;engineering;ip forwarding;packet forwarding;network delay;computer network	Mobile	1.5293832763691917	83.09640977398801	117470

In addition to the complexity of content placement as revealed in the literature, routing video requests remains a challenging issue. Two problems must be addressed: (i) how to distribute video requests among multiple internal servers (i.e., server selection); and (ii) how to route so-generated video flows (i.e., flow routing). In this work, we jointly formulate these two problems with two traffic-engineering objectives considered, namely, minimizing maximum link utilization and minimizing total link cost. We develop fast algorithms to solve the problems with provable approximation guarantees. We then propose a hop-by-hop routing protocol, which implements the optimization solutions by generating a set of flow-splitting and routing decisions for each router/caching node. Simulation results show that our algorithms significantly outperform existing routing schemes under various system settings, reducing up to 68 percent of maximum link utilization and more than 50 percent of link cost, and supporting over 60 percent more of traffic load.	algorithm;approximation;cache (computing);canonical account;hop-by-hop transport;mathematical optimization;optimizing compiler;provable security;quality of service;regular expression;router (computing);routing;server (computing);simulation;time complexity	Jun He;Wei Song	2016	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2480063	policy-based routing;data aggregator;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;traffic engineering;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;mobile telephony;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile computing;path vector protocol;routing information protocol;server;computer network	Mobile	-1.829337843164397	83.22374921695798	117613

The objective is to find the topological layout of links at a minimal cost under the constraint that the overall reliability of constructed network is not less than a given level of system reliability. A decomposition method which is based on branch and bound approach is proposed for solving it.

Most of the routing protocols use the number of hops as path metric without considering the link condition. Expected Transmission Count (ETX) calculates the estimated number of transmissions to successfully transmit a packet, but it fails to calculate the correct number of transmissions for a TCP segment. In addition, the overhead of ETX is very high because it needs to probe all destinations to calculate the link loss probability. In this paper, we propose a novel cross layer path metric, TCP-ETX, which calculates the accurate number of transmissions for TCP segments and minimizes the protocol overhead. To evaluate our proposal, we conduct simulations and compare our solution to existing protocols, which shows that our protocol can offer a significant improvement on the TCP performance.	algorithm;etx (form factor);elegant degradation;expected transmission count;internet protocol suite;mathematical optimization;network packet;overhead (computing);routing;shortest path problem;simulation;tcp congestion control;tcp pacing;transmitter	Hengheng Xie;Azzedine Boukerche;Antonio Alfredo Ferreira Loureiro	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655110	radio link protocol;tcp delayed acknowledgment;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;bic tcp;tcp hole punching;distance-vector routing protocol;probability;distributed computing;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;cubic tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp sequence prediction attack;tcp friendly rate control;transport layer;statistics;computer network	Mobile	0.7714092854911597	86.05534403699188	117804

Publish/subscribe content dissemination techniques based on opportunistic networking and network coding-based epidemic routing are key techniques for optimizing network resources, simplifying network architecture, and providing a platform for realizing innovative networking applications and service. In this paper we consider the central problem of any pub/sub implementation, namely the problem of event dissemination, in the case of a wireless mesh network. We propose a new dissemination strategy based on the notion of semi-broadcast. In a semi-broadcast based protocol the actual content is disseminated in two phases. In the first phase only a fraction of the content is broadcasted (pushed) over the network and stored inside any node, whereas in the second phase the missed part is retried (pulled) on demand from other nodes. Thanks to network coding the partial content stored in each node at the end of the first phase is a set of random linear combinations over the whole content. This allows a very efficient recovery strategy as the missed part is found in nearby nodes with a high probability.The benefit of this approach is that only the interested subscribers, which can vary in number and position over time, can engage the pulling phase. We propose several protocols based on non-trivial forwarding mechanisms that employ network coding as a central tool for supporting adaptive event dissemination while exploiting the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions and guided to the semi-broadcast principle. We show a considerable enhancement in term of total flooding costs and full decoding rates by a self parameter control deployment during the dissemination procedure.	linear network coding;semiconductor industry	Hussein M.

Calculation of coverage hole size, the corresponding hole-healing process and discovery of nearly redundant sensors are based on the hexagonal cells into which the sensing field is virtually divided. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly improved field coverage, and indicates both the number and the influence of nearly redundant sensors in the wireless sensor network.	software deployment	Tien-Wen Sung;Chu-Sing Yang	2010	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2010.032231	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer security	Mobile	-0.2611426992369752	75.63149801026464	118372

Many centralized algorithms already exist for this purpose (used for example in spatial databases). However, these algorithms are not suited to decentralized spatial computing environments, like geosensor networks, which must operate without global knowledge of the system state and without centralized control. Unlike many existing decentralized spatial algorithms, the proposed algorithm is also able to operate in the absence of information about a node's coordinate location. This makes the algorithm suitable for applications of geosensor networks where GPS or other positioning systems are unavailable or unreliable. The algorithm approach is founded on the well-known 4-intersection model, using in-network data aggregation and spatial filtering (involving nodes only at some region boundaries). This ensures only a relatively small proportion of the network is involved in computation, thus increasing efficiency. Our analysis shows that while the overall communication complexity of the algorithm is O(n), the load balancing is optimal leading to a constant O(1) communication complexity for individual nodes. This expectation is confirmed with empirical investigation using simulation, which demonstrates the practical efficiency of the algorithm.	algorithm;centralized computing;communication complexity;computation;data aggregation;global positioning system;internationalization and localization;load balancing (computing);semantic network;simulation;spatial database;whole earth 'lectronic link	Matt Duckham;Myeong Hun Jeong;Sanjiang Li;Jochen Renz	2010		10.1145/1869790.1869850	data aggregator;computer science;load balancing;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;communication complexity;database;distributed computing;geographic information system;spatial database;information system;spatial filter	DB	3.141509473354753	79.32843543777425	118566
f6781dbe0cbc9feb209dd2edd8de5f551463e22f	a tree based chemical reaction optimization algorithm for qos multicast routing		The onset of various real-time multimedia applications in whirlwind networks prompt the necessity of QoS based multicast routing. A multicast communication creates a distribution tree structure, on which a multicast source sends a single copy of data to a group of receivers. QoS multicast routing is a non-linear combinatorial optimization problem which has been proved to be NP-complete, in which we try to find a multicast tree with minimized cost that satisfies multiple constraints. In this paper, we propose a tree based Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) Algorithm to solve QoS multicast routing problem. CRO mimics trees as molecules in a chemical reaction, and performs collision between molecules and based on potential energy, we select optimal result. Reckoning results for various random generated networks show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other existing heuristics.	algorithm;combinatorial optimization;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;multicast;np-completeness;nonlinear system;onset (audio);optimization problem;packet delay variation;quality of service;randomness;real-time transcription;routing;tree structure	Satya Prakash Sahoo;Sumaiya Ahmed;Manoj Kumar Patel;Manas Ranjan Kabat	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-03753-0_7	static routing;protocol independent multicast;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;link-state routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Networks	-2.7278169741601954	81.57885098768048	118632

Each node senses its own dynamics and chooses locally an appropriate routing size. As such stationary nodes generate little signaling traffic, however fast moving nodes choose small routing periods to mitigate the effect of mobility. Moreover, every node integrates a self regulating process that dynamically regulates the already chosen routing period to track the timely evolution of the node dynamics. The performance of our proposed routing protocol are evaluated and compared to the known OLSR through extensive simulations. First, we show that the collected network cartography maintains over time a validity ratio above 97 percent even for high node speed. Second, while our proposed routing protocol provides around 97 percent routing validity, the OLSR can hardly deliver more than 60 percent. Third, the proposed protocol provides much more throughput than OLSR and much less end to end delay at moderate to high speeds and workloads.	algorithm;cartography;hoc (programming language);optimized link state routing protocol;self-organization;simulation;stationary process;throughput	Mohamed Amine Abid;Abdelfettah Belghith	2010	ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications - AICCSA 2010	10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5586998	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.073800923586508	83.38518126786542	118921

Oblivious algorithms are inherently distributed and they can be designed to efficiently balance the network utilization. We give an oblivious routing algorithm for the class of hole-free networks, in which the nodes are topologically embedded in simple areas of the plane. Such networks appear frequently in wireless and sensor network topologies. The algorithm achieves optimal congestion and stretch. The stretch of the resulting paths is constant. The congestion is O(C∗ log n), where C∗ is the optimal non-oblivious congestion and n is the number of nodes. This congestion bound is asymptotically worst-case optimal for oblivious routing algorithms.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;embedded system;network congestion;network packet;network topology;routing	Costas Busch;Malik Magdon-Ismail	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-29222-4_30	wireless routing protocol;routing;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing	Theory	-1.5791432148174704	80.26671369738871	119119

The main objective in clustering is to identify suitable node representatives, i.e. cluster heads (CHs) to store routing and topology information; CHs should be elected so as to maximize clusters stability, that is to prevent frequent cluster re-structuring. Since CHs are engaged on packet forwarding they are prone to rapidly drop their energy supplies, hence, another important objective of clustering is to prevent such node failures. Recently proposed clustering algorithms either suggest CH election based on node IDs (nodes with locally lowest ID value become CHs) or take into account additional metrics (such as energy and mobility) and optimize initial clustering. Yet, the former method is biased against nodes with low IDs (which are likely to serve as CHs for long periods and therefore run the risk of rapid battery exhaustion). Similarly, in the latter method, in many situations (e.g. in relatively static topologies) re-clustering procedure is hardly D.

Herein, we propose LIDAR, a novel clustering method which represents a major improvement over alternative clustering algorithms: node IDs are periodically re-assigned so that nodes with low mobility rate and high energy capacity are assigned low ID values and, therefore, are likely to serve as CHs. Therefore, LIDAR achieves stable cluster formations and balanced distribution of energy consumption over mobile nodes. Our protocol also greatly reduces control traffic volume of existing algorithms during clustering maintenance phase, while not risking the energy availability of CHs. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and stability of our protocol against alternative approaches.	acorn archimedes;algorithm;cluster analysis;coefficient;depletion region;email;emoticon;energy level;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);informatics;network packet;overhead (computing);routing;scalability;simulation	Damianos Gavalas;Grammati E.

With the ever increase of scale, there comes also the problem of various communication failures. They are usually caused by hardware, software, or any other medium access contention. For the case of mobile networks, path uncertainty comes also into picture due to node mobility. All this leads to low quality of service and reduced user experience. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a novel distributed algorithm called FailDetect for the statistical estimation of the average packet loss in large-scale wireless distributed systems. It is based on a gossip mechanism, with the adding of periodic resets of the exchanged values. FailDetect is a fully- distributed scheme that does not presume time synchronization among the reset intervals for various nodes. A model and an evaluation by means of simulation and experiments show that FailDetect succeeds in evaluating the average packet loss of the network, while exhibiting low message-complexity.	consensus (computer science);distributed algorithm;distributed computing;estimation theory;experiment;network packet;quality of service;replication (computing);simulation;testbed;user experience	Andrei Pruteanu;Venkat Iyer;Stefan Dulman	2011	2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006082	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	3.3416273882820806	77.94869612183753	119318

IoT(T, n) is a wireless network of things composed of T things with n items (information) distributed on it. The aim of the permutation routing is to route to each thing, its items, so it can accomplish its task. In this paper, we present an agent-based broadcast protocol for mobile Internet of Things that uses few communication channels. The main idea is to partition things into groups according to the number of channels. In each group, an agent manages a set of things. This new protocol performs efficiently with respect to the number of broadcast rounds and runs without conflict and collision on the communication channels. We give an estimation of the upper and the lower bounds of the number of broadcast rounds in the worst case.

However, such paths can include slow or lossy links, leading to poor throughput. A routing algorithm can select better paths by explicitly taking the quality of the wireless links into account. In this paper, we conduct a detailed, empirical evaluation of the performance of three link-quality metrics---ETX, per-hop RTT, and per-hop packet pair---and compare them against minimum hop count. We study these metrics using a DSR-based routing protocol running in a wireless testbed. We find that the ETX metric has the best performance when all nodes are stationary. We also find that the per-hop RTT and per-hop packet-pair metrics perform poorly due to self-interference. Interestingly, the hop-count metric outperforms all of the link-quality metrics in a scenario where the sender is mobile.	ansi escape code;algorithm;etx (form factor);experiment;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);lossy compression;network packet;routing;stationary process;testbed;throughput	Richard Draves;Jitendra Padhye;Brian Zill	2004		10.1145/1015467.1015483	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;metrics;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.5759404559348735	85.62285312814177	119664

In our analysis, we consider a densely populated network and assume a flooding protocol for packet forwarding. We find that the behavior of packet forwarding in such an environment can be regarded as dropping a stone into a lake, and then counting the number of ripples moving out from the source (i.e., the center) to the destination. What makes the problem complicated is the node mobility during the packet forwarding. As a result, we cannot solely count the number of ripples in between as the number of hops in the path on which the packet traverses. We then derive the probability distribution function of hop counts for packet forwarding, accounting for node movements. Based on the analytical model, we then evaluate several different types of flooding mechanisms commonly adopted for target searching in ad hoc networks. Compared with existing work, which assumes a snapshot of the network and all nodes are static in the analysis, our analytical framework provides more insights for the study of efficient flooding in mobile ad hoc networks.	hoc (programming language);national supercomputer centre in sweden;network packet;packet analyzer;population;routing;snapshot (computer storage)	Jia-Chun Kuo;Wanjiun Liao	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

ae82263b5b2ce36f5a097e153012e9160e94c840	evaluation of suitable radio frequencies for data transmission in potato warehouses		During recent years, automation and optimized production processes within a variety of different agriculture sectors allowed farmers to achieve higher harvesting rates and therefore to maximize the outcome of their efforts. Besides harvesting, storing the crop is the next challenging step in improving agricultural practices. Monitoring and adjusting the environmental conditions in storage are important tasks to achieve an optimal and efficient storability. This paper focuses on the communication part of such a monitoring system. Modern warehouses are usually organized as box storage, which means that the crop to be stored is filled into boxes and then piled up in large warehouses. Selective ventilation and air conditioning ensure a maximum storage period. This paper examines which radio frequencies are suitable for transmitting sensor data from stored boxes to a sink. The obtained sensor data could be used, for example, to control the air conditioning of the warehouse more precisely. The investigations are carried out on potatoes as an example, for which first a simulation and then a prototypical sensor node is created.

e2263d73c82949bdc0a625695cd24acf6b73b40c	smartcop: enabling smart traffic violations ticketing in vehicular named data networks		Recently, various applications for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) have been proposed and smart traffic violation ticketing is one of them. On the other hand, the new Information-Centric Networking (ICN) architectures have emerged and been investigated into VANETs, such as Vehicular Named Data Networking (VNDN). However, the existing applications in VANETs are not suitable for VNDN paradigm due to the dependency on a “named content” instead of a current “host-centric” approach. Thus, we need to design the emerging and new architectures for VNDN applications. In this paper, we propose a smart traffic violation ticketing (TVT) system for VNDN, named as SmartCop, that enables a cop vehicle (CV) to issue tickets for traffic violation(s) to the offender(s) autonomously, once they are in the transmission range of that CV. The ticket issuing delay, messaging cost, and percentage of violations detected for varying number of vehicles, violators, CVs, and vehicles speeds are estimated through simulations. In addition, we provide a road map of future research directions for enabling safe driving experience in future cars aided with VNDN technology.	concurrent versions system;future internet;hoc (programming language);icn gps;issue tracking system;network packet;pressure-tolerant electronics;programming paradigm;simulation;testbed	Syed Hassan Ahmed;Muhammad Azfar Yaqub;Safdar Hussain Bouk;Dongkyun Kim	2016	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2016/1353290	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.1421690353427567	87.86751438298157	120258

They can be set up anywhere and at any time because they neither require infrastructure nor central administration. Hence they have enormous commercial and military potential. However, the bandwidth offered to users is strongly affected by radio interferences. This paper proposes a solution taking into account radio interferences at the routing level in mobile ad-hoc networks. This solution is based on an admission control and a modified version of OLSR routing protocol that considers bandwidth reservation and interferences. A comparative performance evaluation done by NS simulations shows that this solution outperforms classical OLSR in terms of maximum number of acceptable flows, bandwidth amount granted to a flow and route stability.	bandwidth (signal processing);bandwidth management;computer simulation;elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mobile device;optimized link state routing protocol;performance evaluation;quality of service;shortest path problem;simulation	Dang-Quan Nguyen;Pascale Minet	2005	Sixth International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing and First ACIS International Workshop on Self-Assembling Wireless Network	10.1109/SNPD-SAWN.2005.46	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;mobile device;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	-1.6494016924766701	85.02192266760896	120266

The scheme takes into account restricted resources i.e. battery level and optimizes its use such that the lifetime for the working of Enhanced SEP is prolonged. In accordance to that, weighted probability is calculated, for efficient election of cluster head and optimised cluster formation. Fuzzy logic control based Enhanced SEP (FLC-SEPE) minimises energy consumption required by sensor nodes for communication, mobility, Cluster Head election, and load balancing by optimising the whole process, hence increasing the lifetime of the wireless sensor network. Simulation results have shown significant improvement of FLC-SEPE, over SEP-E. Performance improvement achieved for the two cases discussed is about 76.5% and 103% respectively.	cluster analysis;computer cluster;flic (file format);fuzzy logic;load balancing (computing);logic control;mike lesser;routing;simulation;symantec endpoint protection	Mayank Mani;Ajay K.

This paper proposes two novel adaptive transmission algorithms for UWSNs to prolong lifetime. When a message becomes available for propagation at a node, the node will propagate data by multi-hop or one-hop to the master node according to the hybrid of its residual energy and a threshold. The threshold is predetermined by the master node and is not changed midway. This study applies the approaches to star topology for various combinations of internode distance, frequency and the number of nodes in a prototype hallow UWSNs. Simulation experiments show that the schemes can prolong the lifetime comparing with the existing schemes of UWSNs.	algorithm;battle of midway;experiment;prototype;sensor;serial ata;simulation;software propagation;star network	Zhongwen Guo;Jinfeng Dou;Wei Han;Guangxu Zhang;Zhengang Ha	2008		10.1145/1374718.1374731	real-time computing;computer experiment;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	8.504945203459862	82.10505580171586	120327

In this paper, to design a practical and efficient redundancy mechanism in WSNs, we firstly provide a theoretical study of packet delivery probability and average energy consumption for retransmission and redundancy mechanisms. The theoretical results indicate that in WSNs, the adaptive redundancy coding mechanism is more energy efficient than retransmission while keeping the same level of reliability in most scenarios. Then based on the mapping table and two basic design principles obtained from the theoretical analysis, we propose a reliable transport protocol ARRTP which combines the adaptive redundancy mechanism and partial retransmission. The simulation and trace-driven results both verify that when the loss probability varies from low to high, our protocol provides reliability with comparably lower energy consumption. Furthermore, compared with fixed redundancy degrees, the robustness of the adaptive mechanism are also evaluated.	associative entity;erasure code;network packet;retransmission (data networks);simulation;tracing (software)	Hao Wen;Chuang Lin;Fengyuan Ren;Hongkun Yang;Tao He;Eryk Dutkiewicz	2008	2008 IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference	10.1109/PCCC.2008.4745122	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;computer network	Embedded	7.438857296464577	85.76227151743042	120620

Such conditions make it difficult to ensure high bandwidth, low transmission delay and low packet losses required for real time multimedia streaming applications. In this paper, we propose COMUS a COgnitive radio solution for MUltimedia streaming over wireless Sensor networks which uses both cognitive radio technology and clustering mechanism to enhance spectrum and energy efficiency. In COMUS we consider clustering the MWSN nodes into different clusters to ensure low energy consumption. Furthermore, based on the nodes geographical position and the actual and the forecasted channel availability, we aim to ensure stable clusters forming. The multimedia streaming from a particular source node to the sink node, require a physical channel selection to perform the corresponding routing task. Thus, in COMUS we propose an efficient channel selection to prevent frequent channel switching which considers the PU (Primary User) activity forecasts. Our simulation results show that COMUS outperforms the two existing pioneering mechanisms called SEARCH and SCEEM and this in terms of providing higher video quality (PSNR and frame rate), lower end-to-end transmission delay and lower frame loss ratio under varied spectrum conditions.	ambiguous name resolution;central processing unit;cluster analysis;cognitive radio;end-to-end principle;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);network packet;one-class classification;peak signal-to-noise ratio;routing;simulation;streaming media	Abbas Bradai;Kamal Deep Singh;Abderrezak Rachedi;Toufik Ahmed	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289251	cognitive radio;real-time computing;energy;wireless sensor network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;cluster analysis;computer network	Mobile	8.404118849486112	84.25559292476893	120633

To improve people life quality or experience, recently the concept of IoT technology has been introduced with a higher degree of variability in term communication capability and applied applications comparing with WSN. The devices in such kind of technology are implanted with multiple radio access interfaces, usually indicated as Multiple-In and Multiple-Out (MIMO) in 5G networks. With the propagation of MIMO service in IoT machines, clustering technique for IoT systems is required to achieve energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel centralized Energy -Balancing Unequal Concentric Chain Clustering (MIMO-UCC) protocol for the IoT system in the context of the 5G environment. Which has a probability-based suboptimal multi-hop path selection algorithm to reduce the burden on the cluster head and adjusting the cluster-head diameter based on the energy level and the distance to the base station. MIMO-UCC use principal vector projection approach, which considers the location of the base station to build an unequal concentric chain clustering.	centralized computing;cluster analysis;depletion region;energy level;heart rate variability;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;mimo;organizing (structure);selection algorithm;simulation;software propagation	Mohammad Baniata;Hyunho Ji;Yongmin Kim;Jeongwoo Choi;Jiman Hong	2018		10.1145/3264746.3264747	real-time computing;mimo;concentric;selection algorithm;cluster analysis;efficient energy use;vector projection;internet of things;base station;computer science	Mobile	8.957738660231978	80.0496886133932	120810

Traditionally, all the proposals made rely solely on simulator results. However, as different research groups develop different solutions to solve problems related to these new networks, it becomes more and more important to migrate the proposed solutions to a real environment. In this work we present Castadiva, a test-bed architecture that allows validating software solutions for ad hoc networks using low-cost, of the-shelf devices and open source software. Through a friendly user interface, Castadiva offers the possibility to define and test different scenarios and traffic patterns, adding the possibility to export them to the NS-2 format for result comparison. A first evaluation of the tool reveals Castadiva as an efficient tool that offers real-life accuracy, while avoiding having a high number of mobile users available for test-bed experiments.	experiment;hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;network topology;open-source software;real life;simulation;testbed;traffic exchange;user interface	Jorge Hortelano;Marga Nácher;Juan-Carlos Cano;Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate;Pietro Manzoni	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394380	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;operating system;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	0.09643745715879316	87.77969743348741	120886

It is a decentralized network where mobile nodes can be easily deployed in almost any environment without sophisticated infrastructure support. An empirical study has been done for AODV routing protocol under single channel and multi channel environment using the tool NS2. To compare the performance of AODV in the two environments, the simulation results have been analyzed by graphical manner and trace file based on QoS metrics such as throughput, packet drop, delay and jitter. The simulation result analysis verifies the AODV routing protocol performances for single channel and multi channel. After the analysis of the simulation scenario we suggest that use of Parallel MAC (PMAC) may enhance the performance for multi channel.	case-based reasoning;graphical user interface;hoc (programming language);network packet;pmac (cryptography);performance;routing;simulation;throughput	Md.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of these methodologies which transform current Internet communication to Machine-to-Machine (M2M) basis. The IoT can seamlessly connect the real world and cyberspace via physical objects that are embeded with various types of intelligent sensors. The opportunistic networks are the variants of Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). These networks can be useful for routing in places where there are few base stations and connected routes for long distances. In an opportunistic network, when nodes move away or turn off their power to conserve energy, links may be disrupted or shut down periodically. These events result in intermittent connectivity. When there is no path existing between the source and the destination, the network partition occurs. Therefore, nodes need to communicate with each other via opportunistic contacts through store-carry-forward operation. In this paper, we present the design of an integrated intelligent system for IoT device selection and placement in opportunistic networks using Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithm. We introduce the system structure and present in details the design and implementation issues.	artificial intelligence;cyberspace;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;internet of things;machine to machine;network partition;object storage;pid;routing;sensor;software release life cycle	Miralda Cuka;Donald Elmazi;Ryoichiro Obukata;Kesuke Ozera;Tetsuya Oda;Leonard Barolli	2017	2017 31st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (WAINA)	10.1109/WAINA.2017.178	fuzzy logic;communications protocol;routing;the internet;genetic algorithm;intelligent decision support system;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;fuzzy set;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Robotics	-1.8571951273345286	80.57762537559856	121050

Each mobile node determines its own transmission power based only on its local information. The proposed algorithm first constructs local SPTs from the initial graph, after which the total power consumption is further reduced by allowing each mobile node to search the replaceable links individually. The constructed topology ensures network connectivity, and possesses the following desirable energy-efficient features: (i) the power stretch factor is bounded and can be predetermined, (ii) the power consumption is evenly distributed among the mobile nodes, and (iii) the total power consumption is lower than that obtained by the best known algorithms. The performance improvements of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through extensive simulations. We conclude our work with a discussion of future research directions toward more integrated mobile network architectures. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We propose an integrated approach that combines core migration with local search to afford the receivers a consistent quality service. The main ideas are always to migrate the core to the topological center of multicast tree within limited overhead and to provide multiple routes via local search for a new receiver to meet its quality requirements. Our algorithm aims to meet a predefined upper bound delay along path to individual receiver and satisfy the constraint of inter-destination delay variation among all receivers. In simulation results, it is shown that the proposed algorithm approximately provides the cost saving of 10%, the maximum delays of 25% and the inter-destination delay variation of 12%, compared to the existing approaches.	algorithm;local search (optimization);multicast;overhead (computing);quality of service;requirement;simulation	Wu-Hong Tsai;Yuan-Sun Chu	2008	22nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Workshops (aina workshops 2008)	10.1109/WAINA.2008.224	real-time computing;computer science;local search;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;computer network;satisfiability	EDA	-2.8192974250253906	82.73292164714353	121276

In this paper, a novel real-time routing protocol for WSNs is proposed for guaranteeing real-time communication. Additionally, energy-efficiency that prolongs the network lifetime is fully considered. Performance analyses and simulation results show that our protocol has much better performance than Directed Diffusion [2] and Rumor Routing [5] in terms of both communication delay and network lifetime.	overhead (computing);real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;routing;simulation	Li-Ming He	2009	2009 10th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligences, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing	10.1109/SNPD.2009.110	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Embedded	7.0492373920680516	83.17182261022205	121456

The performance of the gradient algorithm is compared to the lower bounds as well as to some algorithms in the literature. Significant reduction of h is obtained with the use of the gradient algorithm, especially for highly skewed traffic distributions. For a ShuffleNet with N = 64 nodes, theh found is only 22% above the lower bound for the uniform random traffic distribution, and 14.7% for a highly skewed traffic distribution with skew factor	algorithm;combinatorial optimization;gradient descent;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Kwan Lawrence Yeung;Tak-Shing Peter Yum	1998	IEEE/ACM Trans.

The objective of this protocol is increasing the lifetime of the sensor network by uniformly distributing the clusters on the wireless sensor network by reclustering the whole network repeatedly. The uniform distribution of clusters on the network provides efficient coverage of that network. Efficient coverage means that the clusters are neither overlapped nor leaving nodes in the network unclustered. Each sensor node uses the energy level, local density within its sensing range and time as parameters for clustering, re-clustering, and merging existed clusters by using fuzzy logic technique. The proposed protocol requires neither a prior knowledge of the sensor locations nor a centralized controller for clustering the sensor nodes. A comparison was conducted and found that the new protocol distributes clusters uniformly as good as ACE protocol and prolong the network lifetime in magnitude of 100% more than ACE.	ace;centralized computing;cluster analysis;energy level;fuzzy logic;inference engine;sensor node	Yahya M.

96db469b33189d92b409e786216e122e63efc3b8	abort: acknowledgement-based opportunistic routing protocol for high data rate multichannel wsns		The ease of deployment and the auto-configuration capabilities of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) make them very attractive in different domains like environmental, home automation or heath care applications. The use of multichannel communications in WSNs helps to improve the overall performance of the network. However, in heavy traffic scenarios, routing protocols should be adapted to allow load balancing and to avoid losing data packets due to congestion and queue overflow. In this paper, we present an Acknowledgement-Based Opportunistic Routing (ABORt) protocol designed for high data rate multichannel WSNs. It is a low overhead protocol that does not rely on synchronization for control traffic exchange during the operational phase of the network. ABORt is an opportunistic protocol that relies on link layer acknowledgements to disseminate routing metrics, which helps to reduce overhead. The performance of ABORt is evaluated using the Cooja simulator and the obtained results show that ABORt has a high packet delivery ratio with reduced packet end-to-end delay compared to two single channel routing protocols and two multichannel routing protocols that use number of hops and expected transmission count as routing metrics.	acknowledgement (data networks);auto-configuration;channel router;data rate units;duty cycle;end-to-end principle;expected transmission count;home automation;information exchange;load balancing (computing);network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;routing;simulation;software deployment;synchronization (computer science);traffic exchange;tree accumulation;uncompressed video	Hamadoun Tall;Gérard Chalhoub	2017	J.

This problem consists of selecting the number of routers and their types, selecting the interface card types, connecting the access and the backbone links to the ports and selecting the link types between the co-located routers. Furthermore, the model considers the routing of the IP traffic. The performance guarantees we refer to are bandwidth guarantees between the routers for the normal state of the POP and also for all failure scenarios of interest to the network planner. A tabu search heuristic to find solutions for real-size instances of the problem is proposed. Finally, we present a systematic set of experiments designed to assess the performance of the proposed heuristic.	internet protocol suite	Steven Chamberland	2005	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2004.05.010	internet protocol;communications protocol;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;the internet;simulation;telecommunications;experience design;tabu search;computer science;point of presence;mathematical model;bandwidth;computer network	Metrics	-4.46950356146314	78.39901941794959	122028

Most of them focus on how to organize the peer connections into an efficient overlay network. Due to the variation in the network, a lot of overhead is generated when the overlay structure adapts to the changes. In order to minimize the impact of network fluctuation, we proposed a scheduling algorithm which helps to distribute stream data efficiently through the fluctuating networks. It needs only partial information about overlay structure and provides the services to satisfy most number of users. The global latency experienced by peers in the system is thus minimized. To alleviate the problem of packet loss along the overlay, we introduce retransmission requests into our scheduling algorithm. Requests for much needed data are treated with higher priority. Parent peers which receive the request will re-send the missing data to minimize the loss impact. The missing data which are needed by more peers will have a larger cumulative impact through the tree overlay and these are thus scheduled and sent earlier. Simulation results showed that our prioritization and scheduling algorithm minimizes the negative impact of fluctuation and data loss in a dynamic network environment. J. Li (B) · C. K.

In order to balance the energy consumption of the nodes around the base station, a reasonable and effective mechanism of node rotation dormancy is put forward. In this way, a large number of redundant nodes in the network are in a dormant state, so as to reduce the load of important nodes around the base station. The problems of the redundant nodes in the sensor network are analyzed, and a new method is proposed to distinguish the redundant nodes based on local Delaunay triangulation and multi node election dormancy mechanism. The experimental results showed that this method could effectively distinguish the redundant nodes in the network; at the same time, through the multi round election mechanism, parts of redundant nodes are made dormant. In summary, they can reduce the network energy consumption on the condition of guaranteeing the original coverage.	algorithm	Bo Feng;Wei Tang;Guofa Guo	2017	iJOE		real-time computing;delaunay triangulation;engineering;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	8.57469483990549	79.92424965398783	122221

At the expense of some bandwidth wastage, this approach can reduce multicast state and tree management overhead at transit routers. It may also simplify and facilitate the provisioning of QoS guarantee for multicast in future aggregated-flow-based QoS networks. We formulate the tree sharing problem and propose a simple intuitive algorithm. We study this algorithm and evaluate the trade-off of aggregation vs. bandwidth overhead using simulations. Simulation results show that significant aggregation is achieved while at the same time bandwidth overhead can be reasonably controlled.	aggregate data;algorithm;differentiated services;multicast;multiprotocol label switching;overhead (computing);provisioning;quality of service;router (computing);routing;scalability;simulation	Aiguo Fei;Jun-Hong Cui;Mario Gerla;Michalis Faloutsos	2001		10.1007/3-540-45546-9_13	multicast;scalability;the internet;flow network;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;tree structure;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;service quality;tree;bandwidth;xcast;statistics;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-4.309003248002327	76.93917145758577	122326

A typical example illustrating how network coding improves the throughput of wireless networks. Abstract—Efficient and reliable communications is a critical issue in wireless networks with lossy links. In this paper, we propose a neighbor-assisted coding aware opportunistic retransmission mechanism to increase the network throughput. The key idea behind our design is as follows. If a node fails to receive a packet due to link loss, its neighboring node(s) receiving the packet can assist the retransmission of the packet, possibly encoded with other packet(s) via localized network coding, if such retransmission is expected to be beneficial. This can effectively reduce the total number of packet retransmissions at the MAC layer. Simulation results show that our proposed mechanism can significantly increase the network throughput as compared with existing work.	flow network;linear network coding;lossy compression;network packet;reliability (computer networking);retransmission (data networks);simulation;throughput	Yan Yan;Zhuang Zhao;Baoxian Zhang;H.

All suggested solutions have a common goal: To build and maintain structures (routing tables) that can be used to route messages. Several of the proposed algorithms focus on efficiency of bandwidth usage. However, their behavior is uncertain in the presence of highly dynamic environments, or serious disasters (i.e. half of the nodes crashing). In this paper we present an alternative approach to managing routing tables for peer-to-peer routing overlay networks, based on the Newscast epidemic protocol [1].

Fault tolerant strategy adapts scheduling of sensors and choosing a fault tolerant path caused by fault due to lack of energy in the network. The Fail Safe Fault Tolerant (FSFT) serves as a solution to HOT SPOT in the WBSN. The lifetime enhancement of FSFT is made possible by classifying the data packets based on the state of the subject, scheduling the sensors connected to Human body and based on the residual energy of the node. Markovian model helps in prediction the state of the subject and scheduling the wearable body sensors. Simulation results shows that the proposed algorithm increases the lifetime of the network approximately 40 % and increases the throughput of the network by 120 %. FSFT decreases the HOT SPOT and Energy Hole problem providing a fail safe mechanism to the system.		G. R. Kanagachidambaresan;A.

Most consumption energy of the sensor nodes is used for communication parts. MAC protocols directly control the communications in network; therefore, in this paper we design an innovative contention-based MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks to provide long network lifetime. Our MAC protocol embeds some extra information in long wake up preamble frame and it also uses collision avoidance signaling and handshaking. These ideas help wireless nodes to stay at sleep mode as much as possible. This protocol avoids major energy waste causes, such as idle listening, collision and overhearing, without compromising other network performance measures like latency. Our simulation results and analyses show that with dynamic traffic load, ET-MAC protocol achieves significant improvement in energy-efficiency and throughput, over well known MAC protocols like B-MAC.	b-mac;handshaking;idle (cpu);network performance;sensor;simulation;sleep mode;throughput	Hadi S.

In particular, we show that under a common technique of selection of RSUs by OBUs based on the received signal strength, a vast variability of a number of OBUs connected to RSUs can be observed leading to inefficient/unfair service provided by RSUs.To overcome this problem, we propose an algorithm for RSU selection called RSEL to obtain even attachment of OBUs to RSUs. Its objective is to approach the best solution in terms of minimizing variability of the number of OBUs connected to each RSU and, as a result, increase fairness of access to services in V2I communications. We analyzed five scenarios referring to different RSU location schemes for two VANET topologies: considering urban environment and a multilane highway. As confirmed via simulations, the average fairness of RSU load (based on Jain's formula) was improved up to 50%, while the value of user-perspective fairness measure of collision-free transmissions, introduced in this paper, was increased up to 35%.

Such mesh networks typically comprise a wireless backbone connected to the wired infrastructure with wireless client residing at the edge. The wireless routers and access points of a wireless mesh network (WMN) are connected by shared links that often use the same channel. The capacity of a WMN depends on several factors such as network size and topology, traffic profile, number of radio interfaces per node, number of radio channels, channel assignment scheme, routing algorithm etc. In this paper, we describe an analytical framework for capacity estimation using the notion of collision domains. Furthermore, we analyse the capacity of WMNs under various scenarios to study the impact of different network parameters.	algorithm;collision domain;internet backbone;mesh networking;network planning and design;news aggregator;router (computing);routing;serial experiments lain;wireless access point;wireless mesh network;wireless router	Nadeem Akhtar;Klaus Moessner	2008	2008 3rd International Conference on Communication Systems Software and Middleware and Workshops (COMSWARE '08)	10.1109/COMSWA.2008.4554487	wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;switched mesh;service set;wi-fi;routing;cognitive radio;wireless wan;wireless site survey;logic gate;metropolitan area network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;mesh networking;wireless network;shared mesh;distributed computing;interference;order one network protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;channel capacity;network topology;bandwidth;wireless;grid computing;computer network	Mobile	-1.8791908342717338	84.90881709804907	122800

However, developing and designing a successful PBS is challenging. This work proposes a novel problem called station decision problem for bicycle ad hoc networks. The problem is to find the minimum number of bike stations required while satisfying reachability and richness conditions. After that, practical geographic concerns, such as unreachable areas and maximum distances, are considered. Station decision algorithms are provided, with simulations conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. Real site data are also plugged in to show the result of the station decision algorithms.	algorithm;decision problem;distance-vector routing protocol;hoc (programming language);reachability;simulation;unreachable memory	Wen Ouyang;Chang-Wu Yu;Kun-Ming Yu;Ko-Jui Lin;Hsin-Wen Chang;Hung-Nien Hsieh;Lin-Li Tai;Chung-Han Lin	2014	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2014.064347	simulation;computer science;cycling;reachability;computer security;computer network	ECom	2.65553421649181	75.21590740140464	122959

The objective is to find a multicast tree to deliver a message from a source to multiple destinations in minimum delay time. This paper introduces a new delay measure called reception-and-processing delay that takes nodal processing delays into account for constructing multicast trees. In the process of constructing a multicast tree, the branches of the multicast tree may intersect or overlap with each other. An efficient method is devised to avoid this undesirable phenomenon. Several heuristic algorithms are developed for constructing multicast trees. The performances of the heuristic algorithms are studied via simulation. Our simulation results show that constructing the multicast tree by iteratively attaching the destination node with the smallest reception-and-processing delay to the current multicast tree yields the lowest average multicast delay among the heuristic algorithms studied in this paper.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;heuristic;multicast;overlap–add method;overlay network;performance;processing delay;simulation	Hwa-Chun Lin;Tsung-Ming Lin;Cheng-Feng Wu;Hsiu-Ming Yang	2010	International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications	10.1109/ISPA.2010.44	multicast;overlay network;protocol independent multicast;computer science;theoretical computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Arch	-3.5438552488920743	82.91317813324852	123088

It typically consists of a base layer and some additional layers that provide enhanced video quality. The multicasting operation of layered video consists of many receivers dynamically joining and leaving different multicast sessions of different layers depending on their network condition. A layered video multicasting system needs to satisfy: (i) bounded end-to-end delay from the video source to each receiver; (ii) minimum total cost; and (iii) minimum delay jitter between the various video streams received by each receiver. The problem of computing such data distribution paths is NP-complete. This paper presents a new heuristic algorithm, called layered video multicast super-tree routing algorithm, with OðRnÞ time complexity and OðRÞ message complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the network and R is the receiver group size. Our investigation shows that the multicast data paths computed by our algorithm can always satisfy the delay constraint with reasonably low total cost. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

cc6dcef17297cee68564819ef0c560765ffb5dd7	enhanced caching for geocast routing in vehicular ad hoc network		In vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), the major challenge for routing protocol is to find a route from the sender to the destination without any preconfigured information under constantly varying link circumstances. Topology-based routing is strictly avoided because of frequent changes in the topology. The approach of position-based routing relies only on geographical position information to deal with the problem of dynamic topology changes. Also, in most of the intelligent transport system (ITS) applications such as collision warning, advertising, alerts message, information needs to be disseminated in a predefined geographical region. That is why, position-based geocast routing is a suitable candidate for VANETs since position information is already available from navigation systems. In this paper, we have proposed a novel geocast routing protocol named “Enhanced Caching for Geocast routing (ECGR)” that takes the advantage of “Geocast in Vehicular Environments: Caching and Transmission Range Control for Improved Efficiency (CTRC)” and can be used in various ITS applications. The main contribution of our work is to introduce a novel coverage determination algorithm. This algorithm improves the caching methodology of CTRC and almost eliminates the packet loss due to high-speed movement of vehicles. Our new protocol also improves the throughput of the system by eliminating the range-forwarding approach of CTRC and using full radio transmission range of the vehicles to forward packets.	cache (computing);geocast;routing	Omprakash Kaiwartya;Sushil Kumar	2013		10.1007/978-81-322-1665-0_20	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast	Mobile	3.4531726721731086	83.492644173866	123512
fcd72f373651118a67a2d01ce980f83f9bea4b45	a distributed algorithm for monitoring an expanding hole in wireless sensor networks		Holes in sensor networks are regions that have no operating nodes and that may occur due to several reasons, including cases caused by natural obstacles or disaster suffered areas. Determining the location and shape of holes can help to monitor these disasters (such as volcano, tsunami, etc.) or help to make smart, early routing decisions for circumventing a hole. There are many hole determination algorithms proposed in the literature, however, these only consider the networks with static holes i.e. with stable boundary nodes. Moreover, most of these are designed in a centralized manner which is not suitable to the unstable situation of networks with an expanding hole. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic scheme not only for determining the initial shape but also for monitoring and quickly reporting about the area of a hole gradually expanding. Our algorithms are designed in a distributed manner and our initial simulation results show that our protocol is lightweight and feasible with monitoring sensor networks with an expanding hole.	distributed algorithm	Khanh-Van Nguyen;Phi-Le Nguyen;Phan Van Hau;Duc-Trong Nguyen	2016	Informatica (Slovenia)		simulation;distributed computing;computer security	Mobile	8.031833277726967	77.92833497160508	123523

Based on the analysis of the multipath routing and congestion control strategy, we propose a dynamic congestion control based multipath routing protocol (DccMR). DccMR establishes and maintains redundant multiple paths with very low routing overhead. A dynamic congestion control strategy is applied to adjust packets routing in a load-aware manner. When all shortest paths broken, a route update procedure will be initiated by the destination node, in which new paths will be reestablished whereas the video transmission will not be interrupted. Simulation results show that our protocol can decrease routing overhead significantly and improve the real-time video transmission quality.	backup;control theory;experiment;hoc (programming language);interrupt;multipath routing;network congestion;overhead (computing);peak signal-to-noise ratio;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;shortest path problem;simulation	Yang He;Zhenyong Chen;Yuheng Liu;Zhang Xiong	2008	2008 International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage	10.1109/NAS.2008.28	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.4804926115057013	83.76329478329212	123693
e29c0e2062207ab6c1c4a598dea76e43be94db62	a hole-tolerant redundancy scheme for wireless sensor networks	journal	Maximizing network lifetime while not sacrificing coverage and connectivity in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has attracted many researches during the past few years. One common approach is node scheduling which dynamically schedules some redundant nodes to shut down and keeps alive some necessary nodes to preserve network performance. Previous researches focus either on guaranteeing coverage and connectivity or sacrificing coverage and connectivity to conserve energy. In this paper, we introduce a new hole-tolerant redundancy scheme (HRS) which can prolong network lifetime while maintaining coverage and connectivity performance. This HRS scheme can tolerate some coverage holes when determining redundancy eligibility, so it shuts down more nodes when hole tolerance is higher. Our work takes into account both homoradius WSNs and heteroradius WSNs. The simulation results show that (1) the average coverage percentage varies mildly but network lifetime is prolonged as hole tolerance increases; (2) HRS outperforms several existing lifetime maximization schemes.	expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;network performance;rendering (computer graphics);scheduling (computing);simulation	Juhua Pu;Yu Gu;Yi Zhang;Jia Chen;Zhang Xiong	2012	IJDSN	10.1155/2012/320108	real-time computing;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.719801409149907	79.94667086156905	123709

Network routing is one such application that can be mapped to an agent-based approach. The performance of any agent-based system will depend on the size of its agent population. Although a significant amount of research has been conducted on mobile agent-based systems, little consideration has been given to the importance of dynamically and autonomously adapting the size of the agent population as function of circumstances in the environment. A large number of constituent agents can consume considerable amounts of network resources, thereby impeding the overall performance of the network. Hence, it is imperative to have a control mechanism whereby the agent population can be adjusted in a distributed manner to balance the resource overhead in the network. This paper briefly discusses an agent-based approach to Distance Vector Routing, referred as Agent-based Distance Vector Routing. It also describes a framework for an adaptive approach to control the number of agents in the network using pheromones and discusses its limitations.		Kaizar Amin;Armin R.

Abstract. This paper studies the location management problem in PCS network. An adaptive direction-based location update (ADBU) scheme is proposed in which a line-paging method is adopted to minimize the paging cost and an adaptive direction-based scheme is formulated for location update generation. Mobile terminals inspect their directions and a location update will be generated when the change in the direction of a mobile terminal is greater than the direction threshold. In the paper, we assume that the movement of a mobile terminal in a period of time can be divided into steps and each step has a destination. Then, we use a Gauss-Markov process to model the movement of a mobile terminal in each step. With the Gauss-Markov model and a feedback control mechanism, we estimate the optimal value for the direction threshold with the attempt to minimize the update cost and at the same time limit the paging cost using line-paging. Performance results have shown that the performance of ADBU is significantly better than another direction-based update scheme and the distance-based scheme a result of smaller paging cost and update processing cost.	feedback;markov chain;markov model;mobile phone;optimization problem;paging;personal computer;simulation	Dong-Xiu Ou;Kam-yiu Lam;De-Cun Dong	2002		10.1007/3-540-46146-9_41	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;feedback;statistics	Mobile	-2.105425599926466	77.74690275515637	123847

In this paper, the authors propose a cross-layer protocol for cooperative wireless sensor networks, inspired by the collaborative behaviour of ant groups. The fuzzy heuristic information modelling is proposed to assist the clustering and routing processes at network layer. A resultant relaying threshold is combined with an adaptive invoking of cooperative modulation diversity, at link and physical layers. Simulation results show the performance enhancement in network lifetime and packet loss rate, compared with another cross-layer cooperative system. The evaluation of energy consumption distribution and a comparison between the performance of fuzzy and crisp modelling are also provided.	ant colony optimization algorithms;cluster analysis;consensus dynamics;cooperative mimo;heuristic;information model;mathematical optimization;modulation;network packet;resultant;routing;scalability;simulation	Marcelo Portela Sousa;Waslon Terllizzie A.

Due to this high density of nodes, it is very likely that both spatially correlated information and redundant data be detected by several nearby nodes, which can be exploited to save energy by these nodes that are sensing an event. In this work, we propose an Energy-Aware Spatial Correlation mechanism (ESC) based on correlation regions to perform efficient data collection. The sensed information of a region is forwarded to the sink by only one node inside that region. Also, the area of a correlation region can be changed dynamically by the sink node to achieve the required accuracy of the sensed information. Simulation results show that using ESC, an event can be sensed with 97% of accuracy, and 75% of the nodes' residual energy can be saved within the phenomena area when compared with the classical approach for data collection.	algorithm;routing;simulation	Leandro A.

Our system requires an extremely high level of robustness and efficient power optimization techniques. By modeling the faults, we evaluate the probability of having failures in network. Then we study two problems of placement and routing in the sensor networks such that the fault tolerance is maximized while the power consumption is minimized. We develop efficient methodology to address these problems and perform both placement and routing simultaneously. This ensures that the solution is a lower bound for both problems. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques on a variety of benchmarks.	benchmark (computing);fault tolerance;grid network;high-level programming language;mathematical optimization;place and route;regular expression;robustness (computer science);routing;sensor	Roozbeh Jafari;Foad Dabiri;Bo-Kyung Choi;Majid Sarrafzadeh	2005		10.1145/1066677.1066882	routing;fault tolerance;static routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;geographic routing;routing;computer network;placement	EDA	3.999768542140056	75.61206885492857	124726

However, when actuator nodes in a field execute the applications, the sink node does not have to collect all the sensing information, but each actuator node collects the information required for its application. We aim to collect the required information to each actuator node, and generate a group whose members are source sensor nodes involved by each actuator node. We propose a protocol to efficiently collect sensing information of grouped source nodes. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that actuator nodes can collect the information and that the proposed protocol can decrease the number of packets transmitted in the network.	experiment;network packet	Yohsuke Ishikawa;Hiraku Okada;Katsuhiro Naito;Kentaro Kobayashi;Masaaki Katayama	2015	2015 Third International Symposium on Computing and Networking (CANDAR)	10.1109/CANDAR.2015.33	embedded system;ring network;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;engineering;brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;node;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	9.360759035254828	77.88266830951466	125004

Assuming that the link delays are random variables with continuous and differentiable probability density function and using the central limit theorem this problem can be formulated as a path problem which involves simultaneously optimizing two additive path parameters. Two cases arise. When there is one path with mean delay less than the delay bound, we present an exact pseudo polynomial algorithm, a fully polynomial time /spl epsi/-approximation algorithm and a strongly polynomial heuristic algorithm. In the unlikely case when this assumption is violated, the problem is shown to be NP-hard and no constant factor approximation algorithm exists if P /spl ne/ NP. We also study the path protection problem under inaccurate state information.	apx;approximation algorithm;directed graph;exact algorithm;heuristic (computer science);lagrangian relaxation;line search;linear programming relaxation;np-hardness;p versus np problem;path protection;polynomial;shortest path problem;telecommunications network;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ying Xiao;Krishnaiyan Thulasiraman;Guoliang Xue	2004	First International Conference on Quality of Service in Heterogeneous Wired/Wireless Networks	10.1109/QSHINE.2004.11	heuristic;time complexity;random variable;mathematical optimization;probability density function;directed graph;widest path problem;fast path;longest path problem;central limit theorem;probability;shortest path problem;computational complexity theory;statistics	EDA	-4.122471923666129	81.6907120391059	125337
fd0cf50e1fc5031392be18c34087177ddd9cb036	beacon-less mobility assisted energy efficient georouting in energy harvesting actuator and sensor networks		In the next years, wireless sensor networks are expected to be more and more widely deployed. In order to increase their performance without increasing nodes’ density, a solution is to add some actuators that have the ability to move. However, even actuators rely on batteries that are not expected to be replaced. In this paper, we introduce MEGAN (Mobility assisted Energy efficient Georouting in energy harvesting Actuator and sensor Networks), a beacon-less protocol that uses controlled mobility, and takes account of the energy consumption and the energy harvesting to select next hop. MEGAN aims at prolonging the overall network lifetime rather than reducing the energy consumption over a single path. When node s needs to send a message to the sink d, it first computes the “ideal” position of the forwarder node based on available and needed energy, and then broadcasts this data. Every node within the transmission range of s in the forward direction toward d will start a backoff timer. The backoff time is based on its available energy and on its distance from the ideal position. The first node whose backoff timer goes off is the forwarder node. This node informs its neighborhood and then moves toward the ideal position. If, on its route, it finds a good spot for energy harvesting, it will actually stop its movement and forward the original message by using MEGAN, which will run on all the intermediate nodes until the destination is reached. Simulations show that MEGAN reduces energy consumption up to 50% compared to algorithms where mobility and harvesting capabilities are not exploited.	algorithm;backoff;computer simulation;geographic routing;institute for operations research and the management sciences;megan;performance;sensor;timer	Nathalie Mitton;Enrico Natalizio;Riaan Wolhuter	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39247-4_24	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	8.547555590740014	81.18699837204919	125339
37230603dac66b66849b2e97bb5d17bc67f25ddf	a predictive algorithm for mitigate swarming bees through proactive monitoring via wireless sensor networks	wireless sensor network;data reduction;environmental monitoring	Swarming is the massive outflow of the bees in a hive, whose most common causes are high temperatures, lack of food, stress and humidity changes. Among the types of swarming, one in which the complete abandonment of the hive occurs, has created large losses to Brazilian beekeepers, especially the Northeast. In an attempt to mitigate this problem, we propose in this paper a system for monitoring hive, via a wireless sensors network capable of identifying the preswarming colony behavior. Through a pattern of collections obtained from the cyclical behavior daily temperatures, we developed a predictive algorithm based on pattern recognition techniques, able to detect the increase in temperature in the hive (microclimate) responsible for the typical stress of bees that culminates in swarming. This mechanism is also able to recognize and avoid sending redundant information over the network in order to reduce radio communication, thereby reducing costs of data transmission and energy.	algorithm;apache hive;pattern recognition;sensor	Douglas Santiago Kridi;Carlos Giovanni Nunes de Carvalho;Danielo Goncalves Gomes	2014		10.1145/2653481.2653482	embedded system;data reduction;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;environmental monitoring;computer security	Mobile	9.307967446693375	76.1629595365198	125392

Within rugged terrains where wheeled sensors are unsuitable, other types of mobile sensors, such as hopping sensors, are needed. In this paper, we address the problem of relocating hopping sensors to the sensing holes. Recent study for this problem considered moving sensors along the shortest path. The shortest path might be used repeatedly and therefore create other sensing holes. In order to overcome these weak nesses, we propose multipath-based schemes considering the balanced assignment for the relocation of hopping sensors. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes guarantee a more balanced migration distribution of efficient sensors and a higher movement success ratio of required sensors than those of the shortest path-based schemes.	frequency-hopping spread spectrum;multipath propagation;relocation (computing);rugged computer;sensor;shortest path problem;simulation	Moonseong Kim;Matt W.

In this paper, we have proposed a new model of routing protocol named ARANz, which is an extension of the original Authenticated Routing for Ad Hoc Networks (ARAN). ARANz adopts the authentication methods used with ARAN and aims to increase security, achieve robustness and solve the single point of failure and attack problems by introducing multiple local certificate authority servers. Additionally, via dealing with the network as zones and using restricted directional flooding, our new model exhibits better scalability and performance. Through simulation, we evaluated ARANz and compared it with the original ARAN as well as Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector. Simulation results show that ARANz is able to effectively discover secure routes within relatively large networks with large number of mobile nodes, while maintaining the minimum packet routing load.

However, most of the routing protocols designed for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are meant only for homogeneous sensor networks in which all sensor nodes have same capabilities in terms of communication, computation, energy supply, etc. This paper presents an ant-based QoS routing protocol for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks consisting of scalar and multimedia sensor nodes with diverse QoS requirements. The proposed protocol proposes different path selection criteria for control traffic and data traffic. The data traffic is further categorized into multimedia traffic and scalar traffic and QoS routes are selected according to the traffic type, thus improving network performance. Further, prior to actual deployment of such networks, an extensive evaluation of the protocols is carried out by making use of simulators. A simulator must replicate realistic conditions and one of the most difficult aspects is the radio signal propagation model. This paper shows that the non-determinism present in some radio propagation models induce randomness which may compromise the performance of many protocols and demonstrates the effectiveness of proposed protocol over AODV under different propagation models.	categorization;computation;network performance;performance evaluation;quality of service;radio wave;randomness;requirement;routing;self-replicating machine;sensor web;simulation;software deployment;software propagation	Sanjay Kumar;Mayank Dave;Surender Dahiya	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2013.6802834	wireless routing protocol;routing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	7.765865650580266	84.61197374370302	125698

As a result, WMNs have found many useful applications in a broad range of domains. In this paper, we discuss the need for adaptive and dynamic routing protocols in WMNs and discussed several existing approaches for adaptive routing protocols. We also identify the different parameters in traditional wireless routing protocols (and their variants) and provide a qualitative review of their impact on network performance when adapted to changes in network characteristics. We include our initial finding in simulation scenario to investigate the relationship of important parameter with respect to mobility. A comparison of existing adaptive WMNs protocols are also presented in this paper.	fault tolerance;mesh networking;network performance;routing;self-organization;simulation;wireless mesh network	Saaidal Razalli Bin Azzuhri;Marius Portmann;Wee Lum Tan	2010	2010 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing and 7th International Conference on Autonomic & Trusted Computing	10.1109/UIC-ATC.2010.28	wireless mesh network;routing domain;fault tolerance;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;adaptive routing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;computer network	HPC	0.41796556442404204	84.36381314291437	125700

The performance is evaluated based on the results of 2×2 MIMO measurements conducted in the 2.4-GHz band. The investigation focuses on the dependency of the element spacing of an MT antenna on the correlation, received power, and channel capacity. Even when a single polarized antenna is used in a MT, keeping the antenna element spacing at 0.4λ, the capacity is comparable to that of POL-MEVIO in this environment.	channel capacity;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mevio;polarization (waves);transmitter	Shu-Hsin Chang;Wei-Chi Ting;Jui-Wen Chen	2010	Proceedings of the Fourth European Conference on Antennas and Propagation	10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633159	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;ring network;routing;star network;telecommunications;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;node;link-state routing protocol;node;triangular routing;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	6.126404009842459	86.37613039370453	126009
9e59f5b587b4760a70184f99bcfab488e6852d3d	optimal video packet distribution in multipath routing for urban vanets		Video content streaming between two vehicles has various applications in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Due to the highly dynamic nature of VANETs, video contents are usually transferred via multiple discovered routes to increase the chance of error-free packet delivery. However, vehicular routes suffer from limited lifetimes and low connectivity probabilities, which result in increasing packet loss ratio (PLR) and frequent video playback freezing. In this paper, PLR is minimized by optimally distributing video packets in multiple routes while meeting quality of service (QoS) parameters (meeting freezing delay and number of transferred video packets constraints). By doing so, reconstruction and playback of the video are achieved with guaranteed QoS. Performance evaluation of our proposed scheme shows enhancements in terms of average PLR (63.3%), average freezing delay (6%), average packet end-to-end delay (66.6%) and average number of delivered video packets (8%) after 10 seconds simulation.	digital distribution;digital video;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);loss function;mathematical optimization;multipath routing;network packet;optimization problem;performance evaluation;private label rights;public lending right;quality of service;simulation	Mostafa Asgharpoor Salkuyeh;Bahman Abolhassani	2018	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2018.000026	multipath routing;computer network;computer science;real-time computing;packet loss;quality of service;network packet	Mobile	3.7093328147396427	84.89181182708629	126020

Specifically, the links in such a network are too volatile to maintain a consistent topology, rendering most MANET protocols ineffective. At the same time, store-andforward (DTN) techniques are not an option due to the need for ndelay intolerance, and may be unnecessary due to the likely availability of contemporaneous, albeit rapidly changing, paths.We present a novel routing mechanism called FansyRoute, aimed at this challenged region between MANETs and DTNs. Fansy- Route adaptively adjusts the number of replications (fan-out) on a per-node basis, taking into account the level of intermittency along the path to the destination and a user-specified tradeoff between delivery expectation and the cost of replication. We study the performance of two FansyRoute schemes on a prime example of such variably intermittently connected networks, namely asynchronously duty-cycled sensor networks. Using ns-3, we compare FansyRoute to OLSR, AODV and Flooding. The results show that in an intermittent network, FansyRoute can deliver 50% more packets than the single path protocols, with less than 5% of the replication incurred by flooding. FansyRoute replicates only when needed and the replication is restricted to the challenged regions of the network.	fan-out	Stephen Dabideen;Ram Ramanathan	2014	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/2581555.2581561	multipath propagation;routing;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive behavior;fan-out;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	4.859840073854543	83.8235271855932	126246

We first present an efficient algorithm called OptPathTrans that operates on a simple greedy principle: whenever a new source–destination (s–d) path is required at time instant t, choose the longestliving s–d path from time t. The above strategy when repeated over the duration of the s–d session yields a sequence of long-lived stable paths such that number of path transitions is the global minimum. We then propose algorithms to determine the sequence of stable Steiner trees and the sequence of stable connected dominating sets to illustrate that the principle behind OptPathTrans is very general and can be used to find the stable sequence of any communication structure as long as there is a heuristic or algorithm to determine that particular communication structure in a given network graph. We study the performance of the three algorithms in the presence of complete knowledge of future topology changes as well as using models that predict the future locations of nodes. Performance results indicate that the stability of the communication structures could be considerably improved by making use of the knowledge about locations of nodes in the	greedy algorithm;heuristic;hoc (programming language);maxima and minima;steiner tree problem	Natarajan Meghanathan;András Faragó	2008	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2007.06.005	mobile ad hoc network;steiner tree problem;computer science;connected dominating set;distributed computing;statistics	Theory	4.373612522964929	79.4967256556009	126284

Accordingly, the traffic volume through networks becomes tremendously large and heavily unbalanced. In large networks, a network is usually divided into small subnetworks for its efficient management. However, traffic elevation often occurs to specific divided subnetworks, the throughput suddenly decreases and in the worst case communication is not assured. In order to cope with the congestion problem, this paper proposes a dynamic hierarchization method for traffic variation in wireless mesh networks. In the proposed method, the subnetworks are divided and integrated adaptively to rapid traffic variation in wireless mesh networks. Simulation experimental results show that timely division of the proposed method reduces packets loss due to buffer overflow and a high throughput is maintained.	best, worst and average case;buffer overflow;experiment;internet backbone;mesh networking;network congestion;simulation;smartphone;tablet computer;throughput;unbalanced circuit;wireless mesh network	Yasuhiro Nakamoto;Yoshiaki Kakuda	2013	2013 IEEE Eleventh International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ISADS)	10.1109/ISADS.2013.6513417	wireless mesh network;switched mesh;telecommunications;computer science;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;cluster analysis;computer network	Mobile	2.2527528936024606	84.38815250577193	126288

Simulation frameworks represent a viable solution to anticipate crucial choices, however existing solutions do not encompass the impact of changes (e.g., route updates, node crashes) on the nodes behavior and vice-versa. This article proposes a novel adaptive modeling approach to master the complexity of the thorough simulation of routing algorithms for WSN.

Routing algorithms perform an important role in distributing the traffic load over the network by providing alternative routing paths. The major parts of research works avoid congestion by considering the traffic condition in the forward paths and delivering packets through less congested paths. However, they do not consider the impact of the router arbitration in traffic distribution. On the other hand, traditional methods usually consider the traffic at the node level rather than a region level. In this paper, we propose a method named Dual Congestion Awareness (DuCA) which involves the congestion information about forward paths in the routing decision and backward paths in the router arbitration. DuCA can efficiently use the traffic information to transmit packets through less congested areas (using congestion information about forward paths) and steer traffic from highly congested regions to low congested areas (using congestion information in backward paths). Finally, DuCA is a region-based approach, providing a wider view of the network traffic.	algorithm;lagrange multiplier;network congestion;network on a chip;network traffic control;router (computing);routing	Masoumeh Ebrahimi;Masoud Daneshtalab;Juha Plosila;Hannu Tenhunen	2012	2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Networked Embedded Systems for Every Application (NESEA)	10.1109/NESEA.2012.6474020	policy-based routing;routing table;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;network traffic control;hierarchical routing;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;engineering;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer network	Metrics	-1.2063859756485504	84.08846770138636	126421
2e792a52d03eedd69e66047b3fde9533a14b6065	a dynamic self-organising heterogeneous routing protocol for clustered wsns		Many self-adaptation routing schemes have been proposed for sensor networks. The most relevant of them consider a hierarchical topology and aim to meet energy conservation and QoS requirements in a homogeneous environment. In such networks, one specific algorithm is commonly applied by all nodes inside clusters. Contrarily, in this paper, we propose a heterogeneous routing by applying different strategies according to specific parameters at the same time inside different clusters. Moreover, each cluster can adopt different strategies at different moments under different conditions. This approach leads to a new self-adaptation protocol based on heterogeneity of the routing process in a multi-hop clustering WSN. The proposal uses a set of mechanisms that have been adopted in well-known protocols (HEEP, APTEEN, LEACH, PEGASIS, etc.) taking into account their strengths and weaknesses.

c09f544c0a545c2d24c49a2a52e2800c9cd8cd65	recent advances in modeling and performance evaluation in wireless and mobile systems		This special issue includes a collection of seven outstanding research articles on recent advances in modeling and performance evaluation in wireless and mobile systems. The issue begins with the paper ‘‘A Rate Control Video Dissemination Solution for Extremely Dynamic Vehicular Ad hoc Networks’’, contributed by Dr. Guilherme Maia, et al. This paper studies the problem of video dissemination to a group of vehicles for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks. A video dissemination protocol named VoV, which operates under extremely dynamic road traffic conditions, is proposed. A new geographic-based broadcast suppressionmechanism that gives a higher priority to rebroadcast to vehicles inside special forwarding zones is further provided. Store and carry mechanism is incorporated into the work to handle the collisions or intermittent disconnections, whereas a rate control mechanism is utilized to avoid channel overloading problem. Performance evaluation reveals that the proposed scheme achieves better efficiency in terms of message delivery, delay and overhead underManhattan grid and real city scenarios. The second paper, ‘‘RECAST: Telling Apart Social and Random Relationships in Dynamic Networks’’, authored by Dr. Pedro Olmo S. Vaz de Melo et al., investigates the interactions among users in dynamic networks where entities act according to their interests and activity dynamics. A new strategy named Random rElationship ClASsifier sTrategy (RECAST) is proposed to effectively classify user interactions, and separate random ties from social ones. The effectiveness of the RECAST classification is evaluated on five real-world user contact datasets collected in diverse networking contexts. The analysis shows the impact of social ties on opportunistic routing in such networks, and demonstrates that the relationships inferred by RECAST are more relevant than that from other schemes, e.g., self-declared friendships, on Facebook. In the third paper, ‘‘An Efficient Utilization of Intermittent Surface-Satellite Optical Links by UsingMass Storage,’’ Kaneko Kazuma et al. studied the data relay satellite problem using optical communication. By relaying observed data traffic to the relay satellite, which has geostationary orbit, it is possible to increase the chance of sending data for the observation satellite due to the wide coverage of the relay satellite. The laser light used in the satellite optical communication has high frequency and can be used to deliver large data compared with radio wave. A new data traffic control method is proposed in the work to adaptively transmit the mass data storage according to the condition of optical downlink between satellite and ground station. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated with numerical result presented. The fourth paper, ‘‘DJAVAN: Detecting Jamming Attacks in Vehicle Ad hoc Networks,’’ authored by Dr. Jalel Ben-Othman et al., studied how to effectively detect security vulnerable in distributed systems and a fluctuating radio channel in VANETs. A new algorithm named DJAVAN (solution of Detecting Jamming Attacks in Vehicle Ad Hoc Networks) is proposed to detect a jamming attack in VANETs using the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). Through performance analysis, the proper threshold is obtained that can effectively differentiate between an attack and a poor radio link. In the fifth paper, ‘‘Per-node Throughput and Fairness Analysis of IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks with Hidden Nodes,’’ Dr. Ganguk Hwang et al. strive to develop an analytical model for the per-node throughput analysis of IEEE 802.11 WLAN networks with hidden nodes by extending Bianchi’s model. Per-node throughput is derived and the impact of hidden nodes on per-node throughput is quantified. A new algorithm, called the fake collision algorithm, is proposed to solve the unfairness problem due to hidden nodes by allowing nodes with poor throughput to acquire more transmission opportunities by slightly modifying the Binary Exponential Backoff algorithm of the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function. Simulation results show that the fairness goal can be achieved using the proposed algorithm. The sixth paper, ‘‘Scalable and Robust Channel Allocation for Densely-Deployed Urban Wireless Stations,’’ authored by Dr. Hirozumi Yamaguchi et al., presents a robust scheduling algorithm for a set of wireless stations such as roadside access points for vehicular networks and outdoor WiFi stations. The goal is to achieve the best balance among the optimality of resource utilization, the robustness to new station installation and traffic demand, and scalability to the population of stations and area size.

In this paper, we describe a communication model that is derived directly from that of Bluetooth, an emerging technology for pervasive computing; this technology is expected to play a major role in future personal area network applications. We further propose two new distributed algorithms for clustering in wireless ad hoc networks. The existing algorithms often become infeasible because they use models where the discovering devices broadcast their Ids and exchange substantial information in the initial stages of the algorithm. We propose a 2-stage distributed O(N) randomized algorithm for an N node complete network, that always finds the minimum number of star-shaped clusters, which have maximum size. We then present a completely deterministic O(N) distributed algorithm for the same model, which achieves the same purpose. We describe in detail how these algorithms can be applied to Bluetooth for efficient scatternet formation. Finally, we evaluate both algorithms using simulation experiments based on the Bluetooth communication model, and compare their performance.	bluetooth;cluster analysis;distributed algorithm;experiment;hoc (programming language);randomized algorithm;simulation;ubiquitous computing	Lakshmi Ramachandran;Manika Kapoor;Abhinanda Sarkar;Alok Aggarwal	2000		10.1145/345848.345860	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;theoretical computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	4.014069359318479	78.74301862664508	126528
a82bcbec59967dde99739b5b60a286b0d5c92cad	improving the energy efficiency for the wbsn bottleneck zone based on random linear network coding		The reduction of energy consumption and the successful delivery of data are important for the Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN). Many studies have been proposed to improve energy efficiency, but most of them have not focussed on the biosensor nodes in the WBSN bottleneck zone. Energy consumption is a critical issue in WBSNs, as the nodes that are placed next to the sink node consume more energy. All biomedical packets are aggregated through these nodes forming a bottleneck zone. This paper proposes a novel mathematical model for body area network (BAN) topology to explain the deployment and connection between biosensor nodes, simple relay nodes, network coding relay nodes and the sink node. Therefore, this paper is dedicated to researching both the energy saving and delivery of data if there is a failure in one of the links of the transmission, which relates to the proposed Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) model in the WBSN. Using a novel mathematical model for a WBSN, it is apparent that energy consumption is reduced and data delivery achieved with the proposed mechanism. This paper details the stages of the research work.

The most important problem, though, is energy consumption, which limits the lifetime of the network. Clustering has been proposed as a technique for organizing sensors in order to prolong their lifespan. Although many clustering algorithms have been proposed, very few of them are especially designed for the ultra-wideband (UWB) technology. UWB is a key solution for wireless connectivity characterized by ultralow power consumption and a good degree of robustness to interference. Based on these principles, we propose a novel energy-aware clustering algorithm for UWB sensor networks. Simulation based studies would demonstrate the superior performance that it is achieved by the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer cluster;interference (communication);organizing (structure);self-organization;sensor;simulation;ultra-wideband	Georgios Koltsidas;Eirini D.

We refer to this scheme as explicit notification with enhanced inter-layer communication and control (ENIC) mechanism. Because of the distinct characteristics between mobile ad hoc networks and wired networks, we introduce the new design methodology -enhanced inter-layer control mechanism to improve the reliability of data transport. Comprehensive effects of interactions among Medium Access Control (MAC), routing and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are considered in our work. Moreover, our scheme provides a true end-to-end TCP maintenance and recovery method during the route failure. A quantitative implementation is simulated and compared with the standard SACK TCP.

We consider this problem in the context of an overlay network by allowing a source to send data over k (k ≥ 1) overlay paths to its destination. This problem is NP-hard, and we develop an iterative distributed heuristic to solve it. In each iteration, we first select paths and then control the sending rates on the multiple paths to maximize the aggregate sending rate of the sources. For rate control, we develop an application-level multipath rate controller via TCP. This controller is easy to deploy and maximizes the aggregate sending rate of the sources in certain settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed application-level controller with such an optimality property. For path selection, we prove that the problem of optimal overlay path selection is NP-hard and propose randomized path-selection algorithms. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that our iterative heuristic performs very well in a wide range of settings. Furthermore, a small number of paths, 2–4, and a small amount of extra bandwidth in the network are sufficient to realize most of the performance gains. c © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

17cd48de40ac8e6ace1181c0d5b9cfca98c673c9	robust self-organized wireless sensor network: a gene regulatory network bio-inspired approach		Minimal energy consumption and maximal event detection rate are among the main objectives in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Sensor nodes are constrained units that have limited energy and low processing capabilities. Some challenging applications aim to spread a large number of nodes randomly in a geographical location to monitor it. Since it is difficult to access frequently and physically these sensors, an independent, failures resistant and distributed control, that is non-assisted by humans is mandatory. However, any intelligent strategy in WSN should have minimal requirements and low overhead. In this paper, we exploit the cell/node analogy to introduce a bio-inspired controller based on the principles of Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). This controller is adapted by the Genetic Algorithm. By implementing this controller in each node, the emergent network is characterized by an auto-organized, robust and adaptive behavior similar to a biological system. We compare the approach to a classical approach that uses redundancy as a failure resistance strategy, and found a significant increase in lifetime and event detection rates of the entire network.	gene regulatory network	Nour El Mawass;Nada Chendeb Taher;Nazim Agoulmine	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-01796-9_11	real-time computing;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	8.806194771478921	77.48180585727808	127051

As a result, the proposed method increases the power efficiency and decreases the route-reconstructions due to residual power shortages and node mobility.	control theory;hoc (programming language);loss function;network packet;performance per watt;routing	Kyoung-Jin Kim;Sang-Jo Yoo	2004	The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

Topology makes restrictions to the wireless technology and the wireless technology makes restrictions to the network topology. In this paper we present an algorithm to select a network topology and a wireless technology depending on application's requirements automatically.

Energy efficiency is one of the determining factors for survivability and lifetime of WSNs. In the WSNs, severe energy issue necessitates energyefficient approach to fulfill application objectives. In this paper, we propose an Energy Optimization Approach based on Cross-Layer for Wireless Sensor Networks named as EOA, which consider the joint optimal design of the physical, medium access control (MAC), and routing layer. The focus of EOA is on the computation of optimal transmission power, routing, and duty-cycle schedule that optimize the WSNs energy-efficiency. We first propose a feedback algorithm that computes the proper transmission power level between nodes. Then, routing protocol can make use of the transmission power as a metric by choosing route with optimal power consumption to forward packets. Finally, the cross-layer routing information is exploited to form a duty-cycle schedule in MAC layer. EOA is validated on a CROSSBOW’s MicaZ mote platform, and evaluated using the TOSSIM simulator, the simulation results show that EOA is an energy-efficient approach and able to achieve significant performance improvement as well.	access control;algorithm;computation;duty cycle;mathematical optimization;optimal design;routing;scheduling (computing);sensor node;simulation;tinyos	Yuebin Bai;Shujuan Liu;Mo Sha;Yang Lu;Cong Xu	2008	JCM	10.4304/jcm.3.6.27-34	wireless routing protocol;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	7.9441892228886815	83.20268662239694	127428

The epoch mobility model is one of important mobility models that can statistically describe mobile behavior in general. Here an epoch is a random length interval during which a node is supposed to move at a constant velocity. However, a border may force a node to change its motion during an epoch. This phenomenon is often called border effect in the literature. In this case, the original mobility model cannot reflect the real mobile behavior, and it is necessary to study border effect in depth. Epoch distribution is the key to epoch mobility models and may be severely impacted by border effect. Therefore, this paper discusses how to use geometric probability to estimate affected epoch distributions by proposing some methods to calculate border hitting probabilities and estimate epoch distributions that are affected by border effect. A simulation study is also conducted to verify the proposed methods and shows that they can provide good estimations.	epoch (reference date);hypertext transfer protocol;performance;simulation;time complexity;velocity (software development)	Shengming Jiang	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks	10.1109/MSN.2009.61	wireless ad hoc network;cellular network;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;mobility model;geometric probability;statistics;computer network	Mobile	3.2765877445155507	86.7355862181255	127644
c82e94fe644eefe5b03b94f37523ac7ec385bd9f	path heuristics using aco for inter-domain routing in mobile ad hoc and sensor networks		We investigate the use of biologically inspired routing heuristics in the field of inter-domain routing in sensor networks. Instead of relying on classical topology control techniques for routing in sensor networks, the use of geographical coordinates has been investigated for self-organized and fully distributed message forwarding. However, the identification of the nodes’ positions is either expensive in terms of necessary equipment or message exchange. Therefore, the use of virtual coordinates has been investigated in this domain. The key advantage is that these virtual identifiers can also be used for data management similar as in a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). It is, however, extremely challenging to provide routing functionality between multiple independent networks or network domains. In previous work, we developed the Virtual Cord Protocol (VCP) that provides all the means for creating and maintaining such virtual identifiers and that is even able to route between neighboring network domains. This paper extends VCP by providing a generalized inter-domain routing framework using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimizing routes between multiple network domains. In extensive simulations, we evaluated this routing bio-inspired heuristic. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that ACO is very efficient even in highly mobile scenarios.	ant colony optimization algorithms;british informatics olympiad;distributed hash table;geographic coordinate system;heuristic (computer science);high- and low-level;identifier;indirection;inter-domain;overhead (computing);routing;scalability;self-organization;shortest path problem;simulation;topology control	Falko Dressler;Roman Koch;Mario Gerla	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-32615-8_16	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	4.260786573278131	79.77078733837162	128006

However, the mobility has large impact on the network behavior namely the dynamic network topology and the synchronization loss of mobile nodes. Given that, this paper proposes two new re-association procedures for reliable handover to deal with nodes mobility in IEEE 802.15.4 WSNs. In the first approach, the handover process is triggered by parent nodes based on their residual energy. In the second approach, the handover process is triggered by mobile nodes upon location change. Both approaches allow to minimize data packet loss during the handover process while optimizing energy consumption. We used simulation in order to highlight the efficiency of our proposals namely in terms of network throughput and reliability.

In year 2002, an extended network reliability model was proposed which considers the connection important level between each pair of nodes. This paper proposes an approximation algorithm based on Monte Carlo simulation for the new network reliability model. This approximation algorithm can be integrated into GAs to solve the optimal cost reliable network design problem under the extended model.	approximation algorithm;genetic algorithm;monte carlo method;network planning and design;simulation;software deployment	Shiang-Ming Huang;Quincy Wu;Shi-Chun Tsai	2008	Fourth International Conference on Networking and Services (icns 2008)	10.1109/ICNS.2008.29	reliability engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics;monte carlo method	Robotics	-4.0080054067312805	80.49344268704004	128823
f91a5372373361d4da628aaf950ee9b00a4d17fd	an opportunistic routing for data forwarding based on vehicle mobility association in vehicular ad hoc networks		Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have emerged as a new powerful technology for data transmission between vehicles. Efficient data transmission accompanied with low data delay plays an important role in selecting the ideal data forwarding path in VANETs. This paper proposes a new opportunity routing protocol for data forwarding based on vehicle mobility association (OVMA). With assistance from the vehicle mobility association, data can be forwarded without passing through many extra intermediate nodes. Besides, each vehicle carries the only replica information to record its associated vehicle information, so the routing decision can adapt to the vehicle densities. Simulation results show that the OVMA protocol can extend the network lifetime, improve the performance of data delivery ratio, and reduce the data delay and routing overhead when compared to the other well-known routing protocols.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;hoc (programming language);information source;network performance;operand forwarding;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);simulation;transfer function	Leilei Wang;Zhigang Chen;Jia Wu	2017	Information	10.3390/info8040140	link-state routing protocol;virtual routing and forwarding;optimized link state routing protocol;computer science;wireless routing protocol;dynamic source routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer network;equal-cost multi-path routing;zone routing protocol	Mobile	5.788884552445788	82.1898681180963	128831

WSNs need virtual backbones to support in-network data transmission. In scenarios where there is no spatial redundancy (such as a sensor network in a petroleum installation), Connected Dominating Set (CDS)-based algorithms can be useful for hierarchical network management. We construct a CDSbased backbone to support the operation of an energy efficient network. We focus on three key ideas in our design: (a) a realistic weight matrix, (b) an asymmetric communication link between pairs of nodes, and (c) a role switching technique to prolong the lifetime of the CDS backbone. We simulate our proposed design using realistic scenarios for performance evaluation. We compare the proposed design with a traditional CDS algorithm. The simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of network lifetime and packet loss.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;connected dominating set;emoticon;internet backbone;nesc;network packet;network traffic control;performance evaluation;real life;requirement;simulation;tinyos;tree network	Sajid Hussain;Mubashsharul Shafique;Laurence Tianruo Yang	2010	2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)	10.1109/HPCC.2010.96	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;backbone network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	7.960492411695011	79.10078177655902	128863

The operation of the overlay network results in the creation of routing data packets in the network layer. This paper considers the possibility of employing an overlay network for the Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) architecture in the intention of deploying a P2P network service for extreme emergency cases as described in the EU-FP7 PEACE project. The structured overlay network for the underlying MANET network, proposed in this paper, is built on Bamboo [12] which has been proven to be more efficient than other methods in literature. A study is carried out, using the network simulator ns-2, in order to demonstrate that the proposed enhanced overlay solution has less overhead, and that it has the potential to be used in MANETs for reliable data routing.	hoc (programming language);peer-to-peer	Grant P.

However, their generated enormous amount of Internet traffic usually congests the network to cause the degradation of network utilization. Although, multicast provides an efficient way for distributing multimedia information to a set of destinations simultaneously, the congestion still degrade the desired QoS (Quality of Service) of the on-going multicast connections especially the group of multicast destinations is large and scattered. Hence, this paper proposes a novel Adaptive Multicast Routing (AMRST) approach for Satellite-Terrestrial Network (ST Network) [1] to provide reliable and adaptive multicast services to global subscribers. This approach decomposes the multicast delivery problem into two parts, (1) the construction of the multicast tree and (2) the maintenance of dynamic membership. The Virtual Hierarchical Routing Tree (VHRT) is proposed for constructing an efficient multicast tree and the ReRouting scheme is for maintaining the multicast tree in an optimal routing cost once the membership, such as member joining or leaving, changes dynamically. The AMRST not only keeps the benefits of the traditional terrestrial multicast but also further promotes the multicasting performance by employing the satellite broadcasting capability. The simulation results demonstrate that the AMRST has excellent performance for the satellite-terrestrial network.	algorithm;elegant degradation;multicast;network congestion;network topology;quality of service;routing;simulation;terrestrial television	Chao-Hsu Chang;Eric Hsiao-Kuang Wu	2002		10.1109/ICCCN.2002.1043058	multicast;ip multicast;non-broadcast multiple-access network;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;mbone;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;computer network;multicast address;broadband networks	Networks	-3.2807670967251545	83.77870184482072	129229

There are several proposals of how to integrate gateway forwarding strategies but they all rely on the route discovery procedure of reactive routing protocols. We propose a proactive approach to avoid the delay of the route discovery process. Mobile IP is often suggested to handle macro mobility and we use the advertisements periodically sent by the gateway to update routing tables in the ad hoc network. Since advertisements may arrive to a mobile host through multiple paths, it is important to keep track of the best path to each gateway. We demonstrate the use of a proposed dynamic metric and how to handle location of correspondent hosts.

To join in a ZigBee network with the tree topology, the hardware requirement of a device is simple and low threshold. However, a device may become an isolated node due to constraints of configuration parameters in the ZigBee network. To decrease isolated nodes, we propose an approach called Enhanced Connectivity Scheme for the ZigBee network. This scheme can efficiently reconstruct parts of the network to let more devices join, and hence increase the join ratio. Experimental results show that our method can efficiently improve the connectivity of ZigBee networks. In this paper, we also propose a swapping method to extend the life of the ZigBee network. The objective of swapping is to balance the energy consumption of the nodes. Experimental results show that the swapping scheme can increase the life of the network compared to the ZigBee standard operation by 50%. We provide an innovative solution for increasing connectivity and life of the network to ZigBee designs.	data rate units;home automation;low-power broadcasting;paging;tree network;tree structure	Chia-Ming Wu;Ruay-Shiung Chang;Pu-I Lee;Jei-Hsiang Yen	2011	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-011-0696-z	embedded system;neurfon;wireless sensor network;computer science;connectivity;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	7.393978962392654	79.66247615262792	129329

This paper focuses on various strategies for adjusting the overhead generated by the CE-ants as the state of the network changes. The overhead is in terms of number of management packets (ants) generated, and the adjustments are done by controlling the ant generation rate that controls the number ants traversing the network. The link state events considered are failure and restoration events. A simulation scenario compares restoration performance of rate adaptation in the source node with rate adaptation in the intermediate nodes close to the link state events. Implicit detection of failure events through monitoring ant parameters are considered. Results indicate that an implicit adjustment in the source node is a promising approach with respect to restoration time and the number of ants required.	circuit restoration;management system;swarm intelligence	Poul E.

Observing that many sensor applications for object tracking can tolerate a certain degree of imprecision in location data of tracked objects, this paper studies precision-constrained approximate queries that trade answer precision for energy efficiency. We develop an Energy-conserving Approximate StoragE (EASE) scheme to efficiently answer approximate location queries by keeping errorbounded imprecise location data at some designated storage node. The data impreciseness is captured by a system parameter, i.e., approximation radius. We analyze the performance of EASE in terms of message complexity and derive the optimal setting of approximation radius. We show via extensive simulation experiments that, as compared to a conventional approach, the EASE scheme cuts down the network traffic by up to 96% and, in most cases, prolongs the network lifetime by a factor of 2−5.	approximation algorithm;experiment;network packet;simulation	Jianliang Xu;Xueyan Tang;Wang-Chien Lee	2005	2005 Second Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2005.

The emergency warning messages such as post crash warning notification would require an efficient multi hop broadcast scheme to notify all the vehicles within a particular area about the emergency. Such emergency warning applications have low delay and transmission overhead requirements to effectively transmit the emergency notification. In this paper, an adaptive distance based backoff scheme is presented for efficient dissemination of warning messages on the road. The proposed scheme adaptively selects the furthest vehicle as the next forwarder of the emergency message based on channel conditions. The detailed performance figures of the protocol are presented in the paper using simulations in the OPNET network simulator. The proposed protocol introduces lower packet delay and broadcast overhead as compared to standard packet broadcasting protocols for vehicular networks.

VANETs have several advantages over the conventional wireless networks such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). Main advantages are low cost of implementation and maintenance, selforganization and lower local information dissemination time (Javed & Khan; Karim, 2008). For the future implementation of an efficient VANET architecture, the IEEE802.11p protocol has been proposed (2010 IEEE Standards Association). The CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) mechanism which is used in the IEEE 802.11p MAC reduces the signaling overhead compared to the conventional cellular networks. However, use of the CSMA/CA scheme could reduce the reliability of a network when used to support emergency messaging services such as accident or breakdown notifications (Javed & Khan). Many research studies have been undertaken to improve the performance of the broadcasting techniques in VANETs. However, the broadcast suppression mechanism used in current systems results in large overhead, warning notification time and packet loss. Consider a typical scenario shown in Figure 1 where a vehicle broadcasts post crash warning notification to vehicles behind it so that they can change their route and to the rescue vehicles so that they can reach the site with minimum delay. Using a simple flooding packet transmission technique in which each node on receiving a broadcast message rebroadcasts it to all other nodes within its transmission range could result in network contention and increased overhead. Using the flooding technique many nodes will rebroadcast the warning message simultaneously causing collisions hence, dissemination of urgent information such as post crash warning notification will be either delayed or interrupted. Probability based broadcast suppression technique could also result in collisions in dense networks because nodes within a certain area have a similar probability of rebroadcast (Wisitpongphan et al., 2007). Similarly in the timer based techniques, nodes with similar assigned time slots will have similar probability of rebroadcast which will cause contention (Wisitpongphan et al., 2007). In this paper we propose an efficient geocast protocol in the IEEE802.11p network to support emergency messaging services. The proposed protocol achieves the goal of minimizing the hop count for emergency message dissemination by selecting the furthest node for rebroadcast at each hop. The selection of furthest node is made possible by a new contention window design based on the distance from the sender node. The furthest node is adaptively selected each time based on the channel conditions using an adaptive distance based backoff technique. The protocol helps in broadcast suppression and reducing the contention probability of safety message distribution in a VANET which is shown by a higher packet success rate and a lower convergence time as compared to current protocols. The proposed protocol performance has been compared with the standard packet broadcasting protocols such as flooding and a timer based protocol. The paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the IEEE 802.11p protocol architecture in detail. This is followed by review of some of the existing protocols to develop the reliability features of VANET applications particularly for car to car communication services. The next section introduces the proposed geocasting protocol for VANET applications. Simulation model is discussed in the following section. Finally, simulation results are presented followed by the conclusions.

In contrast to previously studied models, broadcasting is among peers, rather than client server. Such a model represents, for example, satellite communication among widely distributed nodes, sensor networks, and mobile ad hoc networks. We introduce a cost model for data dissemination in peer to peer broadcast networks. The model quantifies the tradeoff between the inconsistency of the data, and its transmission cost; the transmission cost may be given in terms of dollars, energy, or bandwidth. Using the model we first determine the parameters for which eager (i.e. consistent) replication has a lower cost than lazy (i.e. inconsistent) replication. Then we introduce a lazy broadcast policy and compare it with several naive or traditional approaches to solving the problem.	analysis of algorithms;bandwidth (signal processing);broadcasting (networking);client–server model;communications satellite;computation;data item;database;distributed computing;fully buffered dimm;hoc (programming language);lazy evaluation;peer-to-peer;policy-based design;server (computing);simulation;smart battery;table (database)	Bo Xu;Ouri Wolfson;Sam Chamberlain;Naphtali Rishe	2002	MONET	10.1023/A:1013277313373	mobile ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;distributed database;communications satellite;dissemination;client–server model;replication;computer network	DB	1.6465022919689967	76.72831764342448	129595

However, a finer approximation (for smaller stretch) leads to higher cost of dissemination, which could be unaffordable for the sensors. We provide an insightful analysis to this fundamental trade-off of the hole approximation problem, using a geometric model. Based on this we discuss an efficient approximation-dissemination scheme using a natural, heuristic approximation technique. For reasonable conditions (network is dense enough apart from the hole), we assure that the routing stretch is under a predefined threshold > 1 while the dissemination cost is also under tight control. Our initial experiment results also confirm that our approach is significantly more efficient and economical, compared to existing proposals.	approximation algorithm;computer data storage;convex hull;experiment;geometric modeling;heuristic;ibm 7030 stretch;perimeter;routing;sensor node;simulation;theory	Phi-Le Nguyen;Khanh-Van Nguyen	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems	10.1109/DCOSS.2014.17	wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;embedded system;mathematical optimization;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Robotics	7.861988011521948	78.5243025030755	129607

To this end, hierarchical architectures provide a solution to this scalability problem. In this paper, we address the problem of design and optimization of a tiered wireless access network. At the lower tier, mesh routers are clustered based on traffic demands and delay requirements. The cluster heads are equipped with wireless optical transceivers and form the upper tier free space optical (FSO) network. We first present a plane sweeping and clustering algorithm aiming to minimize the number of clusters. PSC sweeps the network area and captures cluster members under delay and traffic load constraints. We then present an algebraic connectivity-based formulation for FSO network topology optimization and develop a greedy edge-appending algorithm that iteratively inserts edges to maximize algebraic connectivity. The proposed algorithms are analyzed and evaluated via simulations, and are shown to be highly effective as compared to the performance bounds derived in this paper.	access network;algebraic connectivity;cluster analysis;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;multi-function printer;multitier architecture;network topology;optimization problem;program optimization;requirement;scalability;simulation;throughput;topology optimization;transceiver;wireless mesh network	In Keun Son;Shiwen Mao	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462107	algebraic connectivity;wireless mesh network;design;wireless wan;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;wi-fi array;network topology;computer network;broadband networks	HPC	-4.222793285242912	82.42756306632141	129642

A typical WSN node is composed of several sensors, a radio communication interface, a microprocessor, and a limited power supply. In many WSN applications, such as forest fire monitoring or intruder detection, user intervention and battery replenishment is not possible. Since the battery lifetime is directly related to the amount of processing and communication involved in these nodes, optimal resource usage becomes a major issue. A typical WSN application may sense and process very close or constant data values for long durations, when the environmental conditions are stable. This is a common behavior that can be exploited to reduce the power consumption of WSN nodes. This study combines two orthogonal techniques to reduce the energy dissipation of the processor component of the sensor nodes. First, we briefly discuss silentstore filtering MoteCache. Second, we utilize Content-Aware Data MAnagement (CADMA) on top of MoteCache architecture to achieve further energy savings and performance improvements. The complexity increase introduced by CADMA is also compensated by further complexity reduction in MoteCache. Our optimal configuration reduces the total node energy, and hence increases the node lifetime, by 19.4% on the average across a wide variety of simulated sensor benchmarks. Our complexity-aware configuration with a minimum MoteCache size achieves not only energy savings up to 16.2% but also performance improvements up to 4.3%, on the average.	habitat;intruder detection;microprocessor;power supply;reduction (complexity);sensor	Gürhan Küçük;Can Basaran	2006		10.1007/11902140_69	filter;embedded system;wireless sensor network;habitat;telecommunications;content management;data management;computer science;dissipation;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;sensor array;reduction;battery	Mobile	0.18214271633437581	75.06461028409856	129669

Multicast is a one-to-many communication scheme and has largely been studied in such networks. Indeed, this communication primitive can be used as a building block for popular services, such as data streaming or group communication. The particularity of 6Shot is the location- aware routing scheme of its implementation, which offers improved efficiency in terms of message overhead compared to existing algorithms, for a reasonable cost in terms of reliability.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);location awareness;multicast;one-to-many (data model);overhead (computing);real life;routing;sensor;streaming media	Benoît Garbinato;Adrian Holzer;François Vessaz	2010	2010 Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications	10.1109/NCA.2010.8	maintenance engineering;multicast;mobile ad hoc network;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;mobile computing;computer security;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Arch	0.0018219104489334808	82.67293114221145	129690
5abcea5874eeac24d04498bffbc79c5fdeacb654	connectivity restoration and amelioration in wireless ad-hoc networks: a practical solution		Connectivity restoration after a node failure is one of the major issues in wireless ad-hoc networks. In particular, failures can lead to a network partitioning and a huge loss of information. Therefore, a fast mechanism is needed to heal the network between the partitions. In this paper, we consider the scenario where an intermediate node failures and a mobile system is moving autonomously to restore connectivity and provide the best service. We propose a fast connectivity restoration algorithm that is based only on local information. We implement our solution on a real robotic platform and we present some experimental results using a simple case scenario.	amelioration pattern;circuit restoration;hoc (programming language)	Christos Katsikiotis;Dimitrios Zorbas;Periklis Chatzimisios	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13329-4_23	simulation;artificial intelligence;distributed computing	Mobile	7.290281952804693	78.56626357599808	129712

In order to support these applications efficiently, multicast routing algorithms are needed for computing the least cost multicast trees that satisfy a given end-to-end delay constraint. However, finding such a tree is known to be computationally expensive. Therefore, we propose a heuristic distributed multicast routing algorithm that satisfies a given end-to-end delay constraint and minimizes the average resulting tree cost. Also, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better average cost performance than the other existing algorithms.	algorithm;multicast	Min-Woo Shin;Nak-Keun Joo;Hyeong-Seok Lim	2002		10.1007/3-540-36087-5_44	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;videoconferencing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	EDA	-3.6583362323396122	77.74456306751262	129773

In order to organize nodes efficiently for a long lifespan, clustering algorithm is demanded in WSNs to reduce redundant data transmissions and to save energy. We propose a novel clustering algorithm to create reliable and energy-aware clusters for in-network data processing. The clustering algorithm is a new service on a publish/subscribe middleware called Mires. The goal is to improve load balancing and robustness. Our clustering algorithm considers location information to facilitate boundary control. We conducted simulations to evaluate performance and energy efficiency. We implemented a prototype for feasibility demonstration.	algorithm;cluster analysis;load balancing (computing);middleware;prototype;publish–subscribe pattern;simulation	Pin Nie;Zhihua Jin;Yi Gong	2010		10.1145/1868521.1868551	embedded system;data stream clustering;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;data processing;telecommunications;computer science;load balancing;operating system;middleware;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;publish–subscribe pattern;cluster analysis;computer network;data transmission	Mobile	9.396316543290201	77.25457068517778	129778

However, the performance of geographic routing is impacted by physical voids, and localization errors. Accordingly, virtual coordinate systems (VCS) were proposed as an alternative approach that is resilient to localization errors and that naturally routes around physical voids. However, VCS also faces virtual anomalies, causing their performance to trail geographic routing. In existing VCS routing protocols, there is a lack of an effective stateless and delivery guaranteed complementar y routing algorithm that can be used to traverse voids. Most proposed solutions use variants of flooding or blind searching when a void is encountered. In this paper, we propose a spanning-path virtual coordinate system which can be used as a complete routing algorithm or as the complementary algorithm to greedy forwarding that is invoked when voids are encountered. With this approach, and for the first time, we demonstrate a stateless and delivery guaranteed geometric routing algorithm on VCS. When used in conjunction with our previously proposed aligned virtual coordinate system (AVCS), it out-performs not only all geometric routing protocols on VCS, but also geographic routing with accurate location information.	file spanning;geographic routing;greedy algorithm;overhead (computing);stateless protocol;traverse;veritas cluster server	Ke Liu;Nael B.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-phase data reporting (TDR) scheme that supports class-based QoS to sensor nodes in different priority classes. In the first phase, time slots are divided into separate data reporting round defined for each class, while in the second phase, the sensor nodes in the same class are scheduled to particular time slots depending on the given number of slots calculated in the first phase. In TDR, sensor nodes compete with other nodes in the same class only, while nodes in different classes have differentiated channel access opportunity. TDR is performed in a single-hop cluster-based topology, and a cluster head acts as a node assignment manager (NAM). Sensor nodes wake up for their scheduled time slots; otherwise, they go into sleep mode to save energy. TDR supports both schedulebased and contention-based channel access mechanisms and is scalable due to its distributed nature.	addressing scheme;binary number;computation;computer cluster;nam;quality of service;requirement;scalability;scheduling (computing);sensor web;sleep mode;throughput;time-domain reflectometer;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking	Hyun Jung Choe;Preetam Ghosh;Kalyan Basu;Sajal K.

Such networks are composed of a number of mobile wireless nodes typical of MANETs, but also have fixed (satellite) links and are continuously powered as is typical of fixed networks. Combined, these characteristics provide unique challenges not conducive to the use of existing MANET or fixed network management techniques. Since maritime units also operate in a low-bandwidth environment with varying communications capabilities, the efficiency of network management services is critical. Similarly, the lack of power constraints and slower mobility require a less dynamic solution than that required for MANETs. This article provides an overview of the maritime network management problem space including two key management opportunities provided by such an environment. The first opportunity is in automation. Maritime networks are subject to changing operational requirements, while at the same time suffering from limited availability of skilled network operators. To rapidly respond to faults and changes in performance needs, we propose the use of a serviceoriented policy-based management architecture on which a wide variety of management services can be rapidly deployed. The second key management opportunity is resource optimization. We suggest several management services that can be used to support traffic engineering. In our simulations traffic monitoring, traffic prioritization, adaptive routing, and resource reservation services were found to provide awareness and significantly improve the timeliness of prioritized flows.	key management;limited availability;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;problem domain;requirement;routing;simulation	David Kidston;Thomas Kunz	2008	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2008.4644135	network management;wireless ad hoc network;traffic engineering;quality of service;network management station;adaptive routing;telecommunications;computer science;automation;key management;computer security;satellite;computer network	Metrics	-1.5731166822603115	85.16714596505658	130329

However, one missing component is an efficient and scalable distributed data location service. Existing approaches impose significant communication overhead on the underlying wireless layer and generally limit the total number of locatable objects in a network. To address this problem, we present the integrated data location protocol (IDLP), which provides scalable location of a large number of objects by integrating compressed summaries of object signatures into the routing layer. We evaluate our approach using extensive simulations in Qualnet, as well as detailed measurements from a deployed AODV-implementation on the UCSB MeshNet testbed. Results show that IDLP maintains low communication overhead while efficiently locating up to a hundred objects per node.	antivirus software;disaster recovery;location awareness;location-based service;mesh networking;overhead (computing);routing;scalability;simulation;testbed	Irfan Sheriff;Prashanth Aravinda Kumar Acharya;Ashwin Sampath;Ben Y.

d1fa61b4adf6812d16177dfe1661d5b31ac7342a	parameterized collision tolerant scheduling for broadcast latency minimization in duty-cycled wireless sensor networks	collision tolerant;duty cycle;wireless sensor networks;broadcast scheduling;minimum latency	Broadcast latency minimization is one of the most important problems in duty-cycled Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In order to minimize the broadcast latency, recent scheduling schemes prefer to schedule transmissions to nodes along critical paths of a network. Nodes in a critical path are referred as critical nodes and other nodes is referred as non-critical ones. The schemes are typically motivated to find a collision-free broadcast schedule to ensure their completions, i.e. all nodes receive a broadcast message collision-freely. Observing that any delay on transmission to a critical node will result in an increase of the overall broadcast latency, we propose a novel broadcast scheduling, named Parameterized Collision Tolerant Scheduling (PCTS), that allows collision at non-critical nodes to speed up the broadcast process for critical ones. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces broadcast latency compared with the existing schemes, and slightly increases the number of transmissions due to retransmission.	critical path method;retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);simulation;speedup	Duc Tai Le;Thang Le Duc;Yechan Park;Ho-Jin Hwang;Vyacheslav V.

In this paper we use a common context to analyze a broad range of the energy balancing algorithms suggested in literature. In addition we suggest three new algorithms to complete the range. Altogether, nine different balancing techniques are analyzed. We focuses on networks running the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) routing protocol. Our simple change in RPL's parent selection procedure can give a significant balancing effect without any increase in management cost. However, the best balancing algorithm is when the nodes exchange residual-energy information to ensure forwarding through the highest residual-energy next-hop node. The increased information exchange implies increased management cost due to the amount of information transmitted and added computational load.	algorithm;computation;depletion region;information exchange;lossy compression;low-power broadcasting;routing	Anne-Lena Kampen;Knut Øvsthus;Øivind Kure	2015	2015 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)	10.15439/2015F67	wireless routing protocol;algorithm design;routing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;energy level;dynamic source routing;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	7.743932975999638	80.67936930445785	130674

In this paper, we present our study on reactive MANET routing over the VNLayer. During this research, we identified in our initial VNLayer implementation three major limitations that lead to heavy control traffic, long forwarding paths and frequent message collisions in MANET routing. To address the problems, we changed the assumptions made by the VNLayer on the link layer and extended the operations allowed by VNLayer. This results in a VNLayer implementation that can be tuned to optimize the performance of traffic intensive applications (such as routing) while maintaining their simplicity and robustness. Simulation results showed that VNAODV, a VNLayer based routing protocol adapted from AODV [4], delivers more packets, generates less routing traffic and creates more stable routes than AODV in a dense MANET with high node motion rates. This research validated that the VNLayer approach makes software development for MANET easier and improves the performance of MANET protocols.	cluster analysis;consistency model;link-state routing protocol;network packet;overhead (computing);portable document format;promiscuous mode;retransmission (data networks);server (computing);simulation;software development	Jiang Wu;Nancy D.

10cdf03d8734e1e6cbc4f6d321822b570d9c6ebe	a novel social contact graph-based routing strategy for workload and throughput fairness in delay tolerant networks	relay selection;fairness;delay tolerant networks;load balancing;message scheduling;throughput	Delay-tolerant networks are sparse mobile ad hoc networks in which there is typically no complete path between the source and destination. Although many routing schemes for delay-tolerant networks have been proposed, they do not address fairness issues in terms of the workload/traffic handled at each node and the share of throughput among different destination nodes. In this paper, we propose a socially aware routing strategy that optimizes both fairness and throughput. A relay node is selected based on the multi-hop delivery probability and its queue length. The effect of queue length control is to divert traffic away from highly connected nodes and allows nodes to explore less-congested paths to the destination. This helps balance the network loads, thus achieving workload fairness. Furthermore, to achieve throughput fairness, we sort arriving messages into different destination-based queues. Messages are then scheduled following a two-level forwarding strategy that optimizes throughput fairness using round-robin and delivery ratio using priority scheduling. Extensive real-trace-driven simulation results show that our scheme outperforms existing algorithms in terms of the delivery ratio. Furthermore, our scheme achieves a high throughput fairness, while distributing the network loads more evenly, with the top 10% of network nodes handling only 22% of the forwardings.

The generated data is first stored inside the network before being uploaded to the base station when uploading opportunities arise. Each node has both limited energy level and limited storage space, and is associated with a probability of failure. To guarantee that at any moment, each generated data item is available for being uploaded in the presence of node failure, we propose to replicate K copies of each data item in the network, where K depends upon the node failure probability. We refer to the problem as Data K-Availability Problem (DKAP). DKAP is naturally divided into two phases: K-Availability creation and K-Availability maintenance. For K-Availability creation, we show that the problem is NP-hard for arbitrary data sizes, and that it is equivalent to minimum cost flow problem for unit data sizes. For K-Availability maintenance, we show that it is NP-hard even for unit data sizes and design a centralized greedy heuristic. We further design an efficient and low-overhead distributed algorithm, which is applicable to both phases, and show using extensive simulations that it performs close to the heuristic.	centralized computing;clustered file system;data item;depletion region;distributed algorithm;energy level;flow network;greedy algorithm;grid network;hard disk drive;heuristic;ibm notes;mahdiyar;minimum-cost flow problem;np-hardness;overhead (computing);procedural generation;replication (computing);self-replicating machine;simulation;upload;weatherstar	Bin Tang;Neeraj Jaggi;Masaaki Takahashi	2014	2014 23rd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2014.6911795	greedy algorithm;real-time computing;computer science;np-hard;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computational complexity theory;distributed database;computer network	DB	1.959638051369892	76.18928071144437	131330
2048191b672ef69520d32bb6f051d2ddfdbf8b95	performance analysis of ieee 802.15.4 mac layer: prospect for multi-hop networks		In this paper, we propose and model an enhanced IEEE 802.15.4 MAC for sensor nodes operating in multi-hop scenarios. Existing IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, when adapted to multi-hop networks may not perform efficiently due to lack of knowledge about the instantaneous state of local gateway. We therefore ameliorate the channel access mechanism by introducing a new Active-Tx state, which aids in identifying the state of local gateway along with traditionally existing Sleep and CSMA/CA states. A 3D Markov chain based model is developed for analysing the performance of proposed MAC framework under different configurations of network. Upon considering reliability, energy and delay as the key performance metrics the analysis shows that the model captures behaviour of the sensor node most accurately with 95% confidence level. In addition performance is also analysed using real time deployment and found to be in good accordance with analytical and simulation outcomes.	duty cycle;markov chain;mathematical model;network congestion;network performance;profiling (computer programming);real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor node;simulation;software deployment;testbed;website monitoring;while	M.

The Bluetooth medium access control protocol is based on the Master/Slave paradigm wherein any communication between slave devices has to go through the Master. While this model provides for simplicity, it incurs a longer delay between any two slave devices due to far from optimal packet forwarding, the use of double the bandwidth, and also additional energy wastage at the Master. Moreover, if more than two devices want to communicate as a group, this can only be achieved by either multiple unicast transmissions or a piconet-wide broadcast, clearly resulting in inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Slot Assignment (DSA) scheme whereby the Master device dynamically assigns slots to Slaves so as to allow them to communicate directly with each other without any Master intervention. This proposed communication architecture also provides for Quality of Service (QoS) requests, admission control, and multi-device conversation by which a multicast-like communication is implemented within a piconet. Through extensive simulation, we observe that DSA drastically enhances Bluetooth performance in terms of delay and throughput, while significantly reducing power consumption at the master and the overall piconet. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The ever growing popularity of wireless devices has caused crowding of the existing spectrum. One of the major issues faced by real sensor network deployments is the coexistence with other devices and symbiotic interoperability in uncoordinated wireless environments. Since sensor networks consist of low power embedded nodes, the issue of coexistence and interference avoidance becomes important as the nodes remain handicapped while competing against other less resource constrained devices for the same channel. Surprisingly only a limited amount of work has been done towards designing spectrum agile and cognitive MACs catering the inevitable wireless interference. The selection of an interference minimal channel for data communication is key for reliable operation of a sensor network MAC protocol. In this paper, we identify the fundamental design challenges for dynamic selection of an interference free channel in wireless sensor networks. We describe a lightweight channel selection strategy designed to efficiently cater the real world deployment issues. We have carried out performance evaluation of our scheme on real sensor nodes and measured metrics such as successful packet delivery ratios and throughput. We provide comparative analysis of our channel selection algorithm with a random channel scheme on a sensor node testbed in the presence of different types of wireless interference patterns. Experiments show that our scheme has fast convergence and is able to achieve higher throughput and successful packet delivery ratios.	agile software development;catastrophic interference;coexist (image);crowding;embedded system;interference (communication);interoperability;network packet;performance evaluation;qualitative comparative analysis;selection algorithm;sensor node;software deployment;testbed;throughput	Junaid Ansari;Petri Mähönen	2010		10.1145/1868497.1868511	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.307874483080786	87.33589378492714	131444

Energy is the main constraint associated with the sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a cluster based multipath routing protocol, which uses the clustering and multipath techniques to reduce energy consumption and increase the reliability. The basic idea is to reduce the load of the sensor node by giving more responsibility to the base station (sink).

While the original motivation for Vehicular Networks was to promote traffic safety, recently it has become increasingly obvious that Vehicular Networks open new vistas for Internet access, providing weather or road condition, parking availability, distributed gaming, and advertisement. In previous papers [27,28], we introduced Cooperation as a Service (CaaS); a new service-oriented solution which enables improved and new services for the road users and an optimized use of the road network through vehicle’s cooperation and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The current paper is an extension of the first ones; it describes an improved version of CaaS and provides its full implementation details and simulation results. CaaS structures the network into clusters, and uses Content Based Routing (CBR) for intra-cluster communications and DTN (Delay – and disruption-Tolerant Network) routing for inter-cluster communications. To show the feasibility of our approach, we implemented and tested CaaS using Opnet modeler software package. Simulation results prove the correctness of our protocol and indicate that CaaS achieves higher performance as compared to an Epidemic approach.	correctness (computer science);delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;emergence;hoc (programming language);internet access;routing;service-oriented device architecture;simulation;vehicle-to-vehicle;whole earth 'lectronic link	Hajar Mousannif;Ismail Khalil;Stephan Olariu	2012	Mobile Information Systems	10.3233/MIS-2012-0136	vehicular ad hoc network;embedded system;intelligent transportation system;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;publish–subscribe pattern;computer security;computer network;cluster	Mobile	2.4991654370858205	85.85725322016496	131533

In this article, we focus on exploring context knowledge between nodes to control congestion. For this purpose, we first measure the effect of context information on congestion, and specify several major congestion factors. We then model the congestion control problem as multiple criteria decision making, in which the weight of each congestion factor is measured by the CRITIC method. Subsequently, we develop a context-aware congestion control approach (CACC) to determine the forwarding set, including those messages that incur the least congestion on the network. Extensive real-trace driven simulation is conducted, and the experimental results finally validate the efficiency of our proposed CACC.	control theory;network congestion;simulation;smartphone	Kaimin Wei;Song Guo;Ke Xu	2014	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2014.6829943	routing;computer science;distributed computing;packet loss;network congestion;computer security;slow-start;computer network	Networks	5.007885450786288	84.85496751731566	131565

In MANETs, nodes are mobile, and due to this mobility, topology of the network changes rapidly. This dynamic topology reduces the data availability in MANETs. Cooperative caching provides an attractive solution for this problem. In this paper, a new cooperative caching algorithm, ProCoCa, is proposed. This algorithm is based on a proactive approach. Each node will be associated with a zone and the data of leaving node will be cached. The authors simulate the algorithm on OMNET++ simulator, and simulation results show that ProCoCa improves the data availability as well as overall performance of the network.	algorithm;cache (computing);proactive parallel suite;simulation	Prashant Kumar;Naveen Chauhan;Lalit Kumar Awasthi;Narottam Chand	2011	IJMCMC	10.4018/jmcmc.2011100104	computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;network performance;computer security;computer network	Metrics	0.47577210457094926	81.62478462099396	131732

However, it is difficult to provide the exact location information for location services in a mobile ad hoc network. Nevertheless, the location of nodes can be predicted based on the nodes’ mobility information. We propose prediction-based mechanisms for location updating and destination searching. Many simulations under different motion environments are given. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanisms can significantly reduce the control overhead of location updating and improve the successful rate of searching the destination nodes in the meantime.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;breath of fire iii;computer science;distributed computing;geographic routing;hoc (programming language);image processing;information engineering;information management;location-based service;management science;operations research;optical character recognition;overhead (computing);simulation;the computer journal	Rei-Heng Cheng;Chiming Huang	2012	J.

04107030f2d97ab412f802b84cefcd8340ed5edd	broadcasting with prediction and selective forwarding in vehicular networks		Broadcasting in vehicular networks has attracted great interest in research community and industry. Broadcasting on disseminating information to individual vehicle beyond the transmission range is based on inter-vehicle communication systems. It is crucial to broadcastmessages to other vehicles as fast as possible because themessages in vehicle communication systems are often emergency messages such as accident warning or alarm. In many current approaches, the message initiator or sender selects the node among its neighbors that is farthest away from it in the broadcasting direction and then assigns the node to rebroadcast the message once the node gets out of its range or after a particular time slot. However, this approach may select a nonoptimal candidate because it does not consider the moving status of vehicles including their moving directions and speeds. In this paper, we develop a new approach based on prediction of future velocity and selective forwarding. The current message sender selects the best candidate that will rebroadcast the message to other vehicles as fast as possible. Key to the decision making is to consider the candidates’ previous moving status and predict the future moving trends of the candidates so that the message is spread out faster. In addition, this approach generates very low overhead. Simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly decreases end-to-end delay and improves message delivery ratio.	algorithm;computer simulation;end-to-end principle;inter-process communication;overhead (computing);scsi initiator and target;velocity (software development);wave	Jianjun Yang;Zongming Fei	2013	IJDSN	10.1155/2013/309041	broadcasting;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.290067575842443	87.70769150187024	131882

In recent years, the basic forwarding strategies have been refined to create road-based paths, connecting successive road intersections selected on the basis of the connectivity between them. Revisiting this idea, we present two different flavors of a new protocols (Intersection-Based Routing on Virtual Nodes): called VNIBR reactive and proactive. These variations can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art routing protocols by relying on a virtualization layer that transparently deals with the problems of mobility. With the aim of analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the new protocols, we have proposed a friendly urban scenario where we prove our routing protocols by means of simulations with different vehicle densities, looking at overhead, packet delivery ratios and end-to-end delays.	algorithm;download;end-to-end principle;experiment;hoc (programming language);multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;reliability engineering;routing;simulation;swarm intelligence	Esteban Fernando Ordóñez-Morales;Victor Saians-Vazquezl;Jack Fernando Bravo-Torres;Yolanda Blanco-Fernández;Martín López Nores	2016	2016 8th IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)	10.1109/LATINCOM.2016.7811580	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;virtual routing and forwarding;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;computer security;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.866617772618177	84.39830112580638	131992

We conclude that in a circular multihop sensor network (modeled as concentric coronas) with nonuniform node distribution and constant data reporting, the unbalanced energy depletion among all the nodes in the network is unavoidable. Even if the nodes in the inner coronas of the network have used up their energy simultaneously, the ones in the outermost corona may still have unused energy. This is due to the intrinsic many-to-one traffic pattern of WSNs. Nevertheless, nearly balanced energy depletion in the network is possible if the number of nodes increases in geometric progression from the outer coronas to the inner ones except the outermost one. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel nonuniform node distribution strategy to achieve nearly balanced energy depletion in the network. We regulate the number of nodes in each corona and derive the ratio between the node densities in the adjacent (i + 1)th and ith coronas by the strategy. Finally, we propose (q-switch routing, a distributed shortest path routing algorithm tailored for the proposed nonuniform node distribution strategy. Extensive simulations have been performed to validate the analysis.	algorithm;color gradient;depletion region;emoticon;jpeg xr;one-to-many (data model);pr/sm;rewrite (programming);routing;shortest path problem;simulation;unbalanced circuit	Xiaobing Wu;Guihai Chen;Sajal K.

Consequently, we proposed a novel framework, namely Quasi-Guaranteed System Lifetime (Q-GSL), which allows the admission of flows without jeopardizing the limited energy of the wireless stations. A noteworthy feature of Q-GSL is that it provides a means for contention mitigation and load balancing. The upper bound on the packet rate is computed in the absence of the energy overheads associated with routing, contention resolution, channel sensing, etc. The results reported herein augment our previous conclusions about the usefulness of the proposed framework. We show that load balancing is achieved amongst the routes and the nodes in the wireless ad hoc network without violating any of the energy constraints, and while adhering to a pre-computed deterministic minimum system lifetime.	aggregate data;gnu scientific library;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);network congestion;network packet;precomputation;routing;traffic flow (computer networking)	Ahmed M.

The purpose of this classification is to clearly delineate the assumptions they work under and to facilitate mapping of applications to these algorithms. Algorithms based on opportunistic contact and some variant of epidemic routing use minimal topology knowledge and the most resources due to replication. The island-based algorithms find routes between connected islands and are closer to real applications such as tactical military networks. The general consensus is that there is no single routing solution that will minimize delay at the same maximizing throughput for DTNs. Majority of the algorithms assume non-standard and diverse scenarios which makes comparative evaluation difficult. Mapping applications to algorithms also poses a problem as many of the known applications do not match in scale the rigor of the proposed algorithms. Further efforts in standardization and verifiable evaluation using application context are the way forward.	algorithm;context (computing);delay-tolerant networking;formal verification;routing;throughput;uncontrolled format string	Padma Mundur;Matthew Seligman	2008	2008 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Pervasive Computing	10.1109/ISWPC.2008.4556268	routing;static routing;real-time computing;engineering;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	1.1603675491112568	82.24428756430764	132652

From all the existing techniques to achieve synchronization, those that work at the MAC layer and can precisely timestamp sync messages are the most accurate. However, working with standard protocols, usually prevents the user from accessing lower layers and consequently reduces accuracy. Receiver-receiver schema improves time-stamping performance because it eliminates the biggest non-deterministic error at the sender side; the medium access time. Nevertheless, utilization of these methods in multi- hop networks usually requires an extra amount of traffic. In this paper we present a method which allows accurate synchronization of large multi-hop networks such as satellite networks working at the application layer while keeping the message exchange to the minimum. Through an exhaustive experimentation, we show the protocol's performance and analyze the factors that influence synchronization accuracy the most.	access time;hop;scheduling (computing);synchronization (computer science);technical standard	Álvaro Marco;Roberto Casas;José Luis Sevillano;Victorián Coarasa;Jorge L.

EMGR utilizes geographic information, the characteristics of energy consumption and the metric of advanced energy cost to select the next forwarding node, and uses a dynamic anchor list to shift routing path for load balance. Simulation results show that EMGR is superior to other protocols in terms of energy efficiency, network lifetime, end-to-end delay, and packet delivery ratio.

One promising solution is to adopt a checkpointing that periodically saves the state of a sensor node, thereby maintaining node reliability and network availability. Thus, this study first shows the design and implementation of a full checkpointing for WSNs. However, checkpointing is expensive. Therefore, incremental checkpointing was previously proposed to eliminate the checkpoint overhead by relying on the page protection hardware to identify dirty pages. Because sensor nodes are resource-constrained and do not equip with the page protection hardware, previous incremental checkpointings cannot be directly applied. To address this issue, this paper proposes three incremental checkpointings for WSNs. These three methods differ in the granularity of the checkpoint memory data unit and module execution overhead. In addition, we designed an incremental checkpoint file format that simultaneously supports proposed three different incremental checkpointings and accommodates them with sensor network characteristics. We implemented the full and three incremental checkpointings on SOS in the mica2 sensor motes. A performance evaluation of the three incremental checkpointings is presented. We also discuss and evaluate a method for selecting the appropriate incremental checkpointing. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to design and implement incremental checkpointing in MMU-less WSNs.

We address here dynamic routing problems where the load of roads is taken into account dynamically, aiming at the optimization of required travel times. We investigate ant-based algorithms that can handle dynamic routing problems, but suffer from negative emergent effects like road congestions. We propose an inverse antbased routing algorithm to avoid these negative emergent effects. We evaluate our approach with the agent-based traffic simulation system MAINSIM. For evaluation, we use a synthetic and two real world scenarios. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed inverse ant-based routing can lead to a reduction of travel time.	agent-based model;algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;emergence;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;routing;simulation;synthetic intelligence	Jörg Dallmeyer;René Schumann;Andreas D.

In order to optimize the wireless sensor networks performance and meanwhile expand the cellular network's service applications, mobile cellular networks and wireless sensor networks are evolving from heterogeneous to converge. However, the sensor nodes need to be informed the mobile sink's location for data collection purpose. Unfortunately, frequent location updates from multiple sinks can lead to both excessive drain of sensors' limited battery supply and increased collisions in wireless transmission. In this paper, we describe the movement direction based path selection strategy which adopts the grid structure and provides an efficient mobile sink's location updates approach. When the sinks have mobility, they only inform their current locations to the specific nodes on the previous path instead of the source nodes. We evaluate the proposed method through both analysis and extensive simulations. The results show that our proposed theory not only provides an energy-efficient location update approach, but also generates a minimal delay path for data dissemination.	autonomous robot;collision domain;converge;mobile phone;sensor;simulation	Jingfeng Qu;Zhenhong Li;Haifeng Wang;Fei Yin;Fuqiang Liu;Ping Wang	2012	2012 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2012.6399011	wireless wan;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;radio resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	9.215801228327907	78.19194935692327	133120

The need is to improve the performance of such systems that can be significantly done by using adaptive cooperative diversity (SCA) technique, which is basically a cross-layer design that combines truncated ARQ at the link layer and cooperative diversity at the physical layer. In addition to it, LEACH protocol gives advantage of utilizing randomized rotation of local cluster-heads to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. This paper proposes an integrated system, SCA with LEACH and evaluates its performance with LEACH with truncated ARQ system. Comparison is done based on network lifetime and packet loss rate of system under varying propagation scenarios, number of retransmissions, initial energy by node and network size. Simulation results show better performances with various achieved thresholds.	network packet;performance evaluation;randomized algorithm;sensor;simulation;software propagation;truncated newton method	Marcelo Portela Sousa;Ajey Kumar;Marcelo Sampaio de Alencar;Waslon Terllizzie A.

It does not require coordinates, requiring only minimal connectivity information (for example, whether any two nodes are within either the sensing radius or twice the sensing radius.) The radio communications area is assumed to be larger than the sensed area. Two active nodes are called neighbors, and are said to be connected by a link, if their distance lies between these two values. Redundant nodes are likely to exist inside an active node's sensing range. If all connected neighbors of some active node A can form a ring via links between them, there is no large hole inside the ring. Otherwise A is a boundary node of a large hole. All boundary nodes and most holes can be detected with very low probability of error, and simulation results suggest that redundant nodes are selected efficiently for activation when recovering the hole.	distributed algorithm;simulation	Xiaoyun Li;David K.

The first part of the paper provides an overview of the most recent research on sink mobility in WSNs, placing a special emphasis on different types of sink mobility (random, predictable and controlled) and discussing the application scenarios most suitable for their respective deployment. In the second part of the paper, our OPNET model for simulation of large-scale and ZigBee-based wireless sensor networks is presented. The model enables effective evaluation of random and predictable sink mobility under varying conditions and forms of routing in the underlying ZigBee WSN. The results obtained using this model show that in terms of energy efficiency ZigBeepsilas tree-based routing outperforms ZigBeepsilas mesh routing, both in the case of random and predictable sink mobility. At the same time, under both mobility models, tree-based routing generates longer delays in the delivery of data reporting packets. Furthermore, when compared against each other assuming identical network conditions, random mobility is shown to achieve higher energy efficiency and shorter packet delays than predictable mobility.	mesh networking;network packet;routing;simulation;software deployment	Dusan Stevanovic;Natalija Vlajic	2008	2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2008.4664265	embedded system;neurfon;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;mobility model;computer network	Mobile	7.174815395683292	84.33358747536309	133524

The use of caterpillar as the multicast tree has been analyzed and compared with the other tree topologies under the new measure of the multicast network metric. We have applied graceful label distributions to the links of the spanning caterpillars associated to the autonomous sub-networks (AN) that involved in the multicasting. The labeling algorithm proposed uniquely assigns link labels based on the node numbering which in turn enables to give a sharp estimate to the time-to-live parameter, optimal selection of RP (rendezvous points) of multicast caterpillar topology to nodes in the ANs by transmitting of ‘graceful code’ in the form of sequence of (n-2) node numbers. The graceful code for the caterpillar has revealed an efficient method (G-trace) of the reconstruction of multicast tree topology which in turn to be used for maintability and for the other purposes in the management site.

Geographic routing requires the sources nodes to be aware of the location of the sinks. Most of existing geographic routing protocols merely assume that the sources can get the location of sinks by some location service. How can source nodes obtain the location of sinks is not addressed in detail. In this paper, we propose an anchor node based sink location dissemination scheme for geographic routing in wireless sensor networks. In this scheme, a source node and a sink node send sink location announcement and query messages along two paths respectively by geographic routing. The node located on the crossing point of the two paths informs the source about the sink location. The challenge of this paper is that how to guarantee these two paths having at least one crossing point in any irregular profile of sensor network. Simulation results show that our protocol is significantly superior to other protocols in terms of energy consumption and control overhead.	geographic routing;institute for operations research and the management sciences;location-based service;network packet;overhead (computing);scalability;sensor node;simulation	Fucai Yu;Younghwan Choi;Sang Ha Kim;Euisin Lee	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.541	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;wireless sensor network;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	4.0391416358144925	81.05101602517682	133803

We use a new metric definition to route the packets and to select the best available link along the path in a multi-rate protocol senario. The new metric is created with information coming from interlayer interaction between the routing layer and the MAC layer. We use SNR as an information about link quality. We show through simulation that for communications using muti-rate protocol in ad hoc networks, throughput is highly affected as soon as the route goes through low-rate link.	autonomic computing;bit error rate;hoc (programming language);information exchange;mathematical optimization;routing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput;transmitter	André-Luc Beylot;Riadh Dhaou;Vincent Gauthier;Monique Becker	2004		10.1007/0-387-23150-1_2	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;data link layer;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;ieee 802.11;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;quality of service;supernetwork;border gateway protocol;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.4960014873742187	85.39083366971327	133828

This paper presents an approach for connecting this simulation and real-world VANET hardware to extend the test range and investigates the real-time behaviour of the simulation.

Additionally, the paper deals with the impacts of real-time losses on the test run outcomes. Most time dependant algorithms like the duplicate packet detection do not need very accurate real-time data and thus could be verified using the presented approach. Otherwise, in some cases such as testing of multi-hop communication, accurate real time is crucial.	algorithm;device under test;network packet;open-source software;real-time clock;real-time data;real-time transcription;simulation	Christina Obermaier;Christian Facchi	2017	CoRR		real-time computing;vehicular ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;network packet;device under test	Embedded	0.33799683587627993	87.7809895437948	133890

The communication relies on a network with an access point (Wi-Fi, cellular, etc.) using ad hoc communication because Wi-Fi Direct would avoid this dependence. Currently, Wi-Fi Direct does not support multi-hop communication or moving devices. This work focuses on expanding the use of Wi-Fi Direct technology, so that information sent from a device can walk on the network (multi-hop). The number of exchanged messages by devices were measured using four classic routing protocols: i) flooding, ii) Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), iii) AODV-Backup Route (AODV-BR), and iv) Location-Aided Routing (LAR) and a new protocol that we proposed, namely Contact and Social Behavior Routing (CSB) that uses Impromptu Mobile Social Network (IMSN) metrics to store routes. We see that even with some challenges one can route mobile devices over Wi-Fi Direct.	backup;hoc (programming language);impromptu;information exchange;mobile device;mobile social network;routing;wireless access point	Ricardo P.

This paper presents a performance study of the RCRR protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks.

Through the presented scenarios and simulations, it is shown that the energy consumption is much more in some cases and much less in other cases. Based on this study, guidelines can be deduced to improve the behavior of the RCCR routing protocol.	algorithm;routing	N. W.

7453ddb3a2cbbf1d44fae8f7d8da78abcb8c2404	time efficient energy-aware routing in software defined networks		As devices and traffic in the Internet increase, power consumption becomes a critical issue for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry. The emerging technology, Software Defined Networking (SDN), can adaptively manage the network resources and control the power consumption. In this paper, we first investigate the time efficient energy aware routing in SDN enabled networks, and then propose a Time Efficient Energy Aware Routing (TEAR) algorithm. The goal of this work is to effectively reduce the number of used links for packet delivery so that the energy consumption can be decreased. Different from most existing schemes which only focus on static demands, the proposed TEAR algorithm considers both the temporal variation in demand and computational efficiency when finding routing paths. Specifically, the energy consumption problem for routing traffic in a network is formulated as an integer linear programming problem. Hence, the proposed TEAR algorithm can dynamically route flows in a time efficient manner. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other schemes in terms of computation time and energy consumption of the network.

When multiple vehicles with geographical proximity have a common interest in certain objects to download, they can collaborate to significantly reduce their overall download time. In this paper, we investigate the application of Network Coding (NC) in collaborative downloading (CD). We focus on the R2V part of CD, and analytically derive probability distribution and the expected value of the amount of time necessary to deliver all of the information to the vehicles with and without NC. Our results show that using NC slightly improves the downloading time in addition to removing the need for having any sort of uplink communications from vehicles to the infrastructure.	download;linear network coding;list of code lyoko episodes;on the fly;sparse matrix;telecommunications link;wheels	Mohammad Hamed Firooz;Sumit Roy	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364257	vehicular ad hoc network;probability distribution;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer security;statistics;computer network	Robotics	4.487877520014922	88.2019979025817	134042
f4bf1b167ba4c3dfdc2069265b34a43c8c27e133	a review of power aware routing protocols in wireless sensor networks		WSNs are envisioned to consist of many small devices that can sense the environment and communicate the data as required. The most critical requirement for widespread sensor networks is power efficiency since battery replacement is not viable. Many protocols are proposed to minimize the power consumption by using complex algorithms. However, it is difficult to perform these complex methods since an individual sensor node in sensor networks does not have high computational capacity. On the other hand, many sensor nodes should transfer the data packet to the sink node that collects the required data. Therefore, the operations of the sensor nodes over the route are terminated. It is difficult to deliver the data packet to the sink node even if some sensor nodes are active. In this paper, an introduction of WSNs is presented with a deep insight into the power-aware routing protocol for sensor networks. The protocols considered are – LEACH,VGA and PEGASIS. In addition, a comparison of these protocols is also presented.

43a961b1fdd1180beceeadd0486ce7cf68a76966	data backup for mobile nodes: a cooperative middleware and an experimentation platform	mobile;building block;p2p;middleware;evaluation;mobile node;it evaluation;mobile systems;backup	In this paper, we present a middleware for dependable mobile systems and an experimentation platform for its evaluation. The middleware proposed is based on three original building blocks: a Proximity Map, a Trust and Cooperation Oracle, and a Cooperative Data Backup service. A Distributed Black-box is used as an illustrative application and evaluated on top of the proposed mobile platform. 1. Problem Statement Finding the proper abstractions to design middleware for the provision of dependable distributed applications on mobile devices is still a big challenge[1]. The number of mobile communicating devices one can meet in every-day life is dramatically increasing: mobile phones, PDAs, handheld GPS, laptops and notebooks, portable music and video players. Those devices benefit from an amazing number of sensors and communication interfaces. The interconnection of these systems does not only result in a huge distributed system. New technical and scientific challenges emerge due to the mobility of users and of their devices, or due to the massive scale of uncontrolled devices that constantly connect and disconnect, fail, etc. To handle those systems’ dynamics, cooperation-based approaches à la peer-to-peer seem attractive. An important question is thus to know if and how can we design a sound middleware that offers useful building blocks for this type of system. Another crucial question is to study how we can correctly evaluate those highly mobile and dynamic systems. This work was partially supported by the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the European Hidenets project (EUIST-FP6-26979), and the European ReSIST network of excellence (EU-IST-FP6-26764). This paper answers these two questions: we present a middleware architecture dedicated to the provision of cooperative data backup on mobile nodes and a platform for its experimental evaluation. This architecture is exemplified by implementing a Distributed Black-Box (DBB) application which provides a virtual device, whose semantics is similar to avionics blackboxes, that tracks cars’ history in a way that can be replayed in the event of a car accident. This application ensures information is securely stored using replication mechanisms, by means of exchanging positions between cars. Our implementation is based on three original services: a Proximity Map, a Trust and Cooperation Oracle, and a Cooperative Data Backup. This DBB application is a good illustration of the use of the various middleware services and applications that users can benefit thanks to mobile communicating devices, such as in the automobile context with carto-car communication. As a “classical” black-box, its aim is to record critical data, such as: engine / vehicle speed, brake status, throttle position, and even the state of the driver’s seat belt switch. As a “smart” blackbox, it can also be used for extending the recorded information with contextual information concerning the neighboring vehicles, possibly the various vehicles involved in an accident. Indeed, information stored by the application leverages vehicle-based parameters and communication-induced information. The proposed architecture is based on four main middleware building blocks, namely a Networking service, a Proximity Map, a Trust and Cooperation Oracle, and a Cooperative Data Backup service. This architecture and the DBB application will be described in Section 2. This distributed architecture being targeted to mobile nodes (e.g. automobiles), it has been implemented and evaluated on top of a mobile robot platform described in section 3. Finally, we give some further trails of research in Section 4. ha l-0 03 85 20 3, v er si on 1 18 M ay 2 00 9 Cooperative Data Backup Robot Platform Location HW Reduced WiFi SmartCard Location Svce Networking Svce Trust&Coop. Ocle OS X 10.5.6 + Java 1.5 Proximity Map Figure 1. Overall Architecture 2. Architecture and system model This work was conducted in the course of the Hidenets project. HIDENETS (HIghly DEpendable ipbased NETworks and Services) was a specific targeted research project funded by the European Union under the Information Society Sixth Framework Programme. The aim of HIDENETS was to develop and analyze end-to-end resilience solutions for distributed applications and mobility-aware services in ubiquitous communication scenarios. The overall architecture used in this work is depicted on Fig. 1. The mobile platform, the hardware and other experimental settings will be described later in Section 3. This architecture is a partial implementation of the Hidenets architecture and has been detailed in the projects deliverables, see e.g. [2] or [3]. Apart from standard hardware-related services (networking, localization...), we propose three new building blocks, targeted for mobile systems, that are described in the following subsections. The rationale of these building blocks is as follows: • Proximity map. Before being able to backup data, a mobile node has first to discover its neighbors and the resources and services they offer. The proximity map represents the local knowledge a node has about its vicinity. • Trust and cooperation oracle. In order to interact with a priori unknown neighbors for critical services (e.g., collaborative backup), a node has to evaluate the level of trust it can assign to each of its neighbors. The purpose of the trust and cooperation oracle is to evaluate this level of trust and to incite nodes to cooperate with one another. • Cooperative data backup. The provision of a cooperative backup service at the middleware level is the major contribution of the architecture described in this paper. This service acts as a peer-to-peer storage resource sharing service for backup and restoration of critical data. 2.1. Communication and network layer Since Java provides no specific support for ad hoc networking, we implemented a specific package for handling multiple WiFi interfaces. This package supports both UDP broadcasting and TCP unicasting. It handles indexing, choping and unchoping of arbitrary size messages and deals with typed messages. As we are only interested in local interactions within an entity’s neighborhood, our network layer implements one-hop interactions only, and does not address the problem of routing in an ad-hoc network. 2.2. Localization and Proximity Map For many applications for mobile nodes, and especially for cooperation-based applications, a node needs to interact with its neighbors. Furthermore, the quality of service that may be provided by a given component can vary according to the vicinity, e.g. the quantity of neighbors, their density, etc. It is then necessary to formalize this view of the vicinity into a more abstract representation. To that means, we propose the Proximity Map building block, that provides an abstraction of the physically attainable network of entities. The aim of this building block is to provide applications with information aggregated from localization and networking layers. Indeed, the goal of the proximity map is to gather physical information about nodes in the vicinity. When using its proximity map, a given node has a view of the nodes in its vicinity (defined as being the nodes which are reachable within H hops), their location information, and the freshness of the pieces of information. This problem has similarities with neighbor discovery protocols for ad-hoc routing algorithms, that can be divided into pro active schemes and reactive schemes. In a reactive scheme, information about routing is constructed on demand, i.e., as soon as a message has to be sent to a previously unknown destination. In a pro active scheme, the entity periodically sends messages on the network to look for new neighbors, and to check the availability and reachability of already discovered requested by the application/caller. Since we are only interested in local interactions, and due to the fact that the set of entities is large and unknown to participants, we designed the proximity map as a pro active service. Intuitively each node periodically beacons its proximity map to its 1-hop neighbors, and collects similar ha l-0 03 85 20 3, v er si on 1 18 M ay 2 00 9 information from its direct neighbors. When merging these pieces of information, it is able to update its proximity map with new nodes that appeared as neighbors of neighbors, nodes which have moved, nodes whose connectivity changed, etc. The preliminary ideas about the proximity map can be found in [4]. To implement the proximity map, we use locationstamped beacons. Each node keeps a map of its knowledge of the location and connectivity of other nodes, which is represented as a graph.This graph is regularly updated when the node receives a beacon and is also regularly sent to the node’s neighbors in its beacons. 2.3. Trust and Cooperation Oracle The trust and cooperation oracle (TCO) is our second basic building block for cooperative services. A cooperative service emerges from the cooperation of entities that are generally unknown to one another. Therefore, these entities have no a priori trust relationship and may thus be reluctant to cooperate. In cooperative systems without cooperation incentives, entities tend to behave in a rational way in order to maximize their own benefit from the system. The goal of the trust and cooperation oracle is therefore to evaluate locally the level of trust of neighboring entities and to manage cooperation incentives [5]. Synergy is the desired positive effect of cooperation, i.e., that the accrued benefits are greater than the sum of the benefits that could be achieved without cooperation. However synergy can only be achieved if nodes do cooperate rather than pursuing some individual short-term strategy, i.e. being rational. Therefore, cooperative systems need to have cooperation incentives and rationality disincentives.

SFTs associate the failure time of leaf events with a non-Markovian (GEN) cumulative distribution function (CDF) and support the evaluation of system unreliability over time. In the reference scenario, the SFT model dynamically updates system unreliability according to samples delivered by the WSN, it maintains a dynamic measure of the safe time-horizon within which the system is expected to operate under a given threshold of unreliability, and it also provides the WSN with a measure of the contribution of each basic event to system unreliability.	byzantine fault tolerance;fault tree analysis;power management	Laura Carnevali;Lorenzo Ridi;Enrico Vicario	2009	2009 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation	10.1109/ETFA.2009.5347071	embedded system;fault tolerance;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;fault tree analysis;computer science;engineering;distributed computing	Embedded	8.658556120246642	76.37398155805089	134355

Moreover, to access the information from sensor nodes efficiently in aquatic environment is very unpredictable. In our scheme sensor nodes are randomly deployed in the network filed. We have cover the maximum network field through constant mobility of two sinks. Due to consistent movement of mobile sinks every time maximum number of sensor nodes transmit their data packets to the respective mobile sink in their transmission range. Mobility of sinks increases the throughput with balanced energy consumption.

We employ a graph-theoretic approach for the analysis. Furthermore, we assume wireless NANs based on the new IEEE 802.15.4g standard. A planning tool has been implemented using software Mathematica in order to automate our approach. Simulation results show interesting tradeoffs between the performance metrics and the network design parameters, thus providing useful insights for the NAN designer.	deployment environment;electrical connection;gateway (telecommunications);graph theory;nan;network planning and design;simulation;smart meter;wolfram mathematica	Joao R.

Since highly resource-constrained, WSNs pose specific challenges to the design and implementation of protocols and algorithms. In order to test, compare, and verify the intended functionality of new approaches, performance evaluations must be conducted in a sound and credible manner. Instead of simulative evaluation, the WSN research community has mostly shown a preference towards experimental evaluation. Being especially important for the evaluation of routing protocols, node mobility is one of the more complex features to facilitate in testbeds. Robots have been the most common means for moving nodes so far, which, however, introduces more costs and limits reproducibility, scalability, and mobility patterns. We present a new software-based approach that essentially combines mobility modeling with link control. Mobility patterns taken from the mobility scenario generator BonnMotion are converted and replayed to create a virtual dynamic topology. Our approach drastically reduces costs, makes mobility reproducible and scalable, and enables the use of a variety of mobility models.	algorithm;overhead (computing);robot;routing;scalability;software performance testing;software propagation;testbed	Nils Aschenbruck;Jan Bauer;Jakob Bieling;Alexander Bothe;Matthias Schwamborn	2012	2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289190	wireless sensor network;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;mobility model;mobile wireless sensor network;network topology;wireless;computer network	Mobile	0.38650607485807303	87.8108731090303	134670
448d8f326f5440938f20695bfc12ec7ac5c1cdcd	cartography gathering driven by the olsr protocol		Nowadays, the location awareness becomes a ubiquitous requirement for several computing applications. The utilization of such knowledge in mobile ad hoc networks is primarily limited by the scarcity of their resources. In this paper, we propose two cartography gathering schemes (OLSR-SCGS and OLSR-ACGS) that make use of the seminal OLSR signaling in order to endue nodes participating in the MANET with location awareness. The first proposed scheme (OLSR-SCGS) is inspired from the operation of OLSR during the process of routing table calculation. The simplicity of this scheme makes it subject to several limitations that we avoid in the second scheme (OLSR-ACGS). In this latter scheme, the nodes become able to identify the freshest position among the available ones thanks to a dedicated time stamping approach. Conducted simulations show the effectiveness of the two proposed approaches. Nevertheless, simulations portray the superiority of the second proposed scheme (OLSR-ACGS) regarding the first one (OLSR-SCGS) when the network dynamics increases. Through simulations, we show that the validity of the collected cartography is impacted by several factors such as the tolerated distance parameter, the frequencies of OLSR control messages and the network extent.	cartography;hoc (programming language);location awareness;optimized link state routing protocol;quasiperiodicity;routing table;simulation	Mohamed Belhassen;Abdelfettah Belghith	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30507-8_42	simulation;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	4.864821165165441	82.30331319861897	134751

One of the most important protocol in the initialization phase is a clustering protocol, which also aids in the route formation. In this paper, a joint clustering and routing protocol has been proposed for three-dimensional Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network. This proposed protocol uses a non-probabilistic approach which selects the Cluster-Head node based on the weighted cost of residual energy and network connectivity. Route is then formed to the Base-Station node using chain of Cluster-Head nodes of the network.

Multicast routing scenario has considerable impact on the quality of optical signal received at each destination. To guarantee the fairness of signal quality at different destinations in a multicast session, it is desirable to construct a loss-balanced light-forest to deliver the multicast traffic. A loss-balanced light-forest is composed of a set of light-trees bounded in size (number of destinations per multicast tree), in size variation (difference in the number of destinations among different multicast trees), and in dimension (maximum source-to-destination distance on each multicast tree). This paper investigates the multicast routing and wavelength assignment (MC-RWA) problem under the loss-balance constraint. The problem is formulated as an optimization model using integer linear programming (ILP). Numerical solutions to the optimization model can supply useful performance benchmarks for loss-balance-constrained optical multicast in WDM networks.	multicast;wavelength-division multiplexing	Yuan Cao;Oliver Yu	2006	J.

Troubleshooting is especially challenging in multihop wireless networks because the behavior of such networks depends on complicated interactions between many unpredictable factors such as RF noise, signal propagation, node interference, and traffic flows. In this paper we propose a new direction for research on fault diagnosis in wireless networks. Specifically, we present a diagnostic system that employs trace-driven simulations to detect faults and perform root cause analysis. We apply this approach to diagnose performance problems caused by packet dropping, link congestion, external noise, and MAC misbehavior. In a 25 node multihop wireless network, we are able to diagnose over 10 simultaneous faults of multiple types with more than 80% coverage. Our framework is general enough for a wide variety of wireless and wired networks.	interaction;interference (communication);network congestion;network packet;radio frequency;simulation;software propagation	Lili Qiu;Paramvir Bahl;Ananth Rao;Lidong Zhou	2005		10.1145/1064212.1064264	multi-frequency network;network management;wireless ad hoc network;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;heterogeneous network;root cause analysis;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;traffic flow;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;computer network	Mobile	-2.4438243733289204	87.86499901781305	134833

Each of these applications has its own specific structure, goals, and requirements. Medium access control (MAC) protocols play a significant role in WSNs and should be tuned to the particular application. However, there is no general model that can aid in the selection and tuning of MAC protocols for different applications, imposing a heavy burden on the design engineers of these networks. Having a precise analytical model for each MAC protocol, on the other hand, is almost impossible. Using the intuition that protocols in the same behavioral set perform similarly, our goal in this paper is to introduce a general model that can help select the protocol(s) that satisfy given requirements from a protocol set that performs best for a given context. We define the Combined Performance Function (CPF) to demonstrate the performance of different category protocols for different contexts. Having developed the general model, we then discuss the models scalability in terms of adding new protocols, categories, requirements, and performance criteria. Considering energy consumption and delay as the initial performance criteria of the model, we focus on deriving mathematical models for them. Previous rules of thumb for selecting MAC protocols support the results extracted from CPF, providing a practical verification for our model. We further validate our models with the help of simulation studies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Various """"explicit"""" clustering techniques have been proposed to improve scalability obtaining successful sessions in fields of 400-800 nodes. However explicit clustering may damage the performances, e.g., sessions breaks due to fast movements of cluster heads and the overhead for the explicit partition to clusters. An alternative to explicit clustering is to use algorithms that are """"naturally clustered"""", i.e., over time arrange the nodes in dynamic hierarchical structures obtaining a similar effect to that of explicit clustering. The explicit clustering is more adaptive than explicit clustering and basically comes without overhead as it does not require an additional protocol for explicit partition of the nodes to clusters and cluster heads. For example if a cluster head moves away from its group another node may replace it without updating its class member. In this work we study the effect of explicit clustering by comparing an advance version of the AODV (a core algorithm in ad hoc networks) with the MRA algorithm that has the naturally clustering property. We cover fundamental aspects of scalability and experimentally prove the superiority of explicit clustering over explicit clustering. In particular we consider heterogeneous theaters with several types of transmitters including personal, cars, helicopters and a GEO satellite. Naturally clustering is more effective in heterogeneous theaters as the more powerful transmitters (helicopters) serve as cluster heads."""	algorithm;cluster analysis;communications satellite;computer cluster;display resolution;experiment;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);performance;routing;scalability;simulation;transmitter	Yosi Ben-Asher;Sharoni Feldman;Moran Feldman;Pini Gurfil	2010	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-008-9636-5	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;scalability;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	2.9693121251777437	84.23806864018074	134902

However, the networks suffer from many problems caused by the limited sensor resources and the harsh environments where these networks are deployed. Many algorithms have been proposed to manage data routing while respecting the specificity of such networks. One of the known proposed routing protocols is RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy networks). Nevertheless this protocol is designed with consideration of the limited sensor energy, it cannot be integrated in may WSN applications. In fact, RPL, as it has been proposed, assume that the sensor nodes are static and don't manage any type of mobility. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called BMP-RPL (Bayesian model Mobility Prediction RPL for wireless sensor networks), that aims to adapt native RPL to nodes' mobility scenarios. This approach is based on nodes' identification and velocity prediction as well as the estimation of the link duration. Thus, we introduce a new metric which constructs routes according to the node status and within information lost. The performance of our approach is proved through simulation.	algorithm;bmp file format;bayesian network;lossy compression;routing;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;simulation;software deployment;velocity (software development)	Fatma Somaa;Inès El Korbi;Cédric Adjih;Leïla Azouz Saïdane	2016	2016 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577140	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;geographic routing;routing information protocol;measurement;computer network	Mobile	7.16236666696439	82.62883945549609	135120

Hundreds or thousands of these devices can be connected using low-power multi-hop wireless networks. These networks foster a new class of ubiquitous computing applications called proactive computing. In proactive applications, computing occurs in the background without requiring human interaction; humans participate to access information or to modify control policies. This paper provides an overview of the application of a large wireless network of sensors to solve everyday problems in the workplace. It describes the implementation of one application that allows people in the workplace to easily find empty conference rooms (e.g., for impromptu meetings). Drawing on this experience, we identify technical challenges and possible directions for building dense networks of sensors that enable proactive computing.	impromptu;low-power broadcasting;sensor;ubiquitous computing	W.

f5920adfe9f0f451e1068cb26636933605e2bd0e	frame counter: achieving accurate and real-time link estimation in low power wireless sensor networks		Link estimation is a fundamental component of forwarding protocols in wireless sensor networks. In low power forwarding, however, the asynchronous nature of widely adopted duty-cycled radio control brings new challenges to achieve accurate and real- time estimation. First, the repeatedly transmitted frames (called wake-up frame) increase the complexity of accurate statistic, especially with bursty channel contention and coexistent interference. Second, frequent update of every link status exhausts the limited energy supply due to long duration of beacon broadcast. In this paper, we propose meter (Distributed Frame Counter), which takes the opportunities of link overhearing to update link status in real time. Furthermore, meter does not only depend on counting the successfully decoded wake-up frames, but also counts the corrupted ones by exploiting the feasibility of ZigBee identification based on short-term sequence of the received signal strength. We implement meter in TinyOS and further evaluate the performance through extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor testbeds. The results demonstrate that meter can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art link estimation schemes.	experiment;interference (communication);radio control;real-time transcription;testbed;tinyos	Daibo Liu;Zhichao Cao;Mengshu Hou;Yi Zhang	2016	2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN)		routing;estimation;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;interference;accuracy and precision;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;statistics;computer network	Mobile	9.996737952779265	83.99493230388158	135331

In this paper, we investigated the good put of AODV, OLSR and DYMO routing protocols using CAVENET (Cellular Automaton based Vehicular Network). The simulation results show that the number of hops for DYMO is smaller than AODV and bigger than OLSR. Also, the good put of DYMO is better than OLSR, but smaller than AODV because DYMO is not equipped with a buffer for storing the packets. Delay for DYMO is a little bit higher than OLSR but it is smaller than AODV. But, different from AODV, the good put of DYMO is stable. For this reason, DYMO has better performance than OLSR and AODV protocols.	cellular automaton;goodput;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);simulation;software propagation	Evjola Spaho;Leonard Barolli;Gjergji Mino;Fatos Xhafa;Vladi Kolici	2011	2011 14th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems	10.1109/NBiS.2011.27	wireless ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	EDA	3.2245502557701102	85.26495780435256	135493

This algorithm keeps the characteristics of APRMAC, which is energy efficient, contention free and inherent routes establishment. The advantages of APRMAC and the novel scheduling algorithm are analysed. A simulation is carried out for both crossing chain and random topologies to validate the scheme and for comparison of performance with the original delay-oriented APRMAC and a well-known schedule-based MAC protocol, TRAMA. The results show that APRMAC offers higher energy efficiency against TRAMA. The results also show that the traffic-oriented scheduling algorithm can provide better throughput performance then the original delay-oriented one.	aerial photography;algorithm;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Jian Qiu;Paul Daniel Mitchell;David Grace	2010		10.1145/1815396.1815500	fair-share scheduling;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;distributed computing;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	7.3136442857468875	83.61363900162539	135627

The data copy spraying scheme is a challenging problem in MON, due to the mobility of nodes and lack of global knowledge, it hence captures great interests from research communities. Traditional algorithms allocate data copies with node's statistical information and neglect the temporal contact feature, resulting in a poor delivery performance. We propose AS, an adaptive data copy spraying scheme in MON. AS adjusts the number of copies dynamically based on the temporal contact feature among nodes. Theoretical analysis verifies that AS achieves a lower mean delivery delay than SprayWait, one of the state-of-the-art works. Simulation results show that AS improves the packet delivery ratio simultaneously.	algorithm;network packet;programming paradigm;simulation	Peiyan Yuan;Wei Wang;Chenyang Wang	2015		10.1145/2746285.2764862	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.091949469277713	84.05242789253343	135645

Such a set can serve as a virtual backbone to facilitate shortest path routing, as introduced in [40], [12] and [13]. When employed in a hierarchical fashion, together with a hybrid (partly proactive, partly reactive) strategy, the k-SPR set methods become highly scalable, resulting in guaranteed shortest path routing with comparatively little overhead. In this paper, we first discuss the notion of k-SPR sets, with the nodes of such a set functioning as routers for the network. These sets generalize our earlier k-SPR sets, which facilitated shortest path routing. We then introduce K-SPR sequences that are used for hierarchical routing. We propose a distributed greedy algorithm for construction of K-SPR sequences. The new sets facilitate minimal path routing, where “minimal path” here means “shortest weighted path based on edge weights”. Finally, we introduce an efficient hybrid hierarchical routing strategy that is based on K-SPR sequences. Our approach is unique in the sense that although dominating sets have been used to construct virtual backbones in ad hoc and sensor networks, this is the first attempt to use k-hop connected k-dominating sets for hierarchical routing that is also minimal path routing.	connectivity (graph theory);distributed algorithm;dominating set;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;overhead (computing);router (computing);routing;scalability;set cover problem;shortest path problem;tree rearrangement	Michael Q.

Transfer of gathered information from the sensing field to the base station must be done in proficiently to sustain the network longer. Clustering of sensor nodes is one way to achieve this goal. This paper introduces an Energy Efficient clustered routing protocol based on LEACH-C for WSN. In LEACH-C (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy-Centralized), the cluster heads are selected by the base station randomly. This paper introduces a novel cluster based routing protocol in which, the base station finds the highest energy node among the cluster and mark it as a cluster head for the current time. Thus in the proposed system the energy consumption of various nodes becomes more uniform as compared to LEACH-C. The simulation results indicate that our proposed method leads to efficient transmission of data packets with less energy and therefore increases the network longevity as compared to LEACH-C and LEACH.	centralized computing;computer cluster;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;network packet;randomness;routing;sensor;simulation	Meenakshi Tripathi;Ramesh Babu Battula;Manoj Singh Gaur;Vijay Laxmi	2013	2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks	10.1109/MSN.2013.67	data modeling;communications protocol;routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;base station;efficient energy use;routing protocol;cluster analysis;computer network;cluster	Mobile	8.265878647597766	80.45881051917108	135797

We present weighted Low-Energy Localized Clustering(w-LLC), which has better efficiency than LLC by assigning weight functions to each CH. Drew on the w-LLC scheme, weighted Localized Clustering for RFID networks(w-LCR) addresses a coverage-aware reader collision arbitration protocol as an application. w-LCR is a protocol that minimizes collisions by minimizing overlapping areas of clusters.	radio-frequency identification	Joongheon Kim;Wonjun Lee;Jaewon Jung;Jihoon Choi;Eunkyo Kim;Joonmo Kim	2005		10.1007/11599555_52	correlation clustering;telecommunications;computer science;cluster analysis;computer security	Mobile	-0.36283054842236584	75.68833296071419	135881

Cooperative transmission allows for extending the transmission range achievable by power-constrained devices thanks to the use of their neighbours being able to reach more distant destination nodes. Autonomicity in turn enables a networked system to behave like a living organism and self-manage without any explicit need for an external intervention. Each of these ideas is highly applicable to wireless sensor networks in terms of conserving energy and improving transmission capabilities to facilitate smooth and durable system operation.	autonomic computing	Michal Wódczak	2011	IJSNet	10.1504/IJSNET.2011.040906	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.38641215675845	78.38722248475393	135887

Our algorithm is an enabler of the real-time softwarized control of large-scale networks, and not only optical, we believe. The Dijkstra algorithm is a generalization of the depth-first search, and we generalize the Dijkstra algorithm further to resolve the continuity and contiguity constraints of the frequency slot units. Specifically, we generalize the notion of a label, change what we iterate with, and reformulate the edge relaxation so that vertices are revisited, loops avoided, and worse labels discarded. We also used the typical constriction during edge relaxation to take care of the signal modulation constraints. The algorithm can be used with various spectrum allocation policies. We motivate and discuss the algorithm design, and provide our libre, high-quality, and generic implementation using the Boost Graph Library. We carried out 85000 simulation runs for realistic and random networks (Gabriel graphs) of 75 vertices with about a billion shortest-path searches, and found that the proposed algorithm outperforms considerably other three competing optimal algorithms, which are frequently used in research.	algorithm design;analysis of algorithms;boost;care-of address;correctness (computer science);depth-first search;dijkstra's algorithm;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed algorithm;flow network;frequency allocation;heuristic;iteration;linear programming relaxation;memory footprint;modulation;parallel computing;real-time clock;scott continuity;shortest path problem;signal regeneration;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Ireneusz Szczesniak;Andrzej Jajszczyk;Bozena Wozna	2018	CoRR		contiguity;distributed computing;vertex (geometry);frequency allocation;modulation;algorithm design;computer science;shortest path problem;dijkstra's algorithm;multiplexing	ML	-4.286565244620703	82.3847349886367	135983

It is based on Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing which is a powerful routing protocol used in ad-hoc networks to deal with the fast changing logical topology. IPODV improves two modules of conventional AODV: neighbor table management and route maintenance mechanism. The improved neighbor table management is applied to select stable neighbors to participate in the route discovery. Meanwhile, the route maintenance mechanism is improved to reduce the routing maintenance overhead. It is shown by simulations and experiments that IPODV reduces the routing overhead and improves the stability of the routes compared to conventional AODV.	algorithm;control theory;distance-vector routing protocol;experiment;hoc (programming language);logical topology;overhead (computing);simulation	Wei Gao;Wenguang Jin;Hao Li	2011	2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089739	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;border gateway protocol;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.042449651869614	82.66075327134905	136042

Here, we address how to deal with such a deployment scenario. Our protocol ensures secure transmission of data from the source sensors to the base station in a way that it can best utilize the available amount of energy in the network. We use one-way hash chain and pre-stored shared secret keys for ensuring data transmission security. In SERP, first, a sink rooted tree structure is created as the backbone of the network. This energy-efficient network structure is used for authenticated and encrypted data delivery from the source sensors to the base station. To introduce data freshness, SERP includes an optional key refreshment mechanism which could be applied depending on the application at hand. Our analysis and simulation results show that SERP provides a good level of confidentiality and authenticity of data that are transmitted from the sensors to the base station. It also helps for energy-efficient structuring of the network so that the maximum lifetime of the network could be achieved.	routing;search engine results page	Al-Sakib Khan Pathan;Choong Seon Hong	2008	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/s12243-008-0042-5	energy;network architecture;wireless sensor network;confidentiality;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;wireless network;hash chain;efficient energy use;tree structure;routing protocol;distance;energy budget;computer security;information protection policy;sensor array;encryption;telecommunications network;detection theory;computer network;data transmission	Mobile	-0.2380244533408495	75.54606482681353	136058

The prime objective of the inter-connected objects is that within a minimum use of available resources, maximum output with respect to parameters such as throughput and delay can be achieved. But, due to high velocity and irrelevant information propagation, there may be a performance degradation in some part of the network with respect to these parameters. To address these issues, we have designed novel algorithms for context-aware information propagation among the vehicles. The proposed scheme consists of algorithms for data access, data dissemination, and data suggestion. These algorithms are based on reliability of vehicle which is calculated as soon as vehicles enter the network and is updated after each successful execution of various operations of information propagation. The scheme works on by increasing the reliability which in turn solve the broadcast storm problem in which sometime irrelevant information may also be sent to the vehicles. Simulation results prove the merit of the proposed scheme over the other existing schemes with respect to parameters such as message overhead, connectivity ratio, and resources utilization.	algorithm;broadcast radiation;data access;elegant degradation;entity;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);relevance;simulation;software propagation;throughput;time complexity;velocity (software development)	Neeraj Kumar;Rahat Iqbal;Anne E.

Within rugged terrains, the use of hopping sensors may be more suitable than wheeled mobile sensors. Since WSN communication is data-centric, globally unique ID allocation that is used for MANETs is usually not applicable for WSNs. A recent study classifies the locally unique ID allocation scheme for WSNs into two representative types: a proactive and a reactive scheme. In the reactive scheme, energy preservation is improved because ID conflict resolution is delayed until data communication is needed. Although a typical reactive ID assignment scheme is used, local uniqueness cannot be guaranteed if hopping sensors are relocated. In order to overcome the weakness, we propose the recycled ID assignment scheme for relocation of hopping sensors. Simulation results show that the proposed recycled ID assignment scheme outperforms the typical reactive scheme for relocation of hopping sensors.	assignment problem;computer recycling;emergence;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;overhead (computing);relocation (computing);rugged computer;scheme;sensor;simulation	Moonseong Kim;Matt W.

We construct a mobility model using the GPS data collected from more than 4000 taxis in Shanghai. The model is both realistic and large scale. Based on this model, network topology and connectivity of SUVnet are studied. Because of the sparse distribution and dynamic topology of SUVnet, simply utilizing the conventional mobile ad hoc network routing protocols in SUVnet may not achieve a satisfactory performance. Therefore, we apply the delay-tolerant network model to SUVnet and evaluate the epidemic routing protocols. We propose a new protocol, which is the distance aware epidemic routing (DAER), to improve the bundle delivery ratio. Results show that DAER performs well for a VANET. This paper provides a basis in studying a realistic urban VANET.	delay-tolerant networking;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);network model;network topology;performance evaluation;real-time transcription;routing;sparse matrix;weatherstar	Hongyu Huang;Pei'en Luo;Minglu Li;Da Li;Xu Li;Wei Shu;Min-You Wu	2007	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.907273	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;delay-tolerant networking;routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.4724072688683223	85.57782681976066	136143

It attempts to find parallel routing paths by taking advantage of the concept of skeleton in the continuous domain. However, MAP suffers seriously from overloading the sensor nodes that are close to the skeleton. In this paper, we propose a contour-based routing protocol, CAR, that does not require geographical information, produces short routing paths, and achieves outstanding load balancing. Our experimental results show that CAR outperforms MAP in terms of both load balancing and routing path length.	contour line;design of experiments;function overloading;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;load balancing (computing);map	Jie Cheng;Qiang Ye;Yanbo Xu;Hongbo Jiang;Hongwei Du	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364420	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;resource allocation;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Robotics	6.0523978059847785	81.502186402867	136178
89e2d4a1901cf281a1d0d8c39a74b299418f673e	a hybrid method of csma/ca and tdma for real-time data aggregation in wireless sensor networks	real time;data aggregation;wireless sensor networks	We study the real-time data aggregation in contention-based wireless sensor networks that use CSMA/CA MAC layer protocols as defined in IEEE 802.15.4 or IEEE 802.11 standard. The problem is, for a given data aggregation tree and a delay bound, to maximize the average transmission success probability of all sensor nodes within the delay bound. In CSMA/CA protocols, the success probability and the expected transmission delay are highly sensitive to node interference, while the node interference is often very high in the large scale sensor networks. We propose a hybrid method that combines the CSMA/CA protocol with TDMA scheduling of transmissions. We divide the child nodes of a parent into groups and schedule the groups into different ''time-frames'' for transmission. Within the group, the nodes still use the CSMA/CA protocol to compete for data transmission. By doing so, we divide a large collision domain (i.e., all child nodes competing to transmit to their parent) into several small collision domains (i.e., a group of nodes competing for transmission), and the success probability can thus be significantly improved. On the other hand, the ''time-frame'' used in our method is much larger than the timeslot used in pure TDMA protocols. It only requires loose synchronization of clocks, which is suitable for low-cost sensor networks. We transform our objective of maximizing the average success probability into minimizing the average node interference. We then convert our problem to the maximum weight k-cut problem, which is NP-hard. We propose two efficient heuristic algorithms to solve the problem. Simulation results have shown that our proposed method can improve the success probability significantly.	data aggregation;real-time clock;real-time data	Yanan Chang;Xiaohua Jia	2013	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2012.09.016	data aggregator;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Embedded	9.711425793902645	82.53283359238705	136412

The overlay network, built on-the-fly, is highly dynamic. It is getting worse in reality because single-tree based multicast structures are preferred, due to their efficient usage of network resources. In these single multicast tree based schemes, users' departure may cause serious service disruption for all the downstream users. A new tree construction algorithm is proposed to enhance reliability for application layer multicast. It exploits the property that the participating users' lifetime follow a Pareto distribution, which has the used better than new (UBTN) feature, and dynamically adjusts the multicast tree. The participating nodes are mapped into a hierarchy which is organized in such a way that it reflects the relative stability among the participating nodes. The proposed approach is light-weight and no a prior knowledge about users' lifetime is needed. A minimum of 50% reduction can be achieved in terms of service disruption frequency. Detailed mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented to validate the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;application lifecycle management;denial-of-service attack;downstream (software development);multicast;organizing (structure);overlay network;pareto efficiency;self-organization;simulation;terms of service	Bin Rong;Ibrahim Khalil;Zahir Tari	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.247	multicast;overlay network;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pareto distribution;theoretical computer science;pragmatic general multicast;resource;internet group management protocol;reliability;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;statistics;computer network;multicast address	Metrics	-1.4872108269919728	83.24255614509525	136422
b14eec7f9912857bcf7fd3205c4485815d6e8329	video transmission in mobile ad hoc networks using multiple interfaces and multiple channels		Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) are an important part of wireless communications and the increasing use of mobile devices is confirming that. MANETs can be of great value in Emergency Response situations where communication between mobile deployed units is critical and wired or wireless infrastructures may not be present or functional. In emergency scenarios, multimedia communication is very important for decision making and situation assessment. This requires up-to-date (on-line) information feed on the situation, including voice and video from the affected zone. However, MANETs do not seem to efficiently support multimedia applications, and this is quite evident in video transmission. One way to remedy this is to use more (wireless) interfaces per mobile node and consequently more communication channels. In this work, we perform an analytical study on the use of multiple interfaces and multiple channels (MIMC) in video transmission with respect to the requirements of Emergency Response Ad hoc Networks. More specifically, we examine and present the impact of using MIMC on MANETs during video transmission applications, we evaluate the performance of three basic routing protocols in MANETs, and we propose a channel selection mechanism in MANET nodes with MIMC for enhanced video transmission. In addition, we evaluate video transmission streams with rate adaptation and present comparative results. The proposed mechanism is evaluated using the ns-2 network simulator and the simulations are performed for a variety of topologies. Simulation results show that the different routing protocols respond differently when MIMC is introduced. The Ad hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector and (especially) the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector routing protocols benefit significantly, while the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector shows fewer improvements. The proposed mechanism is shown to be beneficial for transmitting video streams and enhances the network’s ability to accommodate more streams and reduce packet delay.

The ability of vehicles to communicate is a promising way to alleviate traffic accidents by reducing the response time associated with human reaction to nearby drivers. Vehicle mobility patterns caused by varying traffic dynamics and travel behavior lead to considerable complexity in the efficiency and reliability of vehicular communication networks. This causes two major routing issues: the broadcast storm problem and the network disconnection problem. In this article we review broadcast communication in vehicular communication networks and mechanisms to alleviate the broadcast storm problem. Moreover, we introduce vehicular safety applications, discuss network design considerations, and characterize broadcast protocols in vehicular networks.	broadcast domain;broadcast radiation;computer science;flow network;hoc (programming language);network planning and design;network security;operations research;peer-to-peer;requirement;response time (technology);routing;scalability;systems design;telecommunications network	Rex Chen;Wen-Long Jin;Amelia Regan	2010	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2010.5395779	communications protocol;routing;intelligent transportation system;network planning and design;computer science;vehicular communication systems;travel behavior;routing protocol;computer security;broadcasting;computer network	Mobile	4.117574660726346	87.53086104560005	136482

This work presents an alternative approach for conducting performance evaluation studies of DTN, following a recent movement of the scientific community with respect to the use of hybrid environments in order to achieve realism in the studies. We propose, implement and validate the Virtualized DTN Testbed (VDT) as a means to construct a virtualized testbed completely in software that takes into account a real instance of the operating system and applications that run inside the mobile nodes, as well as a robust model of the wireless channel. The results show that VDT can accurately reproduce both the mobility of nodes, and the contact opportunities obtained in experiments of a real testbed. Moreover, we identified some implementation problems in the real experiments, that after some fixing strategies allowed us to identify the occurrence of several contacts not registered previously.	computer terminal;delay-tolerant networking;experiment;hardware virtualization;operating system;performance evaluation;simulation;testbed	Daniel Bittencourt;Edjair de Souza Mota;Edson Nascimento Silva;Camilo Batista Souza	2013	2013 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2013.6686511	embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;computer network	Mobile	-0.10802358733168385	88.23150246373082	136574

1c1a58094aceaa4bf223a2de32e83d4ebc0189d1	a new algorithm of self organization in wireless sensor network	optics;wireless sensor network;self organization	Self organization is one of the most important characteristics in an Ad-hoc Sensor Network. Thousands of Sensors are deployed in a geographical area randomly without considering the location factor. After deployment, sensors are to self organize themselves to form a network of their own. How well the network is formed determines the life of the whole network as well as the quality of data transmission. Self organization based on clustering has proven to be very useful in this regard. Since hierarchical clustering reduces energy consumption by routing data from one node to another. In this paper, we discuss a new algorithm for self organization of sensors deployed in a geographical area. The algorithm forms clusters of sensors by ordering them using a unique triangulation method. This algorithm not only considers all sensors but also groups them so that their inherent clustering property is preserved.	algorithm;cluster analysis;geographic coordinate system;hierarchical clustering;hoc (programming language);randomness;routing;self-organization;sensor;software deployment;triangulation (geometry)	Hemanta Kumar Kalita;Avijit Kar	2010	Wireless Sensor Network	10.4236/wsn.2010.21006	embedded system;self-organization;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;data mining;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	8.702475142509535	78.79618538840869	136851

All these systems are based on the autonomous capability of the unmanned vehicles. The common factor of such systems is the use of an ad-hoc wireless network that enables the communication among the vehicles. However, guaranteeing an effective level of Quality-of-Service in the UAVs wireless network is hard to reach because of the unpredictable nature of such a system. Multiple solutions have emerged to address this problem, like enhanced communication protocols or mobility control systems that exploit the autonomous mobility of such vehicles. Nevertheless, none of those solutions have real affect on the end-to-end QoS performance. This paper aims to address the issue of guaranteeing the wireless network connectivity while providing Quality-of-Service at network layer, i.e., the proposed system will dynamically adapt its topology in order to increase the end-to-end network performance by using nature-inspired algorithm.

The multicast routing problem is also known as the Steiner tree problem which has been shown to be NP-complete. Previous research works just take delay, delay jitter, loss rate, bandwidth and cost into consideration and not view multicasting ability of router as a constrained factor. Limiting degree of switch or router can save information delivering/copying time and keep load balance. Delay-constrained is a crucial factor in QoS. This paper takes delay and also degree constraints into account and proposes a new multicast routing algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA) to construct degree-delay constrained least-cost multicast routing tree (DDCT). Algorithms adopt prufer coding and decoding which is very suitable for crossover and mutation operation and can save runtime, pruning and grafting techniques are employed to adjust node degree and repair tree structure. Two repairing tree structure methods are proposed and named as DDCTI and DDCT2. Simulations were conducted on a random graph to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental result shows proposed algorithms perform well than other similar multicasting algorithm such as CSPT and Wang/spl I.bar/GA.	code;computer simulation;genetic algorithm;load balancing (computing);multicast;np-completeness;packet delay variation;quality of service;random graph;requirement;router (computing);routing;software release life cycle;steiner tree problem;tree structure	Lin Chen;Zhiyun Yang;ZhengQuan Xu	2004	The Fourth International Conference onComputer and Information Technology, 2004.

In particular, we examine a proposed extension to the Essential Connected Dominating Set (ECDS) algorithm that has been specified for use by both present mobile ad hoc network unicast and multicast protocols. We demonstrate temporal stability improvements in the ECDS relay set membership that can be achieved with a simple modification to the election algorithm. Our results are particularly important when dealing with frequently changing election metrics represented in the priority field such as density or link quality as a weight metric. By using several mobile models of networks undergoing link quality fluctuations we demonstrate significant improvements in stability of the backbone set. Our results also indicate that we can maintain good stability results while maintaining a small relay set membership size as compared to the unmodified algorithm.	algorithm;connected dominating set;hoc (programming language);instability;internet backbone;multicast;relay;routing;unicast	Joseph P.

In this paper, an efficient data-gathering protocol (EDAP) is proposed to address this problem by using a Virtual Sink (VS) node nearby the sources, which plays the role of sink node and broadcasts local interest messages and routes gathered data toward destination. Also, multiple paths are constructed between VS and the sink node, which leads to load-balancing, and increase in the lifetime of the network. Simulation results show that in EDAP a significant amount of energy can be saved and the network lifetime will be increased considerably.	data aggregation;load balancing (computing);overhead (computing);simulation	Arash Nasiri Eghbali;Nastooh Taheri Javan;Mehdi Dehghan	2011	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2011.037850	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-1.2025513056500199	76.05643050960683	137329

Legacy mobile ad hoc network (MANET) protocols send packets along a predetermined path between a source and a destination. Node mobility, however, may create network partitions and a multi-hop link may not be present at the onset. Such node mobility may instead be leveraged to create an asynchronous path between a source and destination enabling opportunistic message exchange. In this work we propose an analytic model for this data exchange by defining a node's probability to forward packets to an encountered node. Drawing on results from mobility studies, we derive the statistics on the packet exchange and packet delivery performance for opportunistic networks. This model is validated for several simulation scenarios. The work provides a foundation for a one-to-one performance comparison of existing opportunistic forwarding protocols.	computation;dataflow;glossary of computer graphics;hoc (programming language);network packet;one-to-one (data model);onset (audio);routing;simulation;tree accumulation	Mary R.

In this model, the strategic agents are source nodes located on a network, who aim to send traffic to a unique destination node. The interaction between the agents is dynamic and complex -- asynchronous, sequential, and based on partial information. Best-reply dynamics in this model capture crucial aspects of the interdomain routing protocol de facto, namely the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  We study complexity and incentive-related issues in this model. Our main results are showing that in realistic and well-studied settings, BGP is incentive-compatible. I.e., not only does myopic behaviour of all players converge to a """"stable"""" routing outcome, but no player has motivation to unilaterally deviate from the protocol. Moreover, we show that even coalitions of players of any size cannot improve their routing outcomes by collaborating.

We introduce a new dual radio communication model, where a long-range, low cost, and low rate radio is integrated into smartphones to assist regular radio interfaces such as WiFi and Bluetooth. We propose to use the long-range radio to carry out small management data packets to improve the routing protocols. Specifically, we develop new schemes to improve the efficiency of the path establishment and path recovery process in the on-demand Ad-Hoc routing protocols.

This results in the need to coordinate applications not only at the functional level, as is traditionally done, but also in terms of resource utilization. In this paper, we present a middleware that does this using adaptive service provisioning. Novel service binding strategies automatically adapt application behavior when opportunities for energy savings surface, and switch providers when the network topology changes. The former is accomplished by providing limited information about the energy consumption associated with using various services, systematically exploiting opportunities for sharing service invocations, and exploiting the broadcast nature of wireless communication in WSNs. The middleware has been implemented and evaluated on two disparate WSN platforms, the TelosB and Imote2. Empirical results show that adaptive service provisioning can enable energy-aware service binding decisions that result in increased energy efficiency and significantly increase service availability, while imposing minimal additional burden on the application, service, and device developers. Two applications, medical patient monitoring and structural health monitoring, demonstrate the middleware’s efficacy.	middleware;network topology;programming paradigm;provisioning	Chien-Liang Fok;Gruia-Catalin Roman;Chenyang Lu	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13414-2_8	in situ resource utilization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;middleware;remote patient monitoring;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;network topology;wireless;computer network	Mobile	7.097228602849304	75.42794267431704	138076

Making effective use of sensornet data will require scalable, self-organizing, and energy-efficient data dissemination algorithms. Recent work has identified data-centric routing as one such method. In this paper we suggest that a companion method, data-centric storage, may also be a useful approach. While there are many ways to achieve data-centric storage, this paper proposes a mechanism that builds upon two recent advances; (1) the GPSR geographic routing algorithm and (2) a new generation of efficient peer-to-peer lookup systems (such as Chord, CAN, Pastry, Tapestry, etc.). We evaluate the performance of data-centric storage and two other dissemination approaches in several sensornet scenarios and identify the conditions under which the various approaches are preferable.	algorithm;central processing unit;computer data storage;geographic routing;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;lookup table;organizing (structure);peer-to-peer;scalability;self-organization	Scott Shenker;Sylvia Ratnasamy;Brad Karp;Ramesh Govindan;Deborah Estrin	2002	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/774763.774785	internet protocol;real-time computing;self-organization;database-centric architecture;computer science;distributed computing;distributed control system;efficient energy use;computer security;geographic routing;packet switching;dissemination;circuit switching;wireless;computer network	Networks	6.444189942907974	76.84375719466263	138089

The main idea of transit nodes is to precompute paths for selected routes and use these as shortcuts during the search. While this method can be employed for road networks that remain static over a period of time, it can not be directly applied to complex fast changing networks such as those used for telecommunication since precomputed shortcuts can become invalid at any time. In this paper, an approach is presented that is based on transit nodes but extends the concept to accommodate for the special requirements of fast changing networks.	application domain;heuristic (computer science);on the fly;pathfinding;precomputation;requirement;telecommunications network	Robert Mertens;Timo Steffens;Joerg Stachowiak	2008			telecommunications	Robotics	-0.8101329291431928	80.75200264157593	138161

401cb65697125ec991e3d56b8c24406d4a001eda	a comprehensive survey on multichannel routing in wireless sensor networks		Multi-channel based routing approach may utilize more than one channel for communication and has the ability to provide high performance by more rigorously countering interference, collisions and re-transmissions than the single-channel routing methodology. This research work aims to establish guidelines for future research and development in the area of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) based on the critical analysis of the prevalent multi-channel based routing protocols for WSNs. Due to extensive ongoing research in this domain, a significant number of multi-channel routing strategies have been presented which need to be discussed. To explore, this work not only reviews a variety of single/multi-path and single/multi-radio multichannel routing protocols for WSNs under a novel taxonomy, but also outlines their relevant pros and cons. In order to help design new multi-channel routing strategies for WSNs, an insightful review on the applications, current design issues and associated challenges of multichannel routing in WSNs are in-depth scrutinized. Towards the end, some prospect trends are put forth regarding multi-channel routing for WSNs which may provide a road map for future investigation.	routing	Waqas Rehan;Stefan Fischer;Maaz Rehan;Mubashir Husain Rehmani	2017	J.

Preemptive DSR(PDSR) is the modified version of DSR. The main objective of this paper is to analyze and compare the performance of Preemptive DSR and Temporarily Ordered Routing Algorithm(TORA).It discusses the effect of variation in number of nodes and average speed on protocol performance. Simulation results (provided by the instructor) are analyzed to get an insight into the operation of TORA and PDSR in small/large sized networks with slow/fast moving nodes. Results show that PDSR outperforms TORA in terms of the number of MANET control packets used to maintain/erase routes. Also, it is concluded that TORA is a better choice than PDSR for fast moving highly connected set of nodes. It is also observed that DSR provides better data throughput than TORA and that routes can be created faster in PDSR than in TORA. This paper tries to explain the reasons behind the nature of the results.	ansi escape code;algorithm;cache (computing);control flow;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);simulation;source routing;throughput	V.

Three different information delivery mechanisms are investigated using regenerative relays with or without error correction capability. Energy consumption for successful delivery of a data packet for each mechanism is evaluated and compared under several conditions of node density, bit rate, transmit power, and channel fading. Energy efficiencies of different retransmission schemes are also evaluated. Further, an optimal packet length based on energy efficiency is derived. Impact of optimal packet size on average number of retransmission and total energy expenditure is analyzed for each delivery scheme.

In this paper, we present Reliability Enhanced-Adaptive Threshold based Thermal-unaware Energy-efficient Multi-hop ProTocol (RE-ATTEMPT) for WBASNs. The proposed routing protocol uses fixed deployment of wireless sensors (nodes) such that these are placed according to energy levels. Moreover, we use direct communication for the delivery of emergency data and multihop communication for the delivery of normal data. RE-ATTEMPT selects route with minimum hop count to deliver data which downplays the delay factor. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis supported by MATLAB simulations to provide an estimation of path loss, and problem formulation with its solution via linear programming model for network lifetime maximization is also provided. In simulations, we analyze our protocol in terms of network lifetime, packet drops, and throughput. Results show better performance for the proposed protocol as compared to the existing one.	routing	Ashfaq Ahmad;Nadeem Javaid;Umar Qasim;M.

Many routing protocols for such networks have been proposed so far. Amongst the most popular ones are dynamic source routing (DSR), ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV), temporally-ordered routing algorithm (TORA) and location-aided routing (LAR). Despite the popularity of those protocols, research efforts have not focused in evaluating their performance when applied to large-scale wireless networks. Such networks are comprised of hundreds of nodes, connected via long routes. This greatly affects the network efficiency, since it necessitates frequent exchange of routing information. In this paper we present our observations regarding the behavior of the above protocols, in large-scale mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). We consider wireless mobile terminals spread over a large geographical area, and we perform extensive simulations, using the QualNet and NS-2 simulators. The results of the simulations yield some interesting conclusions: AODV suffers in terms of packet delivery fraction (PDF) but scales very well in terms of end-to-end delay. DSR on the other hand scales well in terms of packet delivery fraction but suffers an important increase of end-to-end delay, as compared to its performance achieved in small-scale topologies. Also, the effect of maximum connections is severe on TORA, which seems unable to route large amounts of traffic.

These algorithms and protocols rely on probabilistic message replication and redundancy to ensure reliable communication. Moreover, they have been successfully exploited to support group communication in distributed systems, broadcasting, multicasting and information dissemination in fixed and mobile networks. However, in most of the existing work, the probability of infection is determined heuristically, without relying on any analytical model. This often leads to unnecessarily high transmission overheads. In this paper we show that models of epidemic spreading in complex networks can be applied to the problem of tuning and controlling the dissemination of information in wireless ad hoc networks composed of devices carried by individuals, i.e., human-based networks. The novelty of our idea resides in the evaluation and exploitation of the structure of the underlying human network for the automatic tuning of the dissemination process in order to improve the protocol performance. We evaluate the results using synthetic mobility models and real human contacts traces.	algorithm;complex network;distributed computing;heuristic;hoc (programming language);multicast;redundancy (engineering);social network;synthetic intelligence;tracing (software)	Salvatore Scellato;Cecilia Mascolo;Mirco Musolesi;Vito Latora	2007	CoRR			Mobile	0.1148544397654118	81.45453866040259	139154

We present a real-time disaster recovery backup model based on peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming with considering the reliability and security. The key metrics, which are recovery time objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), and predicted channel delay of the P2P disaster recovery backup model, were analysed. Then the backup methods were described based on a P2P network, which consists of a node-joining mechanism, data sending and receiving mechanism, etc. To ensure transport channel redundancy, we designed a node conflict resolution algorithm. We also optimised the algorithm in terms of node distance, historical information, useless nodes traffic, etc. Finally, simulation experiments were conducted.

A framework of power control with QoS constraints in CDMA wireless ad hoc networks is introduced and the feasibility condition of the power control problem is identified. Both centralized solution and distributed implementations are derived to calculate the transmission power given required throughput and the set of transmitting nodes. Then a joint power control and maximally disjoint routing scheme is proposed for routing data traffic with minimum rate constraint while maintaining high energy efficiency and prolonged network lifetime. Furthermore, in order to provide reliable end-to-end data delivery, the proposed joint power control and maximally disjoint routing scheme is augmented by a dynamic traffic switching mechanism to mitigate the effect of node mobility or node failure.

Despite their use in interesting applications, such as healthcare and surveillance, many shortcomings derived from their small size and constrained batteries limit their use, calling for solutions to enhance the WSNs. Born in wireless networks using the transport control protocol (TCP), cross-layer proposals have been proving that there is interdependency of parameters across the layers and that collaboration among the layers of the protocol stack can improve the performance of wireless networks in terms of quality of service, throughput, and transmission fairness. Thus, cross-layer design is merging into WSNs, especially to reduce sensors energy consumption. In this work, a cross-layer sleep and rate adaptation mechanism is proposed to operate on a slotted ALOHA WSN. Through the use of sensors sleep periods, energy consumption is reduced, and throughput reduction is mitigated by the use of the rate adaptation.	approximation algorithm;clock rate;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;interdependence;protocol stack;quality of service;sensor;simulation;throughput	Lucas D.

The controlled replication based routing approach include the basic Spray and Wait algorithm that tries to forward the messages by replicating them in a fixed number and then forwarding them to the relay nodes. In this paper, an empirical analysis was performed to compare and evaluate the basic Spray and Wait algorithms with some major improvements. The ONE simulator is used to provide a simulation environment to run these algorithms and generate the results. The simulation results show that in terms of delivery ratio and average delay `Composite Methods to improve Spray and Wait' outperforms all the other variants compared.	algorithm;delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);relay;routing;simulation;utility	Nikhitha Kishore;Sweta Jain;Vasco Nuno da Gama de Jesus Soares	2013	2013 Tenth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN)	10.1109/WOCN.2013.6616231	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	EDA	3.9622536866956692	84.29532709069268	139554

To reduce outage in such fading-rich areas, cooperative relays can be used to overhear source-destination transmissions and forward data packets that a source fails to deliver. This paper presents the results of an experimental study of selective cooperative relaying protocols that are implemented in off-the-shelf IEEE 802.15.4-compatible devices and evaluated in an industrial production plant. Three practical relay update schemes, which define when a new relay selection is triggered, are investigated: 1) periodic; 2) adaptive; and 3) reactive relay selections. The results show that all relaying protocols outperform conventional time diversity retransmissions in delivery ratio and number of retransmissions for packet delivery. Reactive selection provides the best overall delivery ratio of nearly 99% over the tested network. There is a tradeoff, however, between achievable delivery ratio and required selection overhead. This tradeoff depends on protocol and network parameters, and is studied via protocol emulation using empirical channel values.	cooperative mimo;emulator;experiment;interference (communication);marginal model;multi-user mimo;network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;relay;requirement;routing;scheduling (computing);sun outage	Nikolaj Marchenko;Torsten Andre;Günther Brandner;Wasif Masood;Christian Bettstetter	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2014.2327915	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;cooperative diversity;computer network	Mobile	7.928425267424112	86.50686190948174	139586

Due to the continuous collection, processing, and dissemination of data, one crucial requirement is the efficient use of the available bandwidth. Firstly, the rate of message transmissions must be properly controlled in order to limit the amount of data inserted into the network. Secondly, messages must be carefully selected to maximize the utility (benefit) gain of vehicles in the neighborhood. We argue that such selection must aim at a fair distribution of data utility, given the possible conflicting data interests among vehicles. In this work, we propose a data dissemination protocol for VANETs that distributes data utility fairly over vehicles while adaptively controlling the network load. The protocol relies only on local knowledge to achieve fairness with concepts of Nash Bargaining from game theory. Simulation results show that our algorithm presents a higher fairness index and yet it maintains a high level of bandwidth utilization efficiency compared to other approaches. In addition, the rate of transmissions is adaptively controlled as new information about the environment is collected.	algorithm;fairness measure;game theory;high-level programming language;hoc (programming language);information system;nash equilibrium;simulation;throughput	Ramon S.

While most of this interest is focused on unicast communications, there has recently been an growing focus to suppori multicast communications with mobile sources and, in particular, Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) sources. To address this issue, the Mobile IPv6 specifications currently being developed by the IETF briefly introduce one possible solution known as bi-directional tunneling. In parallel, a set of mechanisms called MSSMSv6 which supports an optimized multicast routing has also been proposed. However to date, there has been no attempt to evaluate the performance of these proposals. This paper therefore aims to compare the efficiency of the IETF solution with the MSSMSv6 scheme in the particular case of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) mobile sources. A large set of simulations has been produced to evaluate and compare the performance of these two proposals. It clearly shows that the IETF solution introduces sub-optimal routing, in contrast to the MSSMSv6 proposal which builds dynamic shortest-path multicast trees that follow the position of the mobile sources.	mobile ip;performance evaluation;routing;shortest path problem;simulation;source-specific multicast;tunneling protocol;unicast	Christophe Jelger;Thomas Noël	2003		10.1109/ICON.2003.1266276	wireless routing protocol;communications protocol;routing;multicast;inter-domain;mobile telephony;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;quantum tunnelling;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;wireless;computer network;unicast	Mobile	-1.019096089243374	87.09745566638989	140016
fd5c379314e789f76f847a44ca26a567035b95d5	an efficient grid-based data gathering scheme in wireless sensor networks	data transmission;data gathering;wireless sensor network;base station;sensor nodes;delay time	Data gathering is an important operation in wireless sensor networks. Due to the limited battery power, sensor nodes consume significant energy and drain out of it quickly if each node transmits its sensed data directly to a distant base station, even though the delay time is minimized in a round of communication. Hence, there is a trade-off between minimizing both of the energy consumed by sensor nodes and the delay time, then the overall cost is defined as the energy × delay cost. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Grid-based Data Gathering (EGDG) scheme which adopts a hierarchical grid structure and constructs cycles by connecting heads in each order of the hierarchy. Data transmissions move toward a leader from two starter nodes simultaneously in each cycle. The objective of EGDG is to achieve a better result for the energy × delay cost comparing to other schemes, and also to accomplish significant coverage-preserving at the same time. Simulation results show that EGDG outperforms than LEACH and PEGASIS in terms of rounds, the energy × delay cost and coverage-preserving.

The sensors closer to the sink node usually required forwarding a large amount of traffic for sensors farther from the sink node. Hotspot problem causes the nodes near the hotspot sensor node consuming much more energy than the other nodes, which seriously shortens the lifetime of the sensor networks. In the paper, it is proposed a dual mobile sink nodes protocol (DMSP) which combines the balance traffic strategy in the WSNs to extend the lifetime of the sensor networks. The simulation results show that the proposed DMSP can efficiently prolong the lifetime of the WSNs.	java hotspot virtual machine;sensor node;simulation	Mei-Wen Huang;Hsu-Jung Liu;Min-Rui Lin;Wen-Shyong Hsieh	2012	JNW	10.4304/jnw.7.9.1415-1422	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	8.653383431566409	79.51451712360496	140088

However, to facil itate packet forwarding in a hierarchically organized network, each datagram must specify the hierarchical address of the destination. Maintaining and acquiring hierarchical addresses represents a location management (LM) problem and incurs control overhead in addition to that of a routing protocol. This paper considers the LM overhead due to handoff. That is, the transfer of LM data due to node mobility and volatility of the clustered hierarchy. It is shown that handoff overhead is only polylogarithmic in the node count.	datagram;hoc (programming language);network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);polylogarithmic function;routing;session (computer science);tree network;volatility	John Sucec;Ivan Marsic	2002		10.1109/IPDPS.2002.1016597	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	1.8223748282814345	82.16689717809174	140103

In this paper, we propose to solve this problem from three aspects, (i) defining accident models for intersections and straight roads where pedestrian accidents frequently occur, (ii) estimating the degree of risk by exploiting pedestrian context information, and (iii) differentiating pedestrian transmissions with different transmission intervals and channel access priorities so that messages from pedestrians in high risk can be quickly and reliably sent to potentially colliding vehicles. The proposed scheme is implemented via network simulator and extensively evaluated. Experimental results confirm that in dense scenarios with a large number of pedestrians, the proposed scheme can greatly improve packet delivery rate of pedestrians in high risk compared with the conventional schemes.	effective method;network packet;ray tracing (graphics);simulation;software propagation	Suhua Tang;Kiyoshi Saito;Sadao Obana	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety (ICVES)	10.1109/ICVES.2015.7396891	simulation;engineering;transport engineering;computer security	Robotics	5.4632236124487745	88.0413004225756	140491

In these new scenarios, performance must be monitored and effectively measured, in order to guarantee that the network fulfills initial expectations. However, measuring performance in WSN has not the same requirements as measuring performance in traditional networks. While new specific WSN metrics have been proposed to cope with the new specific needs of these networks, a global performance framework for evaluating WSN does not yet exist. In this paper, WSN specific communication performance needs are analyzed and, to measure them, an initial approach to a global framework of WSN performance metrics is proposed. These metrics are intended to evaluate the real-time performance of a WSN, providing the necessary measurements to indicate if the QoS expectations are being met.	quality of service;real-time clock;requirement	Vasco Pereira;Jorge Sá Silva;Edmundo Monteiro	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263784	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;quality of service;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;taxonomy;computer network	Embedded	8.021800344852194	75.58617219418733	140598

First, we present the linear program for routing optimization. The nonblocking network is considered, which only limits the traffic loads of the network nodes. Guaranteed node traffic loads pass through the network regardless of the actual traffic destinations. The derived optimization includes node priority weights that allow the network planner to assign higher or lower traffic values to the network nodes. Then we analyze the performance of the proposed strategy for some realistic network topologies, and show that the proposed scheme achieves higher guaranteed node traffic loads than the regular shortest-path routing.	coefficient;linear programming;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;network packet;network topology;optimization problem;routing	Marija Antic;Aleksandra Smiljanic	2009	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2009.081874	traffic generation model;policy-based routing;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;network traffic control;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;computer science;linear programming;dynamic source routing;load balancing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;network topology;computer network	Networks	-4.068513748683554	77.36468183805123	140713

In this application, the role of the sensor network usually consists in obtaining a representation or a model for a physical phenomenon spreading through the area. In this work we focus on forest fire fighting operations, proposing a distributed way for approximating the shape of the fire. In the simplest scenario, assuming the existence of an efficient dissemination layer, each network node obtains a representation of the forest fire starting from the complete list of positions reached by the fire so far. However, this approach makes an intensive use of node and network resources. In order to reduce these requirements, we propose incorporating in-network aggregation techniques. In particular, in this paper we analyze the employ of a shape composed of several convex hulls to represent the forest fire in a more compact way.

Detecting bursts in data streams of UW-ASNs is an important area of research with a wide range of applications. In this paper, we build semi-autonomous underwater acoustic sensor networks based on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology for sharing various UW-ASNs' information. In addition, we propose a novel approach for solving the problem of elastic burst detection in UW-ASNs based on evolutionary game theory. Extensive experiments have been carried out to assess the performance of the proposed method. The obtained results show that our burst detection method performs better than existing method with different data distributions.	acoustic cryptanalysis;autonomous robot;central processing unit;collision detection;evolutionary governance theory;experiment;game theory;peer-to-peer;rationality;semiconductor industry;sensor	Ming Xu;Guangzhong Liu	2011	2011 11th International Symposium on Communications & Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2011.6089740	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing	Embedded	5.29061611631867	76.01557952398672	141020

Based on the establishment of cluster structure, initial cluster head is selected following the ‘Randomly Competition, First Declare Win’ principle. Cluster members transmit their expected status messages through the maintained multiple hop routings. After a series of information fusion and calculation work, the cluster head broadcasts the management messages based on dynamic timestamps. This article also gives the cluster maintaining strategy when the cluster head disappears or new nodes join. Tests performed in the simulation by NS-2 show that the proposed algorithm has less cluster heads and lower control overhead compared to the single hop-based approach (the Lowest-ID algorithm).	algorithm;artificial intelligence;cns disorder;cluster analysis;control theory;drug vehicle;email;global positioning system;head - component of device;hereditary angioedema type iii;hoc (programming language);information engineering;intelligent control;name;numerous;overhead (computing);ph (complexity);randomness;routing;simulation;vii;yang;computer network;interest;message;statistical cluster	Haiqing Liu;Licai Yang;Yao Zhang;Lei Wu	2014	iJOE		vehicular ad hoc network;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;cluster analysis;computer security	ML	7.784228506625191	80.68059072574428	141212

Routers involved in multicast record a routing path based on periodic probes from sources, and receivers isolate a fault region using the probes. We introduce a probe suppression mechanism to enhance the performance. The proposed scheme reduces message complexity and enhances fault isolation latency, which improves scalability. Furthermore, an analytical formula is proposed to estimate suppression time, which provides maximum performance for a given network status.	fault detection and isolation;multi-source;multicast;one-way function;router (computing);routing;scalability;symposium on operating systems principles;zero suppression	Heonkyu Park;Dongman Lee;Kyungran Kang;Kilnam Chon	2004	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2004.835321	communications protocol;real-time computing;multicast;scalability;protocol independent multicast;computer science;communication complexity;distributed computing;routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;fault detection and isolation;xcast;computer network	Networks	-4.359901337804772	74.5491066407736	141217

In this paper, we propose a new region-based location service management protocol (RLSMP) that uses mobility patterns as means to synthesize vehicle movement and thus can be used in VANETs applications. One of the key distinguishing features of our solution from existing literature is its scalability since it uses message aggregation in both updating and querying, and promises locality awareness as well as minimum signaling overhead. To evaluate the efficiency of our proposal, we compare our scheme with existing solutions using both analytical and simulation approaches. To achieve this, we develop analytical models to evaluate the location updates cost. Numerical and simulation results show that our protocol scales better than existing schemes, when increasing the size of VANET which enhances the feasibility of such large scale ad hoc networks.	cluster analysis;hoc (programming language);local search (optimization);locality of reference;location-based service;overhead (computing);scalability;simulation	Hanan Saleet;Rami Langar;Otman A.

Analysis shows that the degradation is higher for the station with a high data rate that operates with good signal to noise ratio (SNR). Consequently, the station with low SNR has higher throughput then stations with high SNR To evaluate the anomaly an experimental test was created to obtain the WLAN behavior with wireless host transmitting with low SNR together with hosts with high SNR. The anomaly was evaluated experimentally utilizing two architectures: fat and thin. The anomaly was detected in the fat architecture and was not detected in the Thin architecture. This paper presents a strategy to justify the result obtained with Thin architecture, using SNR to control the contention window and consequently mitigate the anomaly. Simulations using network simulator (NS) are presented to demonstrate the anomaly and to evaluate the mitigation anomaly strategy. The strategy configures the wireless stations with low SNR to work with large contention windows and wireless stations with high SNR with small contention windows. With this strategy the station with high SNR obtains higher throughput than the station with low SNR.	anomaly detection;backoff;computer simulation;design of the fat file system;elegant degradation;experiment;file allocation table;microsoft windows;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;transmitter;uncompressed video;wireless access point	Omar Carvalho Branquinho;Norma Reggiani;D.

These constraints preclude the use of traditional ad hoc protocols, and demand optimizations that incur in solutions specific to a class of applications. This article presents PROC, a protocol designed for continuous data dissemination networks, that interacts with the application to establish routes, allowing the application to reconfigure PROC on runtime. A performance evaluation in topologies varying from 50 to 200 nodes showed that PROC increases network lifetime around 7% to 12%, and has higher throughput than EAD and TinyOS Beaconing. Furthermore, PROC presents a softer performance degradation when the number of nodes in the network increases.	ead socket;elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;performance evaluation;routing;throughput;tinyos	Daniel F.

In order to do so, we resort to real deployments involving TelosB motes. The simulator, named Castalia, boasts the most accurate wireless channel and radio models for WSN found in current literature. These models are capturing some essential experimental findings. This does not guaranty though that the simulator will behave similarly with a real deployment at the high level (i.e., the protocol or application level). We investigate how our multi-parameter MAC protocol behaves in a real deployment so as to take a first step towards validating and possibly tuning Castalia. The investigation starts by determining the connectivity map for the real deployment and then trying to reproduce it in the simulator. We then proceed with the protocol testing and comparing. We report the difficulties faced and our findings from this process.	communications protocol;high- and low-level;high-level programming language;simulation;software deployment	Hai N.

Nevertheless, it needs more overhead to rebuild a new path when occurring link failure in the MPLS network. In this paper, we propose an efficient fast path recovery mechanism, which employs the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to establish the working and backup paths concurrently and modify the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) to establish the LSP by using Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism not only improves resource utilization but provides shorter path recovery time than the end-to-end recovery mechanism.	backup;diffusing update algorithm;end-to-end encryption;fast path;label distribution protocol;lookup table;multiprotocol label switching;network packet;network switch;overhead (computing);routing table;simulation	Jenhui Chen;Chung-Ching Chiou;Shih-Lin Wu	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-31957-3_8	multiprotocol label switching;label distribution protocol;label information base;telecommunications;computer science;routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;computer network	Networks	-4.300152167595704	76.36940517904566	141574

While WSN applications are normally optimized by the given underlying network topology, another trend is to optimize WSN by means of topology control. A number of approaches have been invested in this area, such as topology directed routing, cooperating schemes, sensor coverage based topology control and network connectivity based topology control. Most of the schemes have proven to be able to provide a better network monitoring and communication performance with prolonged system lifetime. In this survey paper, we provide a full view of the studies in this area.

Many sensors are deployed in a region of concern to detect any potential targets. On the contrary, intelligent target looks for the best path to traverse the sensing field for fear of being detected and leads to defunct surveillance. In this paper, we focus on how an intelligent target traverses the sensing field. We model this traversing problem, design, implement and evaluate a number of path-finding algorithms. Different from previous works which assume complete information of the sensing field, we assume that the target only can detect part of the sensor network in its detection radius. This makes the proposed methods more practical. Extensive experiments with a target and a sensor network confirm the validity of the approach.	algorithm;experiment;menace;sensor;software deployment;traverse	Wenzhe Zhang;Minglu Li;Wei Shu;Min-You Wu	2006		10.1007/11943952_11	wireless ad hoc network;routing;systems modeling;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;pathfinding;wireless network;shortest path problem;mobile computing;computer security;sensor array;computer network	Robotics	-0.3974244111461056	75.54829768844604	141660
12efac2344a3cf61983cb0cfcf8a7fa8026b678e	performance modeling and analysis of void-handling methodologies in underwater wireless sensor networks	communication void region problem;underwater sensor networks;greedy upward routing	Abstract In this paper, we devise an analytical framework for the performance evaluation of communication void-handling algorithms designed for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Geographic and opportunistic routing (GOR) have been shown efficient for multi-hop data delivery in UWSNs. However, geo-routing suffers from a serious drawback known as communication void region. The communication void region problem occurs when a source node does not have a neighbor node in closer proximity to the destination that can continue forwarding the packet. Whenever a data packet reaches a node in a void region, the data packet should be re-routed from a void-handling procedure or discarded. In this paper, we model the three main methodologies that have been used for the design of void-handling algorithms for geographic and opportunistic routing protocols in UWSNs. Our proposed analytical framework considers the characteristics of underwater sensor networks, network density and traffic load, underwater environment and acoustic channel, as well as the characteristics of the power control, bypassing void region and mobility assisted void-handling paradigms. The devised analytical framework is aimed to fill the gap in the literature of analytical tools that allow the performance evaluation of the trade-offs of each paradigm along different scenarios of UWSNs. The proposed model provides insights for the further design of void-handling algorithms in different underwater application and sensor network configurations. Numerical results show that the widely used bypassing void region approach is not effectively for moderate- and high-density UWSN scenarios. Conversely, topology control-based approaches (power control and mobility-assisted) are preferable as they create additional links. However, the use of void-handling procedures increased the network energy consumption, which made each paradigm unsuitable for specific scenarios revealed by the proposed modeling.		Rodolfo W. L.

Hosts with a maximal number of neighbors are often chosen as backbone hosts (BHs) to forward packets. Most likely, these BHs will be traffic concentrations/ bottlenecks of the network. In addition, since host mobility is not taken into consideration in selecting BHs, these two-tier schemes will suffer from more lost packets if highly mobile hosts are selected as BHs. In this paper, a new multicast protocol is proposed for multicast services in a large-scale MANET. In the proposed protocol, hosts with fewer hops and longer remaining connection time to the other hosts will be selected as BHs. The objective is not only to obtain short multicast routes, but also to construct a stable two-tier infrastructure with fewer lost packets.	hoc (programming language);multicast	Chia-Cheng Hu;Eric Hsiao-Kuang Wu;Gen-Huey Chen;Chiang Jui-Hao	2005		10.1007/11534310_41	telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;mobile computing;computer security;xcast;computer network;multicast address	HPC	-2.2885163452920754	76.44484966131235	141923

This is aim of VANET routing protocols. The simulation scene was set up by means of the NS2 simulation platform in this paper. The performances of ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and dynamic source routing (DSR), two classical routing protocols of MANET and VANET, are simulated and analyzed, and the conclusion that the AODV protocol is more suitable for VANET than the DSR protocol is derived.	hoc (programming language);routing	Jiancai Liu;Feng Chen;Jiakai Xu	2010		10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633461	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer network	HCI	2.8623765263496934	85.64243410551646	141938

Little assumption is made during the development process in order to minimize the gap between a laboratory testbed and a fully-operational system. Some notable features of ACT include: 1) it makes use of distributed TDMA scheme to provide “circuitswitched” type of Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantee for audio traffic; 2) its broadcast tree building algorithm is able to minimize the latency of message dissemination to the whole network; 3) the protocol running in ACT is able to predict radio link break due to mobility so that service interruption is reduced; 4) and relative position information is available at each node in the network.

Queries are divided into two categories: queries that need data from all the nodes in the network and queries that need data from a subset of nodes only.#R##N#For the first type of queries we propose a distributed algorithm to construct a near-optimal balanced communication tree with minimum overhead. Such a tree has inherently minimal number of collisions during query execution, and therefore avoids numerous retransmissions. Our algorithm outperforms previous work both in tree construction overhead and in tree balance.#R##N#For the second type of queries we present methods for constructing query trees to route and perform in-network processing of data. First, we focus on snapshot queries and show that minimizing the problem is NP-hard. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal solution for small problem instances. We also propose a low complexity, approximate, heuristic algorithm for solving larger problem instances efficiently. Finally, we adapt the Fermat point problem (1-median problem) for a weighted graph, and propose a centralized solution that is used as heuristic in the above algorithms. #R##N#Dealing with continuous queries of the second category, we present an optimal distributed algorithm to adapt the placement of a single operator. Our parameter-free algorithm finds the optimal node to host the operator with minimum communication cost overhead. Three ideas, proposed here, make this feature possible: (1) identifying the special, and most frequent case, where no flooding is needed, otherwise (2) limitation of the neighborhood to be flooded and (3) variable speed flooding and eves-dropping. To our knowledge this is the first optimal and distributed algorithm to solve the 1-median (Fermat node) problem. In our experiments we show that for the rest of cases our algorithm saves 30%-80% of the energy compared to previously proposed techniques.

62408b4c4f33ddffab4b43e6984915ad87bcd80a	a mobile agent based autonomous partial green corridor discovery and maintenance mechanism for emergency services amidst urban traffic	design;emulation;experimentation;swi-prolog;internet of things;urban traffic;distributed applications;traffic management;autonomous movement;multiagent systems;mobile agents	Traffic management in urban areas is a challenging task. Provisioning of traffic moving on the roads becomes crucial especially when emergency services such as an ambulance or fire-fighting team need to make their way to the hospital or to the point where the problem is. With the advent of networking technologies, the traffic signals can now be equipped with sensing and communicating equipment facilitating the diversion of such vehicles along shorter and less crowded paths towards their respective destinations. This paper exploits the concept of an Internet of Things comprising the various traffic signaling equipments, and proposes a distributed mobile agent based mechanism to autonomously discover, create and manage a partial green corridor just ahead of the emergency vehicle along the least crowded path to its destination. The proposed mechanism assumes a network of equipment used for traffic signaling as its base and makes use of intelligent mobile software agents to facilitate the smooth movement of an emergency service vehicle. We have implemented the proposed mechanism by emulating the network of traffic signals and mobile agents using a mobile agent platform. The movement of the ambulance and the traffic flowing on the roads has been at the moment simulated. Our implementation and results obtained emphasize that the proposed mechanism can prove to be a viable solution for the movement of emergency vehicles in urban traffic.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;mobile agent;wildlife corridor	Manoj Bode;Shashi Shekhar Jha;Shivashankar B.

WMNs are increasingly being used in urban, metropolitan and municipal area networks for deployment of medical, transport, surveillance systems, etc. The performance and operability of WMNs largely depends on placement of mesh routers nodes in the geographical area to achieve network connectivity and stability. The objective is to find an optimal and robust topology of the mesh router network to support intelligent telecommunication services to clients such as adaptive and flexible wireless Internet access, mobile data, voice, video in addition to supporting other preferred client services. In this work, we propose and evaluate local search methods for intelligent placement of mesh routers in WMNs with a two fold objective: maximizing the size of the giant component in the network and user coverage. Given a grid area where to distribute a given number of mesh router nodes, which can have different radio coverage, and a number of fixed clients a priori distributed in the given area, local search methods explore different local movements and incrementally improve the quality of the router nodes placement in terms of network connectivity and user coverage.

In this paper the idea of exploiting sink mobility for the purpose of culling the energy hole problem in hierarchical large-scale wireless sensor networks based on bees algorithm is presented. In the proposed scheme, a mobile sink equipped with a powerful transceiver and battery, traverses the entire field, and periodically gathers data from network cluster heads. The mobile sink follows an adaptive gathering strategy resilient to both connected and disconnected networks. The proposed gathering strategy geared to eliminate multihop relays required by all cluster heads to reach the mobile sink, balancing the traffic load across all network heads, meanwhile, reducing the loss that data may incur due to buffer overflow. Furthermore, enabling the mobile sink to navigate safely within cluttered and uncluttered fields augments the proposed gathering strategy. Extensive simulations are conducted in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The achieved results show an improvement in overall system performance compared to other mobility strategies.		Elsayed M. Saad;Medhat H. Awadalla;R. R.

The nodes are continuously sense and transmit the data to the base station. Therefore, energy consumption and network coverage are important issues to improve the life time of the network. Clustering architecture is an effective architecture to reduce the energy consumption. The main aim is to increase network lifetime as well as increase the presence of live nodes so that more nodes will remain exist. In this paper we propose a new approach called EPCDRE (Enhanced passive clustering algorithm based on distance and residual energy), which evenly distributes the energy dissipation among the sensor nodes to maximize the network lifetime. This is achieved by using residual energy and distance between nodes in the selection of nodes clusterheads and election of clusterhead backup. Comparison with the existing schemes such as Passive Clustering, PCEEC and GRIDS (Geographically Repulsive Insomnious Distributed Sensors) reveals that the proposed algorithm approach significantly improves the network lifetime and it can further efficiently relay the cluster data.	algorithm;backup;cluster analysis;fault tolerance;grid computing;maximal set;network packet;node (computer science);passive optical network;personal computer;relay;self-organization;sensor;simulation	Abderrahim Maizate;Najib El Kamoun	2013	2013 ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)	10.1109/AICCSA.2013.6616416	telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	8.60095737432971	80.08217789311158	142386

This paper proposes an adaptive and distributed routing protocol that attempts to reduce the EMI introduced by a medical wireless sensor network (MWSN). The proposed algorithm, namely EMI-aware routing protocol (EMIR), assigns to each node a potential value which is dynamically calculated in such a way that network traffic tends to be deflected from nodes that are radiating high EMI and/or locating far away from gateways. Experiments in a real-life IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN implemented with the EMIR demonstrate that, compared to the shortest path routing, the proposed algorithm can significantly suppress the level of the EMI in the surrounding area where the WSN is deployed. Besides, the EMIR is scalable to the network size because it only requires one-hop neighbor information.	algorithm;emi;experiment;interference (communication);network traffic control;real life;routing;scalability;shortest path problem;software deployment;testbed	Quang-Dung Ho;Thanh-Ngon Tran;Gowdemy Rajalingham;Tho Le-Ngoc	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214267	wireless routing protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;wireless network;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer network	Mobile	5.206898234964454	81.18002115432616	142429

We compare the social graph containing friends, as defined by participants, to the contact graph, that is the temporal network created by opportunistic contacts as owners of devices move and come into communication range. Our contribution is twofold: first, we prove that most properties of nodes, links, and paths correlate among the social and contact graphs. Second, we describe how the structure of the social graph helps build forwarding paths in the contact graph, allowing two nodes to communicate over time using opportunistic contacts and intermediate nodes. Efficient paths can be built using only pairs of nodes that are socially close (i.e. connected through a few pairs of friends). Our results indicate that opportunistic forwarding complies with the requirement of social network application.	bluetooth;contact graph;mobile social network;port forwarding;social graph	Abderrahmen Mtibaa;Augustin Chaintreau;Jason LeBrun;Earl Oliver;Anna Kaisa Pietiläinen;Christophe Diot	2008		10.1145/1397735.1397751	cellular network;intelligent computer network;weighted network;network architecture;evolving networks;telecommunications;computer science;delay-tolerant networking;network simulation;distributed computing;centrality;network delay;computer network;social network;switched communication network	HCI	0.5099337679775543	78.39483742410457	142575

Cooperative transmission is an important way to make full use of the space diversity and can save the transmission power significantly, especially in the wireless broadcast transmission, where the nodes can accumulate the overheard information. In this paper, firstly a centralized cooperative broadcast algorithm, which permits multiple nodes to cooperate in transmitting the broadcast message, is proposed to save the total transmission power. Considering that the centralized algorithm requiring a global knowledge of the networks is impractical in large wireless networks, the distributed version of the centralized algorithm requiring only 1-hop neighborhood information is proposed under the assumption that limited frequency band is available. The distributed algorithm combines the physical (PHY) and medium-access-control (MAC) layer mechanisms to reach all the nodes in a cooperative way. Though the proposed distributed algorithm is inferior to the centralized algorithm in terms of total transmission power, it takes less resource to broadcast than the centralized algorithms. Simulation results show that both the centralized algorithm and distributed algorithm can get a better performance than the existing broadcast algorithms. Furthermore, the distributed algorithm can achieve the total transmission power close to the centralized algorithm.

Yet, existing clustering approaches do not take the primary task of sensor networks into account: performing relevant measurements. They usually form 'arbitrary' clusters, e.g., using connectivity information, and thus, the resulting measurements are often of only limited use to the applications. This problem can be avoided by considering application-specific semantics. For indoor applications, the notion of a room provides a natural unit of clustering since walls are constructed deliberately to ensure locality. This paper shows that it is feasible to automatically create clusters that reflect boundaries between rooms by analyzing the measurements of inexpensive, broadly available sensors. The paper first analyzes the applicability of statistical clustering methods and based on this analysis, it proposes and evaluates a lightweight approach to determine clusters in real deployments.	cluster analysis;locality of reference;requirement;sensor;software deployment;statistical machine translation	Matthias Gauger;Olga Saukh;Marcus Handte;Pedro José Marrón;Andreas Heydlauff;Kurt Rothermel	2008	2008 5th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks	10.1109/SAHCN.2008.64	embedded system;constrained clustering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	8.724025027301016	75.09947797668595	142725

Several protocols have been proposed for DTNs, being the epidemic routing (and variations of it) the most representative protocol. Nevertheless, the availability of navigation systems, thanks to which each vehicle is aware of its location within a map, introduces the possibility for a new routing approach, known as Geographic Routing. In this paper we analytically evaluate the performance of our previously presented Map-based Sensor-data Delivery Protocol (MSDP). We introduce an analytical model that takes into account the effect of constrained buffers. The results show that adopting the Map-based Sensor-data Delivery Protocol (MSDP) routing mechanism allows achieving a reasonable delivery time with an insignificant overhead compared with epidemic routing.	delay-tolerant networking;geographic routing;map;network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);sensor;trust (emotion)	Sergio Martínez Tornell;Enrique Hernández-Orallo;Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate;Juan-Carlos Cano;Pietro Manzoni	2013	"""2013 IEEE 14th International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WoWMoM.2013.6583405	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;global positioning system;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;distance-vector routing protocol;mathematical model;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	4.031784890923273	84.57422655965001	142770

Up to day, several routing protocols have been proposed to face such a hostile environment. These solutions usually provide to the sources of data flows with single valid paths towards their destinations. However, it has been proven that maintaining multiple paths can be favorable to the network, either using the paths at the same time (for load balancing) or using an alternative path, when the primary one fails. It is also a way to meet the Quality of Service requirements demanded by some particular applications. In this paper, we propose a novel routing mechanism based on Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) routing protocol, in order to enable the establishment of more than one node disjoint routes towards the same destination. Simulation results show that there is a significant gain in end-to-end delay for data packets and a reduction in the number of the transmitted routing packets.	end-to-end encryption;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);multipath propagation;network packet;non-functional requirement;quality of service;routing;simulation;testbed	Georgios Koltsidas;Fotini-Niovi Pavlidou;Koojana Kuladinithi;Andreas Timm-Giel;Carmelita Görg	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394276	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;load balancing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Arch	-1.1776732061709339	84.73107700804378	142815

Considering the multi-frequency hierarchy structure of ad hoc networks, this paper proposes a hybrid checkpointing strategy which combines the techniques of synchronous checkpointing with asynchronous checkpointing, namely the checkpoints of mobile terminals in the same cluster remain synchronous, and the checkpoints in different clusters remain asynchronous. This strategy could not only avoid cascading rollback among the processes in the same cluster, but also avoid too many message transmissions among the processes in different clusters. What is more, it can reduce the communication delay. In order to assure the consistency of the global states, this paper discusses the correctness criteria of hybrid checkpointing, which includes the criteria of checkpoint taking, rollback recovery and indelibility. Based on the designed Intra-Cluster Checkpoint Dependence Graph and Inter-Cluster Checkpoint Dependence Graph, the elimination rules for different kinds of checkpoints are discussed, and the algorithms for the same cluster checkpoints, different cluster checkpoints, and rollback recovery are also given. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed hybrid checkpointing strategy is a preferable trade-off method, which not only synthetically takes all kinds of resource constraints of Ad hoc networks into account, but also outperforms the existing schemes in terms of the dependence to cluster heads, the recovery time compared to the pure synchronous, and the pure asynchronous checkpoint advantage.	advanced configuration and power interface;algorithm;anatomy, regional;application checkpointing;cell cycle checkpoints;correctness (computer science);excretory function;graph - visual representation;head - component of device;hoc (programming language);numerous;rollback (data management);routing;rule (guideline);transaction processing system	Naixue N.

Automobile manufacturers, government organizations, and consortia of the two have been investigating using VANETs for safety applications. Though VANETs are in large part designed for safety applications, researchers do not yet know the communication requirements of VANET safety messages. As a result, protocol designers have relied on generic network success metrics, such as packet delivery ratio, to evaluate their protocols. However, a more useful metric is the ability of currently proposed VANET schemes (e.g., for authentication, power control, etc.) to allow vehicles to receive safety messages and warn their drivers sufficiently in advance of an accident so that the driver can avoid the accident. Besides the basic safety message service, researchers have proposed other VANET mechanisms and services including mix zones [2, 5] and silent periods [18, 8, 17] to enhance vehicle privacy, intelligent transportation systems [24], and commercial applications [12]. However, these applications face a similar question: will a VANET be able to support these services and still achieve the safety goals for which the VANET was designed?  Previous attempts at answering the above questions have been made using small test beds without any collisions and using vehicle kinematics and message reception probabilities. However, each of these approaches lack the realism (i.e., actual crashes) and scale that VANETs will have. In this paper, we present our results from simulating two vehicular safety applications. We simulated crash scenarios and determined the probability that vehicles could avoid the crashes. Additionally, we measured the communication requirements needed for those probabilities.	authentication;network packet;privacy;requirement;simulation;software deployment	Jason J.

We choose the monitored number of link breaks as key mobility metric and observe that the relative observable mobility varies widely for different nodes and over time for the same node. We utilize this (simple) mobility metric to allow a node using OLSR as routing protocol to dynamically adapt its behavior (changing the Hello Interval, selecting MPRs, etc.). Simulations with different mobility scenarios show that Adaptive OLSR can improve packet delivery ratio, reduce packet latency, and reduce routing overhead, especially in high mobility scenarios. As a general conclusion, we believe that designing adaptive routing protocols (protocols that change their behavior based on mobility and potentially traffic patterns) holds great promise in resourceconstrained environments.	adaptive filter;adaptive grammar;computer simulation;design review (u.s. government);global optimization;mathematical optimization;minkowski portal refinement;network packet;observable;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);waypoint	Liang Qin;Thomas Kunz	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-85209-4_4	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;adaptive routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;behavior change;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobility model;mobile computing;path vector protocol;computer security;routing information protocol;global optimization;computer network	Mobile	2.769801415052889	84.73038751259868	142908

If sensing error is unacceptably high, we can reduce the number of working channels so as to improve the channels-vs.-sensing nodes ratio, and undertake differential or split sensing in which subsets of sensing nodes target idle and active channels, respectively. The paper presents a probabilistic analysis of the sensing process, including the split sensing policy, and investigates the range of values in which such, incomplete sensing is capable of maintaining an accurate view of the status of the working channel set. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The actuators work with the sensor nodes, but can perform much richer application-specific actions. To act responsively and accurately, an efficient and reliable reporting scheme is crucial for the sensors to inform the actuators about the environmental events. Unfortunately, the low-power multi-hop communications in a WSAN are inherently unreliable; the frequent sensor failures and the excessive delays due to congestion or in-network data aggregation further aggravate the problem. In this paper, we propose a general reliability-centric framework for event reporting in WSANs. We argue that the reliability in such a real-time system depends not only on the accuracy, but also the importance and freshness of the reported data. Our design follows this argument and seamlessly integrates three key modules that process the event data, namely, an efficient and fault-tolerant event data aggregation algorithm, a delay-aware data transmission protocol, and an adaptive actuator allocation algorithm for unevenly distributed events. Our transmission protocol also adopts smart priority scheduling that differentiates the event data of non-uniform importance. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulations, and the results demonstrate that it achieves desirable reliability with minimized delay	algorithm;communications protocol;data aggregation;fault tolerance;interaction;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;network architecture;network congestion;real-time clock;real-time computing;replay attack;requirement;scheduling (computing);sensor web;simulation	Edith C.-H.

The novelty of this work stems from the integrated optimization of the redundancy at the path and the FEC packet levels to arrive at the concept of the regenerating nodes. The regenerating nodes can reduce the packet loss rate (PLR) between the source and the intermediate nodes so that, eventually, the PLR between the source and the destination is minimized. In general, the residual PLR in the system is reduced to the PLR on the connection between the last regenerating node and the destination. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed scheme in the network environments with frequently changing topologies and PLR scenarios. The scheme accommodates various constraints for delay and reliability in terms of PLR that can be tailored to the specific applications, such as real-time multimedia services in MANET.	forward error correction;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;multipath routing;network packet;public lending right;real-time transcription;simulation	Rui Ma;Jacek Ilow	2003		10.1109/LCN.2003.1243205	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;link-state routing protocol;statistics;computer network;monte carlo method	Mobile	1.0262160298692813	84.29565462298272	143213

Its effectiveness has been already investigated showing significant improvements compared to the Standard IEEE 802.11, in terms of throughput, one -way packet delay, energy consumption and support of real time traffic. In this paper enhanced versions of CF-MAC have been considered with significant novelties regarding the introduction of variable time slot dimension, different management of Power Saving (PS) mechanisms, more efficient utilization of channel bandwidth, etc. The performance of these variants have been investigated by simple analytical models, in terms of energy saving, channel utilization, average access delay, etc., highlighting their improvements over basic CF-MAC protocol. In addition, computer simulations have been exploited to study the suitability of the proposed schemes to support VoIp applications.	automation;computer simulation;hoc (programming language);mac address;mathematical optimization;network packet;racket;software deployment;throughput	Pietro Camarda;Orazio Fiume	2007	JCM	10.4304/jcm.2.7.1-8	computer simulation;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;block design;wireless sensor network;index term;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;automation;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer security;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	7.09066782338197	87.10048883167057	143260

698b300e6a9e554aecce1cd86ccb32cfc475ff27	a link state aware geographic routing protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), the communication links are inherently unstable due to vehicles’ mobility and various impairment of radio signal. Existing geographic routing protocols often choose the next hop according to the greedy forwarding, regardless of the link’s quality and transmission reliability. The successful packet delivery rate is decreased in non-ideal communication links. Consequently, the reliability of data transmission is worse and the network throughput is declined. In this paper, we propose a routing protocol called link state aware geographic routing protocol (LSGR) for VANETs. In LSGR, a routing metric called expected one-transmission advance (EOA) is contrived to improve the greedy forwarding algorithm by explicitly incorporating the link state and packet’s advance. Routing with the EOAmetric, one can improve the transmission efficiency by diminishing transmission failures. Simulation results show that LSGR can achieve a higher throughput and packet delivery rate than the geographic routing protocols that adopt the traditional greedy forwarding.

19036095eef374feb4dbe2683639db59acb706c7	unmanned aerial vehicles as store-carry-forward nodes for vehicular networks		A fully connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) establishes a strong foundation for the development of smart cities, where one of the main objectives is the improvement of the welfare of commuting passengers. The availability of a multi-hop path across a VANET system, through vehicle-to-vehicle communication, depends mainly on the vehicular density and the willingness of vehicles to cooperate with one another. This paper proposes to minimize the path availability’s dependence on vehicular density and cooperation, by utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Particularly, this paper explores, both mathematically as well as through an extensive simulation study, the advantages of exploiting UAVs as store-carry-forward nodes so as to enhance the availability of a connectivity path as well as to reduce the end-to-end packet delivery delay. The obtained results shed clear light on the benefits emanating from the coupling of UAVs with vehicles in the context of a highly promising, innovative, and hybrid vehicular networking architecture.	aerial photography;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);hybrid kernel;network packet;simulation;smart city;television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle;vehicle-to-vehicle	Wissam Fawaz;Ribal Atallah;Chadi M.

When only one of these detent pawls (26) is in the locking position, the bedding furniture can swing about this detent pawl which functions as a pivot pin. When two detent pawls (26) located behind one another in the longitudinal direction of the bedding furniture are locked, the pendulum frame (2) is blocked and is held outside its mid-position on one side. A free-swinging mid-position, four pendulum positions locked at one point and two fixing positions locked off-center are therefore available for each piece of bedding furniture.

According to recent analytical result, the lifetime of a route, which can reflect the route stability, depends on the length of the route and the lifetime of each link in the route. This paper presents a Greedy-based Backup Routing (GBR) protocol that considers both route length and link lifetime to achieve high route stability. In GBR, the primary path is constructed primarily based on a greedy forwarding mechanism, whereas the local-backup path for each link is established according to the link lifetime. Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate that GBR has excellent performance in terms of route lifetime, packet delivery ratio, and control overhead.	greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);multipath routing	Wenjing Yang;Xinyu Yang;Shusen Yang;Dongxu Yang	2011	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2010.09.004	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;source routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;dsrflow;route poisoning;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.877709263023492	83.80429526520017	143665

Because SAMCRA is an exact algorithm, its complexity also characterizes that of QoS routing in general. The complexity of SAMCRA is simulated in speciÞc classes of graphs. Since the complexity of an algorithm involves a scaling of relevant parameters, the second part of this paper analyzes how routing with multiple independent link weights affects the hopcount distribution. Both the complexity and the hopcount analysis indicate that for a special class of networks, QoS routing exhibits features similar to single-parameter routing. These results suggest that there may exist classes of graphs in which QoS routing is not NP-complete. 1 QoS Routing in Perspective. After almost Þve years since the appearance of our Aspects of QoS routing [21], a brief update seems desirable because more understanding has been gained since then although basically little on the concepts has been changed. Our starting point here is the complementarity between routing algorithm and routing protocol. We quote from [21] Network routing essentially consists of two identities, the routing algorithm and the routing protocol. The routing algorithm assumes a temporarily static or frozen view of the network topology. [...] The routing protocol, on the other hand, provides each node in the network topology with a consistent view of that topology at some moment... If this duality is acceptable, it says that capturing the dynamics of the topology and the link weights is taken care of by the routing protocol. Once the graph where each link is speciÞed by a QoS link weight vector with as components for example delay, cell/packet loss, available bandwidth, monetary cost, etc... is offered by the routing protocol to a node, a local QoS routing algorithm is applied to determine in that graph a path from A to B subject to a QoS constraint vector. If an effective QoS routing protocol exists together with a QoS routing algorithm, we argue intuitively that the load in the network will be distributed automatically by QoS routing (both protocol and algorithm) and will tend closely to an optimally load-balanced network. Thus, under these assumptions, many ∗email: {P.VanMieghem,F.A.Kuipers}@its.tudelft.nl	care-of address;complementarity theory;exact algorithm;image scaling;load balancing (computing);network packet;network topology;quality of service;routing	Piet Van Mieghem;Fernando A.

We propose semi-distributed spatial query indexing structure that disseminates a query into the network and retrieves data energy efficiently using a localized tree building algorithm. We also propose a sectioned tree index, which divides the network area into several squares and each square has a local index subtree organized within that square. Local trees are interconnected to form one big tree in the network. Local trees are also built based on any algorithm that is energy consumption aware at each sub-root node in a locally centralized way. We use an existing two dimensional indexing technique for energy efficient query dissemination. We show that our proposed scheme is energy efficient for query and data processing heuristically. Our proposed scheme, sectioned tree, is finally simulated in sparse and dense networks to show the energy saving for query and data processing in the sensor network.	algorithm;centralized computing;heuristic;semiconductor industry;sparse matrix;spatial query;tree (data structure)	Kyungseo Park;Byoungyong Lee;Ramez Elmasri	2007	21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)	10.1109/AINAW.2007.171	embedded system;query optimization;wireless sensor network;data processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;database	DB	9.029244550316909	75.38476418583268	143881

Since a crowdsourced eHealth network has intermittent connectivity to its remote healthcare provider, researchers usually use some well-studied networks to model the novel network, but data congestion analytics is still a big problem in most intermittent connecting networks. In most cases, data congestion analytics may be realized by fixing the number of forwarded copies, but sometimes, it cannot suit the changing network environments well. This problem could be solved by modifying packet forwarding conditions dynamically through detecting real-time network environment. Based on this idea, in this paper, an optimized routing algorithm named RSW (reduced variable neighborhood search-based spray and wait) is proposed. In the algorithm, nodes will exchange and store each other’s buffer status during their communication, based on which, current network environments will be evaluated and quantified as a real-time threshold. Then, spray and wait adapts the threshold for data congestion control. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm increases data packet delivery probability, and optimize the overhead ratio dramatically, which can be up to ten times lower than that of standard algorithm.	algorithm;big data;crowdsourcing;heuristic;network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);real-time clock;real-time computing;routing;scanline rendering;sensor;simulation;variable neighborhood search	Yun Shao;Kun Wang;Lei Shu;Song Deng;Der-Jiunn Deng	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2646058	computer science;data mining;world wide web;computer network	Networks	6.846333358442602	84.69605057869255	144025

In several protocols such as SLTP, this issue is considered for local time estimation of a remote node. Cluster creation is according to ID technique. This technique incurs an increase in cluster overlapping and eventually the routing algorithm will be affected and requires more hops to move from one cluster to another remote cluster. In this article, we present L-SYNC method, which creates large degree clusters for wireless sensor networks synchronization. Using large degree clustering, L-SYNC can reduce path hops. Also, L-SYNC uses linear regression method to calculate clock offset and skew in each cluster. Therefore, it is capable to compute skew and offset intervals between each node and its head cluster and, in other words, it can estimate the local time of remote nodes in future and past. To estimate the local time for remote nodes, routing algorithm is used and conversion technique is performed in each time changing hop. The fewer L-SYNC hops could increase the precision. Simulation results illustrate that monotonous clustering formation can increase the precision in synchronization.

We propose a channel feedback-based enhancement to the protocol that is significantly more scalable, showing a relatively flat, slow-changing total system throughput and energy consumption as the network size increases. A key feature of the enhancement is that the back-off windows are updated after successful transmissions instead of collisions.

We develop an anycast extension of the IEEE 802.11 MAC layer based on this idea. We implement the protocol in an experimental proof-of-concept testbed using the Berkeley motes platform and S-MAC protocol stack. We also implement it in the popular ns-2 simulator and experiment with the AOMDV multipath routing protocol and Ricean fading channels. We show that anycast performs significantly better than 802.11 in terms of packet delivery, particularly when the path length or effect of fading is large. Further we experiment with anycast in networks that use multiple channels and those that use directional antennas for transmission. In these networks, deafness and hidden terminal problems are the main source of packet loss. We implemented anycast as extension of 802.11 like protocols that were proposed for these special networks. We are able to show that anycast is capable of enhancing the performance of these protocols by simply making use of the path diversity whenever it is available.	hoc (programming language)	Shweta Jain;Samir Ranjan Das	2008	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2007.07.002	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	0.8893015020630113	86.58793933439756	144366

This paper, presents a new routing algo- rithm for MANETs, which combines the idea of ant colony optimization with Zone-based Hierarchical Link State (ZHLS) protocol. Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a class of Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms. SI is the local interac- tion of many simple agents to achieve a global goal. SI is based on social insect for solving different types of problems. ACO algorithm uses mobile agents called ants to explore network. Ants help to find paths between two nodes in the network. Our algorithm is based on ants jump from one zone to the next zones which contains of the proactive routing within a zone and reactive routing be- tween the zones. Our proposed algorithm improves the performance of the network such as delay, packet delivery ratio and overhead than traditional routing algorithms.	algorithm;ant colony;routing	Marjan Kuchaki Rafsanjani;Sanaz Asadinia;Farzaneh Pakzad	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17604-3_12	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;mathematical optimization;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;ant colony optimization algorithms;mobile ad hoc network;hierarchical routing;adaptive routing;zone routing protocol;swarm intelligence;computer science;dynamic source routing;artificial intelligence;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ant colony;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;mobile agent;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	EDA	0.5093673992031563	81.1971935578061	144412
d605cf661a21d07e450215edbc48fea88ea727d7	performance evaluation of a wireless sensor network for mobile and stationary event cases considering routing efficiency and goodput metrics		Sensor networks are a sensing, computing and communication infrastructure that are able to observe and respond to phenomena in the natural environment and in our physical and cyber infrastructure. The sensors themselves can range from small passive microsensors to larger scale, controllable weather-sensing platforms. Presently, there are many research works for sensor networks. In our previous work, we built a simulation system for simulation the sensor networks. But, we considered that the event node is stationary in the observation field. However, in many applications the event node may move. For example, in an ecology environment the animals can move randomly. In this work, we investigate how the sensor network performs in the case when the event node moves. We carried out the simulations for lattice topology and TwoRayGround radio model considering AODV and DSR protocols. For the performance evaluation, we considered two metrics: routing efficiency and goodput and we compare the simulation results for two cases: when the event node is mobile and stationary. The simulation results have shown that the routing efficiency for the case of mobile event node is better than the stationary event node using AODV protocol. Also, the goodput for the mobile event node case does not change too much compared with the stationary event case using AODV, but the goodput is not good when the number of nodes is increased.	ansi escape code;control theory;ecology;electronic filter topology;goodput;performance evaluation;randomness;routing;sensor;simulation;stationary process	Tao Yang;Leonard Barolli;Makoto Ikeda;Giuseppe De Marco;Arjan Durresi	2009	Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience		real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	6.009316264131204	79.49156762425027	144471

Unlike cellular wireless networks, an ad hoc wireless network does not have any fixed communication infrastructure. For an active connection, the end host as well as the intermediate nodes can be mobile. Therefore routes are subject to frequent disconnections. In such an environment, it is important to minimize disruptions caused by the changing topology for critical application such as voice and video. This presents a difficult challenge for routing protocols, since rapid reconstruction of routes is crucial in the presence of topology changes. By exploiting non-random behaviors for the mobility patterns that mobile users exhibit, we can predict the future state of network topology and perform route reconstruction proactively in a timely manner. Moreover, by using the predicted information on the network topology, we can eliminate transmissions of control packets otherwise needed to reconstruct the route and thus reduce overhead. In this paper, we propose various schemes to improve routing protocol performances by using mobility prediction. We then evaluate the effectiveness of using mobility prediction via simulation.	hoc (programming language);network topology;overhead (computing);performance;randomness;routing;simulation;video	William Su;Sung-Ju Lee;Mario Gerla	2001	Int.

In this paper, we propose a new dissemination protocol called Splash, that eliminates the need for contention resolution by exploiting constructive interference and channel diversity to effectively create fast and parallel pipelines over multiple paths that cover all the nodes in a network. We call this tree pipelining. In order to ensure high reliability, Splash also incorporates several techniques, including exploiting transmission density diversity, opportunistic overhearing, channel-cycling and XOR coding. Our evaluation results on two large-scale testbeds show that Splash is more than an order of magnitude faster than state-ofthe-art dissemination protocols and achieves a reduction in data dissemination time by a factor of more than 20 compared to DelugeT2.	exclusive or;experiment;interference (communication);overhead (computing);panama papers;pipeline (computing);smart;splash (conference);scalability	Manjunath Doddavenkatappa;Mun Choon Chan;Ben Leong	2013			real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	9.343390594430174	88.20980189997901	144489
d8a34126b8fc738a569cd9dba642071078739fe9	a cross-layer approach for partition detection at overlay layer for structured p2p in manets	structured p2p overlay;manet;partition detection	Due to limited radio range and mobility of nodes in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), the network partitioning and merging could occur frequently. When structured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays are running over MANETs, then network partition in the physical network can also cause network partition at the overlay layer. Existing approaches for structured P2P overlay over MANETs do not detect network partition at the overlay layer. This paper proposes a cross-layer approach to detect network partition at the overlay layer for structured P2P overlay over MANETs. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is highly effective and efficient in terms of routing overhead, success ratio and false-negative ratio.

Based an the DSDV (destination-sequenced distance-vector) routing protocol for maintaining up-to-date route information, previous works on QoS routing for ad hoc mobile wireless networks do require adding an extra bandwidth for exchanging QoS information. However the size and the update frequency of the routing table are increased tremendously with the number of mobile nodes. We propose an on-demand-based QoS routing protocol to achieve the QoS requirement. The goal of this paper is to discover an optimal route with minimum time delay for transmitting real-time data from a source node hop by hop to a destination node under some predefined constraints.	quality of service;routing	Ying-Kwei Ho;Ru-Sheng Liu	2000		10.1109/ISCC.2000.860696	vehicular ad hoc network;maintenance engineering;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;quality of service;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;time division multiple access;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.414760099478717	83.739903949532	144662

Although these characteristics reduce the cost of network manufacture and deployment, they nevertheless add new challenges in terms of network operation deviation from norm. Unfortunately, this deviation, in some cases, badly affects the network's collected data and makes it meaningless. This paper proposes a distributed monitoring algorithm that enables each node in a large scale WSN to track the operation of its neighbour nodes and report any deviation that is expected to effect network functionality. The proposed algorithm's functionality was tested on a Berkeley (Crossbow) Mica2 sensor Motes test bed with the TinyOS ‘Surge’ multihop application. The results of the conducted experiments show that the algorithm achieves a high level of detection reliability.	algorithm;experiment;high-level programming language;network performance;software deployment;testbed;tinyos	Yaqoob J.

Software Defined Network (SDN) is a new network architecture, in which there’s few research on QoS routing. This paper generates the whole network virtual topology according to the characteristics of SDN, and based on the principle of simulated annealing, proposes a nonlinear annealing algorithm, which adapts to the SDN. Firstly we simplify the network topology by Dijkstra-like algorithm, and then introduce the nonlinear energy function, and then iterate the initial solution according to the simulated temperature, until find a feasible path from the source node to the destination node which satisfies the condition. Experimental results show that this algorithm has a higher success rate, better expansibility of network size, and better transplantation for the SDN than traditional QoS routing algorithm.	dijkstra's algorithm;iteration;mathematical optimization;network architecture;network topology;nonlinear system;quality of service;routing;simulated annealing;simulation;software-defined networking;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Lijie Sheng;Zhikun Song;Jianhua Yang	2015	JNW	10.4304/jnw.10.6.376-384	policy-based routing;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;simulated annealing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Networks	-2.5691683575280204	81.63849479984907	145139

In this paper we proposes a new strategy driven approach that aims at discouraging selfish behavior among network participants. Each node is using a strategy that defines conditions under which packets are being forwarded. Such strategy is based on the notion of trust and activity of the source node of the packet. This way network participants are forced to forward packets and to reduce the amount of time spent in a sleep mode. To evaluate strategies we use a new game theory based model of an ad hoc network. A genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to find good strategies. Experimental results show that our approach makes selfish behavior unattractive.	game theory;genetic algorithm;hoc (programming language);network packet;sleep mode;software release life cycle	Marcin Seredynski;Pascal Bouvry;Mieczyslaw A.

8edc79d71d67e4a3f84bed66749d1acd7c69f5b8	dependable message delivery to mobile units		Mobile computing is emerging as a novel paradigm with its own characteristic problems, models, and algorithms. Much effort is being directed to integrate mobile units with fixed networks, providing bridges to connect wireless to wired. The result is a fixed core of wireconnected static nodes and a fluid fringe of wireless mobile units, a computing system similar to the cellular telephone network. The model we put forward uses the graph of fixed nodes as a foundation and models the mobile units themselves as persistent messages moving through this network graph. Such a model allows algorithms from traditional distributed computing to be directly implemented in the mobile environment, however, it has been shown that the unique properties of mobility, such as limited bandwidth and disconnection, make such direct translation impractical. This paper presents a fundamentally different idea. Instead of recreating the functionality of distributed algorithms in the mobile domain, we show how distributed algorithms can be adapted to solve problems unique to the mobile environment. Specifically we focus on the problem of dependably delivering a message to a moving unit. We demonstrate this technique with two new algorithms, the first based on distributed snapshots and the second on diffusing computations.	computation;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;mobile computing;mobile phone;programming paradigm;snapshot (computer storage);snapshot algorithm	George Varghese;Gruia-Catalin Roman;Amy L.

6f7d4506aa141d520742bdc1250cd72757b4c908	improving neighbor discovery by operating at the quantum scale		Duty-cycling is generally adopted in existing sensor networks to reduce power consumption and these networks depend on neighbor discovery protocols to ensure that nodes wake up and discover each other. For different neighbor discovery protocols, the discovery latency is determined by two factors: the wake-sleep pattern and slot size. To the best of our knowledge, previous works on neighbor discovery have thus far been focused on improving the wake-sleep pattern. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which we can improve discovery latency by reducing the slot size. We found that by reducing the slot size, i.e., reducing the listening time in active slots, the collisions between beacons and synchronization between nodes become more severe, which can lead to discovery failures that are not predicted by existing theoretical models. We show that we can mitigate these effects by reducing the number of beacons and introducing randomization. We propose a new continuous-listening-based neighbor discovery algorithm called Spotlight. Our evaluations with a practical sensor testbed suggest that Spotlight can achieve a 50% reduction in discovery latency over existing state-of-the-art neighbor discovery protocols without increasing power consumption in existing sensor networks.

In this paper, we propose a new overlay multicast protocol: HostCast. Besides constructing a data delivery tree, HostCast uses a simple and efficient approach to form an overlay mesh for control and maintenance. The mesh can effectively facilitate the overlay multicasting. HostCast improves the reliability of overlay multicast tree and decreases the convergence time as demonstrated by the results obtained via simulation.	end system multicast;mesh networking;overlay network;quality of service;routing;scalability;simulation;software deployment;tree (data structure)	Zhi Li;Prasant Mohapatra	2003		10.1109/ICC.2003.1204265	mesh generation;multicast;the internet;overlay network;ip multicast;inter-domain;convergence;stability;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;transport layer;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-2.840775605861651	84.75019250987047	145636

The routing problem in this case involves the construction of a set of low-cost multicast trees with bandwidth requirements, one for each member of the group, for multicasting messages to other members of the group. In this paper we first prove that to find a feasible solution to the group multicast routing problem is NP-complete. Following that we propose a new heuristic algorithm to generate a set of low-cost multicast trees with bandwidth reservation. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm performs better in terms of cost and utilization of bandwidth compared with an existing algorithm that was proposed by Jia and Wang (1997).	algorithm;multicast;routing	Chor Ping Low;Ning Wang	1999		10.1109/ICON.1999.796158	heuristic;routing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;theoretical computer science;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;computational complexity theory;multimedia broadcast multicast service;network topology;xcast;computer network;multicast address;bandwidth allocation	Networks	-3.1469179266062595	82.52141473270419	145839

Besides, when network is stable, data is transmitted after choosing shortest path without any consideration of any particular node's traffic, and then traffic is concentrated on a particular node, which raises the problem of delay of transmission and huge energy consuming. In this paper, load-balancing routing method, which considers power conversation, is suggested.

DTN uses intermittently available links to communicate opportunistically regardless of delivery delay. In the literature, much work has been done mainly to improve the rate of message delivery and routing algorithms. However, previous work has not focused on guaranteeing the message delivery delay in a DTN scenario. In addition, real deployments of DTN systems have so far been mostly proof-of-concepts in research projects. We address the problem of delivery delay in a wired DTN scenario where messages are moved across a time-varying graph topology whose dynamics are known in advance and can be modified. We propose a framework that guarantees bounded delivery delay of users' data. To demonstrate the feasibility of our network management approach, we evaluate our framework on a 10-node wired DTN topology deployed on the Grid5000 platform1.	algorithm;delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;experiment;fault tolerance;network partition;network topology;routing;software deployment;software developer;topological graph theory	Ghislain Landry Tsafack Chetsa;Laurent Lefèvre;Jean-Patrick Gelas	2011	2011 The 14th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)		real-time computing;the internet;network switch;computer science;graph theory;distributed computing;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	-1.5154642941334375	82.5395446512154	146152

Forest fire, landslide or intrusion detection are some examples. In order to perform anomaly detection, wireless sensors are deployed in the area of interest and the nodes monitor a physical parameter. If this parameter exceeds a predefined threshold, the node generates an alarm and sends it in direction of the collection point (the sink). In some cases, the anomaly can span over several nodes, so each of the nodes produces one alarm, resulting in several alarms sent for the same event. These alarms are produced and sent in a very short amount of time, this phenomenon is called alarm storm and causes network congestion, collisions and increases the energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a mechanism which allows to reduce the number of redundant alarms. The proposed mechanism consists in a competition among nodes sensing the anomaly, which aims at determining the node which is the better located to actually send the alarm. The proposed mechanism is evaluated by extensive simulations, the results show that the scheme is able to reduce drastically the number of redundant alarms while not interfering on the MAC and routing processes which guarantee timeliness and reliability to anomaly detection applications.	anomaly detection;communications protocol;end-to-end principle;intrusion detection system;network congestion;routing;sensor;simulation;software deployment;testbed	Alexandre Mouradian;Xuan Linh Nguyen;Isabelle Augé-Blum	2014	2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136365	communications protocol;synchronization;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;storm;computer security;computer network	Mobile	8.743406180417024	76.81594614675767	146155

We hereby propose a MAC protocol which achieves a greater success rate (Success rate is defined as the percentage of delivered packets at the source reaching the destination successfully) by reducing the number of collisions, but by trading off the average propagation delay of transmission. Our proposed protocols are also shown to be more energy efficient in terms of energy dissipation per message delivery, compared to the currently existing protocol.	broadcast delay;hazard (computer architecture);propagation delay;protocol stack;software propagation	Abhishek Samanta;Dripto Bakshi;Amitava Mukherjee;Mita Nasipuri	2009	2009 First International Conference on Networks & Communications	10.1109/NetCoM.2009.28	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	8.337567195813456	84.42012792555253	146321

These probes are routed through overlay paths, which usually overlap at the overlay level. In addition, two seemingly disjoint overlay paths may share many physical links at the IP level, causing high link stress. Several monitoring algorithms have been proposed to reduce the overall probing overhead. Surprisingly, they do not address the associated problem of high link stress. The high link stress presents an additional load on the network links, which could cause congestion, delay, and measurement conflict. In this paper, we aim at reducing the link stress associated with probing algorithms by introducing the concept of Internal Probing, where readily available IP-level topology information is used in conjunction with the overlay topology to reduce the link stress on highly shared path segments. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the link stress by up to 30%. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The networks considered are symmetric and fully connected, the offered calls form Poisson streams and routes have at most two links. In ALBA(K), the states of each link are lumped intoK (K ≥ 2) aggregates and the route of each call is determined by local information on the aggregate-states of the links of the alternate routes. The last aggregate is always the set of states reserved for direct traffic and defined by the trunk reservation parameter. The particular case of ALBA in which there is no aggregation is Least-Busy-Alternative (LBA); ALBA(2) represents the other extreme of aggregation. We consider two separate asymptotic scalings based on Fixed Point Models for ALBA(K) which were obtained and investigated in an earlier paper. In the first, it is assumed that the number of network nodes, the offered traffic and trunk group size are all large; their ratios have been chosen to reflect practical interest. The results show that there exists a threshold which delineates fundamentally different behavior: for offered traffic below the threshold, the network loss probability decreases exponentially with increasing network size, while above the threshold the decrease is only polynomial. In the related second asymptotic scaling, the asymptotically optimum trunk reservation parameter is obtained as the solution of a simple equation. Such asymptotically optimal designs are compared to the outputs of exhaustive numerical searches for some realistically sized networks and found to perform very well.	optimal design;routing	Debasis Mitra;Richard J.

The simulations are conducted in urban environment in two scenarios, where roadside Access Points (AP) are present and not present. We consider 802.11p standard and send multiple video streaming flows over UDP. We use throughput, delay and jitter as evaluation metrics. Based on simulation results, we noticed that transmission for streaming is improved when roadside AP are used.	hoc (programming language);optimized link state routing protocol;simulation;streaming media;throughput	Makoto Ikeda;Taiki Honda;Evjola Spaho;Masahiro Hiyama;Leonard Barolli	2013	2013 Eighth International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2013.57	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;routing protocol;computer security;transport layer;computer network	Robotics	2.0109535363977176	87.60563173552329	146642

It also plays an important role in energy conservation in MAC layer protocols. This paper describes four methods to achieve global synchronization in a sensor network: a node-based approach, a hierarchical cluster-based method, a diffusion-based method, and a fault-tolerant diffusion-based method. The diffusion-based protocol is fully localized. We present two implementations of the diffusion-based protocol for synchronous and asynchronous systems and prove its convergence. Finally, we show that, by imposing some constraints on the sensor network, global clock synchronization can be achieved in the presence of malicious nodes that exhibit Byzantine failures.	algorithm;asynchronous system;byzantine fault tolerance;clock synchronization;data aggregation;sensor node;simulation;synchronization (computer science);tcp global synchronization	Qun Li;Daniela Rus	2004	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354528	clock synchronization;embedded system;synchronization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	7.757130002317195	76.20416217768995	146687

In conventional sensor networks with mobile access points (SENMA), the mobile access (MA) points traverse the network to collect information directly from individual sensors. While simplifying the routing process, a major limitation with SENMA is that data transmission is limited by the physical speed of the MAs and their trajectory length, resulting in low throughput and large delay. In an effort to resolve this problem, we introduce the MC-WSN architecture, for which a major feature is that: through active network deployment and topology design, the number of hops from any sensor to the MA can be limited to a pre-specified number. In this paper, we first present the MC-WSN architecture development and topology design, then provide the throughput analysis. Our analysis is demonstrated through numerical results. It is shown that MC-WSN achieves much higher throughput over SENMA.	active networking;numerical analysis;routing;sensor;software deployment;traverse;throughput;wireless access point	Mai Abdelhakim;Zhaoxi Fang;Jian Ren;Tongtong Li	2015	2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)	10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230443	radio access network;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;engineering;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile station;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	4.523474296683291	79.35204484555757	146861

In addition, the finite batteries in sensor nodes demand energy-aware network control. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient topology management model that allows clustered nodes to act upon imminent targets in a purely distributed and autonomous fashion, which is inspired by the biological inter-cell lateral induction models. In particular, nodes in the target vicinity collaborate to form clusters based on their relative observation quality values.

In CC scheme, the network topology is partitioned into non-overlapping clusters based on the physical network proximity. For a local cache miss, each client looks for data item in the cluster. If no client inside the cluster has cached the requested item, the request is forwarded to the next client on the routing path towards server. A cache replacement policy, called Least Utility Value with Migration (LUV-Mi) is developed. The LUV-Mi policy is suitable for cooperation in clustered ad hoc environment because it considers the performance of an entire cluster along with the performance of local client. Simulation experiments show that CC caching mechanism achieves significant improvements in cache hit ratio and average query latency in comparison with other caching strategies.	cache (computing)	Narottam Chand;Ramesh Chandra Joshi;Manoj Misra	2007	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-006-9238-z	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;cache;computer science;cache invalidation;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;smart cache;cache algorithms;computer network	Mobile	3.0859973404749113	80.9757227412967	146923

Urban planners are looking for solutions to reduce traffic congestion. Real time traffic information obtained from vehicles can help reduce congestion exploiting the wireless communications architecture recently established for safety and traffic control purposes. In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G), in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current traffic conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a flow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle traffic over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT, we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efficacy in controlling the traffic as the number of vehicles increases.	algorithm;global positioning system;glossary of computer graphics;load balancing (computing);mathematical model;network congestion;numerical analysis;routing;server (computing);shortest path problem;simulation;throughput	Wooseong Kim;Mario Gerla	2011	2011 Fifth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/IMIS.2011.36	vehicular ad hoc network;transport;routing;navigation;simulation;index term;floating car data;global positioning system;computer science;load balancing;traffic congestion reconstruction with kerner's three-phase theory;operating system;vehicle routing problem;wireless;server;computer network	Mobile	2.1261604190417165	88.20343216556233	146946

Position-known anchor nodes form a static upper-layer network organization and several mobile nodes constitute the lower-layer network which need dynamic message exchange with the upper network. In the upper static network, near-optimal routing table is allocated to each anchor node based on their known-position and the strength of signal for communication during network initialization. Mobile nodes in the lower-layer can access to the upper network dynamically and at the same time report the RSSI value of nearby anchors to the control-center. At the center, the computer will calculate the real-time location of the target based on the reported RSSI and node-IDs. Algorithm presented in this paper is low cast, easy to implement and can be used for fast location estimation and motion tracking indoors and outdoors.	algorithm;communications protocol;mobile robot;multitier architecture;network governance;real-time clock;robotic mapping;routing table;sensor web;shortest path problem;software deployment	Nan Zhou;Xiaoguang Zhao;Min Tan	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MASS.2013.101	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;routing domain;embedded system;algorithm design;routing;static routing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;organization;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile wireless sensor network;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	4.831328177461714	79.14329265872003	146972

Source or Intermediate node transmits a rebroadcast packet to any or all other nodes whenever it receives, which could generate duplicate transmissions and it ends up in a significant downside `Broadcast Storm problem'. The researchers have been proposed 2-Hop Neighbour based protocol like DP, TDP, PDP and APDP to reduce broadcast storm in MANETs by choosing the minimum number of forwarding nodes using self pruning and dominant pruning. Nowadays, the researchers have been adapting Network coding idea (COPE) to neighbour topology based protocols which overcome the number of transmission by victimisation the using arithmetic operation i.e. XOR of packets. In this paper, we have made an effort to introduce Ant colony optimization to the COPE protocol with Pruning Algorithm. In this approach, we are using pheromone value to decide the packet combination. The pheromone value is evaluated based on the intersection of the sender packet list and Pruning algorithm forward node packet list. We have made an attempt to seek out the network coding gain in the high and low load situations and also in delay tolerant applications. We've shown simulation details in result section.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;broadcast radiation;coding gain;exclusive or;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;network packet;programmed data processor;simulation;thermal design power	Geet Kalani;Srinivas Kanakala;A.

In satellite networks operating above 10 GHz, attenuation due to rain constitutes the dominant fading mechanism deteriorating the quality of service. In this paper, a novel scheme for providing large-scale reliable multicast services through a star-based geostationary satellite topology is presented incorporating accurate channel modeling of the propagation phenomena. The new protocol is based on the selection of an area representative that provides quick FBMs aiming at suppressing FBMs originating from the rest of the network users. The scheme provides a timely reaction to changes of either the channel conditions or the network topology by properly updating the selection of representatives. Through appropriate simulations, comparisons and examples it is demonstrated that the new approach suppresses FBMs very effectively.

However, to allot the naming space in a large-scale distributed wireless sensor network is not an easy task. ZigBee is a popular communication standard for wireless sensor networks. It suggests a distributed address assignment mechanism. A parent device can calculate network addresses for its child devices without communicating with other devices. However, the parameter configuration of this mechanism strictly restricts the number of children of a device and the depth of the network. ZigBee does not recommend suitable parameters. The improper parameter configuration usually makes many devices isolated from the network which become orphan devices. In this paper, we propose two automatic parameter selection schemes for ZigBee address assignment scheme by probing the network and then selecting parameters in advance to alleviate the orphan problem. They can automatically suggest proper parameters for different network topologies and thus help the original ZigBee address assignment mechanism to effectively reduce orphans.	address space;network address;network topology;simulation	Shu-Chiung Hu;Cheng-Kuan Lin;Yu-Chee Tseng	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666483	neurfon;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	5.489997538309713	78.60966726644116	147227

The purpose of this paper is to present a time synchronization algorithm which is suitable to UWSN. Although several time synchronization protocols have been developed, most of them tend to break down when implemented on mobile underwater sensor networks. In this paper, we analyze the effect of node mobility, and propose a Mobile Counteracted Time Synchronization approach, called “Mc-Sync”, which is a novel time synchronization scheme for mobile underwater acoustic sensor networks. It makes use of two mobile reference nodes to counteract the effect of node mobility. We also analyze and design the optimized trajectories of the two mobile reference nodes in underwater environment. We show through analysis and simulation that Mc-Sync provides much better performance than existing schemes.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;simulation	Ying Guo;Yutao Liu	2013	JNW	10.4304/jnw.8.1.116-123	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications	Mobile	9.113893997307361	81.50369014348861	147403

Although problems with utilizing directional antennas have been visited in the past, the research has been confined mostly to medium access control. To determine whether directional antennas are beneficial to ad hoc networks, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of directional antennas on the performance of routing protocols as well. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) using directional antennas. We identify several issues that emerge from executing DSR (originally designed for omnidirectional antennas) over directional antennas. Using insights gained from simulations, we propose routing strategies that adapt the routing protocol to directional communication. Our analysis shows that by using directional antennas, ad hoc networks may achieve better performance. However, scenarios exist in which using omnidirectional antennas may be more appropriate.	ansi escape code;access control;fractal antenna;hoc (programming language);many antennas;performance evaluation;simulation;source routing;sparse matrix;vii	Romit Roy Choudhury;Nitin H.

To reduce the energy overhead, a configurable error control coding adapts the number of redundant wires to the varying noise conditions, achieving different error detection capability. Infrequently used redundant wires are used as spare wires to replace broken links. Furthermore, a packet rebuilding/restoring algorithm that cooperates with a shortened error control coding method is proposed to support a low-latency splitting transmission. With this co-management method, we manage transient errors and a small number of permanent errors, without using extra spare wires, to reduce the need for adaptive routing. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves up to 71% packet latency reduction and 20% throughput improvement, compared to previous methods. Case studies show that our method reduces the energy per packet by up to 68% and 48% for low and high permanent error conditions, respectively.	algorithm;error detection and correction;interference (communication);link rot;network on a chip;network packet;overhead (computing);packet switching;routing;simulation;throughput	Qiaoyan Yu;Paul Ampadu	2010	2010 Fourth ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip	10.1109/NOCS.2010.24	embedded system;real-time computing;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;network on a chip;computer network	Arch	7.291550733506709	86.38356902132892	147534

Aggregates are computed from local management variables using functions such as SUM, MAX, or AVERAGE. For this type of aggregation, crash failures offer a particular challenge due to the problem of mass loss, namely, how to correctly account for contributions from nodes that have failed. In this paper we give a partial solution. We present G-GAP, a gossip protocol for continuous monitoring of aggregates, which is robust against failures that are discontiguous in the sense that neighboring nodes do not fail within a short period of each other. We give formal proofs of correctness and convergence, and we evaluate the protocol through simulation using real traces. The simulation results suggest that the design goals for this protocol have been met. For instance, the tradeoff between estimation accuracy and protocol overhead can be controlled, and a high estimation accuracy (below some 5% error in our measurements) is achieved by the protocol, even for large networks and frequent node failures. Further, we perform a comparative assessment of GGAP against a tree-based aggregation protocol using simulation. Surprisingly, we find that the tree-based aggregation protocol consistently outperforms the gossip protocol for comparative overhead, both in terms of accuracy and robustness.	correctness (computer science);gossip protocol;max;node (computer science);overhead (computing);simulation;tracing (software)	Fetahi Zebenigus Wuhib;Mads Dam;Rolf Stadler;Alexander Clemm	2007	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/INM.2007.374787	communications protocol;gossip protocol;real-time computing;summation;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-2.0894860072855304	79.56997307425964	147895

By creating a vehicular network, each vehicle can exchange information to inform drivers in other vehicles about the current status of the traffic flow or a dangerous situation. Multi-hop communications is an effective method that can be used for information exchange over distances greater than the transmission range of the transmitting vehicle. However, it is a great challenge to ensure a stable multi-hop communication link with a low delivery delay due to the high mobility of the vehicles involved. The goal of this paper is to design a TDMA aware Routing Protocol for Multi-hop wireless vehicular ad hoc networks (TRPM) in order to provide the ability to transmit#x002F;receive packets over long distances. The proposed routing scheme is based on a medium access control protocol, in which the intermediate vehicles are selected based on the TDMA scheduling. The simulation results reveal that our routing protocol significantly outperforms other protocols in terms of average end-to-end delay, average number of relay vehicles and the average delivery ratio.	access control;effective method;end-to-end encryption;hoc (programming language);hop;information exchange;relay;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;transmitter	Mohamed Hadded;Paul Mühlethaler;Anis Laouiti;Leïla Azouz Saïdane	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925601	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;vehicular communication systems;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	5.161931815177153	87.33750228622127	147971

4f98c2b81f7865b64bf370d93168dc8c6e80e77c	a method of determining maximum transmission rate in wireless sensor network		The lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) decreases with the increasing payload, such that extending the network lifetime has become a hot topic. This paper proposes a distance-based transmission rate sexlection algorithm, maximum emission rate (MER) determination, to select the pairwise maximum effective transmission rate in a given WSN environment. The proposed work is founded on two observations, one is the logarithmic relationship of internode communication distance to data transmission rate, the other is the linear relationship of receiving current to data transmission rate. The proposed work helps to reduce data transmission duration, and finally to increase the network lifetime. Simulation results show that the application of MER in existing network protocols extends 300% plus network lifetime while ensuring communication success rate.

8ed9dfd23f64b1cdf00d5f25abfbdfb203c0a151	evaluation of a robust fault-tolerant mechanism for resilient iot infrastructures		Gateways in IoT infrastructures generally represent a single point of failure, thus resulting in a total loss of network operability. This paper presents the design, implementation and experimentation of a fault-tolerant protocol for a critical infrastructure applied to the field of road safety. The proposed mechanism establishes a node hierarchy to prevent loss of communication against AP failures in WLANs based on the IEEE 802.11n standard. This mechanism automates the management of the node roles by means of an election and promotion process between stations in search of designated and backup APs. The convergence times of the protocol obtained suitable values of 3.34 s for the formation of a BSS from zero, as well as 15.20 s and 18.84 s for the failover conditions of the backup and designated APs with a minimum traffic load of 42.76% over the WSN traffic.
